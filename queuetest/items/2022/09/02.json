        "description": "New York Times: “With an opposition party that has largely embraced the lie that the last election was stolen and remains in thrall to a twice-impeached and defeated former president who encouraged a mob that attacked the Capitol to stop the transfer of power, Mr. Biden’s appeals to national unity have found little traction. Some Republicans have argued that his efforts to build consensus were fainthearted at best, while some Democrats complain they were excessive.”\n\n\n\n“Either way, they have made little difference in the national conversation. And so with the midterm congressional campaign getting underway in earnest, Mr. Biden has dispensed with the unity message, at least for now, reaching into the 2020 file cabinet and bringing out the call to win ‘a battle for the soul of this nation’ that was the cornerstone of his successful election.”\n\n\n\n“The immediate strategy is self-evident. Rather than a referendum on his own presidency, which has been hurt by high inflation and low public morale, Mr. Biden wants to make the election a choice between ‘normal’ and an ‘extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,’ as he put it on Thursday.”",

        "description": "New York Times: “Sure, Mr. Biden rattled off the accomplishments of his first year and a half in office — infrastructure, gun safety, prescription drug price controls and ‘the most important climate initiative ever.’ But in his address to the nation, Mr. Biden tacitly acknowledged that his predecessor still looms over the politics of the moment, like it or not. And he took it to Mr. Trump directly, calling him out by name and seeking to differentiate between ‘the MAGA Republicans’ loyal to Mr. Trump and what he deemed reasonable Republicans who still stand by the American democratic experiment.”\n\n\n\n“Midterm elections are usually a referendum on the party of the president in power, especially when that party also controls Congress. But Mr. Biden and the Democrats are betting that if they can make this November a choice between Democratic and Republican control, they can win, or at least keep their losses to a minimum. Mr. Biden’s speech was all about making the choice this Election Day between what he called ‘the light of truth’ and ‘the shadow of lies.’”",

        "description": "The Rockies have been feeble on the road all season. Thursday night, Spencer Strider made them look helpless.\nAtlanta&#8217;s sensational rookie right-hander struck out 16 to set a new Atlanta Braves franchise record and allowed just two hits over his eight innings.\nThe Braves won, 3-0, to take the three-game series.\n&#8220;You&#8217;re asking me what it is about him? It&#8217;s about the stuff,&#8221; manager Bud Black told reporters in Atlanta. &#8220;It&#8217;s a powerful fastball, with velocity. It&#8217;s a breaking pitch that has good action to it and I thought it got better as the game went on.&#8221;\nThe Rockies were shut out for the third time in their last eight road games and blanked for the 10th time this season, tied with Washington and Milwaukee for the most in the National League. Colorado is now 20-44 away from Coors Field and owns the worst road record in the majors.\nColorado&#8217;s C.J. Cron spoiled Strider&#8217;s no-hit bid with a leadoff single in the fifth. Rookie right-fielder Michael Toglia hit a one-out double in the eighth.\nStrider, 23, has made just 17 starts in the majors, and in those starts, he&#8217;s allowed no more than one run 12 times. A leading National League Rookie of the Year candidate, Strider owns a 2.67 ERA.\nHall of Famer John Smoltz previously held the Braves&#8217; Atlanta-era strikeout record, fanning 15 on two occasions: May 24, 1992, at Montreal and April 10, 2005, versus the New York Mets.\nHall of Famer Warren Spahn holds the all-time Braves record with 18 strikeouts on June 14, 1952, versus the Chicago Cubs. The last major leaguer to strike out 16 hitters in a single game was former Rockies right-hander John Gray, who fanned 16 Padres in a complete-game shutout on Sept. 17, 2016, at Coors Field. Gray is also the last rookie pitcher to strike out 16 in a start.\nStrider&#8217;s performance conjured up memories of Clayton Kershaw&#8217;s near-perfect game against the Rockies on June 18, 2014, at Dodger Stadium. The lefty struck out 15 Rockies and only missed a perfect game when shortstop Hanley Ramirez threw away Corey Dickerson’s chopper to start the seventh inning.\nWhile Colorado&#8217;s offense has been AWOL during most of the current 10-game road trip, their pitching has been mostly solid.\nThursday night, right-hander Chad Kuhl would have had to have been perfect to keep the Rockies in the game. He was pretty good, but far from perfect.\nKuhl pitched 4 2/3 innings, gave up five hits, walked only one, and struck out seven. After 22 starts, he has a 5.19 ERA.\nFor three innings, Kuhl was white hot, allowing no runs on one hit and striking out five. He wobbled in the fourth when Austin Riley devoured Kuhl&#8217;s meatball changeup, sending it over the left-field wall for a solo homer, his 33rd longball of the season.\n&#8220;I thought Chad&#8217;s breaking stuff was sharp and I thought that was the key through the first four innings,&#8221; Black told reporters. &#8220;His slider was sharp, he was throwing it for strikes.\n&#8220;He hung in there. Not overly efficient, but he hung in there against a pretty good guy on the other side.&#8221;\nBut Kuhl&#8217;s fifth inning was messy. Michael Harris II led off with a homer to right and Vaughn Grissom singled up the middle. Kuhl got two flyball outs but walked Ronald Acuna Jr. and gave up an RBI single to Dansby Swanson.\nWhat had been a 1-0 Braves lead was now 3-0, and with Strider on the mound, the Rockies were in need of a Mount Everest-sized comeback.\nThe Rockies begin a three-game road series at Cincinnati on Friday night.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRookie Michael Toglia homers, but Rockies lose to Braves\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Rockies Mailbag: What are Todd Helton&#8217;s Hall of Fame chances in 2023?\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies beat Atlanta in first base prospect Michael Toglia&#8217;s MLB debut\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; power outage in the outfield remains a big problem\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGerman Marquez outduels Max Scherzer as Rockies beat Mets, 1-0\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\nSeptember call-ups. Infielder Alan Trejo and relief pitcher Chad Smith were called up from Triple-A Albuquerque Thursday as the Rockies&#8217; expanded their roster to 28 players.\nTrejo received his fourth recall from Triple-A and Smith got his sixth call-up. Trejo, 26, has appeared in 11 major-league games this season, batting .231 with a homer. Smith, 27, made his first four major league outings this season, posting an 11.81 ERA.\nInjury updates. Outfielder Yonathan Daza (dislocated shoulder) began his rehab assignment with Triple-A Albuquerque on Thursday night.\nLefty reliever Lucas Gilbreath remains on the 15-day injured list with a left elbow flexor strain and has undergone an MRI. Black told MLB.com that there will be a meeting with the team doctors and training staff when the team returns to Denver from its current road trip.\n\nOn Deck\nRockies LHP Kyle Freeland (7-9, 4.88 ERA) at Reds RHP Luis Cessa (3-2, 5.36)\n4:40 p.m. Friday, Great American Ballpark\nTV: ATTRM\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM\nFreeland is coming off a solid, albeit fruitless start against the Mets in New York. The Rockies were blanked 3-0 but Freeland allowed just two earned runs over five innings. The Mets tagged him for four hits &#8212; including a homer. In his last four road starts, the lefty is 2-1 with a 2.66 ERA, 20 strikeouts, and seven walks. Freeland dominated the Reds at Coors Field on May 1, holding the Reds to one run on four hits over seven innings in Colorado&#8217;s 10-1 victory. Overall, he&#8217;s 3-2 with a 7.16 ERA in six career starts against Cincinnati. He&#8217;s 2-1 with an 8.27 ERA in three starts at Great American Ballpark.\nCessa will make his 40th appearance of the season but just his fourth start. In his start last Saturday at Washington, he pitched four innings, his longest appearance since he tossed four innings of relief for the Yankees on June 30, 2019, at Boston. He has a 7.71 ERA in three starts this season and a 4.91 ERA in 36 relief stints. He&#8217;s faced the Rockies just twice, pitching two innings of relief earlier this season at Coors Field, giving up one run on two hits over two innings.\nTrending: Since allowing seven earned runs over 7 2/3 innings during a 16-5 loss to Texas at Coors Field on Aug. 24, Colorado&#8217;s bullpen had posted a 1.47 ERA with four scoreless games. (Entering Thursday night&#8217;s game).\nAt issue: Through their last eight road games &#8212; entering Thursday &#8212; the Rockies had been limited to 14 runs, with six of them coming in last Friday&#8217;s 7-6 loss to the Mets. During those eight games, the Rockies have hit .215 with just two home runs, 71 strikeouts, and 12 walks.\nPitching probables:\nSaturday: Rockies RHP German Marquez (7-10, 4.97) at Reds LHP Nick Lodolo (3-5, 4.30), 4:40 p.m., ATTRM\nSunday: Rockies RHP Jose Urena (3-5, 5.8) at Reds RHP Chase Anderson (0-1, 33.75), 11:40 a.m., ATTRM",

        "description": "Unlike in this picture, tonight Yoelqui Céspedes went deep (and saved the game with an assist at the plate) | Photo by Chris Bernacchi/Diamond Images via Getty Images\n    \n\n  It was Dong City for the Knights and Barons, leading to a 3-1 night overall for the farm   \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nBox score link\nA five-run fifth inning guided the Knights to victory over the Durham Bulls during a rare day game on Thursday, dropping the Bulls (a Rays affiliate) to 69-56 and lifting the Knights to 50-75. Kyle Kubat contributed his longest and best start of the year, allowing just one run over 6 ⅔ innings, needing only 80 pitches to do so; he is 7-3 on the year. Declan Cronin and Bennett Sousa also had scoreless outings of varying lengths, then Lane Ramsey gave up a solo shot in the ninth.\nCharlotte was down 1-0 entering the fifth, but Raudy Read changed that in a hurry, his one-out blast—his first as a Knight—tying it up. \n\n\nReading is fundamental!  It's a 402-foot blast for Raudy Read, his first with the Knights!   pic.twitter.com/mPYHI1LNNQ— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nZach Remillard was hit by a pitch and Laz Rivera drew a walk, then Mark Payton singled in Remillard and stole second. His romp around the bases eventually ended in tragedy; Lenyn Sosa reached on an error that scored Rivera (3-1 Knights) and made it to second, but Payton was out at home on the throw…\n…Which made Carlos Pérez’s next-pitch home run both bitter and sweet. \n\n\n'Los is MORE!  1st game back &amp; Carlos Pérez goes YARD!!!!! pic.twitter.com/AECvYeHBLk— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nThey added one more in the seventh, Remillard again hit by a pitch and taking revenge by crossing the plate on a Sosa single, and another in the eighth on Tyler Neslony’s second Triple-A dinger. He is now 12 for his last 27.\n\n\nTyler Neslony goes YARD!!!   pic.twitter.com/mA6OcAMUa8— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nBox score link\nIt was a true roller coaster affair in Montgomery tonight. Drew Dalquist made his second Project Birmingham start and it was one of his better ones of the season; he pitched four full innings and despite walking three, allowed just one run, which was unearned in the second inning on Colson Montgomery’s two-out error at short.\nThe Barons took that run right back in the third with the first of three home runs, this one Duke Ellis’s first Birmingham blast to lead off the inning. \n\n\nDuke Ellis goes yard for the first time with the #Barons. 1-1 tie. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/RgAzPcep24— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nBryan Ramos did the same thing to start the fifth, his second in Double-A and 21st of the season, putting the Barons up 2-1.\n\n\nBryan Ramos with a nuke ☢️. That’s his 2nd in AA, and 21st this year.  105MPH and 424’.  #Barons up 2-1. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/LQynBCBMgH— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nGarrett Davila relieved Dalquist in the bottom of the fifth and the two doubles he allowed in that inning tied it back up at two, then a hit by pitch, single, and double combined for a 3-2 Biscuits lead in the sixth.\nThe roller coaster hit a crest in the Barons’ half of the seventh. Ellis manufactured the team’s third run with a classic Duke Ellis Special; after a leadoff infield single, he stole second base, took third on a wild pitch, and scored when Oscar Colás grounded into a double play. Luis Mieses drew a walk and Yoelqui Céspedes went deep for the 16th time to put the Barons up 5-3.\n\n\nThe Biscuits didn’t get the memo that Yoelqui loves LHP that throws a fastball at his shins where he can get his arms extended. He pops an oppo   (#16).  Mieses scores and the #Barons lead 5-3. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/bk0rxGZIqc— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nDavila, meanwhile, pitched a scoreless seventh, but was again hurt by a double in the eighth, the last of four he allowed; he departed after a subsequent single, leaving two on and one out for Alejandro Mateo, who walked two—including one with the bases loaded—and gave up a run-scoring force out before retiring the side, making it a 5-5 tie.\nAnd there it stayed through a scoreless ninth and 10th, Theo Denlinger and Yoelvin Silven handling things out of the bullpen. The Biscuits were in walk-off position in the ninth and 10th, but the ninth ended with Céspedes throwing a runner out at home from center to save the game and the 10th with Colás doing the same from right, catcher Evan Skoug hanging onto both tags.\n\n\nWe’ve had this talk before. Don’t try the combo of Cespedes and Skoug. It only causes pain. #Barons going to extras tied at 5. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/v7MOQAExkz— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nPSA for those in the back: Don’t run on the Oscar Colas -&gt; Evan Skoug combo either. ⚾️     #Barons #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/8AGOF17IHz— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nIn the top of the 11th, Ellis was the ghost runner at second base, cutting out the hard part of the Duke Ellis Special. He closed it out by stealing third base and scoring, incredibly, as Colás struck out swinging, perhaps psyching the catcher into the passed ball that allowed him to safely come home.\nRamos had walked in the meantime, then he took second on the passed ball, third on a Mieses fly ball, and scored the seventh and final run of the game on (what else?) a balk. \nThe bottom of the 11th started off with a game-saving double play; Céspedes caught the first out in center and nailed the ghost runner at third. If you don’t normally watch video highlights, watch this one:\n\n\nOk, now Yoelqui is just bullying these guys. ⚾️   #Barons #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/dVm5L4wk3I— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nThis rendered the two singles afterwards harmless; Barons win 7-5. They were 0-for-14 with runners in scoring position.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nBox score link\nHunter Dollander technically could have been better in this, his second start with the Dash. Specifically, he could have given up zero hits and baserunners instead of the two he did allow; the 25-year-old lefty went six innings and all the opposing Grasshoppers could do with him was hit two singles total, one of those of the infield variety. He walked no one and struck out seven.\nThe Dash bullpen is a precarious and volatile creature, but tonight it did its job: Cooper Bradford, Wilber Perez, and Luis Amaya each pitched one scoreless inning, striking out at least two apiece, with Bradford claiming the side. In total, Dash pitching gave up four hits, no runs, one walk, and struck out 14.\nEight runs scored on 11 hits for Winston, just one of those hits for extra bases. Scoring started with two outs in the third, Caberea Weaver and Alsander Womack singling and pulling off the double steal, which was ultimately unnecessary as Colby Smelley walked to load the bases; Riley Jepson unleashed the only Dash double of the day to knock in two and permanently give the team the lead. \nJust to make sure, they put up a five-spot in the seventh. James Beard led off with a single and was swapped out for Jason Matthews in a force out; Keegan Fish singled and Weaver walked, loading the bases with one out. Womack singled for one run, making it 3-0, and Smelley singled for two, 5-0. Jepson walked to keep the bases loaded and Andy Atwood made it 7-0 with yet another single (they’re ready for Chicago).\nThey hit only one single in the eighth but did score one more run when Fish walked, took second on a wild pitch, and scored on Weaver’s ground ball single. Their record is 56-67.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nBox score link\nThe Ballers lost this one late, if they ever really had it. Manuel Veloz made his second ever A-ball start after two seasons in the DSL and half a season in the ACL and was very good, the one run he allowed over four innings unearned on catcher Victor Torres’ error. Jesus Valles was not so good; he pitched three innings and gave up a run in two of them, the fifth and sixth, one of those to tie and the other to eventually win.\nSixth-round draft pick Eric Adler walked three in the eighth, two of whom scored. Christian Edwards relieved him with one out and stranded two runners on.\nKannapolis initially led 1-0 after four batters, Brooks Baldwin hitting his first full-season double and Benyamín Bailey knocking him in with a base hit. \n\n\nBenyamin Bailey takes one to CF and Brooks Baldwin (2B) comes in to score. #Ballers up 1-0 early. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/4jisfmZZsy— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nThey retook the lead 2-1 in the fourth inning when Tim Elko went deep, also for the first (and almost assuredly not the last) time in full-season play.\n\n\nTim Elko blasts his first HR with the #Ballers. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/gWfy1sZ5OX— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nAnd that’s where the scoring ended for the Ballers. Elko had two of their seven hits.",

        "description": "BIDEN FULFILLED HIS OATH OF OFFICE\r\nA BLOCK (1:49) SPECIAL COMMENT: When political corruption and degeneration threatens the nation, it is NOT political to say so. Last night in Philadelphia, President Biden rose above politics, went beyond politics, and spoke in spite of politics (3:14) The most important part: No problem has ever been solved until someone stood up and said \"this is wrong\" as Biden did - and thank God he named names (5:50) Even knowing how the American Political Media Complex can't comprehend or digest new things, the networks and newspapers utterly mishandled the story, and bluntly CNN's Poppy Harlow, Brianna Keller, and Jeff Zeleny must've been showing their new Right Wing bosses that they can do Bothsidesism with the best of them. CNN humiliated itself last night (8:42) And the person who proved Biden's point - and the necessity of his speech - was Trump, dangling pardons for and apologies to the 1/6 Traitors (10:45) Trump also contradicted his own attorneys, matter-of-factly slipping in the claim he had declassified the documents he stole (12:20) While Clarence Thomas's continuation on the Supreme Court became even more untenable after his wife's latest disgrace (13:07) And circling back to the Biden speech: somebody else who proved him right? The heckler. What would Trump and his thugs have done to such a protestor?\r\nB BLOCK (17:02) EVERY DOG HAS ITS DAY: Ginger (18:15) POSTSCRIPTS TO THE NEWS: Another protesting Russian succumbs to the leading cause of death in that country: Windows; Greg Abbott is running on the greatness of the Texas Power Grid?; GOP now suing to stop Biden's College Loan Forgiveness plan. (20:35) IN SPORTS: So the Tom Brady Retirement/Un-retirement/Disappearance saga was about his wife? And the Yankees break in a 70-year old rookie tonight! (23:56) THE WORST PERSONS IN THE WORLD: House Minority Leader McCarthy is a political poet, invokes \"the electric cord of liberty\"; Twitter opens Pandora's box with an edit button, and Sarah Palin mystified by Ranked-Choice as they contend for the award.\r\nC BLOCK (32:01) FRIDAYS WITH JAMES THURBER: The story is 88 years old but much of it rings true right now: \"How To Relax While Broadcasting.\"See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

        "description": "Photo by Norm Hall/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Merrill Kelly went 7 innings, and Christian Walker homered to lead the Dbacks to victory. With the season winding down, the problems that have befallen the 2022 version of the Arizona Diamondbacks have become clear. One of the biggest questions that plagued the team, and will need an answer for next season is the two-sided performance of the starting rotation. Coming into tonight’s game, 10 different pitchers made starts for the team (technically 12, but let’s not count opener relievers). 3 of those guys - Zac Gallen, Merrill Kelly, and Zach Davies, have been excellent; allowing just a 3.04 ERA in their 72 combined starts. Their overall record when starting is a bit skewed with the bullpen, with a 38-40 record. \nContrast that with their counterparts, a group that includes: Bumgarner, Castellanos, Gilbert, Henry, Keuchel, Martin, and Weaver; they combined for 53 starts and a 5.64 ERA. Despite the poor performance, the team has a 23-28 record. Of course, the former group averages almost another inning more than the former so despite the worse ERA, a 3-run advantage isn’t all that surmountable.\nLuckily tonight we had one of the better ones pitching tonight, with Merrill Kelly taking the mound against Brandon Woodruff. Kelly has “fallen” back to earth a bit after his electric July, with a 3.34 ERA across 5 August starts with only a 1-0 record to show for it. Woodruff has been even better, pitching to a 2.70 ERA in the same 5 starts but a bad-luck 0-0 record to go with it. \nThe offense started things off with a bang, both figuratively and literally, as Ketel Marte doubled with 2-outs and Christian Walker continued his late-season assault, hitting his 31st to left field to stake Kelly to an early 2-0 lead.\n\n\n\n\nMerrill Kelly was phenomenal in response to the early lead. He allowed 4 hits, all singles in the first 5 innings with only one of those reaching scoring position, Jace Peterson in the 5th. He was stranded there after Garrett Mitchell struck out. After that, Kelly struck out 4 of the last 6 batters he faced with Keston Hiura ending Kelly’s night after an 8-pitch at-bat to end the 7th.\nHis night ended with 91 pitches, 7 innings, and 7 strikeouts with just the 4 hits allowed. It seemed too easy? I don’t know, for a team that came into the day with a 69-61 record, a 41% chance of making the playoffs, and had won 6 of their last 10 games; the Brewers just came out flat. Maybe it’s the daze of the day off or the start of a long road trip, but this isn’t the team I expect to see.\nThe offense added a third run in the 2nd after Thomas doubled and Perdomo singled to make the score 3-0. Flash forward to the 6th, where Carroll and Kelly singled to start the inning. Two outs followed a safety squeeze by Perdomo and pop out, bringing up Rojas where he jumped on the first pitch from Woodruff. 5-0 Dbacks.\n\n\n\n\nCaleb Smith came on in relief and was superb, striking out 4 in his two innings to secure the 8th shutout victory of the year and a nice win after their worst loss of the year last night.\n  \n        \n  \nKelly brought the pain, with a +.304 WPA with his 7 shutout innings. Christian Walker’s homer gave him second on the night, a +.169 WPA to lead the offense.\nDiamondhacks sums it all up with the Comment of the Thread, thanks all for stopping by.\n  \n        \n  \nThese two teams run it back tomorrow for the second of a 4-game series, with the first pitch at 6:40 pm. If you can’t make it to the field make sure to stop on by!",

        "description": "Matt Kartozian-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Milwaukee can’t muster any offense against Merrill Kelly Box Score\nThe Brewers fell to the Diamondbacks 5-0 in the series opener at Chase Field Friday night, with Brandon Woodruff struggling to his worst start since returning from the injured list.\nMilwaukee mustered just four hits and no walks on the night while striking out 11 times. Jace Peterson was the only Brewer to get on more than once, as he went 2-for-2 with two singles. Hunter Renfroe and Willy Adames got the only other two hits for the Crew.\nTo add to the pain, Christian Yelich exited in the fourth with neck discomfort, although the severity is unknown at this time.\nChristian Walker kicked the Diamondbacks off with the lead in the first inning with a two-run homer to left field after Ketel Marte doubled, giving Arizona a 2-0 lead.\nThe Diamondbacks added an insurance run in the bottom of the second as Alek Thomas doubled and Geraldo Perdomo singled him home for a 3-0 home.\nThe Brewers managed to spread their four hits across four separate innings, reaching with singles in the first, second, fourth and fifth but doing nothing with those baserunners.\nArizona added another two runs in the sixth on a Josh Rojas double, which scored both Carson Kelly and Perdomo.\nWoodruff lasted 5 2⁄3 innings in the game, allowing all five runs on eight hits and two walks with four strikeouts. Brent Suter and Luis Perdomo combined for 2 1⁄3 innings out of the bullpen, giving up no runs on two hits and no walks.\nKelly was strong for Arizona, giving up just the four hits while striking out seven across seven shutout innings. Caleb Smith held the shutout in two relief innings, allowing no baserunners while striking out four.\nThe Brewers will look to bounce back on Friday with Eric Lauer on the mound to face off against former Brewer Zach Davies. First pitch is at 8:40 p.m. on Bally Sports Wisconsin and the Brewers Radio Network.",

This is obvious.This mission is unique because there are no analogues in the history of the IAEA at all. Missions took place at objects that were controlled by states.

It is the night before the 1975’s first live show in two and half years, headlining Japan’s SummerSonic festival, and Healy is talking expansively – Healy always talks expansively – about the 1975’s ability to reflect their era, a skill that has propelled the band to vast sales and something approaching global stardom, and which has caused the 33-year-old to be pegged as a spokesperson for the millennial generation.He talks about the curious coincidence that saw them release their previous album, Notes on a Conditional Form, its lyrics transfixed on the notion of what Healy called “a global anxiety attack”, precisely as the world went into lockdown. He also says he “tries to think that I’m just doing my own thing, but every time I look back it always really makes sense in that time”. Continue reading...",

I’m Josh Halliday, and I’m standing in for Archie today. We’re going to focus on the catastrophic floods in Pakistan that have left the country facing what its prime minister called the “toughest moment” in its history.More than 1,100 people have been killed by the “monster monsoon” that has left at least half a million people without homes and a third of the country under water. Pakistan’s government says that in total, more than 33 million people have been affected. A new appeal for aid was launched yesterday in the UK as satellite images were published revealing that the River Indus is now effectively a “long lake” tens of kilometres wide.Crime | Two in three police force areas in England and Wales are experiencing rising gun crime, with one force facing levels six times higher than a decade ago, Guardian analysis of Home Office data has found.Downing Street | A cabinet minister and a high-ranking aide at No 10 continued to work in Boris Johnson’s government despite allegations of sexual misconduct against them, according to reports last night.United States | Joe Biden used a primetime speech to warn that American democracy is in peril from Republican forces loyal to Donald Trump. The speech indicates a newly aggressive strategy ahead of vital midterm elections.Argentina | A man has been arrested after pointing a gun inches from the face of Cristina Fernández de Kirchner, Argentina’s vice-president and former president, as she was greeting supporters in Buenos Aires. The gun – which was loaded with five bullets – appeared to jam when the assailant attempted to fire.Space | Nasa’s $10bn (£8.65bn) James Webb space telescope has revealed a blazing gas giant shrouded in dusty red clouds in unprecedented observations of a planet beyond our solar system.Elle Hunt’s look at the battle royale between renters in 2022 is terrifying – and totally relatable. Toby Moses, head of newslettersAfter the death of BBC presenter Bill Turnbull on Wednesday at 66, Anthony Hayward’s obituary paints a picture of a broadcaster who could do it all, from covering the Lockerbie disaster to hosting Songs of Praise to appearing on Strictly Come Dancing. Charlie Lindlar, production editor, newslettersHaving to come up with a top 20 Julia Roberts films is no mean feat, and Pretty Woman only placing third in Anne Billson’s list is sure to encourage some lively debate – I’m just sad there’s no room for Roberts’ seminal performance as Tink in the widely abused Hook. TobyFor the Guardian’s cathartic Why I Quit series, Megan Nolan is (ironically) funny on giving up standup comedy: “It was clear that it was veering into the territory of above averagely bad, maybe even unforgivable”. CharlieTerri White’s incisive interview with Helen Hunt is a delightful read on how the Oscar she scooped for As Good As It Gets changed the actor’s life, the truth about Jack Nicholson and the Twister sequel we’ll never get to see.

        "description": "Art, industry and regeneration are all on show on a stroll that reveals the vitality and rich culture of BradfordI’d been wanting to do a walk around Bradford months before the city was chosen as UK City of Culture 2025. I’m chuffed for West Yorkshire’s Cinderella city and hope a year in the sun allows it to show off its industrial history, architectural heritage, youthfulness and multicultural mix. The last time Bradford culture made the national news was when London’s V&amp;A nicked the National Media Museum’s photography collections.When it came to planning a walk, there was a glut of options. Haworth to the city centre was an obvious contender, but I recently did a wilder ramble near Brontë Country, and the route into town led through farmers’ fields and a golf club. A walk from Leeds would remind me of trips I’d made when living in Armley in the 1990s, but could be heavy with traffic as well as nostalgia. When I stumbled on an online database of 92 walks to and around Bradford, all of them looked good. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Once home to Clark Gable’s air squadron, the Wilding Airfield in Northamptonshire now has two cabins immersed in nature, as well as the relics of warWhen war ends, the areas affected usually fester as bombed-out piles of rubble or are demolished then remade as a new chapter of history begins. Neither was the case when the US air force 351st Bomb Group departed Polebrook Airfield at the end of the second world war, however. In fact, not much has happened on this 36-hectare site in Northamptonshire since 1945, when the requisitioned land was returned to its owner, the pioneering natural scientist Miriam Rothschild. She made a conscious decision to simply leave it … and leave it … and let nature reclaim the land, its three concrete runways and air force buildings that were home to nearly 3,000 American airmen during the war, Captain (and Hollywood superstar) Clark Gable among them.Give or take a failed forestation scheme in the 1970s, it’s barely been touched by human hand since, and the former airfield slowly evolved into the private Polebrook Airfield nature reserve. Rothschild began this rewilding scheme half a century before the term was invented and became fashionable. In the 77 years since, a variety of habitats have taken hold on the flat, formerly featureless land: woodland, dense scrubland and open grassy areas in between. Continue reading...",

Click – and there’s Goldman Sachs predicting a 22% inflation rise next year. Click again and Bloomberg reports UK energy companies will make £170bn in excess profits over the next two years. If interest rates do hit 4%, banks too will roll in unearned mortgage money, plus shedloads from money loaned to the government. Fine profits will be made from national misery.Each day dawning reveals how everything, everywhere, is at a perilous tipping point. Martin Lewis warns that lives will be lost from cold and hunger, amplified by Sir Michael Marmot’s warning yesterday of children in grave peril. Lewis is not “catastrophising”, he says: “This is a catastrophe, plain and simple unaffordable.” If only he were to be the new chancellor … carry on with your own Jack Monroe-and-Marcus Rashford dream team.Polly Toynbee is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...",

        "description": "Director John Michael McDonagh, author Lawrence Osborne and the stars of the film discuss personal salvation, simplistic critics and why ‘you can’t build a culture out of non-stop moral hysteria’Everyone loved John Michael McDonagh’s first film, The Guard, with Brendan Gleeson as a sloshed cop. They admired his second, Calvary, in which Gleeson played a priest reconciled to his own murder. His third, a black comedy with Alexander Skarsgård and Michael Peña, was mostly loathed. McDonagh anticipated these reactions, he says in a pub in south London. He had assumed people would like his first two, “and War on Everyone was meant to be divisive”.So he would be forgiven for having felt perky before the premiere last year of his fourth film. “I love watching the film!” he says. It’s an old-fashioned noir: tense, starry, good-looking. “So I was like: Everyone’s going to love it.” He puts down his pint and laughs. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Ceri Levy dips into Amy-Jane Beer&#8217;s latest book &#8216;The Flow: Rivers, Water and Wildness&#8217;, finding a call for everyone to rediscover their river, and to re-join it with love.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor years Amy-Jane Beer rose to the challenge of water. Kayaking down rivers, challenging her white-water paddling skills and honing them. The danger, the adrenaline, the thrill of combatting the elemental forces of rivers. Narrow escapes, accidents, learning what went wrong and understanding what went right. Always aware of the presence and the power of water. Friendly one minute, relentless the next, the change in a river’s attitude and flow can happen in a fraction of time. This was the wildness of water. Never tame and always demanding respect. But always rivers had let Amy and her friends leave, some days bruised, some days elated or sometimes both. Until one day that all changed…\n\n\n\nOn New Year’s Day 2012, Amy-Jane’s close friend Kate tragically lost her life while kayaking the river Rawthey with friends in the Howgill Fells, situated in the Yorkshire Dales National Park. This bereavement impacted Amy in a devastating way and the rivers that had been so engaging and time-consuming receded from her life and she moved on in other directions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe had always meant to visit the heart-breaking site, but time and life got in the way until one day some years later, when finding herself in the area of the accident, she made a spur of the moment decision to finally visit the location. This proved to be a transformative event and rivers began to draw her back into their current, rekindling her passion and curiosity for them.\n\n\n\nThe Flow is a series of contemplative explorations of waterways up and down the country, taking in place and people along the way, sometimes by chance and sometimes planned. The author shows how rivers inspire us, their importance to our well-being and how these arteries connect us with land, science, history, stories and each other. We need water for a multitude of reasons and our dependence on it has been taught and learnt since time immemorial.\n\n\n\nHydolatry, or the idea of water as sacred, is ubiquitous in world religions, featuring in rituals of immersion, libation, communion, celebration, promise, thanksgiving, healing, pilgrimage and purification as well as funerary farewells: we dip, pour, sip, raise a toast, deposit offerings, bathe, dose, follow, wash, and commit to water from the beginning of life to the end. The idea that we come from water was intuited long before it was understood in any evolutionary sense. We all emerge from a small, warm, private sea at the beginning of our lives, a sea that substitutes physiologically and phylogenetically for the water in which life on Earth originally began.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe book meanders like a river — almost aimless at times, except no river is ever aimless, and so it is with The Flow. We always end up somewhere. This is part of the magic of the book as we have no idea who or what will appear next. The journey discovers beautiful truths even though the author may not have been initially searching for them. Being a proud Welshman, one of my favourite encounters is with musician, Owen Shiers, in West Wales. On meeting him, Amy discovers Owen has spent three years seeking out folk songs from as close to his locale of the Clettwr Valley as possible. He discovered a treasure trove of lost or forgotten works, many of them centuries old, which have most likely never been heard in the modern world. As he says, “I wanted to restore them to life.” So he recorded a selection of the songs, creating the mesmerically beautiful album Dilyn Afon, under his musical guise of Cynefin. But Owen is aware that it’s not just music that is being lost, “We are experiencing an epidemic of cultural amnesia. Many holders of disappearing knowledge don’t realise what they have. For example, there’s this old farmer who’s the only one I know still growing Welsh black oats and possibly the only one still practising the old method of tying an oat stook.” It’s a reminder to keep our cultural heritage alive before we lose too much of it forever.\n\n\n\nModern living has taken its toll on our rivers, which have become less cared for than they should be. There is what some call ‘a disconnect from nature’ but as Andy Goldsworthy, the landscape artist wrote:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe often forget that WE ARE NATURE.  Nature is not something separate from us. So, when we say that we have lost our connection to nature, we’ve lost our connection to ourselves.\n\n\n\nWe are landscape, we are mountains, we are fields…we are rivers. And Amy points out this absolute truth to us with her own self-reconnection after so long apart from an environment she loved and thrived within. \n\n\n\nThe Flow is a call to action. A call for us to repair the damage caused by humans, to fight for the health of our waterways or demand the simple right to wander along a riverbank. Rivers should be a destination for everyone, but if we can’t spend time to engage with them, how do we learn how to help them? After all, over 90% of the UK is closed to the public. Is it any wonder that by being kept apart from so much of the natural world we neglect the work that needs to be done? Most people simply don’t know what’s going on. The Flow discusses these monumental injustices and supports Right to Roam who campaign for more access to more land for more people across the nation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow more than ever, we need to feel the succour the environment gives us. But we must return to a healthy symbiotic relationship with it. The Flow documents the author’s return to the rivers and sets the reader on a path that may be one of its great purposes. To rediscover your river and re-join it with love.\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n&#8216;The Flow&#8217;, published by Bloomsbury Wildlife, is out now.\n\n\n\nMore information about Right to Roam can be found here.",

        "description": "This morning, former president Trump told a Newsmax host that he was &#8220;financially supporting&#8221; some of the rioters who attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021, in an attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. Calling it &#8220;disgraceful&#8221; that they are being prosecuted, he said that If reelected, he would look &#8220;very favorably at full pardons&#8221; for them and would apologize to them.&nbsp;At a time when his supporters are increasingly calling for violence after the FBI executed a search warrant on the Trump Organization&#8217;s Mar-a-Lago property in order to recover classified documents, Trump is normalizing violence and suggesting that if he regains the presidency, he will protect those who fight on his behalf.&nbsp;Today the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol wrote to former House speaker Newt Gingrich, asking him to appear before the committee voluntarily. Historians identify Gingrich&#8217;s rhetorical attacks on Democrats and on those Republicans he considered too moderate&#8212;Republicans in Name Only, or RINOs&#8212;as key to bleeding traditional Republicans out of party leadership in the 1990s.The letter explained that the committee has learned that Gingrich was part of the effort to overturn the 2020 election. He apparently exchanged emails with Trump&#8217;s advisors, including Jason Miller and Trump&#8217;s son-in-law Jared Kushner, in which Gingrich provided &#8220;detailed input&#8221; on the scripting of television ads that deliberately pushed lies that the 2020 election was stolen. The ads encouraged people to pressure state officials to overturn the election.Gingrich wrote: &#8220;The goal is to arouse the country&#8217;s anger through new verifiable information the American people have never seen before[.]... If we inform the American people in a way they find convincing and it arouses their anger[,] they will then bring pressure on legislators and governors.&#8221;Gingrich was also apparently involved in the scheme to produce fake electors and did not let up even after the attack on the Capitol. That night, he emailed Trump&#8217;s chief of staff, Mark Meadows, to pursue the plan.&nbsp;Today, Emma Brown of the Washington Post reported that Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas&#8217;s wife, Ginni Thomas, wrote not only to 29 lawmakers in Arizona to press them to overturn President Joe Biden&#8217;s victory by appointing their own electors rather than the ones the voters had chosen, but also to lawmakers in Wisconsin.In Arizona, Jerod MacDonald-Evoy of the Arizona Mirror reported that Republican Senate candidate Blake Masters has hired two fake electors as part of his staff. Before the primary, Masters&#8217;s website read: &#8220;We need to get serious about election integrity. The 2020 election was a rotten mess&#8212;if we had had a free and fair election, President Trump would be sitting in the Oval Office today and America would be so much better off,&#8221; although he has since scrubbed it to read simply: &#8220;We need to get serious about election integrity.&#8221; Trump endorsed Masters.Today the White House Twitter account reminded people that 147 congressional Republicans voted to challenge the results of the 2020 election even after the January 6 riot, retweeting the 2021 New York Times article listing them by name.And yet there has been concern on Twitter tonight that President Joe Biden&#8217;s 24-minute prime-time speech on &#8220;The Continued Battle for the Soul of the Nation&#8221; was unfairly partisan.&nbsp;Biden spoke from Philadelphia's Independence National Historical Park, which includes Independence Hall, where lawmakers created the Declaration of Independence and the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp;There, the nation&#8217;s early leaders created a country based on equality and democracy, Biden said, and those principles made the United States &#8220;the greatest nation on Earth.&#8221; Now those principles are under assault, and &#8220;we do ourselves no favor to pretend otherwise.&#8221;&nbsp;Biden offered a passionate defense of democracy, recalling Americans to their heritage: a fight for liberty that has preserved the nation through wars, depressions, and struggles to expand civil rights. That mission still drives us, he said, toward &#8220;an America that is more prosperous, free, and just.&#8221;&nbsp;But &#8220;we must be honest with each other and with ourselves.&#8221;Things are not normal, he said. And then he called out the elephant in the room: &#8220;Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.&#8221;&nbsp;As he has done in similar comments lately, Biden isolated the extremist MAGA Republicans from the rest of the country, while including mainstream Republicans in the larger body of Americans who still believe in democracy. But he acknowledged the truth that &#8220;the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans, and that is a threat to this country.&#8221;They &#8220;do not respect the Constitution. They do not believe in the rule of law. They do not recognize the will of the people. They refuse to accept the results of a free election. And they&#8217;re working right now, as I speak, in state after state to give power to decide elections in America to partisans and cronies, empowering election deniers to undermine democracy itself.&#8221;&nbsp;They &#8220;are determined to take this country backwards&#8212;backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love. They promote authoritarian leaders, and they fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country.&#8221;We are not powerless to combat these threats, Biden said. Far more Americans reject the extremism of MAGA Republicans than embrace it. He called for all Americans&#8212;&#8221;Democrats, independents, mainstream Republicans&#8221;&#8212;to reject government by violence, and instead work together to defend democracy and build a better future, one based in the Constitution, the rule of law, free and fair elections, the will of the people, honesty, decency, respect, patriotism, liberty, justice, hope, and possibility.&nbsp;Biden listed the accomplishments of the past year and a half and echoed the line he has used since he ran for president: &#8220;There is not a single thing America cannot do&#8212;not a single thing beyond our capacity if we do it together.&#8221;&#8220;The soul of America is defined by the sacred proposition that all are created equal in the image of God. That all are entitled to be treated with decency, dignity, and respect. That all deserve justice and a shot at lives of prosperity and consequence. And that democracy&#8230;must be defended, for democracy makes all these things possible. Folks, and it&#8217;s up to us.&#8221;Our democracy is imperfect, Biden said, but &#8220;history and common sense tell us that opportunity, liberty, and justice for all are most likely to come to pass in a democracy.&#8221; &#8220;Our task,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is to make our nation free and fair, just and strong, noble and whole.&#8221;&#8220;We just need to remember who we are. We are the United States of America.&#8221;&#8212;Notes:https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2022/09/01/trump-jan-6-rioters-pardon/https://www.mediaite.com/tv/trump-claims-hes-financially-supporting-jan-6-rioters-looking-very-favorably-at-full-pardons-with-an-apology-if-reelected/https://january6th.house.gov/sites/democrats.january6th.house.gov/files/2022-9-1.BGT%20letter%20to%20Gingrich%20Final.pdfhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/2022/09/01/ginni-thomas-wisconsin-bernier-tauchen/https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/09/politics/violent-rhetoric-pro-trump-internet-fbi-search/index.htmlThe White House @WhiteHouseMAGA Republican elected officials refuse to accept the results of free and fair elections.\n\n147 Congressional Republicans voted to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election.

        "description": "(Cooking Vinyl)The Scottish singer-songwriter balances catchy pop with reflections on a young woman’s navigation through society and the music businessScottish singer-songwriter Nina Nesbitt unintentionally made it into millions of homes when her former boyfriend, Ed Sheeran, wrote a song about their relationship – Nina, on 2014’s X. But she herself has spent a decade on the verge, having narrowly missed the Top 20 with her 2013 single Stay Out and the Top 10 with her 2014 debut album Peroxide. Her third album, Älskar, takes her sharp, guitar-led songwriting further into electronic pop. Having started out writing about teenage romance, she is now 28 and singing the dreamy Teenage Chemistry, about feeling the same thrill in an adult relationship (“Like we’re still 18, hands all over me”). Maturity and lockdowns have brought introspection and songs about family – the truly lovely Dinner Table – loss and death, although she’s still capable of writing like a sassy teen on No Time (For My Life to Suck).At its best, Älskar (meaning “love”) shows us a young woman navigating through society and the music business. Pressure Makes Diamonds kicks back at female stereotypes and insists “I’ll just keep on swimming through the patriarchal system”. Older Guys is a powerful and damning reflection on early relationships that took away her innocence. Colours of You – written with Adele collaborator Dan Wilson – is a more anodyne piano/strings ballad. If Älskar can occasionally feel identikit, there’s a refreshing honesty in its compromise between raw confessionals and acknowledging the pressure to “make it through the bullshit flying at me, write something catchy and turn it into money”.

You can find our latest story hereDame Cressida Dick “felt intimidated” into stepping down as commissioner of the Metropolitan police in February this year following an ultimatum from the mayor of London, Sadiq Khan, according to a review by Sir Thomas Winsor which found due process was not followed.Winsor found Dick “felt intimidated” following an ultimatum from Khan.In this case, none of the statutory steps set out in section 48 of the Police Reform and Social Responsibility Act 2011 and summarised above were followed. The Mayor, through his Chief of Staff, gave the Commissioner an ultimatum on 10 February 2022: if the Commissioner did not attend a meeting and convince the Mayor that her plan of 4 February 2022 would be improved, he would make a statement to the media.That statement would make clear that he no longer had trust and confidence in the Commissioner, and that he intended to start the statutory process for her removal.Londoners will be able to see that this review is clearly biased and ignores the facts.On the former commissioner’s watch, trust in the police fell to record lows following a litany of terrible scandals. What happened was simple – I lost confidence in the former commissioner’s ability to make the changes needed and she then chose to stand aside. Continue reading...",

Yes, some of it was held over from national cabinet earlier this week (the extra Tafe places, for example). Some items were a long time coming and dictated by the circumstances of massive workforce shortages (permanent migration up to 195,000 and a $36m investment to speed up visa processing). One policy was even a tweak of an idea suggested by Dutton in June (the relaxation of tax rules to allow pensioners to work more).But, add to that the massive list of industrial relations reforms outlined by Tony Burke on Thursday intended to get wages moving again (and increase workers’ power) and Labor can rightly say the summit was a success.

Here&#x2019;s another possibility: prediction markets.\nPrediction markets use a wisdom of crowds approach to aggregate beliefs and predict future outcomes. They typically function through bets in futures contracts that pay out on expiration of defined &#x201C;yes or no&#x201D; outcomes.

Saxophonist Joshua Redman’s A-list quartet with pianist Brad Mehldau, bassist Christian McBride and drummer Brian Blade have solved that problem by meeting with tantalisingly rare frequency since their acclaimed 1994 debut.That year, they were all rising stars rounded up by Redman – then the charismatic new tenor-sax kid on the block – united by devotion to the classic jazz tradition, but also by a collective spirit of adventure to stretch it. The quartet’s mid-90s rapport was enthralling, but burgeoning solo careers separated them until 2020’s RoundAgain reunion showed that their individual experiences since had only sharpened their intuition as a foursome. Now 2022’s LongGone takes the story forward. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Cliff Welch/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Peraza finally, mercifully called up; Volpe jumps to Triple-A; MLB insider predicts Judge will re-sign; It’s officially time to start sweating; An update on Rizzo’s back MLB Trade Rumours | Anthony Franco: At long last, Oswald Peraza has finally been called up. With rosters expanding on September 1, Peraza’s call-up is certainly a huge splash for a team in desperate need of a vibe shift. The 22-year-old shortstop is the Yankees’ No. 3 ranked prospect (No. 53 in all of baseball per MLB Pipeline) and has been the target of speculation for a while now, as he tore up Triple-A for the last few months after a pretty rough start to the season.\nIt’s still unclear how much playing time Peraza will receive right away — Oswaldo Cabrera has played nearly everyday since being called up, but the team still might be committed to the incumbent, Isiah Kiner-Falefa, at short — but odds are a prospect of his stature wasn’t called up to sit on the bench every day. Either way, this team needed an infusion of energy and a new look in the lineup, and Peraza was clearly ready to make the leap. Here’s hoping Peraza joins the lineup and hits the ground running.\nAlso, in an logical related move, No. 1 prospect Anthony Volpe is getting a bump up as well:\n\n\nHearing that Yankees top prospect Anthony Volpe is being promoted to AAA with Oswald Peraza going to the majors.— Joel Sherman (@Joelsherman1) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nThe 21-year-old Volpe will take Peraza’s old spot at shortstop in Triple-A Scranton after a terrific year with Double-A Somerset. The fifth-ranked prospect in all of baseball got off to a shaky start, but from mid-May onward, he has dominated the Eastern League with a .282/.373/.523 triple slash, 28 doubles, 14 homers, and 30 steals in 80 games, good for a 142 wRC+.\nBleacher Report | Timothy Rapp: As if the news couldn’t get any better for Yankees fans (and we deserve some positivity around these parts, to be entirely honest), ESPN’s Jeff Passan believes that Aaron Judge will be a Yankee for a long time. On the Pat McAfee Show, Passan predicted that Judge would ultimately re-sign with the Yankees this offseason, perhaps for a contract north of $300 million. Of course, it goes without saying that this is just Passan’s opinion and anything could happen, but I’d like to think someone with Passan’s connections and stature wouldn’t just drop a prediction like this without at least a little knowledge to inform it. \nNew York Post | Dan Martin: After such a great start to the season, a lot of Yankees fans, myself included, got maybe a little too comfortable with the lead the team got out to in the AL East. In the early days of this downturn, we all thought the same thing: Relax, it’s just a blip. They have a huge lead.\nWell, it’s been a couple months, and all of a sudden that lead isn’t so large anymore, as the ever-pesky and annoying Tampa Bay Rays are just six games behind the Yankees for the division lead heading into the final month of the season. With a three-game series coming up and a total of 6 head-to-head games in the next 10 days, it’s officially time to sweat for a lot of Yankees fans. Not mentioned in this article: the Mariners are also just six games behind the Yankees, so if they do lose control of the division, it’s possible they won’t even end up hosting a playoff series. So much for the positivity, eh?\nThere was also a truly confounding Anthony Rizzo update provided by Aaron Boone during his appearance on The Michael Kay Show, just before the news of Peraza’s call-up broke.\n\n\n\"There's a chance he can get an injection and miss this Tampa series potentially, but the prognosis is really good for him\" - Boone on Rizzo's back issue— The Michael Kay Show (@TMKSESPN) September 1, 2022",

        "description": "Republican Scott Jensen darted from one supporter to another as the crowd swelled around his Minnesota State Fair booth on a recent Friday afternoon.The candidate for governor posed for selfies, shook hands and encouraged each visitor to tell their friends about his campaign. With a little more than two months left before Election Day, the annual end-of-summer gathering offered contenders a chance to meet thousands of voters each day. For Jensen — who is vying to unseat DFL Gov. Tim Walz this fall and still lags in name recognition — the interactions were critical. “The State Fair is huge,” Jensen told MPR News during a brief pause from conversations with fairgoers. ”This is how we&#x27;re going to change hearts and minds and change Minnesota. It&#x27;s the only way we can do it. You cannot run against the amount of money that Tim Walz has, without changing hearts and minds. It&#x27;s the only way we win.”Jensen spent at least a few hours each day talking to voters at his booth near the butterfly house as part of that effort. Supporters stopped by to offer a prayer or air their frustrations about the incumbent. Others wished Jensen well and promised him their votes. “Thank you, sir. I wish you luck. We need you,” a man said as he greeted Jensen.“We&#x27;re in this together. Nobody on the sidelines,” Jensen replied. “You remember what Teddy Roosevelt said? ‘(You’ve) got to get out of the spectator seats.’”Republican candidate for governor Dr. Scott Jensen greets supporters at the 2022 Minnesota State Fair.Brian Bakst | MPR NewsJustin Bye, a 27-year-old business executive from Lindstrom, said he plans to vote for Jensen in November. Bye said Jensen could better address crime in the Twin Cities and inflation around the state. And he took issue with the way the governor handled COVID-19 mitigation measures.“Shutting down our businesses took a huge impact on what our state offers, whether it&#x27;s industrial, whether it&#x27;s agricultural, we took a large hit to that,” Bye said. “So that leaves, I think, a lot of sour taste on people&#x27;s tongues.”Jensen heard similar feedback from dozens of people who stopped to chat with him each day at the fair, he said. Those interactions spurred new ideas and added a new spark to the campaign.“Well, obviously, there&#x27;s a lot of energy,” Jensen said. “And I guess that&#x27;s a little bit like dopamine. I mean, it gives you a lot of energy. It drives your adrenaline level up, but it also drives my desire to be the candidate that Minnesotans want me to be.”On the same day, Walz made the rounds at the fair between the DNR building, his campaign booth and TV stations for interviews. “I’m three Mountain Dews in today –— alright — and it&#x27;s noon,” Walz told staff and passersby as he walked toward the DNR building. “We&#x27;re just getting started.”Walz’s fair appearances tended to be more sporadic, with occasional stops at his campaign booth interspersed with ceremonies, news conferences and walks around the fairgrounds.Along the way, some supporters stopped the governor to voice their support for how he guided the state through the COVID-19 pandemic or to thank him for his work in office.Gov. Tim Walz posed for a selfie with a supporter at the 2022 Minnesota State Fair.Brian Bakst | MPR NewsAfter a TV interview, Walz thanked a man wearing an Army hat for his service. The man hugged the governor and promised him his vote.“I hope you hear this a lot: I’m going to vote for you this fall,” he said.George Bergquist said he too plans to vote for Walz in November. The retiree from Princeton said the Walz administration has listened to a variety of perspectives on the pandemic and other issues. And they’ve managed through the crises as well as can be expected, he said.“Even today between four and six people a day die in Minnesota from the coronavirus, and I think he took a very thoughtful approach to that,” Bergquist said. “It was based on science — and while it didn&#x27;t satisfy everyone — I think it tried to. They tried to find an approach that saved people&#x27;s lives.”But opposition to the governor, especially on his handling of the pandemic, was on display day after day, too. Overhead, a plane carried a banner that read “Walz failed.” And workers at a separate booth at the fair handed out anti-Walz backpacks, hats and shirts.“I think there&#x27;s a lot of people that are upset,” said Jesse Smith, 24, as he helped visitors spin a wheel pinpointing areas where voters disagreed with the administration’s policies. “So I think we&#x27;re seeing a lot of good energy going on here.”Smith ran the Action 4 Liberty booth and said he planned to spend all 12 days at the Fair building up opposition to the governor’s reelection bid.Walz has defended his efforts to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and said his steps during the pandemic, as well as in the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder, show that he can lead through difficult situations.“I think we make a pretty strong case that we had a steady hand in pretty unsteady times.” Walz told MPR News. “I do think the good part about this is this is really about character now. People are seeing how you respond to things. And you&#x27;re hearing people out here at the Fair say, ‘I might not have agreed with you but I think you&#x27;re trying to do the right thing.’ And that&#x27;s a pretty high compliment from folks.” In the shadow of the Walz-Jensen matchup are a number of third party candidates. One of them is Hugh McTavish of the Independence-Alliance Party who has a campaign booth next to the Big Fat Bacon stand.“I&#x27;m hearing from a lot of folks that they&#x27;re not happy with Walz or Jensen,” McTavish said as he promoted his plan to invite more citizen participation at the Capitol. “That they&#x27;re not real thrilled with Walz, but that Jensen is unacceptable, because his views on abortion and gun control and other issues.”",

        "description": "On a recent Saturday morning outside the little town of Wrenshall, Minn., about a half-hour south of Duluth, it was 5:40 a.m., and the chickens on the Locally Laid egg farm were starting to get restless. Most people on vacation would still be snoozing. But not Klay Jaeger and his 9-year-old son Isaac. For them, it was time to let out the chickens. “Good morning!” the elder Jaeger shouted as he opened the door to one of two big coops. &quot;Just come on out!” Isaac added. For about $50 a night, the Jaegers slept in a small outbuilding in the chicken yard. It’s two-thirds bunkhouse, one-third chicken coop, separated only by a couple panes of glass. They can actually see the chickens while they’re sleeping; and vice versa. “It&#x27;s weird having chickens stare at you. But … you get used to it,” Isaac Jaeger said. Lucie and Jason Amundsen started their “pasture-raised” egg business ten years ago. They raise 400 chickens themselves, and they contract with seven other larger farmers who produce eggs for their brand. They also grow pick-your-own berries. Jason and Lucie Amundsen opened two Airbnb rentals on their farm on Aug. 20 in Wrenshall, Minn., this summer. Guests stay on the farm and have the option to help with chores.Dan Kraker | MPR NewsThey call this new venture their “AirB-N-BAWK!” The idea came from an article Lucie Amundsen read about a local business in Scotland where guests sleep in an apartment above a bookstore at night, and volunteer at the shop by day. Along with the bunkhouse, the Amundsens also built what they call &quot;The Perch,&quot; a tiny house on stilts in a patch of woods next to the chicken yard. Both are rustic. Neither have running water; guests use an outhouse. But they’ve proven popular since they opened earlier this summer. The Amundsens estimate they&#x27;ll earn about $13,000 this year renting both out, enough to add nearly 20 percent to the farm’s annual profit. &quot;That&#x27;s real money for a farmer,” Lucie Amundsen acknowledged, adding “there is kind of a sad commentary there, that raising food with integrity isn&#x27;t quite enough anymore.&quot;The Amundsens’ quaint farm rentals are part of the rapidly growing agritourism industry. While for a long time many farmers have operated vegetable stands, or pumpkin patches, in recent years operators have become more entrepreneurial, offering everything from pizza nights to beekeeping classes. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates it’s a nearly billion dollar industry. But that’s likely a severe undercount, said Dawn Thilmany, a professor at Colorado State University who researches agritourism.“There is an appetite [for this],” she said. “People are foodies. People are big outdoorsy people. Right now, every single trend of what this next generation of tourists wants to be, we can do well on farms and ranches.”Jason Amundsen, co-owner of Locally Laid Egg Company, helps Isaac Jaeger place freshly washed eggs into cartons.Dan Kraker | MPR News‘Where food actually comes from’There are more than a dozen “farm stays” and Bed and Breakfasts listed on the Minnesota Department of Agriculture’s Minnesota Grown directory, which highlights local food producers. What’s different about the Amundsens’ farm is that guests don’t just sleep there; they also have the option to help with chores. And most do. “For the most part, people want to be involved, they want to do the work, they want to gather the eggs, they want to care for the birds, they want to be in a situation where they&#x27;re contributing,” said Jason Amundsen. For the Jaegers, they started their day letting out the chickens. Then, after going back to sleep for a bit, they were back at it at 8:30 a.m. Joined by three other guests staying at the farm that morning, they collected eggs, washed and packaged them. They also fed the chickens and filled up water containers. Klay Jaeger even scraped chicken poop out of a coop — with a smile on his face. “It&#x27;s been a lot of fun. It&#x27;s great to hang out with my son. And I&#x27;ve always wanted to take him to a farm. It’s a good experience for him to see where food actually comes from,” he said.And once Jason Amundsen trains the guests, he said they can be quite helpful. “We can go into town, we can go do things, or we can go to bed early, the way we couldn&#x27;t do that before. We were just so hamstrung to the clock.”Chickens eagerly wait to be fed at the Locally Laid egg farm.Dan Kraker | MPR NewsAs the number of Americans who work on farms has dwindled —  fewer than two percent of Americans now live on farms — the number of people seeking out ways to experience agriculture has surged. The farm tourism industry tripled between 2002 and 2017, according to the latest USDA estimates. Minnesota doesn&#x27;t track the industry&#x27;s economic impact. But farm tourism has grown along with the growth of the local foods movement, said the Minnesota Department of Agriculture’s Paul Hugunin, because people crave experiences, not just products. “You can go to a grocery store, and you can get local apples, you can get locally grown pumpkins, but you can&#x27;t get the experience of the beauty of an apple orchard that overlooks a river or overlooks the bluffs. You don&#x27;t get the experience of taking your kids out into a pumpkin patch and letting them find the pumpkin that you&#x27;re going to carve as a family.”And increasingly, tourists want to know what life is really like on the farm. “People don&#x27;t always want the entertainment version,” said Thilmany. “They want the authentic, what&#x27;s it like to be a farmer or rancher for a weekend.”Thilmany initially had a hard time understanding that concept. She grew up on a soybean, corn and pig farm in Iowa. She couldn’t wait to head to the big city and leave farm chores behind. &quot;But to anyone who didn&#x27;t get that or didn&#x27;t have a grandfather or grandmother still on the farm, they just want a touch of Americana.”Klay Jaeger mucks a chicken coop at the Locally Laid egg farm.Dan Kraker | MPR NewsReawakened enthusiasmWhile the agritourism sector is growing rapidly, still only a small number of producers actually participate. The USDA estimates that five percent of farmers have some sort of farm tourism venture, although Thilmany believes the actual number could be closer to 20 percent. Andrea Simek and her husband first welcomed guests to their pumpkin patch and corn maze on her husband’s family farm in between Duluth and the Iron Range in 2012. At the time it was still an operating dairy farm. “Who’s going to drive out to the middle of nowhere to see our farm?” she remembers her husband’s grandfather asking, incredulously.  That first summer, she said, cars were lined up down the dirt road. Grandpa Johnny would drive by in his Carhart overalls to wave at the kids. 2020 was their busiest year ever. They welcomed more than 1,000 people a day over six fall weekends. Now they also offer live music and educational field trips, and host parties. Both her and her husband have full-time jobs off the farm. “It adds a little bit of extra income for us at the end of the year,” Simek said. More importantly, it keeps their family’s farming tradition alive. For Jason and Lucie Amundsen, their vacation rentals have helped the bottom line. But it’s also reawakened their enthusiasm for farming, to see how their guests respond to their chickens. “We&#x27;ve been doing this for 10 years. It&#x27;s our anniversary. We kind of needed a little fluffing to get excited about it again.”Isaac Yaeger holds a chicken he caught that escaped through the fence at the Locally Laid egg farm in Wrenshall, Minn., on Aug. 20.Dan Kraker | MPR News",

        "description": "CERRITOS, Calif.—Abortion rights dominated the message when the Democratic congressional candidate Jay Chen sent off a small group who had gathered to canvass for him here early on Sunday morning.“A right that we had all assumed we would have, the right of a woman to have control of her own health-care decisions, was taken away after 50 years,” Chen told the volunteers. He reminded them that his opponent, Republican Representative Michelle Steel, had co-sponsored “a federal ban on abortion” that would prohibit the procedure even in deep-blue California.“You name it, she’s on the extreme end of all these issues,” Chen said. “She’d be a complete outlier even in deep-red Kansas because even in Kansas they protected the right to an abortion. So for her to try to represent [this district] does not make any sense.”Chen’s exhortation captured the outsize role abortion rights could play across this year’s unusually large field of competitive U.S. House races in California, after the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority overturned Roe v. Wade earlier this summer. The Golden State offers Democrats the nation’s single largest concentration of opportunities to offset losses elsewhere by flipping House seats now held by Republicans. And the abortion-rights issue offers Democrats their best chance to do so—particularly with a state constitutional amendment protecting access to the procedure also on the November ballot as Proposition 1.“Because we have this on the ballot, Republicans cannot run away from this issue,” says Dave Jacobson, a Democratic consultant who is advising Christy Smith, the party’s nominee against Republican Representative Mike Garcia in another Los Angeles–area district. “Every Republican in a competitive district is vulnerable with this issue at the top of the ballot as a constitutional amendment. I think it is going to drive turnout.”[Read: The Kansas abortion shocker]California will provide a crucial measure of how broadly the abortion issue may benefit Democrats this year. On both sides, there’s agreement that abortion’s increased prominence will strengthen Democrats in districts with a large number of white-collar voters—including the coastal seats south of Los Angeles now held by Democratic Representatives Katie Porter and Mike Levin. Less clear is whether the issue will prove as powerful in districts, such as those held by Republican Representatives Garcia and David Valadao, with larger numbers of blue-collar and Latino voters who may be acutely feeling the effects of inflation. The district in which Chen is challenging Steel demographically falls somewhere in between.“Presumably you’ll see coastal Republicans split with the party on things like choice,” predicts Darry Sragow, a veteran Democratic strategist and the publisher of the nonpartisan California Target Book, which analyzes state elections. “On the other hand, when you are looking at some inland and Central Valley districts, they are very different,” he told me. Although “there’s all this chatter that abortion is so important,” Sragow added, “I suggest most Americans do not wake up with abortion the thing they are most worried about,” particularly in working-class communities.Though solidly Democratic at the state level—Democratic Governor Gavin Newsom is cruising to reelection this year without serious Republican opposition after defeating a GOP-backed recall effort—congressional contests in California have proved highly susceptible to swings in the national mood. As part of the “blue wave” in 2018, the party flipped seven Republican-held seats, reducing the GOP to its smallest share of California’s congressional delegation since the 1880s. But in 2020, Republicans recaptured four of those districts—a key part of their unusual success at gaining House seats nationwide while losing the White House.Earlier this year, when inflation was raging and the Democratic legislative agenda seemed stalled, Republicans were optimistic about advancing farther across California by potentially ousting Democratic Representatives Josh Harder in the Central Valley and Porter and Levin in Orange and San Diego Counties. Although Democrats acknowledge that those races (and another Democratic-held open seat) remain competitive, they now see the opportunity to go on the offensive against Steel, Valadao, and Garcia, as well as potentially Representatives Ken Calvert and Young Kim in Southern California; they also see an opportunity to contest a Republican open seat in the Sacramento area.Several other issues have also contributed to this reversal of fortune: increased attention to gun violence after the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting; renewed focus on Donald Trump amid the revelations from the House January 6 committee and the firestorm over his mishandling of classified documents; and climate change after the passage of the Democrats’ slimmed-down reconciliation bill. But analysts in both parties see the Supreme Court decision reversing Roe as the pivotal factor shifting the congressional landscape across California. “We are just seeing an unprecedented level of outrage,” Representative Levin told me in an interview.As in other states, Republicans continue to express cautious optimism that frustration over inflation and disenchantment with the performance of President Joe Biden will outweigh views on abortion. “Of course [abortion] is going to be an issue, way more than it was in May of this year,” Lance Trover, a Republican consultant advising Representative Steel, who ousted a Democratic incumbent in 2020, told me. “But at the end of the day, the fundamentals of the economy are going to be key.”California Republicans face an unusually powerful headwind in moving beyond the abortion issue. Almost all Republicans holding or seeking congressional seats have staked out hard-line anti-abortion positions that directly collide with polls showing deep and broad support for abortion rights across the state.Polling in July by the nonpartisan Public Policy Institute of California found that more than two-thirds of state residents opposed the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe. That included about three-fourths of African Americans and Asian Americans, seven in 10 white voters, and just over three-fifths of Latino voters. About three-fourths of independents, whom Republicans need to compete in California, because they are so outnumbered by registered Democrats, opposed the ruling. Opposition to the decision was greatest in the big blue metropolitan areas of Los Angeles and San Francisco, but even in areas where Republicans have traditionally performed somewhat better, such as Orange and San Diego Counties and the Central Valley, preponderant majorities opposed the decision.In another survey released last week by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies and the Los Angeles Times, more than seven in 10 California voters said they intended to support the constitutional amendment inscribing abortion rights into the state constitution.“From a public-opinion perspective, it’s a settled issue in California,” Mark Baldassare, the PPIC president, told me. “We have seen what we would describe as overwhelming support for abortion rights in California consistently in our polls over many, many years … That’s pretty consistent across demographic groups and regions of the state.”The state’s Republican congressional delegation—as well as the party’s challengers in the key races—have placed themselves firmly on the opposite side of that consensus. Four of the House Republicans facing the potentially toughest contests—Steel, Garcia, Valadao, and Calvert—signed a legal brief urging the Supreme Court to overturn Roe. All of them but Calvert have co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act, a Republican bill that would define the unborn as a person under the Constitution from “the moment of fertilization” and effectively ban abortion nationwide, legal scholars say. Representative Kim, another Republican facing a potentially competitive race in an Orange County district, did not co-sponsor that bill, but has described herself as a “proud pro-life woman” who believes “the rights of the child must be respected.” The GOP challengers to Harder, Levin, and Porter have also publicly declared their opposition to legal abortion.As signs have grown of the backlash to the Supreme Court decision—including the Democratic victory in a New York congressional special election and the resounding defeat of a Kansas ballot initiative that would have opened the door to state abortion restrictions—several of the California Republicans have tried to obscure their positions. For instance, although the Life at Conception Act offers no exceptions and Steel earlier this year said she supported legal abortion only when the mother’s health was endangered, she told me in a statement, “I am pro-life with exceptions for rape, incest, and the health and life of the mother, and baby.” In a statement to the Los Angeles Times this week, Representative Garcia backed the same exceptions—which, again, are not included in the “life begins at conception” bill he is co-sponsoring.In her statement, Steel downplayed the possibility that a Republican-controlled Congress would seek to ban abortion nationwide, though notably without disavowing the idea: “Discussions surrounding a nationwide ban on abortion are purely hypothetical at this point,” she declared.But such vague dismissals may not dispel the vulnerability California Republicans face over the possibility of a national ban on abortion, particularly amid the parallel debate over amending the state constitution.Though neither supporters nor opponents of the constitutional amendment have yet raised much money, Newsom, who is emerging as a national leader for Democrats on cultural issues, is expected to campaign heavily for it and raise its visibility this fall. “I don’t want to give away our plans … but I would expect him to play a very prominent role,” Sean Clegg, a senior strategist for Newsom, told me. Abortion rights and the constitutional amendment to protect them, he added, are “going to have an effect in every single race in California.”[Conor Friedersdorf: Gavin Newsom, the Ron DeSantis of the left]The proposed amendment on the ballot in November represents the third level of protection for abortion rights in California. In earlier rulings, the state supreme court has already decided that the procedure is protected under the state constitution’s guarantees of liberty and privacy. This amendment, placed on the ballot by Newsom and the state’s Democratic-controlled legislature, adds an explicit guarantee that “the state shall not deny or interfere with an individual’s reproductive freedom … which includes their fundamental right to choose to have an abortion and their fundamental right to choose or refuse contraceptives.”Yet even all those reinforcing levels of protection for abortion rights in the California constitution would be preempted if Congress approved a national ban, legal analysts agree. The Life at Conception Act would surely face legal challenges if a future Republican-controlled Congress passes it, but should the law be upheld, it would override any California action to guarantee abortion rights, according to Cary Franklin, a constitutional-law professor at UCLA and the faculty director of its Center on Reproductive Health, Law, and Policy. “If Congress were to pass a national ban on abortion, that would trump state law, even state constitutional law,” she told me.That’s a message Democrats are likely to pound across the state in the campaign’s final months. “If Steel has her way, she will pass a federal ban on abortion, which will override our protections here, and I think Californians are coming to realize that,” Chen, a Naval reservist and the owner of a business that manages commercial properties, told me. By contrast, Chen, like the other Democratic incumbents and challengers, supports legislation restoring a national right to abortion.Opponents of the state constitutional amendment, such as Steel, say it would authorize abortions at any point in pregnancy, ending current state restrictions after a fetus is viable outside the womb (unless the mother’s life is endangered). Its sponsors deny that interpretation, but it will likely become the centerpiece of the campaign against the amendment. “Pro-life people may have had enough,” Susan Swift Arnall, the vice president of legal affairs at California’s Right to Life League, told me. “They may say, ‘This is too far. This is too extreme … And we want to send a message back to the legislature that we don’t support abortion on demand for all nine months and even into the birth of the baby.’”But the greater likelihood is that the amendment mobilizes turnout among the decisive majority in the state who support abortion rights. “There’s no question the [Supreme Court] decision has really created a great deal of increased interest from women voters for sure, and not just Democrats,” Levin said. “We are talking about independents, even some Republicans. Those who historically haven’t voted in midterm elections, I think, are motivated.”By solidifying Democrats in suburbia, abortion rights’ growing visibility, like the increased focus on gun violence and renewed attention to Trump, may narrow the range of House districts the GOP can realistically contest both in California and nationwide, and lower the ceiling on their potential gains. But not enough voters may prioritize abortion to neutralize Republicans’ other advantages in economically strained areas. Like so much else in modern American politics, the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe seems likely to further widen the chasm between white-collar and culturally cosmopolitan metropolitan areas trending toward the Democrats and blue-collar, socially conservative smaller places hardening in their support for the GOP, even in staunchly Democratic California.",

His argument – powerfully stated and fascinatingly debated through Christopher Shinn’s play – is that the exponential future improvement in the US traditionally offered by both Republicans and Democrats is now widely viewed as baloney. Trump won, Jim thinks, because rather than offering the standard brag that every four years bring new morning in America, he honestly admitted that it is midnight: mourning times that need dark leadership. Any would-be leader, Jim proposes, must admit the limits of optimism. Continue reading...",

I read it when I was eight, the summer my father was dying, and the girl who disappears into imagined worlds chimed with me.

        "description": "The contents of your shopping basket can have a huge impact on your wellbeing, so stock up on the items which can help to promote digestion and a healthy gutWe’ve probably never been more aware of how the groceries we choose affect our health. Who among us hasn’t tried to resist the lure of the cake aisle? The connection between food and wellbeing seems particularly salient when it comes to gut health. And, it turns out, by making simple changes to our diet, we can start to take care of our tummies. Try popping some of the items listed below into your shopping basket and see if you notice a difference.PotatoesPile plenty of potatoes into your shopping bag, but resist peeling them because their skins contain fibre. Fibre helps to maintain a healthy digestive system, passing through our small intestine without being broken down. The UK government recommends we aim for 30g of fibre a day, although British adults manage to eat only about 19g on average. Potatoes are also a source of resistant starch, a form of starch that can’t be digested in the small intestine and so is classified as a type of fibre. This, too, may aid gut health.

        "description": "There’s a reason our gut is known as the ‘second brain’ – what you eat has an effect on your mindThe idea that many of our emotions and feelings are linked to the gut is an ancient one. More than 2,000 years ago, the Romans made reference to what we today describe as a “gut feeling”. Now, modern science indicates that the gut may indeed play a role in mood disorders and our mental health.The gut is covered in nerve cells known as neurons – cells that transmit signals to other neurons, and which are also fundamental to our brains. Research suggests that this network, known as the enteric nervous system, contains more than 100m neurons. This complex network of cells in our gut is able to function independently of the brain and spinal cord, and is often referred to as the body’s “second brain”. Continue reading...",

Keeping our gut in good health matters more than we may thinkThe British stiff upper lip has a lot to answer for, not least our reluctance to talk about intimate bodily functions without feeling squeamish. Take gut health, a term that covers how well our stomach and intestines are working. Increasingly, experts believe there are important health benefits to be gained from talking openly about how well our guts are, well, performing. Everyone needs to stop worrying about divulging “too much information”.Gut health matters because research indicates it can affect many of our body’s systems and functions, from our metabolism to our mental health, to our digestive system.

        "description": "The O2, LondonPart cruise-ship crooner, part foul-mouthed standup, the 25-year-old caps an occasionally slow show with a magnetic final act‘Fuck me, this is high.” Lewis Capaldi and his piano are sitting atop a gigantic screen at London’s O2 Arena. The 25-year-old Scottish singer-songwriter is in the middle of performing his multi-platinum ballad Bruises and obviously out of his comfort zone. As the 20,000-strong crowd begins to cheer, he scoffs. “The song is not finished,” he scolds. “Please shut up.”This might sound like a horrifying crowd interaction, but for Capaldi’s fans it’s part of the appeal. Ever since he scored a surprise mega-hit with 2018’s Grammy-nominated Someone You Loved – an Adele-style heartbreak anthem that sat at No 1 in the UK for seven weeks – Capaldi has cut an incongruous figure. Although his music often crosses the line into boilerplate balladry, signposting its emotional cues with rasping yelps and forlorn pianos, Capaldi himself has developed a reputation as the class clown of British pop.

You can’t do much better on an offday than seeing a top prospect get promoted. It’s overdue, but the 22-year-old will get his shot. Join us in watching him hopefully debut tonight in Tampa Bay!\nToday on the site, I’ll present a tweaked version of the Aaron Judge Home Run Tracker to accommodate for the Yankees’ day off, and I’ll also run through the scant American League rival action yesterday. After that, Matt will preview the three-game set against the Rays, and Jeff will emphasize the importance of actually giving Peraza extended playing time during his call-up. Finally, Andrés will discuss the Yankees’ potential playoff peril, Peter will look back on the thrill of watching Aaron Judge and Shohei Ohtani go head-to-head this week, and Madison will answer your mailbag questions.\nAlso, Josh, Peter, and Esteban hosted a Twitter Spaces last night to discuss the Peraza promotion, IKF, and several other topics. You can listen to it on our podcast feed in the player below, any of your normal podcast-listening apps, or directly on Twitter here.\nToday’s Matchup:\nNew York Yankees at Tampa Bay Rays\nTime: 7:10 p.m. ET\nTV: YES Network, Bally Sports Sun, MLB Network (out-of-market only)\nRadio: 1280 WADO, 660/101.9 FM WFAN\nVenue: Tropicana Field\nFun Questions/Prompts:\n1.

On one end, a 13ft bison was to stare out over the water. At the other, a colonial fur trader, measuring 11.5ft, would sit atop a pile of bison pelts. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  One heck of a night for the Braves rookie. Spencer Strider was spectacular on Thursday night as the Atlanta Braves defeated the Colorado Rockies 3-0. To earn his ninth win of the season, Strider tossed eight innings of shutout ball and struck out 16. He broke Atlanta’s record for strikeouts in a single game, which was previously held by John Smoltz with 15 strikeouts.\n\n\n.@SpencerSTRIDer's Super Sweet Sixteen (Strikeouts). pic.twitter.com/J8IGsYVevX— MLB (@MLB) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\n“I came out of the game and Kyle was telling me something about John Smoltz or whatever and I had no idea what he was talking about,” Strider said following his start. “It didn’t make any sense, and then somebody else said something and I just kinda looked cross-eyed at them and they were like, ‘you know what just happened?’” \nOn the offensive front, the Braves tacked on one run in the fourth, courtesy of a bomb from Austin Riley. In the fifth, Michael Harris sent a ball 437 feet to give the Braves their second run of the night. Dansby Swanson continued the scoring in the fifth with a 2-out RBI single.\nThe homestand continues tonight as the Miami Marlins are welcomed back to Truist Park. First pitch gets underway at 7:20 ET.\nBraves News:\nThe Braves have a three-game set with the Miami Marlins on deck. Charlie Morton gets the ball for game one. Jake Odorizzi is on the bump for game two, and Max Fried is set for game three. \nThe Braves added INF Orlando Arcia and RHP Jesse Chavez to the active roster on Thursday. To make room on the 40-man roster, Darren O’Day was transferred to the 60-day injured list. \nKyle Muller tossed seven innings of two-run ball to wrap up Wednesday in the minor leagues.\nA look back at the Braves’ performance in August.\nMLB News:\nFree agent RHP Carlos Martinez received an 85-game suspension in accordance with MLB’s domestic violence policy. The 30-year-old had stints with the Boston Red Sox and San Francisco Giants this season, but he has not appeared in a major league game in 2022. \nThe Los Angeles Dodgers activated LHP Clayton Kershaw from the injured list after missing nearly a month with a lower back injury. The club also placed RHP Brusdar Graterol on the 15-day IL with inflammation in his right elbow. Graterol was just reinstated from the injured list on August 22.",

        "description": "Vital springboard for the likes of Adele and Amy Winehouse? Or conveyor belt for beige pop? Staff, famous alumni and critics of the Brit performing arts school consider its complicated legacyWhen it opened in Croydon, south London, in 1991, few knew that the Brit School – part of the Thatcher government’s controversial City Technology Colleges initiative – would change the landscape of British music. An independent, free-to-attend arts school funded by the government with support from the Brit Trust, it was propelled into the spotlight in the mid-00s thanks to its first crop of musical talent. While alumni such as Amy Winehouse, Adele and the Feeling became hugely successful, and in total its students have collectively sold more than 250m albums and won 15 Brit awards, the school has also been the subject of much criticism.

Developers will see their service fees of 15 to 30 percent reduced by 4 percent when users select a new third-party billing option, which the developer — not Google — must support in case of customer issues. The news was first reported by 9to5Google.\nNow, as of September 1st, registered developers from the European Economic Area (EEA), India, Japan, Indonesia, and Australia can participate in User Choice Billing, according to this enrollment page. Google contends that 99 percent of developers using the company’s own Play Store billing qualify for the 15 percent...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "In 1963 Pauline Kael — a freelance essayist, five years before her gig at the New Yorker — published an essay in the Massachusetts Review about some then-recent and then-widely-discussed European films. It’s a very interesting and (I think) convincing essay, animated by the strong views about what movies ought to be that would later make Kael notorious, but without the laying-down-the-law tone that makes so much of her later writing frustrating to read. She wasn’t yet “Pauline Kael of the New Yorker,” she was just another writer in a relatively obscure literary quarterly. Here’s how it starts: \n\nLa Notte and Marienbad are moving in a new filmic direction: they are so introverted, so interior that I think the question must be asked, is there something new and deep in them, or are they simply empty? When they are called abstract, is that just a fancy term for empty? La Notte is supposed to be a study in the failure of communication, but what new perceptions of this problem do we get by watching people on the screen who can&#8217;t communicate if we are never given any insight into what they would have to say if they could talk to each other? \n\nI think she is asking precisely the right questions here and leading her reader towards the right answers. The problem is not so much that these films are pretentious — though Lord knows they are — but that they are empty. They are empereurs sans vêtements. \nLater: \n\nIn La Notte we are people for whom life has lost all meaning, but we are given no insight into why. They&#8217;re so damned inert about their situation that I wind up wanting to throw stones at people who live in glass houses. At a performance of Chekhov&#8217;s Three Sisters, only a boob asks, &#8220;Well, why don&#8217;t they go to Moscow?&#8221; We can see why they don&#8217;t. Chekhov showed us why these particular women didn&#8217;t do what they said they longed to do. But in movies like La Notte or Marienbad, or, to some degree, La Dolce Vita the men and women are not illuminated or ridiculed — they are set in an atmosphere from which the possibilities of joy, satisfaction, and even simple pleasures are eliminated. The mood of the protagonists, if we can call them that, is lassitude; there is almost no conflict, only a bit of struggling — perhaps squirming is more accurate — amid the unvoiced acceptance of defeat. They are the post-analytic set — they have done everything, they have been to Moscow and everywhere else, and it&#8217;s all dust and ashes: they are beyond hope or conviction or dedication. It&#8217;s easy enough to say “They are alienated; therefore, they exist,” but unless we know what they are alienated from, their alienation is meaningless — an empty pose. And that is just what alienation is in these films — an empty pose; the figures are cardboard intellectuals — the middle-class view of sterile artists. Steiner&#8217;s party from La Dolce Vita is still going on in La Notte, just as the gathering of bored aristocrats in La Dolce Vita is still going on in Marienbad. \n\nOf the three films, Last Year at Marienbad is the most visually interesting, and visual interest is the only kind there can be in movies of this sort. But the interest doesn’t last long. This three-minute video essay about the film tells you all you need to know about it, I think. \nKarl could have ended up in a kind of intellectual dead-end: she despised the emptiness of so much New European Cinema, and loved the rough vigor of Old Hollywood … but the world of movies is always mainly about the new, and Old Hollywood was clearly dying. (The amount of absolute trash that the studios cranked out through most of the Sixties is astonishing.) As Mark Harris shows in his brilliant book Pictures at a Revolution: Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood, in 1967 — the year of Bonnie and Clyde and The Graduate — the great pivot happened. And it was her essay in praise of Bonnie and Clyde that landed Kael her job at the New Yorker. ",

If there was ever a war to validate that claim, it’s the one currently churning in Ukraine. As the conflict in Europe’s largest country marks its six-month anniversary on Wednesday, 24 August, the main protagonists have all experienced their fair share of jolted assumptions, operational mistakes, and misplaced beliefs about what is and isn’t possible. Inflated expectations have been punctured, hopes have been dashed, and strategies crafted to cause the enemy discomfort instead produced unintended consequences that are just as painful.Take Russia as an example. Sensing Ukrainian forces would either flee or fold in matter of days, Vladimir Putin believed a military operation in Ukraine could easily dispose of the Volodymyr Zelenskiy administration with minimal resistance. Putin assumed that Russia’s security services, with assets burrowed within the Ukrainian political elite, had an accurate, sophisticated reading of Ukraine’s internal dynamics and were confident that the Ukrainian people would welcome a pro-Russian government in Kyiv.Daniel R DePetris is a fellow at Defense Priorities and a foreign affairs columnist at the Chicago Tribune Continue reading...",

        "description": "President Biden issued a midterm-minded message on Thursday that America’s democratic values are at risk and that former President Trump and his most ardent backers are the chief reason why as his party seeks to continue momentum ahead of the November elections.\n\n\n\nBiden, speaking in prime-time from the perch of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, namechecked his 2020 general election opponent frequently as he sought to up the stakes for voters heading into the stretch run of the political season. During the 24-minute address, the president said that Trump “represents an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our Republic.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“But there’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans,” said Biden, who was flanked on stage by Marine guards. “And that is a threat to this country.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to The Hill’s Brett Samuels and Morgan Chalfant, White House officials insisted Thursday night’s speech would not be political in nature. However, that idea evaporated quickly as Biden levied multiple criticisms of his predecessor and Republicans, while rounding out the address by touting policy victories on issues such as on police funding and the pandemic.\n\n\n\nThe address came at a key time for Biden and Democrats. The party in power is on the upswing after a number of key wins over the past month — including two special election victories that have helped buoy the spirits of Democrats after spending much of the past year struggling to counter GOP messages on the economy and inflation.\n\n\n\nNotably, the president has also grown more combative amid the Democratic resurgence. In recent weeks, he has called out “MAGA Republicans” on a number of occasions. The rhetoric hit a crescendo last week at a political rally in Maryland where he described the movement as akin to “semi-fascism” (The New York Times).\n\n\n\nThat remark has drawn rebukes from across the GOP spectrum. The latest came in a prebuttal speech on Thursday by House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who said that the first line of Biden’s speech should have been an apology “for slandering tens of millions of Americans as fascists” (The Hill).\n\n\n\n▪ The Associated Press: Biden sounds newly strong alarm: Trumpism menaces democracy.\n\n\n\n▪ Peter Baker, The New York Times: A rematch of Biden v. Trump, two years early.\n\n\n\n▪ Niall Stanage: The Memo: Midterms shape up as proxy war between Biden and Trump.\n\n\n\nThe president’s speech, however, had an alternative purpose: to turn the November elections into a choice between his agenda or a return to Trumpism and the ways of “MAGA Republicans.” It also allowed Biden the chance to discuss cultural issues that have animated Democrats and progressives since the Supreme Court’s decision striking down Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\n“MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,” Biden said. “Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.”\n\n\n\nWrapping up his address, Biden also called on Americans to “vote, vote, vote.”\n\n\n\n▪ Politico: Trump is heading to Pennsylvania to make his case. So is Biden.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Trump says he will “look very favorably” at pardons, apologies for Jan. 6 rioters if elected in 2024.\n\n\n\n▪ The Washington Post: New York Police Department veteran who assaulted police receives longest Jan. 6 sentence yet: 10 years.\n\n\n\nBiden’s speech also came as Jan. 6-related investigations rage on. Pat Cipollone, the former White House counsel, and Pat Philbin, Cipollone’s deputy in the counsel’s office under Trump, are expected to appear today before a federal grand jury probing the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and efforts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n\n\nCipollone, who served as counsel on Jan. 6, was subpoenaed by the grand jury last month in connection with the Justice Department's look into Trump’s actions leading up to the attack. The move is part of its criminal probe of efforts to overturn the 2020 electoral results (NBC News).\n\n\n\nThe fallout from Jan. 6 could also lead to congressional action. Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) became the tenth Senate Republican to throw their weight behind the Electoral Count Reform and Presidential Transition Improvement Act, a bipartisan bill aimed at reforming the Electoral Count Act of 1887.\n\n\n\nThe proposal, which is spearheaded by Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), would clarify “ambiguous provisions” of the vice president’s role in overseeing the process of certifying an election following Trump’s pressure campaign against former Vice President Mike Pence last year. The legislation would increase the threshold for objecting to electors from just one member of the Senate and the House, respectively, to at least one-fifth of the 535 members of Congress.\n\n\n\nGrassley’s support is significant as it would likely provide a filibuster-proof majority on the bill (Washington Examiner).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n▪ The New York Times: Top lawyer for Oath Keepers is arrested in connection with Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\n\n▪ CNN: Jan. 6 committee seeking voluntary cooperation from Newt Gingrich.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: State Sen. Doug Mastriano (R), GOP nominee for Pennsylvania governorship, sues Jan. 6 committee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\n\n\n➤ POLITICS &amp; INVESTIGATIONS\n\n\n\nA federal judge on Thursday left the door open to appointing a “special master” to examine documents seized by the FBI earlier this month from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home, but did not make a final decision on the matter.\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon said she will issue a written order “in due course” on whether to appoint the third-party individual to review the collected evidence. Cannon, who was appointed by Trump in 2020, did not indicate a timeline for her decision (The Hill).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring the two-hour hearing, Cannon pressed prosecutors over what the “harm” in appointing a third-party figure to review the documents. Jay Bratt, the head of the counterintelligence section at the Justice Department, argued that a special master could slow the work of investigators and pose a risk to national security. Cannon countered that it could be possible to make the appointment without jeopardizing the security risk assessment (The New York Times).\n\n\n\nCannon wrote last Saturday that it was her “preliminary intent” to appoint a special master, Chris Kise, the former Florida solicitor general who recently joined Trump’s legal team, argued that appointing a special master as a neutral third party would restore faith in the investigation.\n\n\n\n“This is an unprecedented situation. We need to lower the temperature,” Kise said. “We need to take a deep breath.”\n\n\n\nCBS News: Federal judge orders Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) to testify to Georgia grand jury, but limits scope of questioning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Associated Press / Wilfredo Lee | The Paul G. Rogers Federal Building and U.S. Courthouse in West Palm Beach, Fla., on Thursday.\n\n\n\nA little more than two months out from the midterm elections and there’s are trouble in the Senate GOP ranks as Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, issued a not-so-veiled criticism of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) over concerns about the party’s stable of candidates this fall.\n\n\n\nIn an op-ed, Scott panned Republicans for “trash-talking” the party’s candidates for the Senate, added that the remarks are “treasonous” and that the detractors should “pipe down” amid the push to win back the majority in November (The Hill).\n\n\n\n“Unfortunately, many of the very people responsible for losing the Senate last cycle are now trying to stop us from winning the majority this time by trash-talking our Republican candidates,” the Florida Republican wrote. “It’s an amazing act of cowardice, and ultimately, it’s treasonous to the conservative cause.” \n\n\n\nThe comments were viewed as another chapter in the feud between Scott and McConnell, who said last month that “candidate quality” could stand between Republicans and the Senate majority. The Kentucky Republican also said at the time that the GOP had a better chance of winning back the House than the Senate (The New York Times).\n\n\n\n▪ Politico: Defiant Scott explains “strategic disagreement” with McConnell over battle for Senate.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Republicans rage against ranked choice voting after Alaska election.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Cook Political Report moves five House races toward Democrats.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES\n\n\n\n➤ ECONOMY &amp; ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n\nAll eyes this morning will be on the labor market as the August jobs report will provide another snapshot at the economic well-being of the U.S. and could open the door to more aggressive action by the Federal Reserve.\n\n\n\nAfter a white-hot report emerged in July, the jobs numbers are expected to slow slightly for August, but are still likely to be strong across multiple sectors of the market. According to Dow Jones projections, the economy added roughly 318,000 jobs in July (down from 528,000 in June), with the unemployment rate sticking at 3.5 percent.\n\n\n\nThis morning’s numbers are of particular importance, as they will arrive ahead of the Fed’s expected decision later in the month to further hike interest rates, with the state of the labor market playing a key role in that call. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell said last week that the central banking system is committed to combating high inflation with higher rates, adding that the economy and labor market are likely to experience “pain” as a result (CNBC).\n\n\n\nThe August jobs report will be released at 8:30 a.m. ET.\n\n\n\n▪ Reuters: U.S. labor market, manufacturing resilient despite rising interest rates.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Goldman Sachs releases forecast on housing downturn: “Further to fall.”\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, attention will shift from the jobs numbers to the launching pad when NASA will once again attempt to launch the Artemis I moon rocket from the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Fla., less than a week after the initial attempt was scrapped.\n\n\n\nAccording to team leaders, the two-hour launch window for the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion spacecraft will begin at 2:17 p.m. ET on Saturday. Monday’s attempted launch was scuttled after the SLS’s third engine did not fall to the right temperature, with a hydrogen leak also playing a role.\n\n\n\n“We’ve got a path forward,” John Honeycutt, the manager for the SLS program, said on Tuesday. “We’re in the mode now of processing the data that we got and updating our approach prior to the next launch attempt. I’m confident where the team’s headed.”\n\n\n\nCBS News: NASA gears up for second attempt to launch Artemis moon rocket.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPINION\n\n\n\n■ The Trump Show is good for Trump — and Biden, by Rich Lowry, contributing editor, Politico Magazine. https://politi.co/3q2zAQP\n\n\n\n■ To defend democracy, don’t call Trump a semi-fascist, by Jonathan Bernstein, columnist, Bloomberg Opinion. https://bloom.bg/3CKx35g\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHERE AND WHEN\n\n\n\nThe House will meet at 10 a.m. for a pro forma session and return to work in the Capitol on Sept. 13.\n\n\n\nThe Senate convenes at 9 a.m. for a pro forma session during its summer recess, which ends on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe president will receive the President’s Daily Brief at 9 a.m. Biden will speak about his administration’s economic efforts at 11 a.m., before having lunch with Vice President Harris at noon.

The two nations accused each other of shelling in the region and trying to derail the visit by the group. Underscoring the issues with the plant, Ukraine’s state nuclear power company said hours before their arrival that mortar shelling by Moscow led to the shutdown of one of its reactors, amid other issues.\n\n\n\n“The IAEA is now there at the plant and it’s not moving. It’s going to stay there. We’re going to have a continued presence there at the plant with some of my experts,” IAEA director Rafael Grossi said after its initial look inside the plant (The Associated Press).\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Why the world is worried about a nuclear disaster in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n▪ Laura Kelly, reporting for The Hill from Ukraine: Three nights with the volunteer force supplying the frontlines.\n\n\n\n➤ PANDEMIC &amp; HEALTH\n\n\n\nA Centers for Disease Control and Prevention panel on Thursday recommended updated COVID-19 vaccine boosters for people 12 and older that are aimed at combating BA.4 and BA.5 strains of the omicron variant.

According to Fauci, the Southern Hemisphere is already experiencing a more severe flu season, adding that those countries usually encounter new flu strains sooner than those in the U.S. “We should be prepared for that superimposed upon what I hope is the residual and not another spike of Covid,” Fauci told Bloomberg Law (The Hill).\n\n\n\nTotal U.S. coronavirus deaths reported as of this morning, according to Johns Hopkins University (trackers all vary slightly): 1,047,006. Current average U.S. COVID-19 daily deaths are 403, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\nOn the legal side, a federal judge preliminarily declined to toss Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes’s fraud conviction on Thursday as part of her last-ditch effort to avoid jail time. Amy Saharia, Holmes’s lawyer, argued that the head of the failed blood-testing company did not misrepresent the company (or did not know she was) to investors.

The feature — the company’s most requested to date — would allow users to edit a tweet “a few times” up to 30 minutes after it was posted, the company said in a blog post. “If you see an edited Tweet it’s because we’re testing the edit button,” Twitter said in a post from its official account. “This is happening and you’ll be okay” (The Hill).\n\n\n\nPolitico: How Twitter’s edit button could change the calculus in Washington.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE CLOSER\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n© Associated Press / Chris O’Meara | A dead Snook washes up at shore in Bradenton, Fla., due to red tide., 2018.\n\n\n\nAnd finally … 👏👏👏 Congratulations to Morning Report Quiz winners, all of whom possess a nose for news!\n\n\n\nOur end-of-summer puzzle took note of odiferous headlines around the globe, and these champions are all coming up roses this morning: Patrick Kavanagh, Mary Anne McEnery, Amanda Fisher, Richard Baznik, Harry Strulovici, Ki Harvey, Terry Pflaumer, Pam Manges, Kathleen Kovalik, Len Jones, Lou Tisler and Andre Leblanc.\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, Prince Charles, an enthusiastic horticulturist and lover of Highgrove House gardens, launched a line of perfume in August that boasts “top notes of geranium, lavender and hyacinth.” A percentage of proceeds will go to charity.\n\n\n\nIn Sweden, surströmming, or fermented herring, is a delicacy described by some as smelling like “bad eggs” and a “decomposed body,” that left fans lined up outside supermarkets last week to score some of the nation’s scarce supply.\n\n\n\nIn Italy, Mayor Roberto Gualtieri landed on the front page of The New York Times this week because garbage (and garbage fires) are fouling Rome’s air.\n\n\n\nAccording to U.S. news accounts as summer ripened, residents near San Francisco Bay became upset about smelly surpluses of seaweed and algae, and recent fish-killing algae blooms in the Sunshine State are dubbed red tide, which means the answer we were looking for was “all of the above.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Engaged\n\n\n\nWe want to hear from you!

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFour states – Alaska, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Dakota – have never elected an openly LGBTQ+ person to the state legislature.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOpenly LGBTQ+ candidates in Alaska and South Dakota are determined to change that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn each of those states, no less than three pieces of legislation have been introduced this year that would restrict the rights of LGBTQ+ people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJennie Armstrong had spent the morning on Facebook. She combed through pages for new mothers in the West Anchorage area where she lives, where women by the dozen were desperately searching for baby formula to feed their hungry infants amid a nationwide shortage.\n\n\n\nIt was overcast that May 4 morning, and heavy rain fell through much of the afternoon and evening. Two days prior, reporters at POLITICO had published a leaked Supreme Court draft opinion striking down Roe v. Wade, the landmark 1973 ruling that established the constitutional right to abortion.\n\n\n\nArmstrong, a 33-year-old small business owner and mother of two, struggled to wrap her head around the Court – and now, state lawmakers – dissolving abortion protections when accessing necessities like baby food and other childcare resources was already so difficult.\n\n\n\nThat afternoon, Armstrong made both a decision and a prediction: she was going to run for a seat in the Alaska House of Representatives – and she was going to win.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot only does Armstrong’s candidacy reflect an increase in political involvement among women in a post-Roe world, but it’s also representative of the skyrocketing number of openly LGBTQ+ people running for public office – more than 1,000 this year, by the LGBTQ Victory Fund’s count.\n\n\n\n“The truism ‘you can’t be what you can’t see’ rings very true for me,” Armstrong, who is pansexual, told Changing America in an interview. “Many state legislatures have looked homogenous for a long time, and I think it’s important that we have a multitude of lived experiences in the legislature to truly represent what the majority of lived experiences are.”\n\n\n\nAbout 3.7 percent of Alaska’s adult population identifies as LGBTQ+, according to data from Gallup and the Williams Institute. And yet, should Armstrong win in November’s general election, she would be the first openly LGBTQ+ person ever elected to the state legislature.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Armstrong could be one of four openly LGBTQ+ people to serve in the Alaska House next session, indicative of a social and political shift in the state where the late Alaska Sen. Johnny Ellis (D) served in the legislature for nearly three decades before coming out as gay in 2016.\n\n\n\n“It’s a really nice sort of statement of power that we're ready to just be open about who we are,” Ashley Carrick, a bisexual woman running to represent Alaskans in House District 35, told Changing America.\n\n\n\n“There are a lot more women, a lot more LGBT people and a lot more people who are from backgrounds that haven't traditionally been represented in the Alaska legislature saying ‘enough is enough – Alaska is ready for us,’” she said. “I didn't choose to run because I'm LGBT, but I am running and I am LGBT.”\n\n\n\nArmstrong and Carrick are joined by Andrew Gray, an openly gay man and veteran of the Alaska National Guard running to represent House District 20, and Lyn Franks, an out lesbian woman running to represent Alaskans in House District 18. All four candidates are Democrats.\n\n\n\nIn three other states – Louisiana, Mississippi and South Dakota – an openly LGBTQ+ person has never served in the state legislature. This year alone, lawmakers in each of those states introduced no less than three bills that would restrict how LGBTQ+ people access health care, play sports or talk about their identity at school or the workplace, according to Freedom for All Americans, which tracks such legislation.\n\n\n\nSome of those bills, including measures in Louisiana and South Dakota barring transgender women and girls from playing on female sports teams, have already become law.\n\n\n\n“Unfortunately, that's not going to change until we have representation,” Kameron Nelson, an openly gay man running for a seat in the South Dakota House, told Changing America.\n\n\n\nNelson, 32, a Democrat and South Dakota native, said conservative elected officials in the state have for years been embracing anti-LGBTQ+ policies as a way to ignite their base.\n\n\n\n“When you just reduce people to a talking point, then you completely do a disservice to them as a human being,” he said. “These are real folks who are really hurting.”\n\n\n\nSouth Dakota is one of eight states ranked by the Movement Advancement Project as having the fewest policies in place to protect LGBTQ+ people. Louisiana and Arkansas are also included on that list.\n\n\n\nNelson, who describes his hometown of Rapid City as a “crimson corner of a red state,” did not come out as gay until his early twenties. He hopes his candidacy – and he hopes, his win in November – will make it easier for South Dakota’s LGBTQ+ youth to feel empowered and comfortable in their own skin.\n\n\n\n“If I can help clear a path for someone younger than me to not have to go through all of those trials and tribulations, then that's exactly what I'll do,” he said.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Saturday will be the first ever National Cinema Day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMovie theaters across the country will offer $3 tickets to draw in more moviegoers. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2021, just 47 percent of the U.S., Canada population went to a movie theater at least once. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThousands of movie theaters will be offering tickets for just $3 on Saturday as the cinema industry attempts to draw in customers over a&nbsp;long weekend that typically doesn’t see a lot of movie-goers. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Cinema Foundation, a nonprofit connected to the National Association of Theater Owners (NATO),&nbsp;is launching the inaugural&nbsp;National Cinema Day. Over 3,000 movie theaters are participating by offering $3 tickets&nbsp;to customers of all ages. That's a steep discount, as nationally the average U.S. movie ticket was $9.16 in 2019.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMajor theatre chains including AMC and Regal Cinemas are planning to offer $3 movie tickets for all major film studios, in every format like IMAX and 4D. Movie goers can see films like \"The Invitation,\" \"Bullet Train,\" \"Beast\" and \"Top Gun Maverick,\" some of the top performing movies for the last week of August. \n\n\n\nIn addition to offering $3 movie tickets, Cinemark Theatres is going further by offering $3 beverages, candy and popcorn.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“After this summer’s record-breaking return to cinemas, we wanted to do something to celebrate moviegoing,” said Jackie Brenneman, president of Cinema Foundation, in a press release. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’re doing it by offering a ‘thank you’ to the moviegoers that made this summer happen, and by offering an extra enticement for those who haven’t made it back yet.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic devastated the movie industry, with NATO even starting an awareness campaign dubbed #SaveYourCinema that resulted in moviegoers across the U.S. sending over 200,000 letters to Congress asking for more federal relief. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat's in addition to the rise of streaming services, where Americans can watch movies and TV shows of their choice from the comfort of their couch. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt's a reality the movie industry is attempting to grapple with, as the Motion Picture Association (MPA) admitted in its annual report that the U.S./Canada box office market was $4.5 billion in 2021, a 105 percent increase from 2020, but still significantly lower than 2019. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2021, just under half, 47 percent, of the U.S., Canada population physically went to a movie theater at least once—which is about 168 million people. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the same time, MPA found 80 percent of U.S. adults watched movies and shows through traditional TV services and online subscriptions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome media companies are trying to reach viewers in both places, like when Warner Bros. announced it would release the film “Dune” on its streaming service HBO Max at the same time it would also be airing&nbsp;in theatres. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Dune” director Denis Villeneuve blasted the decision, writing in an op-ed for Variety, “streaming services are a positive and powerful addition to the movie and TV ecosystems. But I want the audience to understand that streaming alone can’t sustain the film industry as we knew it before COVID.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVilleneuve went on to explain that his film was created with the intention of a “big screen experience,” with images and sound meticulously designed to be seen in a movie theater.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNational Cinema Day could help jumpstart the movie industry, enticing moviegoers to visit a theater instead of opting to watch through a paid subscription service. &nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/defense/3624734-why-the-world-is-worried-about-a-nuclear-disaster-in-ukraine/",
        "description": "The world’s nuclear watchdog is visiting the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine this week amid concerns sparked by shelling around the plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), warned last month that military action around the plant raised “very real risk of nuclear disaster.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts say the effects of such a disaster could lead to radiation leakage that impacts the local communities, but would most likely not lead to a global catastrophe.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo what are the stakes for Ukraine and the world if Russia’s war leads to a nuclear disaster?\n\n\n\n\"The kind of shelling we're seeing should not be a significant impact on the reactors. In the way that it's being done now, which is, you know, occasional shelling,” said Jonathan Cobb, senior communication manager at the World Nuclear Association.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUkraine has 15 nuclear reactors that generate half of its electricity, according to the World Nuclear Association. Six of these reactors are located at the Zaporizhzhia plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant has been under Russian control since the early days of its invasion of Ukraine, even though Ukrainian workers still operate the plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe facility — the largest nuclear plant in Europe — is directly on the front lines of the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe IAEA’s visit comes days after Ukraine warned of “renewed shelling.” In a statement released Aug. 28, the IAEA said the shelling hit the area of the plant’s “two special buildings” which house facilities like water treatment plants, equipment repair shops and waste management facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAll measurements of radioactivity at the site were within normal range, and there was “no indication of any hydrogen leakage.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJacopo Buongiorno, a professor of nuclear engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said nuclear plants must be continuously cooled, meaning there has to be a way to remove heat generated by nuclear fuel. If the plant is connected to Ukraine’s electric grid, then the cooling is provided by water pumps that are powered by the grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf not, then the plants have emergency diesel generators that can provide that power.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In a well-functioning, peacetime nuclear power plant, all these layers of protections and barriers are there. They work perfectly well,” Buongiorno said. “And now, there is no indication that they're not working well, either.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere have only been two major accidents related to nuclear reactors in history. The first was Chernobyl in 1986, when a reactor when out of control during a test, leading it to explode.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore recently, in March 2011, Japan was hit by a major earthquake followed by a tsunami that led to power loss at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The power led to the cooling systems failing in three reactors, causing the core to overheat.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts say the worst-case scenario at Zaporizhzhia would look more like what happened in Fukushima rather than what happened in Chernobyl.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFighting between the Russians and Ukrainians could disrupt the cooling mechanism of the reactors, which could cause the core to overheat, leading it to melt — often referred to as a nuclear meltdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut getting to a nuclear meltdown would take a major event, experts say, because the reactors themselves have six-feet-thick concrete containment vessels protecting them.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“At least in theory, if even if there was a direct hit, there would be at least some protection,” said Mitchel Wallerstein, a nonresident senior fellow at The Chicago Council.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe greatest concern in such a scenario is for the local population that lives around the area.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainian government has reportedly begun distributing potassium iodide pills, which help prevent inhaled or swallowed radioactive iodine from being absorbed by the thyroid — a gland located in the neck that makes hormones to help to regulate the many functions of the body, such as its metabolic rate.&nbsp;Exposure to radiation can increase the risk of developing thyroid cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe European Union even said Wednesday that it is donating 5.5 million of these tablets at the request of the Ukrainian government.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite the protections at Zaporizhzhia holding for now, experts see high value in the IAEA’s visit.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAll but five of the 14 inspectors had left the plant as of Thursday, along with Grossi, with the remaining scheduled to leave Saturday.\n\n\n\nWhile there, the team will assess the safety of the plant and assess safeguards and equipment to monitor nuclear material, as well as checking on the Ukrainian workers at the facility.\n\n\n\n“These workers have been running the plant in occupied territory essentially for six months,” Cobb said. “And there have been reports — as yet, unconfirmed … of poor treatment of the workers by the Russian forces there.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOlli Heinonen, a former IAEA deputy director general who is now a fellow at the Stimson Center, said the agency is there to gather evidence and records of how the reactors have been operating in recent months.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I would expect that this will take four or five days,” Heinonen said. “If it is shorter then I think that they will come back with less information, and I'm sure Mr. Grossi will not agree to that. But on the other hand, they are in the hands of the occupying force.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a video posted to Twitter, Grossi said the agency will establish a “continued presence” at the plant, which experts said would be a valuable move.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Just reporting on conditions would be a very valuable service. Maintaining that safeguard function, and as being an independent United Nations presence there that could report as best they could, on the way in which the workforce has been treated by the Russian military forces on the site,” Cobb said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That would be a very sensible and valuable function that they can provide.”",

midterm elections are shaping up as a proxy war between President Biden and former President Trump.\n\n\n\nBiden has gone after Trump in a fiery fashion in recent weeks, including in Thursday night’s prime-time speech in Philadelphia.\n\n\n\nReferring to the movement that takes its inspiration from the former president, Biden said: \"Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.\"\n\n\n\nThe Thursday speech made crystal clear that the days of Biden seeking to focus only on his own agenda, or making oblique reference to “the former guy,” are a thing of the past.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden also recently contended that elements of the current Trump-centric Republicanism amount to “semi-fascism” — a reference that delighted his base even as it elicited a demand for an apology from House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.).\n\n\n\nTrump, meanwhile, is playing a huge role in the elections — though in a way that may wind up hurting the GOP.\n\n\n\nGOP Senate nominees who won their primaries in part thanks to the former president’s backing have encountered serious turbulence in their general election campaigns. That’s true to a greater or lesser degree of Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, Herschel Walker in Georgia, J.D. Vance in Ohio and Blake Masters in Arizona.\n\n\n\nTrump has, of course, also returned to the headlines in the most dramatic fashion possible after the FBI’s search of his Mar-a-Lago club on Aug. 8. Almost one month later, there is no sign of that story ebbing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe upshot is that a midterms campaign that seemed likely to be fought on the economy and inflation just a few months ago is now shaping up as a battle between the two septuagenarians who&nbsp;faced off in&nbsp;the last presidential election&nbsp;— and who might yet&nbsp;have a rematch in&nbsp;the next one.\n\n\n\nPutting the focus on Trump is just fine with Democrats.\n\n\n\n“To the extent that this election becomes about Trump, I don’t think it is good for the Republicans,” said Democratic strategist Mark Longabaugh. “It may be somewhat motivating to their base, but as a whole it takes them off of the frame that they would prefer — talking about inflation, the economy, to some degree crime.”\n\n\n\nLast weekend, Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) responded to the ongoing controversy over Trump’s handling of presidential records by complaining on ABC’s “This Week” that it was “less than 100 days before the election [and] suddenly we’re talking about this rather than the economy or inflation.”\n\n\n\nTodd Belt, a George Washington University professor who specializes in political management, also noted that Trump faces several investigations beyond the Mar-a-Lago matter, including a Georgia probe into efforts by him and his allies to overturn the 2020 election and the Department of Justice examination of the events around the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection.\n\n\n\nPolitically, that could be problematic for the GOP, given that Republicans normally benefit from their strong anti-crime, pro-law enforcement image.\n\n\n\n“The fact that the leader of the party is under several different investigations really undercuts the Republican playbook for the upcoming election,” Belt said.\n\n\n\nEven so, Republicans argue that Biden’s newly vigorous campaigning mode is not a panacea for his party’s challenges either.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey note that the president’s approval ratings remain poor, even though they have ticked up a little from their lowest points.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the RealClearPolitics polling average, Biden’s approval stood at 42 percent, with roughly 55 percent of the public disapproving, on Thursday evening.\n\n\n\nBiden has enjoyed some big wins lately, particularly the passage of a huge bill addressing climate change, prescription drug costs and taxes, but other efforts — like his decision to wipe out up to $20,000 in student loan debt&nbsp;for some borrowers&nbsp;— are more politically divisive.\n\n\n\n“It doesn’t really serve Democrats well to have Biden out front and center,” said GOP strategist Ron Bonjean. “He has had some buoyancy in the polls but his numbers are still low. And look at the number of Democrats in contested races who are walking away from the student loans issue.”\n\n\n\nBiden, for his part, is clearly trying to link Trump, the GOP and the recent conservative tilt of the Supreme Court into one overarching narrative.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats’ standing has improved in the polls since the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in late June, and the abortion issue was vital to a Democratic victory in an Aug. 23 special House election in New York’s 19th District. There, Democrat Pat Ryan made abortion rights a centerpiece of his campaign and carried the district, a classic bellwether.\n\n\n\nIn Philadelphia, Biden asserted: “MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards. Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.”\n\n\n\nBelt, the George Washington University professor, noted that Biden had spoken out strongly against Trump and Trumpism at the start of this year, to&nbsp;mark&nbsp;the first anniversary of the Capitol riot. That didn’t noticeably help Democratic political fortunes.\n\n\n\nBut “what’s different this time is that Biden has the wind in his sails,” Belt said, “Right now, he is riding a wave of success. And that makes it a better time to take on former President Trump.”\n\n\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage.",

nearly 9 pm when the Ukrainian commander who calls himself “The Greek” brings our group to a makeshift workshop in the east of Ukraine, where soldiers are tinkering with improvised explosive devices.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe apparent head of the workshop, an engineer in his life before the war, welcomes us into a room that’s been repurposed from its original, civilian use – its exact description withheld for security purposes – but it looks distinctly like an arts and crafts center of death.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMaterials for mixing explosives and their components, grenades and fuses with English-language descriptions, are all neatly organized on book-shelves and in see-through plastic containers that one would find in a kitchen or classroom.\n\n\n\nThe engineer is keen to talk to Jonas Öhman, the founder of the Blue/Yellow nongovernmental organization that since 2014, has provided non-lethal support to Ukraine’s frontline troops —&nbsp; part of a volunteer force that has mushroomed since Russia’s invasion in February to keep Ukrainian forces fed, clothed, supplied and sane.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA reporter from The Hill traveled with Öhman, along with his colleague and driver, Gabrielius Merzinskis, over the course of three days – between August 19 and 21 – visiting with Ukrainian military commanders holding the frontline in the south and the east.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJonas Öhman (Photo Laura Kelly)\n\n\n\nDAY 1\n\n\n\n6:30 PM - Heading out from Mykolaiv\n\n\n\nThe summer sun slowly sets over the vast expanse of grain and sunflower fields while we drive out of Mykolaiv to a small village on Ukraine’s southeast. There are few cars on the road as most of the villages are abandoned, given the intensity of fighting.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMykolaiv, a mid-size city known for its port and shipbuilding industry, is a priority target for Russians, who’s missiles are sent to destroy the city nearly every day. \n\n\n\nWe pull into an abandoned petrol station – it’s unclear if the damage is from the war or neglect, or maybe it is neglected from the war – and meet our escort.\n\n\n\nAnatoly is a battalion commander who goes by the call sign “Chute,” an homage to his time in the paratroopers.&nbsp;Originally from the east, he’s an eight-year veteran of Russia’s war in the Donbas. His brigade was deployed to the area a few weeks earlier and he met us driving a truck provided by Blue/Yellow. Öhman is relieved to see the vehicle still in commission, when so many things are being destroyed under Russian fire.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe’re sitting in a cafe away from the frontline in the Kherson region, but the volley of artillery is audible. The line of contact is a few miles from our position. Anatoly explains that while the Russians are using their standard 122 and 152 mm artillery, the Ukrainians are answering with U.S.-provided M777 Howitzers and High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).\n\n\n\nAll the lights are off except for those behind the bar. There are a few other patrons sitting at tables, but almost no conversation. Our hour-long conversation is slow, to account for the translation, and what little light was streaming through the window quickly fades.\n\n\n\nAt one point someone’s ringtone blares, it’s completely incongruous with the atmosphere and is quickly shut off – the whole point is to be invisible to possible Russian attacks.\n\n\n\nAnatoly has agreed to speak with me about his experience at the front line as officials in Kyiv are pounding the drumbeat for a counteroffensive to retake Kherson – a strategic port city on the Dnipro river that fell in the first weeks of Russia’s invasion.\n\n\n\nAntaloly looks exhausted. He orders a tea. He has taken command of a battalion that includes a large number of recent military recruits, and their lack of experience is both worrisome and frustrating. Everyday, more soldiers are being wounded or killed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainians are making small advances, but the Russians forward artillery, while not accurate, is overwhelming in its stockpiles.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmerica and the west are providing “huge quantities” of weapons to Ukraine, but he appeals for “high-level, hi-tech support.”\n\n\n\n“What we are getting we’re very grateful for, it’s fantastic, obviously, but it helps to a certain level and we need to get beyond that level,” he says.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nÖhman’s group has provided Anatoly’s battalion a Matrice 300 drone – a highly sophisticated reconnaissance drone that Anatoly says they launch behind enemy lines. The UAV has a ticket price of over $10,000 and any loss is a defensive and financial hit. To combat Russian efforts to electronically disrupt its flight, the Ukrainians have rigged a low-tech solution, attaching fishing wire to the machine, to reel it back in case of a problem.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnatoly reels off a long list of additional materials needed to fight the war, and wants all of it to arrive faster.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“People are very motivated, if they get something, some new kind of weaponry, they basically go to YouTube, they teach themselves, and, I may say, in two, three days, most people can learn how to use them.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s late when we finish. Öhman and Merzinskis leave Anatoly with a box of 10 helmets before we part ways. We have a long and dangerous drive ahead of us to reach Dnipro.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n9:00 PM - The night drive&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMerzinskis is driving us in a German-made, covered pick-up truck, in which every available space is filled with donations to drop off at their warehouse in Dnipro.\n\n\n\nIf you ask Google Maps how to get to Dnipro, it will take you straight through Russian-controlled Kherson and the drive time is around seven hours.\n\n\n\nMerzinskis does not drive through Kherson, but manages to accomplish the drive in five hours. It is a grueling ride on deeply pock-marked backroads that requires intensive swerving to avoid the larger holes, and slowing down to ride over the more shallow ones.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, I managed to fall asleep, propped up by the donations piled around me. Öhman and Merzinskis wake me at around 2 am. We’ve arrived at our hotel in Dnipro.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDAY 2 &nbsp;\n\n\n\n12:00 pm - Dnipro into Donetsk\n\n\n\nMerzinskis has already unloaded the truck at Blue/Yellow’s warehouse – I’m relieved to have a little more space for what will end up being nine hours of travel later that night.\n\n\n\nÖhman gives me a tour of the warehouse. Stockpiles range from energy drinks to tactical optics, backpacks organized as all-in-one medical kits and mobile fuel tanks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe points out some souvenirs he’s received from grateful Ukrainian soldiers – Russian license plates, Soviet-era anti-tank missile launchers, and World War II-era helmets he said the Russians are outfitting soldiers with to fight on the frontlines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThose soldiers are likely Ukrainian teenagers from the Russian-occupied territories, rounded up en masse, forced conscripted and sent to the frontline without military training as gunfire fodder.\n\n\n\n4:00 pm - Heading out of Dnipro\n\n\n\nWe head out from Dnipro to start our night. The roads were better and military infrastructure more visible, in what has become a way-station for the frontline. We pass one rest area where a number of trucks are parked and soldiers are sitting and drinking from disposable coffee cups.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMy lunch that day consisted of a protein bar and some trail mix. Our dinner will come from a gas station on the way. Öhman keeps highly concentrated mineral water stocked in the warehouse. It tastes salty, but is supposed to be good for hydration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey’ll make at least three stops tonight – two for delivery handoffs and one visit to the IED workshop.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nÖhman has received rare permission from the Ukrainian Armed Forces (UAF) to travel after sunset, when the rest of the country is under a government-imposed curfew – meant to keep civilians inside, streetlamps off and the roads empty, limiting the targets the Russian’s can identify for missile strikes. We have a security detail guiding us through the roads.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s a good time to move around, but it’s also the time we have,” Öhman said.\n\n\n\n“If you work during the day, you are open to the threat of civilians documenting you and spreading information. Darkness is a natural cover,” he said.\n\n\n\n7:30 pm\n\n\n\nThe first hand-off occurs on the side of the road in a small village in the east. In the middle of a traffic circle sits a fake headstone for Putin, showing his date of death as Feb. 24, 2022 the day of invasion. Putin’s image is defaced with a mustache to resemble Hitler. A dirty mattress, toilet and broken washing machine are laid next to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Kelly/The Hill\n\n\n\nÖhman is meeting “The Greek,” who he describes as a long-time contact, and Dmytro \"Da Vinci\" Kotsyubaylo, a veteran fighter from Ukraine’s volunteer militias – called “dobrebat” – who was recognized in January by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky for the “Hero of Ukraine” award, one of the highest distinctions provided by the state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDa Vinci is a fighter from what’s been described as the ultra-nationalist Right Sector, one of the militias that make up Ukraine’s volunteer battalions. These dobrebat – some that originated with far-right ideologies – have assimilated into the military structure and officials in Kyiv credit them as indispensable to the state’s defense.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nÖhman hands over a few boxes of materials to The Greek and Da Vinci, including body armor, drones, batteries and some camping stoves and gas.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nÖhman shows Da Vinci Blue/Yellow’s EOTech Red Dot Sight – an optical rifle attachment that can provide night vision and thermal imaging optics on the battlefield.\n\n\n\nThe Greek expresses gratitude for U.S. military assistance, but wants a steadier flow of weapons, and more Puma Unmanned Aerial Systems – reconnaissance and surveillance drones – which have been delivered as part of the $13 billion in U.S. military assistance provided to Ukraine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s from here that The Greek wants to introduce us to the engineer at the makeshift IED workshop. We’re on a tight schedule but Öhman agrees.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen our group arrived at the workshop, about a dozen Ukrainian soldiers – many looking like they came directly from the frontline – shuffled out of the room after sitting through a “lesson” provided by the engineer on different ways to build, hide and deliver explosives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Any object can kill,” the engineer tells our group, while pointing out the different options available for making explosives. There are palm-sized bombs to be dropped from drones, with small pellets wrapped around it with masking tape. A 3-D printer is pumping out light-weight propellers to make it aerodynamic.\n\n\n\nWhat appears to be a recovered 152mm Russian artillery shell lies on its side against the wall, to be recycled by the engineer and turned back on the enemy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe engineer is looking to source electronic parts from Öhman that can be used for the explosives. Öhman is noncommittal. He uses these frontline meetings to establish rapport and personally vet the people and requests on his donations list.\n\n\n\n“This has taken a turn, they have boosted production,” Öhman says as we walk out of the building. “This is a major development in terms of IED capacity.”\n\n\n\n10:00 PM\n\n\n\nWe’re back on the road, driving to deliver to Ukrainian medics five medical stretchers at about $100 a pop. The stretchers are lightweight and compact and can be stored in any frontline military vehicle to allow for quick evacuation of injured soldiers, Öhman says.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDistant explosions periodically light up the pitch-black night during the two-hour drive, but the frontline appears far enough away to feel some sense of safety.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe drive through totally blacked out villages and along the more secluded roads that are obstructed with concrete road blocks and tank-busters – steel beams criss-crossed to obstruct the roadway. Merzinskis veers through this maze at high speed – both to account for the long drive and avoid potential Russian strikes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe pass over a bridge where all the street lights are off and pull into what appears to be a small city, but feels like a ghost-town, with buildings dark and lifeless.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe arrive at our rendezvous point near the Ukrainian-controlled village of Kramatorsk.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe remains of the destroyed School Number 23 are seen at dusk after a Russian attack that occurred in the second half of July, in Kramatorsk, Ukraine, Saturday, Aug. 27, 2022. (AP Photo/Leo Correa)\n\n\n\nIn the quiet moments while we wait, I look up to the sky and take a moment to appreciate the blanket of stars – only visible because life on the ground is plunged into darkness.\n\n\n\nThe medics arrive in their ambulance. Maxim, a first responder, introduces himself in broken English. He’s been in the war for nearly five months and explains that his ambulance — himself, a nurse and a driver — is one of five evacuation teams working on the frontline.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInside the ambulance, some children’s drawings offer a pop of life and color to the sanitized medical equipment. But Maxim also shows me photos on his cellphone of the ambulance covered in blood – pooled and spattered on the floor and walls.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We have many who need this,” he says, referring to the stretchers. “Many different situations can be in this war.” His team wants to put a portable stretcher in each Armored Personnel Carrier so that, if attacked by the Russians, it can help with evacuating the wounded.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis was Öhman’s first time meeting the medics, and he said it was important to do it face-to-face.\n\n\n\n“How we’re working, it’s a lot of personal relationships, and making personal connections,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDAY 3&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3:00 pm - Kharkiv to Kyiv\n\n\n\nWe arrived in Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second largest city, Sunday afternoon.\n\n\n\nThe morning had been surreal. After arriving at a different hotel in Dnipro around 1 a.m., I got a decent night’s sleep and in the morning, took stock of the German-Bavarian riverside vacation retreat where we had landed. Breakfast was served in the sunshine along the water in individual gazebos. It was like we were enjoying an all inclusive trip — and then we were back on the road.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe drive to Kharkiv was about three hours, and we’d spend only three hours in the city, which has fiercely resisted a Russian takeover, with the border roughly 30 miles away.\n\n\n\nIt feels cosmopolitan and somewhat lively despite the signs of Russia’s attacks. We pass a shopping mall with the glass windows blown out and shops boarded up after a rocket strike.\n\n\n\nÖhman directs us to an empty parking lot to hand over helmets to a Ukrainian brigade commander, who declines to be interviewed, but lets out a “Super!” when he sees the quality of helmets.\n\n\n\nHe invites us for lunch at a building serving as their headquarters. Baked catfish, cured meats, and traditional Ukrainian coleslaw salad are on the table. We’re served homemade Borscht, lard on toast with pickles, and rice and meat.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe conversation takes place largely in Russian and Ukrainian and I’m offered little translation, except for one anecdote from the commander. He describes speaking with an older woman in a recently liberated Ukrainian village in the south, who said Russian soldiers were incredulous at Ukrainians basic amenities, like a fence for their yard.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“‘Who gave you permission to live like this?’” the soldier asked the woman, per the commander’s telling, and he shakes his head.\n\n\n\nThe next stop was a repurposed office building that is the headquarters of the Freikops, a “dobrebat” but that coordinates closely with Ukrainian forces.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe building could house a tech startup, with graffiti art on the walls, an open floor plan and snooker and a pingpong table in the center of the room.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA few of the soldiers are on leave from the front for a week of rest and training. They sleep on stacked mattresses in the basement, with some curtains strewn up for privacy. Next to the sleeping quarters is the weapons arsenal – rifles with their call signs stacked in the corner.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLaura Kelly/The Hill\n\n\n\nMakar, the 26-year-old commander of the unit, shows off a stockpile of seized Russian weapons, including a Kalishnokov machine gun. Some of these weapons are being repurposed for use by the Ukrainians, but are largely trophies from the battlefield.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe visit was supposed to give me a chance to get a sense of the frontlines through those leading the fight, but Makar can say little about what the unit is doing operationally. He mentions that the morale of the soldiers is high, but they are also speaking with military psychologists to deal with post-traumatic stress from the battles.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6:00 pm\n\n\n\nWe begin the seven-hour drive to Kyiv, where I’ll leave Blue/Yellow. Around 10 pm, and about an hour outside of Kyiv, we drive over a brightly lit bridge. All the street lamps are on. It’s a jarring contrast to the darkness of the past few nights.&nbsp;",

        "description": "As Congress raced to pass long-stalled health, climate and tax legislation this summer, Democrats advanced the country's latest update to U.S. tax laws, giving the IRS $15 million to design a free \"e-file\" tax return system.\n\n\n\nHowever, over the course of several months working on the legislation, on no occasions were working Americans asked in hearings before the main tax writing and tax collection oversight committees in Congress to describe or comment on the personal administrative work of filing their yearly taxes.\n\n\n\nThat process usually consists of filling out different kinds of forms, using a piece of software or interacting with agents in the tax preparation industry. Instead of hearing from working taxpayers who file their own forms, the congressional panels heard from certified public accountants (CPAs), a business executive, a watchdog agency member and a “taxpayer experience” officer, among other specialists.\n\n\n\nIn one hearing in February, titled “Spotlighting IRS Customer Service Challenges,” the witnesses were an IRS officer, a director of strategic issues at the Government Accountability Office and the chair of the tax executive committee at the American Institute of CPAs — though no direct IRS customers.\n\n\n\nWhile members of the tax-related committees maintain they regularly hear from average taxpayers at constituent events back home, the hearings in the first half of 2022 were the latest example of working taxpayers almost never being asked to testify before the panels, which instead opt to hear from tax experts, business owners, advocates, lawyers and other types of analysts with a professional relation to the hugely complicated U.S. tax system.\n\n\n\nAn analysis by The Hill of 49 tax-focused public hearings of the House Ways and Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee held since the last major overhaul of the U.S. tax code in 2017 shows that on only two occasions — both relating to unusual tax relief measures following the coronavirus pandemic — were working Americans invited to hearings to share their experiences of U.S. tax policies directly with the lawmakers who write them.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, 207 experts in various official and professional roles within the U.S. tax system testified as witnesses in the 49 hearings analyzed by The Hill since the Trump administration’s Tax Cuts and Jobs Act was signed into law. Control of both the House and Senate changed hands between Democrats and Republicans during that period.\n\n\n\nBroken down by category, those experts comprised 57 public officials, 57 business executives or trade association representatives, 48 policy advocates, 18 legal experts, 12 academic policy experts and 15 specialists in other categories like union organizers and volunteer organization representatives.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of those hearings were specifically to get updates from officials on various government processes, such as when the IRS commissioner gives a progress report on the current tax filing season or when the Joint Committee on Taxation reports nonpartisan analysis of proposed legislation. Exempting hearings reserved for officials, the number of experts was 173.\n\n\n\nThe near-total emphasis on hearing from policy and legal experts, advocates and other specialists is not unique to the tax-related panels, and lawmakers often turn to those types of witnesses to help parse and explain the complicated U.S. tax code.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, the IRS’s Taxpayer Advocate Service wrote in a report that “the tax code is so complex that the IRS has difficulty administering it,” adding it “requires the significant majority of taxpayers to bear monetary costs to comply, as most taxpayers hire preparers and many other taxpayers purchase tax preparation software.”\n\n\n\nStill, longtime observers note that in the past tax committees more regularly consulted people who didn’t specialize in taxes for their personal views and experiences in how they paid their annual taxes to the government.\n\n\n\n“It used to be that they would do that,” said former tax reporter Howard Gleckman, now a policy analyst with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a Washington think tank. “But congressional hearings really serve two purposes. One of them is to actually elicit information for the record from experts, and the other is the dog-and-pony show. It’s to have a witness that’s going to express the view that the party agrees with, so they can say, ‘A normal person came and said the current state of law is terrible and we need to fix it and here’s why.’ ”\n\n\n\nGleckman added that \"these witnesses are generally very highly scripted, and there will be a lot of interaction between a committee staff and the witnesses about exactly what it is the witness is going to say, and it’s easier to do that with professional witnesses like lobbyists than it is to do it with real people.”\n\n\n\nSome committees have practiced trying to find real working people to testify on policy issues before their panels. In a March 17 hearing of the Senate Special Committee on Aging concerning banking and credit issues, Shelley Jaspering, a grocery store clerk with a disability, was invited to explain her financial situation to senators and how it related to various government policies.\n\n\n\n“I'm 44 years old and work part time as a pricing assistant at Wheatsfield Cooperative. I also love to sew and occasionally sell things at our local farmers market,” Jaspering testified. “I was hired full time at Wheatsfield, which also luckily gave me full-time benefits including an IRA and short-term disability insurance.”\n\n\n\n“The requirements of Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income, Social Security Disability Insurance, vocational rehabilitation and state programs are overwhelming. We need understandable information about how to manage our benefits and earnings. We need to locate trusted people that we can count on to walk us through the financial stages in life,” she told the committee.\n\n\n\nCongressional aides on the Ways and Means and the Senate Finance committees told The Hill that most of their members’ interactions with working Americans happen outside the committee chamber.\n\n\n\n“Hearings aren’t the only means by which we develop legislation, though they are important,” one House aide told The Hill in an email. “Members have constituent meetings all the time where they meet with regular folks, and district work necessitates meeting with local business owners.”\n\n\n\n“If you think about the amount of time any member of Congress spends in their district and talking to constituents about their taxes, you may actually reasonably conclude that we engage with regular people far more frequently on tax policy than we do with the Beltway policy set, and that the purpose of the hearings is to take the formal insight of formal experts,” the aide added.\n\n\n\nAn aide on the Senate Finance Committee, currently chaired by Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.), told The Hill in an email that the committee’s work on tax policy is entirely geared toward the interests of working families and that this is reflected in various hearings.\n\n\n\n“The Finance Committee under Chair Wyden’s leadership centers working families in all its efforts on tax policy. For example, hearings on incentives for clean energy manufacturing, the retirement crisis, the struggles of small businesses to comply with state tax laws, and the lack of affordable housing — just to name a few — all revolved around creating jobs and financial security for American families,” the aide said.\n\n\n\nSince tax policy affects 144 million U.S. taxpayers — covering a wide range of circumstances and income levels — trying to synthesize them into one or two representative witnesses offers a challenge many may view as impossible.\n\n\n\nStill, aggregating the voices of regular taxpayers before congressional committees is one of the jobs of the National Taxpayer Advocate (NTA), an office within the IRS that describes itself as “your voice at the IRS.” The NTA says that it can recommend \" ‘big picture’ or systemic changes at the IRS or in the tax laws.”\n\n\n\nBut the NTA has only testified before the Senate Finance and House Ways and Means committees four times in the years since the 2017 tax bill was passed, and only eight times before any congressional committee. The NTA did not respond to a request for comment on this story.\n\n\n\nSeveral hearings during that period have lacked mainstream voices, including an April 2021 hearing titled “Creating Opportunity Through a Fairer Tax System.” The hearing had six witnesses — two Beltway policy advocates who talk about taxes for a living, a scholar of accounting, a law professor and two business owners — but no one who works simply as an employee of a business unrelated to the tax field.\n\n\n\nAnother hearing of the Senate Finance Committee held in May 2019 on ways to pay for retirement plans had three witnesses from the lobbying and financial sectors and one state government official, though no current or prospective retirees.\n\n\n\nAnother in September 2017 titled “Individual Tax Reform” had two policy advocates from the same Washington think tank, a vice president of a trade group for real estate agents and a law professor, though no one was invited to speak on behalf of individual taxpayers.",

        "description": "Jerry Kill&#x27;s unexpected return to Minnesota with his rebuilding team was a predictably emotional night for New Mexico State&#x27;s new coach.After some apparent reconciliation with P.J. Fleck, Kill was given an up-close reminder that a Gophers program he never wanted to leave is still in pretty good shape.Mo Ibrahim rushed for 132 yards and two touchdowns for Minnesota in his seamless comeback from a season-ending injury in the opener a year ago, and Fleck and the Gophers overwhelmed the Aggies 38-0 on Thursday night to spoil a homecoming of sorts for Kill.“I guess I take it as a blessing that I got the opportunity to come back,” said Kill, who had a cordial pregame conversation with Fleck, his former assistant at Northern Illinois of whom he&#x27;d been critical in the past.Fleck and Kill shared an extended postgame handshake, too, after Minnesota outgained New Mexico State a whopping 485-91 in total yardage. Fleck said he approached Kill by thanking him for his impact on his career.“I appreciate Jerry’s passion, because I know how bad Jerry loves this place,” Fleck said. “The one thing I’ll say is, ‘So do I.’ I know how he feels, because I want to be here. It’s a very special place to me, and I couldn’t imagine not being here.”Ibrahim, who tore his Achilles in the loss to Ohio State last Sept. 2, started his sixth college season in style. He bounced off and bashed into the Aggies over 21 carries, extending his school-record streak of 100-plus yards to 10 straight games and moving into a tie with Marion Barber III for second place in Gophers history with 35 career touchdowns.The return of Kill was even more remarkable in Minnesota, where he inherited a bottomed-out program in 2011 and won the Big Ten Coach of the Year award in 2014 before epilepsy-related health problems forced him to retire midway through the 2015 season.“We gave everything we had and more,” Kill said. “I crashed and burned, and that&#x27;s my fault. But I&#x27;m very happy that Coach has taken it and continued to build and taken it to the next level.”The 61-year-old Kill didn&#x27;t wind up retiring, working in various capacities at five different schools before taking the job this season at independent New Mexico State through a connection with athletic director Mario Moccia. The Aggies, who will join Conference USA next year, were 2-10 last season and finished with only one winning record (2017) in the past 20 years.Kill once vowed to never again set foot on Minnesota&#x27;s campus after the firing of his defensive coordinator and successor as head coach, Tracy Claeys. Kill also ripped Fleck in a 2019 radio interview for what he felt was a disrespectful description of the state Kill and Claeys left the program in when Fleck brought in his distinctly different brand in 2017.Tanner Morgan, another one of the four sixth-year standouts who came back for one more college try with the Gophers after a 9-4 finish in 2021, had 174 yards on 13-for-19 passing and rushed for two touchdowns.Trey Potts, who like Ibrahim returned from a season-ending 2021 injury, had 17 carries for 89 yards and a score. Potts was seriously hurt at Purdue on Oct. 2 and spent six days in a hospital before being cleared to travel back to Minnesota. The Gophers never disclosed the nature of that injury.“It’s first and foremost a very important lesson for everybody to learn from those two guys about how to respond from two very adverse situations,” Morgan said.Diego Pavia, who threw three interceptions and lost a fumble in New Mexico State&#x27;s opening loss to Nevada, got another start and completed 2 of 5 passes for 10 yards.Freshman Gavin Frakes entered in the second quarter and finished 2 of 7 for 43 yards. He was intercepted in the end zone in the fourth quarter by Terell Smith, ending the only drive longer than 16 yards for the Aggies.Strange symmetryKill&#x27;s first home game with Minnesota on Sept. 10, 2011, was against none other than New Mexico State. The Aggies held on to beat the Gophers 28-21 in a finish marred by a frightening seizure Kill suffered on the sideline on a steamy afternoon with a kickoff temperature of 88 degrees.Minnesota won a rematch on the road in 2013 and beat New Mexico State again in 2018. That game and this one were scheduled in 2009 as a two-game contract that guaranteed a total of $1.05 million to the Aggies.The takeawayNew Mexico State: Unhappy about hitting the road for a Big Ten foe just five days after the first game, Kill told Moccia he only wants one payout game per season in the future. The Aggies also play at Wisconsin and Missouri this year. They ran only 33 plays, a single-game program record for the fewest against a Minnesota defense.Minnesota: The run-pass balance the Gophers are striving for behind the direction of offensive coordinator Kirk Ciarrocca, who returned after two seasons away, will have to wait another week. They ran the ball 57 times, including on 12 of 13 plays during a touchdown drive that took 12:58 off the clock into the second quarter.Up nextNew Mexico State plays at UTEP on Sept. 10.Minnesota hosts Western Illinois on Sept. 10.",

        "description": "Brandy Bottone has said she was not trying to make a political statement when she told Dallas deputies that her fetus counts as a living person.LM Otero/APBrandy Bottone, the Texas woman who said she had a right to the HOV lane because her fetus counted as a second passenger, is at it again. The 32-year-old from Plano was issued a second traffic citation in July for riding solo in a high-occupancy lane, Claire Crouch, a spokeswoman from the Dallas District Attorney&#x27;s office, told NPR. &quot;It was about a month after the first ticket that she was pulled over and ticketed again,&quot; Crouch said, adding that &quot;the current case is pending.&quot;Bottone&#x27;s initial story attracted international attention. After being questioned by Dallas County sheriff&#x27;s deputies for appearing to ride alone, Bottone pointed to her belly and told the officers, &quot;My baby girl is right here,&quot; she told the Dallas Morning News. By that logic, she said, she hadn&#x27;t violated the law, which requires at least two passengers in a vehicle in an HOV lane. At the time, she wasn&#x27;t &quot;trying to make a political statement,&quot; she said. But, when the deputies looked at her blankly, she felt a need to provide some context for them. Following the U.S. Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, and under Texas&#x27; abortion laws, all abortions are banned except in circumstances under which the birth would threaten the mother&#x27;s life. And under the state&#x27;s fetal homicide laws, a fetus is considered to be a person when determining whether a crime has been committed. &quot;Do you understand, with everything that&#x27;s going on, this is a baby and she&#x27;s 34 weeks,&quot; she told the deputies. A judge agreed with her, and the June ticket was dismissed. \nIt&#x27;s unclear if the second violation will also be tossed out. But it may be a while before Bottone can use it again. Crouch told NPR that, since this latest incident, Bottone has given birth.\nCopyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "The insurance firm Axa said it regretted that its crash test of a Tesla, in which the front half of the car burst into blames, caused confusion, and the company admitted that electric vehicles don&#x27;t catch fire any more often than combustion-engine automobiles.Screenshot by NPR/AGVS / UPSA - Auto Gewerbe Verband SchweizA global insurance company is taking heat for staging a battery fire during a crash test of a Tesla sedan. The insurance firm Axa was claiming to demonstrate how electric cars can quickly erupt into a dangerous blaze after an accident. But it wasn&#x27;t the Tesla&#x27;s battery that caught fire. In fact, Axa had removed the vehicle&#x27;s battery ahead of the late August demo, the Paris-based company later said. A video of the crash test posted by the Swiss Auto Trade Association shows a yellow Tesla hurtle toward an obstacle and then flip over, landing upside down on its roof. Moments later, a pop erupts from the engine and the front half of the car bursts into flames as the crowd in attendance claps. On Thursday, Axa Switzerland said in a statement that it regretted the crash test gave a &quot;false impression&quot; and created &quot;confusion.&quot;The company said it had to take steps to protect spectators during the demonstration of a battery-powered car going up in flames. The car&#x27;s battery was removed and the fire was put out &quot;under controlled conditions,&quot; the firm said.&quot;In addition, the Crash Test with a Tesla vehicle did not cause the type of damage to the undercarriage that would be likely to spark a battery fire as the images would appear to suggest,&quot; Axa added. The company admitted in a statement to the German website 24auto.de that it used pyrotechnics to ignite the fire. Axa, which conducts crash tests to raise issues of road safety, said its own data shows that electric vehicles don&#x27;t catch fire at a higher rate than combustion-engine automobiles. Axa Switzerland&#x27;s statement also noted its support for the electric car industry: &quot;We firmly believe that e-vehicles will play a key role in the automotive future. This is why we see it as important to take an in-depth look at electromobility and its safety.&quot;Experts estimate that electric cars may actually catch fire less often than their gasoline-fueled peers, but the fierce blazes can be harder to put out. Still, there is a risk that electric vehicle batteries can ignite, and several automakers have issued recalls in recent years over concerns that their batteries could catch fire. Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "People walk near Berlin&#x27;s Brandenburg Gate on the day a new law to save energy nationwide goes into effect on Thursday. The new law includes a wide variety of temporary measures, like banning the illumination of landmarks and regulating temperatures in public and private venues, to save electricity. These are a response to inflation and lower natural gas and other energy supplies from Russia.Carsten Koall/Getty ImagesThe annual gathering of France&#x27;s largest business association, Le Mouvement des Entreprises de France, had a different tone this year. As CEOs and executives hobnobbed at the grassy Longchamp Racecourse in Paris, their main concerns were no longer stubborn French unions or a left wing that rejects capitalism. The pressing matter on everyone&#x27;s minds was rising energy prices, and whether Europe will have enough gas to make it through the winter. &quot;If Russia completely turns off the spigot this winter, there won&#x27;t be enough gas in Europe,&quot; French Prime Minister Élisabeth Borne told the influential group this week. &quot;There is no immediate alternative source to plug that hole today.&quot; The French government says the only way to avoid a crisis is to substantially reduce energy consumption for the next six months. Every business will be required to have an &quot;energy sobriety&quot; plan in place to cut consumption by this fall. More details will likely be announced following President Emmanuel Macron&#x27;s emergency defense council meeting today to address the energy crisis. France is actually in better shape energy-wise than many other countries, says Pierre-Louis Brenac, an energy consultant with SIA Partners who advises utilities across the European Union, United Kingdom and Middle East. &quot;Some of our neighbors are way more exposed, like Germany and Italy,&quot; he says. &quot;For two reasons: Not only are they more exposed to Russian gas&quot; — he says, referring to how much of the fuel they import from the country — &quot;but they use much more gas in their energy mix than we do in France.&quot; France is protected in other ways. About 70% of its electricity needs are met through nuclear power. And the French consumer has been relatively well shielded from price hikes by the government. Energy prices for consumers were frozen last November. The government is now paying the difference. Brenac says the cost of this will eventually be borne by the taxpayer.Across the English Channel, the British government has taken a much more laissez-faire attitude. The U.K. energy regulator announced an 80% price hike coming in October. Dan Paskins, director of Save the Children UK, tells journalist Willem Marx in London that what&#x27;s happening is hurting poor people. &quot;The overall hit on family incomes is bigger than any in the U.K. since records began,&quot; he says.Part of the problem is the government is unwilling to make major spending decisions until a new Conservative leader, due to be announced next week, is put in place to replace outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson. While Germany has recently been able to reduce its dependency on Russian natural gas from 55% to 26% in the past year, according to Reuters, the price of gas has been rising fast. And German consumers are up in arms over a new gas levy they will have to pay starting in October. Gasoline prices at a gas station on Thursday in Berlin. With the end of a temporary reduction in the tax on fuel in Germany, motorists have to adjust to increasing gas prices, in some places rising to over 2 euros a liter ($2 for about a quarter of a U.S. gallon). The tax reduction was to help cut costs as Russia&#x27;s war in Ukraine continues.Adam Berry/Getty ImagesThe energy crisis presents another challenge for European solidarity. But after remaining united through seven sets of sanctions against Russia over its military aggression against Ukraine, there is a will to stick together through the energy crisis. The Czech Republic&#x27;s trade minister has said on Twitter that the EU is now in an &quot;energy war with Russia&quot; and it needs to take coordinated action to prevent further damage.Analyst Brenac says dividing Europe is one of Russian President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s goals in this war. &quot;Clearly we can see that Putin has been playing that card, trying to have European countries bickering between each other, to break their solidarity,&quot; he says. So far, unity seems to be holding. EU energy ministers and heads of state are set to meet in Brussels on Sept. 9 to further reinforce the bloc&#x27;s solidarity through coordinated energy policies and action plans. After all, today&#x27;s EU got its start in energy in the 1950s as the European Coal and Steel Community. European solidarity was on the lips of executives at the Paris business forum, which kicked off Monday with a keynote speaker from Ukraine. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed the crowd by video link-up from Kyiv. Zelenskyy said he understands this winter will not be comfortable, but he implored Europeans to stay together with Ukraine to win. &quot;Putin threatens us all with his war and his blackmail over food and energy,&quot; Zelenskyy said. He then invited French companies to come help rebuild Ukraine when the time comes. Luis Antunes, CEO of energy consulting firm Eco Pro, was listening raptly. &quot;Magnifique,&quot; he says of Zelenskyy&#x27;s speech, which he says touched on every key issue. Antunes says of course French businesses are worried about their bottom line with skyrocketing energy costs, but there are even higher stakes. &quot;Ukraine is committed to democracy, human rights and freedom,&quot; he says, and Europe must stand by it. \nAntunes says the Russian government&#x27;s brutal aggression in Ukraine and its authoritarian actions pose bigger threats to European companies than rising energy prices.\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

A new report from the National Science Foundation finds sexual harassment and assault are a major problem at remote facilities.Patrick Cullis/U.S. Antarctic Program photo LibraryOn her very first day in Antarctica, one woman was warned to avoid a certain building at the National Science Foundation&#x27;s McMurdo Station &quot;unless [she] wanted to be raped.&quot;Another was so &quot;freaked out&quot; by the pervasive sexual harassment that she began carrying around a hammer.Sexual assault and sexual harassment &quot;are a fact of life&quot; in Antarctica, another woman said, &quot;just like the fact that Antarctica is cold and the wind blows.&quot;  These are among the accounts published in a newly released report, commissioned by the National Science Foundation, that shows just how pervasive stories of harassment and assault are at the bottom of the world. And it comes to a damning conclusion about the agency&#x27;s operations in Antarctica: &quot;Sexual harassment, stalking, and sexual assault are ongoing, continuing problems.&quot; The report, which was presented to the NSF in June and publicly released last week, is based on more than 80 interviews with individuals and focus groups, along with a survey of 880 current and recent employees. Many of the report&#x27;s interviewees are anonymous.  &quot;It wasn&#x27;t surprising to me to hear some of the stories that we heard,&quot; said Roberta Marinelli, the director of the NSF&#x27;s Office of Polar Programs, in an interview with NPR. &quot;It&#x27;s certainly disappointing.&quot; Many employees view sexual harassment as a problem  The NSF oversees all American operations in Antarctica. Each year, more than 3,000 scientists, contractors and military personnel are sent to the continent for programs under NSF&#x27;s jurisdiction. About one in three of them are women. In the report&#x27;s survey, 72% of female respondents agreed that sexual harassment was a problem. Just under half agreed that sexual assault was a problem. (Among male employees responding to the survey, about half and a third, respectively, agreed that harassment and assault were problems.)&quot;Every woman I knew down there had an assault or harassment experience that had occurred on ice,&quot; one interviewee told the report&#x27;s authors. Although incidents involving female victims were &quot;much more frequent and severe,&quot; the report stated, several men also recounted experiencing sexual harassment by men and women.Officials at the NSF commissioned the report in April 2021 after years of individual reports of sexual harassment.A remote and difficult workplaceAntarctica is an unusually challenging environment for these kinds of allegations. Its remoteness often means people are unable to leave for weeks or months at a time. &quot;You&#x27;re so isolated and so detached from the normal roles in society that often it makes it, for lack of a better word, easier to get away with inappropriate behavior,&quot; said Meredith Nash, an Australian researcher who did not participate in the NSF report.&quot;When people are out doing deep field work, not only do they not have the capacity to report, because you can&#x27;t call someone or send an email or whatever – if you&#x27;re working with your harasser, you literally can&#x27;t get away from them,&quot; said Nash, who now serves as an associate dean of Diversity, Belonging, Inclusion and Equity at the Australian National University. Up until now, incidents have been reported as one-offs. In 2018, the name of a seven-mile-long glacier was changed after its namesake, the geologist David Marchant, was accused of sexually harassing female graduate students. He was later fired from his job at Boston University. In a statement at the time, he denied the allegations.In a separate incident, the NSF says it received a report of a rape at one of its facilities within the past five years. The agency says it &quot;promptly&quot; referred the allegation to the Department of Justice. The problems go well beyond scientists. Of the thousands of people working in Antarctica under the NSF each year, about 800 are researchers. The rest are support staff, including cooks, janitors and maintenance workers, many of them employed on seasonal contracts. Challenges of reformThroughout the report, respondents describe a pervasive environment of harassment and assault – and a workplace that is unfriendly to those who report incidents. &quot;People on station fear, and rightfully so, that if they are harassed or assaulted and report it, they will be the ones who will be going home,&quot; one person told the report&#x27;s authors. &quot;When things happened on ice, the number one thing I heard was &#x27;don&#x27;t report it or you will go home and be blacklisted from the program.&#x27;&quot;Particularly at risk were people who felt that their livelihoods could be at stake, like seasonal employees who depend on contract renewals, or Ph.D students who are reliant on lead researchers – a fact that officials acknowledged. &quot;The research shows us that even when we have the best sort of the best practice around reporting, the best possible sort of system, people still don&#x27;t report because the power dynamics are such that it&#x27;s not usually in the interest of the victim,&quot; Nash said.Changing the power dynamics at these remote bases will be challenging, officials acknowledged. The infrequent availability of flights and ships means there&#x27;s no simple way to separate victims from their harassers. And the numerous contractors and institutions that operate under NSF&#x27;s oversight each has its own human resources policies and procedures around assault and harassment. But officials at NSF say they are committed to reforming their operations.&quot;I don&#x27;t feel I have a choice but to do anything other than meet this challenge head on,&quot; said Marinelli. &quot;We have an obligation to provide a safe work environment, to provide workplace safety and workplace development opportunities for anyone who wants to come to Antarctica.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "Scott Taetsch-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Catch up on all the Mets prospects in yesterday’s minor league action! *All results from games played on Wednesday September 1, 2022\n\nTriple-A: Syracuse Mets (53-73)\n\nGAME ONE: METS 4, WILKES-BARRE 1 / 7 (BOX)\nThe Mets played two today, due to a makeup game from August 30th. They won game one with relative ease, despite going down 1-0 in the third. A Daniel Palka double tied it in the fourth, a Dom Smith single gave them a 2-1 lead in the fifth, and sixth inning singles by Goskue Katoh and Michael Perez made it the 4-1 lead that would last the rest of the game.\n\nCF Travis Jankowski: 2-4\nRF Jake Mangum: 0-3, BB\n1B Dominic Smith: 2-4, R, RBI, K\n3B Mark Vientos: 1-4, K\nDH Daniel Palka: 1-3, R, 2B, RBI, BB\nSS Yolmer Sanchez: 0-3, BB, 2 K\nLF Nick Plummer: 1-3, 2B, 2 K\nLF Khalil Lee: 0-0\n2B Gosuke Katoh: 2-3, 2 R, RBI\nC Michael Perez: 1-3, RBI, K\nRHP Harol Gonzalez: 4.1 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 2 BB, 4 K\nLHP Sam Clay: 1.2 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 3 K, W (3-2)\nRHP Bryce Montes de Oca: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 1 K, S (8)\n\nGAME TWO : WILKES-BARRE 3, SYRACUSE 2 / 10 (BOX)\nGame two, which served as the makeup from the 30th, went worse than game one, as evidenced by the loss. They swapped runs in the third, with Dom Smith driving in a run in both ends of the double header. That 1-1 score would hold until the eighth, when Khalil Lee would smoke a double to make it 2-1. The RailrRiders would tie it in the bottom of the frame, and after a scoreless ninth, walk off the Mets in the 10th.\n\nCF Travis Jankowski: 1-5, R, 2B, 3 K\nRF Jake Mangum: 1-5, K\nDH Dominic Smith: 1-5, R, RBI, K\n1B Daniel Palka: 0-5, 2 K\nSS JT Riddle: 1-5, 2 K\nLF Khalil Lee: 2-3, 2B, RBI, BB, SB (12)\n2B Gosuke Katoh: 1-1, 3 BB\nC Nick Meyer: 0-4, K\n3B Branden Fryman: 1-4, 2B, 3 K, E (1)\nRHP Jordan Yamamoto: 4.0 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 0 BB, 3 K\nLHP Nate Fisher: 3.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K\nRHP R.J.

The right-hander threw a single inning (following a rough David Griffin performance as the starter), striking out the side on 19 pitches (11 strikes). The Mets bullpen can absolutely use his services if he’s healthy, and this was a good showing.\nAs for the rest of the game, Somerset dropped four runs on ten hits off starter David Griffin, and the Rumble Ponies could not come back from that.\n\n2B Wyatt Young: 2-3, R, 3B, 2 BB, K, SB (3)\nDH Carlos Cortes: 1-5, RBI, K\nSS Ronny Mauricio: 0-4, R, BB, 2 K\n3B Luke Ritter: 2-4, R, K, E (14)\nCF Brandon McIlwain: 1-2, 2B, 2 BB\nRF Rowdey Jordan: 0-2, RBI, BB, K\nC Hayden Senger: 0-4, RBI, 2 K\n1B Jeremy Vasquez: 0-4, K\nLF Zach Ashford: 0-4, 2 K\nRHP David Griffin: 5.0 IP, 10 H, 4 R, 4 ER, 0 BB, 4 K, L (1-6)\n\nREHAB ALERT: RHP Tylor Megill: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 3 K\nRHP Hunter Parsons: 1.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 1 K\nRHP Joe Zanghi: 1.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 0 K\nRHP Manuel Alvarez: 1.0 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K\n\n\nHigh-A: Brooklyn Cyclones (34-22/64-59)\n\nBROOKLYN 9, WILMINGTON 1 (BOX)\nBrooklyn continued their strong second half performance with an absolute drubbing of Wilmington. The Brooklyn pitching staff tossed eight shutout innings, led by a 7 inning, three hit performance by Luis Moreno. Daniel Juarez was the only one to surrender a run, allowing an RBI force out in the ninth.\nOffensively they were carried by JT Schwartz, Jose Mena, Jaylen Palmer and Matt O’Neill, with the quartet going 11-16 with six RBI and seven runs scored.\n\nLF Matt Rudick: 0-4, BB\n3B William Lugo: 1-3, RBI, BB, 2 K, E (2)\n1B JT Schwartz: 3-5, 2B, 2 RBI, E (9)\n2B Jose Peroza: 1-5, K\nRF Stanley Consuegra: 0-4, R, BB, 2 K\nDH Jose Mena: 4-4, 2 R, 2 2B\nSS Shervyen Newton: 0-4, R, RBI\nCF Jaylen Palmer: 2-4, 2 R, 2B, 3B, RBI, K\nC Matt O’Neill: 2-3, 3 R, 3 RBI, BB\nRHP Luis Moreno: 7.0 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 6 K, W (3-7)\nRHP Daison Acosta: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K\nLHP Daniel Juarez: 1.0 IP, 1 H, 1 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 1 K, 1 WP\n\n\nSingle-A: St. Lucie Mets (28-27/69-52)\n\nST. LUCIE 7, JUPITER 5 (BOX)\nThis game was a roller coaster of emotions for our St. Lucie Mets, who have had an uneven second half after a dominant first.\nThey ran out to a 5-0 lead by the fourth inning. with Junior Tillien, D’Andre Smith, Vincent Perozo, and Raul Beracierta all driving in runs. Douglas Orellana and Kolby Kubichek gave those runs back in the fifth and sixth innings, as the Hammerheads tied it up at five, a score that held until the ninth.\nThe ninth started with two quick outs, and extra innings looked immanent. Brad Malm was having none of it, walking to keep the inning alive. Omar De Los Santos, who wanted to go home, took a 3-2 pitch over the left field fence to secure the walk off win.  \n\nCF Omar De Los Santos: 1-4, R, HR, 2 RBI, BB\nC Kevin Parada: 0-2, R, 2 BB, K\nSS Junior Tilien: 1-3, R, 3B, RBI, BB\n2B D’Andre Smith: 0-3, RBI, K\nRF Carlos Dominguez: 0-3, R, 2 K, E\nLF Raul Beracierta: 2-4, R, 2B, RBI\nDH Eduardo Salazar: 0-3, BB, 3 K\n1B Vincent Perozo: 2-4, R, HR, 2 RBI, K\n3B Brad Malm: 0-3, R, BB, K\nP Javier Atencio: 4.0 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 3 K\nP Douglas Orellana: 1.0 IP, 2 H, 3 R, 2 ER, 2 BB, 2 K\nP Kolby Kubichek: 3.0 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 2 BB, 3 K\nP Joshua Cornielly: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 1 K\n\n\nComplex: FCL Mets (33-22)\n\nNO GAME (SEASON OVER)\nStar of the Night\nJose Mena\nGoat of the Night\nDavid Griffin",

        "description": "Bo Jackson made his brief, but still triumphant, return from a hip injury on this day, 31 years ago. | Richard Lautens/Toronto Star via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Roberto and Bo make extraordinary comebacks 1918\nIn a season-ending doubleheader (the 1918 season ended early because of World War I) at Detroit, Buck Weaver rapped out eight hits in 10 at-bats. The Sox would lose the games, 11-5 and 7-3. Weaver went 5-for-5 in the first game and 3-for-5 in the second. He had two doubles among his eight hits.\nThe 1918 team finished 57-67, a 189-point drop in winning percentage from the best team in White Sox history (then, and remains), the 1917 club. The team was never more than five games better than .500, and beyond a World Series hangover suffered key injuries to or WWI absences from Red Faber, Reb Russell, Lefty Williams, Joe Jackson, Happy Felsch and Fred McMullin.\n\n1937\nIn a game at Comiskey Park, White Sox third baseman Lou “Boze” Berger and outfielder Mike Kreevich led off the Sox half of the first with back-to-back home runs. It was the first time that ever happened in team history. The Sox beat Boston, 4-2.\n\n1970\nIt was one of the key dates in franchise history, as Roland Hemond was hired as player personnel director to rebuild the franchise. The club ended up losing a team-record 106 games in 1970. However, in the very next year, the White Sox would improve by 23 games, from 56 to 79 wins, and by 1972 would be a legitimate title contender. Hemond would eventually ascend to GM and stay with the team through 1985. Also coming along as new field manager was Chuck Tanner, who’d be named Manager of the Year in 1972.\n\n1991\nIt was a miracle game for two White Sox. Roberto Hernandez, then a starter, held the Royals hitless for six innings just three months after undergoing transplant surgery that took  a vein from his leg and moved it to his arm. He would throw 93 pitches and get through seven innings of one-hit, one-run ball. He made just two more starts in 1991 (and his career), and this effort remains his sole game started and won.\nMeanwhile Bo Jackson made his first start with the White Sox, hitting sixth in the order at designated hitter. After starting the game 0-for-3, Bo’s final at-bat was a sacrifice fly. Jackson had suffered a debilitating hip injury while playing in the NFL, and would see action in just 23 games in 1991, hitting .225 with three homers and 14 RBIs. In the offseason he would undergo hip replacement surgery and sit out all of 1992 working with White Sox training staff for a triumphant return in 1993.\n\n1995\nTim Raines had his American League record of 40 consecutive steals snapped when he was thrown out in the third inning vs. Toronto. Randy Knorr was the catcher who gunned him down, in Chicago’s 10-4 win.",

        "description": "Happy birthday, Jason Hammel | Photo by Jon Durr/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A thrice-weekly digest, replete with #Cubs, #MLB, and #MiLB factoids, gathered from reputable sources. This one has a bit of everything. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue is pleased to present a light-hearted, Cubs-centric look at baseball’s colorful past, with plenty of the lore and various narratives to follow as they unfold over the course of time. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow along. We also include Cubs’ player birthdays and a bit of world history, for context.\nToday in baseball history:\n\n\n1880 - Using three towers illuminating light 100 feet above the playing field, teams from the department stores of Jordan Marsh and R.H. White stage the first night game in history. The Boston Post reports the next day that “A clear, pure, white light was produced, very strong and yet very pleasant to the sight” by the twelve carbon-arc electric lamps. (1,2)\n\n1920 - Shaken by the possible effects of the scandal surrounding baseball, club owners begin a series of meetings to reform the game. Albert D. Lasker, a Chicago advertising man and minority stockholder, of the Cubs, proposes a three-man board of non-baseball men, with the chairman to be paid $25,000 year. Among the names mentioned: Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis, former president William Howard Taft, General George Pershing, Senator Hiram Johnson, General Leonard Wood, and ex-treasury secretary William McAdoo. (2)\n\n1929 - The Cubs beat the Cards twice, 11-7 and 12-10, before 81,000 fans at Wrigley Field. A crowd of 38,000 sees the morning game and 43,000 watch the afternoon game. Rogers Hornsby has two home runs and Hack Wilson has one. (2)\n\n1965 - The Cubs beat St. Louis, 5-3, at Wrigley Field, as Ernie Banks hits his 400th home run, a three-run shot off Curt Simmons in the third. Simmons teed up the 400th home run of Willie Mays in 1963. Banks will end the season with 28 home runs and 106 RBI. Ron Santo and Billy Williams will also knock in over 100 runs, the only team with three such sluggers, but the Cubs will finish eighth. (1,2)\n\n1972 - Milt Pappas of the Cubs hurls a no-hit game in beating the Padres, 8-0. Pappas has a perfect game until pinch-hitter Larry Stahl walks with two outs in the ninth inning. Pappas and C Randy Hundley both say of the pitches to Stahl, “They were so close I don’t know how Stahl could take them, but they were balls.” Pappas later comments on the plate umpire: “he had a chance to become famous as the umpire in the twelfth perfect game in history, but he blew it.” Pappas retires former Cub Garry Jestadt to finish the game. (2)\n\n1998 - Sammy Sosa hits home run #56 as the Cubs defeat the Reds, 4-2.\n\n2002 - The Cubs beat the Brewers, 17-4, to salvage a split in their doubleheader after Milwaukee takes the opener by a score of 4-2 on solo homers by Ron Belliard (2), Eric Young and Jose Hernandez. Glendon Rusch wins his eighth straight over the Cubs. Chicago P Kerry Wood ties a major-league record in the second game by fanning four Brewers in the 4th inning. Wood also homers off Andrew Lorraine, one of five gophers he serves up. Another is Sammy Sosa’s 494th homer, moving him ahead of Lou Gehrig on the all-time list. (2)\n\nCubs birthdays: Al Spalding HOF, Len Rice, Gordon Massa, Jason Hammel*, \nToday in world history:\n\n\n1666 - Great Fire of London begins at 2am in Pudding Lane, 80% of London is destroyed.\n\n1752 - Last Julian calendar day in Great Britain and British colonies including America. To sync to the Gregorian calendar, 11 days are skipped and the next date is Sep 14.\n\n1901 - Theodore Roosevelt advises “Speak softly &amp; carry a big stick”.\n\nCommon sources:\n\n(1) — Today in Baseball History.\n(2) — Baseball Reference.\n\n(3) — Society for American Baseball Research.\n(4) — Baseball Hall of Fame.\n(5) — This Day in Chicago Cubs history.\n\nFor world history.\n\n*pictured.\nThere is a very active baseball history community and there are many facets to their views. We strive for clarity. Please be aware that we are trying to make the historical record as represented by our main sources coherent and as accurate as is possible. No item is posted here without corroboration. Some of these items spread from site to site without being verified. That is exactly why we ask for reputable sources, so that we can address them to the originators.\nAlso please remember that this is supposed to be fun.",

        "description": "Hats off to you, Kyle Bradish. | Scott Galvin-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Birds won back-to-back series against two first-place clubs, throwing five quality starts. This team is for real, folks. Good morning, Camden Chatters.\nTell me. Are there any non-believers still out there?\nIt’s September, and the 2022 Orioles just keep winning games. This team isn’t a fluke. They’re not getting lucky. They’re actually, really, legitimately good.\nAre they good enough to make the postseason? There’s one month left to answer that question. The Birds, after yesterday’s win, are 1.5 games behind the Blue Jays for the third and final wild card spot—and they’ve got 10 more games against Toronto this month. So the O’s can certainly take their fate into their own hands.\nIn the meantime, they just keep impressing. Yesterday the O’s shut out the Guardians for the second straight game, 3-0, to clinch a series win. Tyler Young recapped all the impressive action. The Birds, faced with a six-game road trip against two first-place teams in Houston and Cleveland — a brutal trek that could have broken them — instead passed with flying colors, going 4-2 and winning both series. O’s starting pitchers were unbelievable, throwing quality starts in five of their six games, bookended by Kyle Bradish throwing eight shutout innings to start the road trip and seven scoreless to end it. Throw in the splashy arrival of Gunnar Henderson, and everything is coming up Orioles right now.\nWell, maybe not everything. The offense could still use a jolt, averaging just over two runs per game on the road trip. Perhaps a return to Camden Yards for a weekend set against the Athletics, the worst team in the AL, will help. (No trap series, please.) Then comes the Orioles’ four-game, three-day showdown against the Blue Jays starting on Labor Day, a battle that could shake up the postseason race.\nLook at this. It’s September and we’re using “Orioles” and “postseason race” in the same sentence. What a strange, delightful trip it’s been.\nLinks\nWhy Are the Orioles’ Playoff Odds So Low? | FanGraphs BaseballYou might have noticed that FanGraphs’ playoff projections for the Orioles are consistently lower than other outlets. Ben Clemens explains why that’s the case, and it’s more complicated than \"bEcAuSe wE hATe tHe oRioLeS.\"\nHyde on Mateo, Henderson, Aguilar, Mountcastle, Hall, home games and more - BlogBrandon Hyde discussed a number of Orioles players and how they’ll fit into the mix down the stretch. I would’ve liked to see him mention Kyle Stowers, who seems to have vanished into the ether.\nFor Lefty Cade Povich, Trade To Orioles ‘A Reset Mentally’ - PressBoxOrioles prospect Cade Povich says he’s trying to model his curveball after Clayton Kershaw’s. It’s good to dream big, I suppose.\nOrioles’ Rodriguez has healthy rehab start at Aberdeen - BaltimoreBaseball.comNot sure why Grayson looks terrified in this picture, but the Orioles’ #1 pitching prospect is back on the mound and feeling good.\nOrioles birthdays and history\nIs today your birthday? Happy birthday! A whopping seven players in Orioles history were born on this day. The only one to play in the last 35 years was right-hander Jason Hammel, a surprise ace on that delightful 2012 O’s playoff team. Hammel turns the big 4-0 today. I’ll be joining you in that club in eight days, Jason.\nOther Sept. 2 birthday Orioles include catcher Dave Criscione (71), right-handers Nate Snell (70) and John Flinn (68), utility man Rex Hudler (62), and the late outfielders Drungo Hazewood (b. 1959, d. 2013) and “Marvelous” Marv Throneberry (b. 1933, d. 1994).\nThe Orioles are on a bit of a Sept. 2 losing streak, losing their last four games on this date after winning the previous six. That last victory came in 2016, an 8-0 shutout of the Yankees at Camden Yards that brought the Birds within three games of the AL East lead. Dylan Bundy (5.2 IP) combined with three relievers on the shutout, while Mark Trumbo, Chris Davis, Manny Machado, and Pedro Alvarez all homered. Alvarez’s blast was his 20th, giving the Orioles six players with 20+ homers: Trumbo, Davis, Machado, Alvarez, Adam Jones, and Jonathan Schoop.\nThe O’s also beat the Yankees on this date in 2012, this time in New York. Mark Reynolds, who absolutely torched the Yanks that September, swatted two home runs to lead an 8-3 comeback win. In that game, Yankees manager Joe Girardi made four pitching changes in the top of the eighth inning, including three relievers who faced just one batter each. So if you’re wondering why MLB instituted the three-batter-minimum rule, look no further than Girardi.\nAnd on this day in 2015, the O’s walked off the Rays, 7-6. After Jonathan Schoop tied the game in the ninth with a dramatic two-run homer, Chris Davis played the hero in the 11th with a mammoth game-ending blast to straightaway center, his second of the game. The win snapped an O’s six-game losing streak.",

Could this double-whammy possibly live up to the hype?‘This is going to be one of the most legendary nights in comedy history!” raves the compere. But we’ll be the judges of that. You’ve got to pick through much myth-making to get to the meat of this rare Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle double whammy. But maybe the hype is justified. These are arguably the two greatest US standups of their generation, and both are hot-topical too, if not always for lovely reasons. Rock got walloped at the Oscars live on TV; Chappelle’s routines about trans people prompted a hundreds-strong staff walkout at Netflix. With background noise that loud, and the claims of their numerous hype men ringing in our ears, can the pair’s comedy possibly make itself heard?It can – particularly Rock’s, with the caveat that much of it is rehashed from his recent Ego Death tour. He’s stronger here than in that solo show, with some of the lesser, domestic material culled and a tighter focus on his antic comedy and often nuanced thinking about socio-politics. His race material runs provokingly counter to current pieties, as he considers Meghan Markle’s naivety and, in a routine fruitfully developed since the spring, the Kardashians “loving black people more than black people love themselves”. A riff on dating post-#MeToo culminates in a very effective sketch demonstrating that “all sex looks bad in court”. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Michael Sheen gives a richly textured performance as he brings Lyra Belacqua’s magical world to lifeLa Belle Sauvage, the first volume in the Book of Dust trilogy – Philip Pullman’s prequel to the His Dark Materials series – begins with plucky 11-year-old Malcolm Polstead learning of the existence of six-month-old Lyra Belacqua, whose future as a thorn in the side of the church’s oppressive ruling body, the Magisterium, is foretold. The product of an affair between Mrs Coulter and Lord Asriel, Lyra has been left in the care of the nuns at an Oxford priory where Malcolm sporadically helps out with the cooking. When a flood overtakes the Thames Valley, Malcolm becomes Lyra’s protector, bundling her into his cherishedcanoe which he has named, La Belle Sauvage.The actor Michael Sheen is our narrator, delivering a perfectly paced, richly textured performance as he takes on a dizzyingly large cast of characters. Along with our questing protagonist, Malcolm, and his teenage accomplice, Alice, there is also gentle Sister Fenella; the booming Lord Asriel; and the villainous Gerard Bonneville, former agent of the Magisterium. Sheen’s rendering of Bonneville’s daemon, a vicious three-legged hyena, is deliciously chilling. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The Slain Birds by Michael Longley; The Hurting Kind by Ada Limón; Faust by Sandeep Parmar; Radical Normalisation by Celia SorhaindoThe Slain Birds by Michael Longley (Jonathan Cape, £12)Birds are some of poetry’s most intimate and mysterious companions: think of the owl of Athena in The Odyssey, the albatross in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner or Ted Hughes’s philosophical crows. The Slain Birds opens with a tawny owl killed by a motorist, later found by Longley’s granddaughters, who make “sketches in charcoal” and hug the feathers. Using ornithology as a guide, Longley’s exhilarating songbook offers a risk assessment of our world under threat, while longing for a future for the next generation. Longley’s Midas touch never turns flora and fauna into gold, but makes foraged memories shimmer. His occasional poems capture transient places, people and events, but also a “soul-space” or “a state of mind”, as when he calls up “Otter-sightings, elvers, leverets, poetry, / The Owenadornaun’s five syllables”. Many syllables are devoted to birds in the book – the blackbird, cuckoo, flycatcher, eagle, godwit, house martin, nightingale, quail, raven, snipe and wren, to name just a few. This is counterbalanced by poignant homages to Homer, Edward Thomas, Ivor Gurney, Schubert, Mussorgsky and the great ornithologist David Cabot. The Slain Birds is a book of quietude and disquiet in Longley’s prolific repertoire, as the poet observes that “Silence that has lasted a thousand years / Is poetry of a kind”.The Hurting Kind by Ada Limón (Corsair, £12.99)Like Longley, the US poet laureate Ada Limón is committed “to call things as they are”, believing in poetry’s resuscitative power when the name of a bird or tree is summoned. By far Limón’s most self- and world-examining book, The Hurting Kind captures the hidden, marginal forces of kindness and suffering around us. Whether it’s a groundhog stealing garden tomatoes, a belted kingfisher perching “on a transmission wire” or the fig buttercup invading the porch, Limón’s poems put non-human subjects centre stage without rendering the humans irrelevant. Instead, we’re asked “To be made whole / by being not a witness, / but witnessed”. This is not Keats’s negative capability but a poetry of full participation, of “searching for proof”. The effect is a set of astoundingly moving poems in which the self becomes an inclusive vehicle for bridging the hurting gaps between generations, ideas and living things. Limón has Elizabeth Bishop’s gift for difficult questions well disguised, and her lines ring truth not like a gong, but like the sound of wind flowing through leaves, as when the poet says “I’m wearing / my heart on my leaves” and asks “Love ends. But what if it doesn’t?” If you only read one book this autumn, make it this one. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Large numbers of workers from different sectors protest against inflation and in favor of higher wages in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on Aug. 17, where inflation has soared.Pablo Barrera/Anadolu Agency via Getty ImagesThe U.S. dollar strengthened to a 20-year high against a collection of foreign currencies this week, spelling more trouble for heavily indebted smaller nations around the world. The stronger dollar makes payments on loans owed in U.S. currency more expensive. This comes as some lower-income countries face mounting economic problems and others — including Sri Lanka, Lebanon and Zambia — have already defaulted on their international debts.Last week, Argentina slapped sweeping new restrictions on imports of everything from whiskey to software to consulting services to try to contain inflation that&#x27;s running at over 70 percent. The South American nation has been hemorrhaging foreign currency and the strengthening U.S. dollar threatens to make that worse. In July, the value of the Argentine peso fell to a record low against the dollar on the black market.Francesc Balcells, who manages emerging market debt at the Dubai-based Frontier Investment Management Partners, says U.S. interest rate hikes like we are seeing often spawn disaster for lower-income countries.&quot;If you look at the history of emerging markets from the Latin American debt crisis in the 1980s, the Mexican peso crisis in 1994, to the different Argentine defaults, to the Brazilian crisis in the early 2000,&quot; Balcells ticks through a list of the most recent emerging market meltdowns, including the Asian financial crisis in the late &#x27;90s. &quot;All of those periods always coincide with periods of interest rate hikes in the U.S.&quot;Not only do poorer countries have larger debts in U.S. currency, now they are having to pay even more for imports bought in dollars as the currency strengthens. And this time around, global prices for fuel and food were already surging, due to currency fluctuations and significant supply shortfalls caused by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.One of three ports on the Danube River on the border between Ukraine and Romania in May. These three ports are the only Ukrainian-run ports still operating in the country. The Russian invasion mainly halted exports shipped from Ukraine, until a U.N.-brokered deal to ship grain and other food items this summer.Claire Harbage/NPR&quot;Not to overuse the term, but it&#x27;s been pretty much a perfect storm for emerging markets,&quot; Balcells says of the current situation.According to the business news service Bloomberg, the number of emerging market borrowers that have debt trading at distressed levels has doubled over the last six months. The pandemic played a hand in that, as many governments took on additional debt to subsidize idled workers and keep social services functioning.An investment analysis by Barclays Corporate and Investment Bank called the second quarter of 2022 an &quot;unmitigated disaster&quot; for the global economy and warned that the third quarter is &quot;shaping up to be the summer of discontent.&quot;Balcells says many of the larger middle-income countries can weather that storm. But others are getting battered. For instance, in May, Sri Lanka had a political and economic meltdown and was unable to pay its foreign debts. The default makes it nearly impossible for Sri Lanka to buy food and fuel on international markets.Other nations facing financial distress are spread around the world, including El Salvador, Pakistan and Ghana. In Nigeria, the largest economy in Africa, inflation has hit a 20-year high driven almost entirely by skyrocketing food prices.&quot;Right now, the world is experiencing the worst food security crisis any of us have ever seen,&quot; says U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield. Speaking at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs in late August, Thomas-Greenfield said much of the current global food crisis is driven by the Russian invasion of Ukraine.She notes that before the war, Russia and Ukraine accounted for almost a quarter of global grain exports. The disruption to those grain supplies, she says, is doing more than just leaving people hungry.A Ukrainian resident of Moschun walks through the remains of his home in Moschun, a Kyiv suburb, in April.Claire Harbage/NPR&quot;Food security is directly linked to economic growth,&quot; she said. &quot;And it matters because food insecurity leads us to political and social instability. And that endangers us all.&quot;The big question is how much instability the current global economic downturn will produce.Increases in food prices hit poorer nations and households harder than wealthier ones, because spending on food consumes a larger portion of their budgets. For instance, the International Monetary Fund estimates that food makes up 40 percent of the consumer price index in sub-Saharan Africa while accounting for less than 20 percent of the index in advanced economies.Customers line up to buy fresh peppers at the Mile 12 food market in Lagos, Nigeria, on July 7. Soaring inflation could push 15 million more Nigerians into extreme poverty by the end of this year, the World Bank says.Damilola Onafuwa/Bloomberg via Getty ImagesBalcells, with Frontier Investment Management Partners, thinks the worst economic pain from the current economic downturn will be in smaller, highly indebted emerging market economies. He includes Ecuador, Ghana, Zambia and El Salvador on that list. Two larger nations — Pakistan and Turkey — are also at risk, he says. The IMF this week approved a billion dollar bailout to support Pakistan&#x27;s floundering economy.Another thing making 2022 different from global economic crises of the past is the role of China as a major lender. A significant portion of the debt now owed by low and middle-income countries is owed to Beijing.&quot;In terms of foreign debt, China is the elephant in the room,&quot; says Vasuki Shastry, an associate fellow with the global think tank Chatham House.Unlike global debt crises of the 1980s, the lending side of the equation is now significantly different. There are now billions of dollars owed to China. Much of that debt has come as part of China&#x27;s ambitious Belt and Road infrastructure program. The issue, Shastry says, is a lack of transparency around much of the lending by China. Some of it is labeled as commercial debt rather than sovereign debt even though it&#x27;s owed to state-owned Chinese companies.And negotiating debt relief with Beijing is novel territory not just for individual countries but for the broader international community. Traditionally, the IMF and the so-called Paris Club of wealthy nations play a significant role in restructuring distressed debt. But so far Beijing has preferred to deal with its borrowers on its own.&quot;China is essentially signaling that there are two tracks in terms of global debt negotiations,&quot; Shastry says. &quot;One track is led by the OECD [the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development], which includes the U.S. and Europe, the traditional Paris Club. And China wants to be part of a separate track, where it alone wants to determine how it wants to deal with countries facing debt distress.&quot;Another forum for emerging markets to hash out debt relief has been the Group of 20. But given that Russia is a member of the G-20, it&#x27;s been nearly impossible since the February invasion of Ukraine to get the group&#x27;s finance ministers to agree on a unified response to the growing global economic troubles.A Ukrainian reconnaissance team trains near Mykolaiv in May.Claire Harbage/NPR\nParticularly if the war in Ukraine drags on, Shastry says the current global economic conditions are going to lead to &quot;a lot of pain&quot; in low and middle-income countries. He predicts that that pain is going to be even worse and could drag out even longer this time because of a lack of global cooperation to address it.\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "Upgraded COVID-19 vaccines are on the way. On Wednesday, the Food and Drug Administration approved new, reformulated versions of the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines. University of Minnesota infectious disease specialist Michael OsterholmCourtesy of the University of MinnesotaMichael Osterholm, an epidemiologist and director of Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota, joins MPR News host Cathy Wurzer to share what that means for our immunity against new and future strains of the virus.The following is a transcript of the conversation edited for clarity. Listen to the full conversation using the audio player above.How do these reformulated vaccines work?Well, they actually work the same way as the vaccines that were used up until now, except for the fact that they include specific changes to the spike protein — that material that we try to develop the antibodies against, which will then prevent that virus from actually entering our cells. And now it is reformulated to include the mutations that we have seen with this virus’ ba.4, ba.5 mutation. So it&#x27;s exactly the same vaccine, with the exception of accounting for that.These vaccines have been tested in mice. And as you know, the director of the CDC says waiting for more human trial data could lead to an outdated vaccine at a time when we&#x27;re at risk of a fall surge. Some in the medical community of question that approach suggests that folks wait for more data. Where are you on this?Well, let me cut through the fog of vaccines right now. Because I think this has really been an unfortunate situation where the public is being whipsawed back and forth. The most important message that anyone can take away from this interview is just the need to get vaccinated, regardless of which vaccine you get. The data are clear and compelling now that if you are vaccinated, and with at least two boosters, meaning four doses in total, you have a significantly lower risk of serious illness, hospitalizations and deaths. And so that&#x27;s the most important thing. I think the prediction that we&#x27;re going to have a surge potentially this fall is not based on any meaningful data. As you know, I&#x27;ve been talking about all along the inability for us to actually predict what&#x27;s going to happen with this virus. So I would be worried about this moment, and that something this fall. And we&#x27;re still seeing in this country, 500 deaths a day due to COVID. It makes it the number four cause of death overall. And so the most important messages stay current. The second thing is this vaccine is coming out is safe. It&#x27;s no different than the other vaccines that we&#x27;ve had to use to date. The challenge is, is it going to work better? Is it going to really stop the infections more effectively than the previous vaccines? And I think that is open to question. So to me, it&#x27;s if I have a choice right now, I&#x27;ll take either vaccine as long as I get a vaccine to keep myself currently vaccinated. Another challenge to the resources for a vaccine rollout this fall are not what they were even last year?We have a perfect storm in the world of vaccines that I&#x27;ve not seen in my almost 48 years in the business. First of all, we&#x27;ve surely got the situation now we have two different vaccines for the purposes of COVID. And by two I don&#x27;t mean to Pfizer and Moderna. I mean, you have the previous U.S. vaccine, which is the one you have to use if you&#x27;re starting somebody for the first time in being vaccinated — because they&#x27;re a higher dosage vaccine than the boosters we have now. So we&#x27;ve got to keep both those vaccines separate. And you&#x27;re right about rolling out a campaign. We&#x27;re in the middle of trying to vaccinate for monkeypox with this intradermal method. That type of administration is much more complicated. We&#x27;ve got polio challenges right now in this country, where we have many pockets of under-vaccinated people. We&#x27;re now concerned polio virus is spreading right here in the state of Minnesota, only 23 percent of young Somali children are vaccinated against polio. Then on top of it rolling out a vaccine for the flu season. You know, if we if the Southern Hemisphere was any indication of what might happen here during their winter through March, April in May in Australia, they had one of their worst flu seasons they&#x27;ve had in many years. This is also something we&#x27;re trying to do right now here in Minnesota draw a flu vaccine. All of these vaccines are challenging us tremendously, trying to get them all done and there are no resources, the feds have not provided additional new resources. So health care providers in the state and local health departments are trying to get the vaccinations done with no new support whatsoever.What do you suggest folks do? Contact their doctor? Just try to get vaccine as quickly as possible, especially when this COVID booster is out? What&#x27;s the timing of that for most folks?You will be able to get the new vaccine dose as early as next week. If you want to get it you should get it just like you’ve gotten your previous vaccines. At clinics and contacting local and state public health agencies for what they&#x27;re doing to provide vaccines. The most important message — again — is get it. If it&#x27;s been at least four months since you&#x27;ve been vaccinated before, you need it right now. With the new vaccine, you can get it as early as two months after the last dose, I think waiting a little bit longer is better. We have a significant amount of activity right now in Minnesota right here. I know of more friends, colleagues and acquaintances that are infected with this virus now than at any time I&#x27;ve known since the pandemic began. So now is the time to get it. Don&#x27;t wait. Again, this could be what can keep you out of the hospital can keep you from becoming seriously ill and keep you from dying.When we were talking back in July, you told me that COVID is one of these situations where the public is done with it, but the virus is not done with us. I know you&#x27;ve said that a number of different times. I&#x27;m wondering, has the public&#x27;s lax behavior around the virus heighten the need for better vaccines in this particular case?We clearly need better vaccines, however, I guess the real question is, “what does better mean?” I think the vaccine that we have coming may have a slight advantage over the one we had previously. But we really need are completely different vaccines that ultimately will stop you from getting infected. That means you don&#x27;t transmit the virus and surely then keeps you from becoming seriously ill. Right now we don&#x27;t have those. These vaccines are powerful tools and keeping people from getting seriously ill or dying. But we clearly need new and better vaccines. Our group happens to be leading an international effort to come up with a roadmap for these new, better vaccines. But they&#x27;re not forthcoming now. They&#x27;re there, they&#x27;re at least several years off at the earliest. So in the meantime, we&#x27;re gonna have to learn how to live with this virus in this kind of boosting situations. But as I&#x27;ve also said to you, we cannot boost our way out of this pandemic. Only 26 percent of Americans 65 years of age and older have had all their boosters to booster doses. Why? Why can&#x27;t we get the remainder vaccinated? Because that&#x27;s one of the most important reasons why we continue to see these 500 deaths a day are people who are just not vaccinated.Are you still wearing a mask? A well-fitted mask?I absolutely do. I&#x27;d say actually not just well fitted, I wear an N95 respirator. I&#x27;m fully vaccinated. And when I&#x27;m in public settings, I do that.  When in private settings, when we entertain a few people for dinner, we test for several days a day, before they come no one who has symptoms, including even sniffles can come. And so far we&#x27;re managing the pandemic to that regard it can be done. But it surely means that you can&#x27;t just ignore the virus. It&#x27;s here, and it is taking a toll.Before you go, by the way, you mentioned that you&#x27;re not sure about a fall surge?Yeah, anybody that predicts what&#x27;s happening with COVID, more than three to five weeks out, probably also has a bridge to sell, so be careful. And I keep hearing my colleagues say this, but as you know, you&#x27;ve been following us over the months that we&#x27;ve been involved with this pandemic. How many times have people made predictions for which it didn&#x27;t come true?A famous one that was made … this past spring that we&#x27;re going to see another major summer hit in the southern sunbelt states, and everyone get ready. Never happened. As near as you may recall, I suggested we don&#x27;t know that would happen and it didn&#x27;t. So I think we have to be very careful with this virus. We just don&#x27;t know what the next shoe to drop is.Listen to the full conversation using the audio player above.",

        "description": "Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Despite an awful month, it’s time to pick your best Marlins player from August! August was a really difficult month for Marlins fans. The offense was a thousand miles from being decent, the whole team took 20 losses—their highest total since August 2019 (22)—and only eight wins were added to their record in the eighth month of the year. The Marlins averaged an abysmal 2.2 runs per game. Nonetheless, we are going to vote for the best performer in August among four candidates (unsurprisingly all pitchers).\nAs usual, we have chosen four names who performed the best for the Marlins over the past month based on statistical production and signature moments. The polls are open here on fishstripes.com and on our Twitter account (@fishstripes). The leading vote-getter will be recognized in the site’s awards section.\nYour options for August, in alphabetical order...\n\nFinalists\nRHP Sandy Alcántara (August: 2.72 ERA, 1.13 WHIP, 29 K in 36.1 IP)\n\n\n\n\n\nAlcántara has been the Marlin of the Month for the past three months thanks to his memorable season which makes him the frontrunner for the NL Cy Young award. In August, Sandy threw two complete games—more than 28 of the 30 MLB teams in August—with one of them being a shutout. Alcántara’s ERA would have been 1.38 had not been for his ugly August 21 outing against the Dodgers (6 ER over 3.2 IP). Even though the Marlins averaged 2.8 runs in Sandy’s August starts, he managed to win thrice.\nRHP Edward Cabrera (August: 1.91 ERA, 0.92 WHIP, 33 K in 28.1 IP)\n\n\n\n\n\nCabrera led all Marlins pitchers (at least five starts) in ERA throughout August. He only allowed 13 hits and held opponents to a .137 batting average. But here’s the best part: Cabrera’s six earned runs came on his last start (Sunday against Dodgers). Before that one, he had thrown 22 2⁄3 shutout innings with eight hits allowed and 28 strikeouts. Cabrera’s August performance went a long way toward establishing him as a worthy member of the rotation for 2023.\nLHP Jesús Luzardo (August: 2.97 ERA, 0.94 WHIP, 32 K in 36.1 IP)\n\n\n\n\n\nIn what’s been a difficult year plagued by injuries, Luzardo has shown what he can do on the mound when healthy. Despite not throwing since May 10, Luzardo made his comeback in August and looked pretty solid for the Fish. He finished the month with three consecutive quality starts. His WHIP and his opponent batting average (.189) tell us even more about Luzardo’s return to form.\nLHP Steven Okert (August: 0.93 ERA, 0.83 WHIP, 11 K in 9.2 IP)\nOkert kept going as one of the Marlins best relievers in 2022 with a strong performance in August. He began the month allowing his lone run across 11 appearances. Then, he went 8 2⁄3 scoreless innings of five hits, one walk, and 10 punchouts. Even better, his opponents posted a weak .161/.188/.194/.381 slash line since August 5.\nHere are your options. Time to vote!\n\n\nHonorable Mentions\n\nCharles Leblanc—led the team in hits with 20.\nTommy Nance—had a 0.87 ERA across 10 1⁄3 innings with 12 strikeouts.",

        "title": "What If Joan of Arc Wasn’t a Woman?",
        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/09/joan-of-arc-nonbinary-globe/671321/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "Does it matter if Joan of Arc was not a woman? “Our new play I, Joan shows Joan as a legendary leader who uses the pronouns ‘they/them,’” announced Shakespeare’s Globe theater in London on August 11. “We are not the first to present Joan in this way, and we will not be the last.”That strange tone—half punk, half defensive—is more explicable in light of the backlash that followed. Many British feminists immediately objected that, yet again, well-meaning revisionists had deemed a historical figure too compelling to be a woman. “One of the consequences of the recent insistence that gender identity is more significant than biological sex has been the recasting of those who fail to meet the stereotypical standards of cis womanhood as trans or non-binary,” wrote Victoria Smith in The Critic, pointing to the author George Eliot, the Civil War soldier Jennie Hodgers, and the ancient Egyptian queen Hatshepsut, as well as Little Women’s Jo and The Famous Five’s George. “Whenever you find an interesting woman—or even just a woman called George—you should always consider the possibility she’s a man.”Indeed, in I, Joan’s climactic scene, where Joan refuses to give up wearing men’s clothes, they give a rousing speech that concludes: “I am not a woman. I am a fucking warrior.” Excuse me? I spent my 20s arguing with stuffy conservative men who thought that women were unsuited to serving in the military. Does the bleeding edge of progressivism now agree with those dinosaurs?The feminist argument against I, Joan’s gender politics is that nonbinary identities are an act of individual liberation that pushes the rest of us back into rigid pink and blue boxes. A few special rebels escape the stereotypes that everyone else is assumed to embrace. The response to this, from the nonbinary people I’ve spoken with, is that they/them pronouns simply feel like a better fit. The words fall on them, as Philip Larkin once wrote about jazz, “as they say love should, like an enormous yes.”The fight over I, Joan was so bitter because everyone wants a piece of Joan of Arc. Suffragettes in England adopted her; so did their sisters in Ireland, who also saw Joan as a symbol of anti-colonial resistance. She inspired antislavery campaigners in America, but also Jean-Marie Le Pen’s hard-right French nationalists.Today’s feminists want to claim her, arguing that very few women in history led an army. So do trans activists, who argue that very few people in history cross-dressed so openly, and suffered for it so obviously. “I’m always hungry for historical queer representation,” the play’s author, Charlie Josephine (who is nonbinary) told The Guardian earlier this week. “Because our history has been erased—particularly transgender people’s—there is very limited documentation of us throughout history, even though we have existed since the beginning of time.” The exact reasons for Joan having “her hair cropped short and round in the fashion of young men”—as the transcript of her trial put it—are therefore important, even if they are ultimately unknowable.Going back to contemporary accounts doesn’t help, because these are conflicting: Joan is the only person burned at the stake who was canonized later, and her rehabilitation started within years of her execution. “Joan was using male apparel to appear sexless, rather than male,” writes her biographer Marina Warner in the introduction to The Trial of Joan of Arc. “She was not in disguise—everyone knew she was Joan la Pucelle, the magic virgin.” But the Bible forbade cross-dressing, and the Church elders refused to let Joan take Communion in breeches: “The men’s clothes she wore,” Warner writes, “became the burden of no less than five of the seventy articles in the charges of condemnation at the end of the trial.” Not long after, though, Joan’s body, desexed by both its appearance and Joan’s virginity, became central to her veneration. She had rejected the messy female body, and its association with sexual desire, childbirth, and breastfeeding. She was pure.When the Globe announced I, Joan, the American right, sensing a culture-war opportunity, piled on too. “The fact that Joan of Arc was an actual woman is the whole point and what makes her story heroic and significant,” tweeted The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh. “But then again, shoe-horning ‘non-binary’ characters into historical stories will always be clumsy and stupid because ‘non-binary’ didn’t exist until 14 seconds ago.”In one sense, Walsh is right. The word nonbinary is new, as is the shorthand, enby, even if the concept is not. Those who identify as nonbinary are more likely to be under 29, urban, and white. A study by Pew Research found that people under 30 are three times more likely than the general U.S. population to report being transgender or nonbinary (pollsters treat the two categories as overlapping, as do many in the LGBTQ community). Last year, the 30-year-old singer Demi Lovato moved to they/them pronouns, because that choice “best represents the fluidity I feel in my gender expression.” But in early August, Lovato issued an update, explaining: “Recently, I’ve been feeling more feminine, and so I’ve adopted she/her again.” This is not how I understand gender: that your level of femininity goes up and down like the level in a gas tank, and you pick the pronouns to match.Making Joan of Arc nonbinary is a legitimate artistic choice; asking questions about that decision is a legitimate critical choice. I am grateful to the Globe for staging this production—which I saw at the start of its preview period, before the production was finalized—and bringing this feminist conversation out from social-media silos and into the open. That’s exactly what a theater should do. All art is subjective: Josephine’s idea of Joan is no less valid than mine. We cannot possibly know what gender identity Joan of Arc would claim in today’s world—we’d have to explain the internet, the dishwasher, and Keeping Up With the Kardashians to her first. In 50 years, the prevailing categories might change again, and nonbinary may seem as outdated to future generations as hermaphrodite, invert, and molly do now.The Globe’s statement argued, convincingly, that “theatres do not deal with ‘historical reality’ … We have had entire storms take place on stage, the sinking of ships, twins who look nothing alike being believable, and even a Queen of the fairies falling in love with a donkey.” However, this invocation of artistic license cannot extend to the production’s program, in which the academic Kit Heyam cheerfully claimed both Elizabeth I and the ninth-century English ruler Æthelflæd for Team Enby because the Tudor queen referred to herself—or “themself,” according to the essay—as a “prince,” and contemporary chroniclers describe Æthelflæd as “conducting … Armies, as if she had changed her sex.” Heyam claimed that “to take on a male-coded military role was, in some sense, for Æthelflæd to become male.”Until recently, the consensus was that when medieval historians claimed it was unnatural for a woman to be brave or ambitious, the right response was: How sad that the past was so imprisoned by stereotypes. Not: Hmm, well, maybe they weren’t women.A similar confusion was evident in the production’s content warning, displayed on notices outside the auditorium: This performance contains strong language, use of prop weaponry, violence, partial nudity, sexual references and misgendering. I was briefly confused: Would this be the bad kind of misgendering, which gets you banned from Twitter? Or the good kind of misgendering, when you arbitrarily reallocate historical figures to new categories based on stereotypes?To understand how I, Joan came about, you need to know that the modern Globe was opened in 1997 as both a theater and a living museum. It is a replica of the theater in which William Shakespeare’s first actors played, and it stands in almost the same spot, on London’s South Bank, near the great dirty artery of the Thames. In aesthetic terms, its politics are conservative: Its previous artistic director, Emma Rice, departed over her desire to use artificial light and amplified sound, among other issues. In Globe productions, for an authentic Elizabethan experience, the actors are not miked. But the world moves on: Instead of shouting over the cacophony of hot-gospellers and bear baiters, they now have to bellow over the noise of planes flying overhead.In ideological terms, however, the Globe’s politics are ultraprogressive. In 2019, it staged a well-reviewed production of Richard II, cast entirely with women of color, as well as a new commission titled Emilia, which suggested that Shakespeare’s talent was nothing compared with that of his lover, a Black woman poet called Emilia Bassano. “Times are finally changing,” reads the marketing material. “Not fast enough. It’s up to you. We are all Emilia.”[From the June 2019 issue: Was Shakespeare a woman?]Reclamation is probably the single biggest trend in modern theater (and it’s pretty popular in film and television too). The emphasis is on “unheard stories” and “marginalized voices,” unearthing lost characters from underrepresented groups and putting them at center stage. That has run parallel to the practice of recasting white, male roles—which have always dominated theater—with actors from diverse backgrounds: Fiona Shaw played Richard II in 1995, Glenda Jackson played King Lear in 2016, and just before the pandemic, Ruth Negga played Hamlet in New York. We have this trend to thank for the Broadway super-mega-blockbuster Hamilton, which recasts America’s Founding Fathers as people of color. Broadening the talent pool by cross-gender and cross-race casting has made theater more exciting. At last, actors who are not white men are getting the roles that they deserve.I too had always instinctively approved of the reclamation project, until I read Dava Sobel’s The Glass Universe, a book about the women astronomers of the 19th century, which was careful to note that its subjects were not ignored or forgotten. They were respected at the time, and valued for their skills, even if they did also face sexism. It is self-flattery to reflexively portray ourselves as rescuing them from obscurity and adversity. I had a similar thought in 2015, when a British newspaper asserted that the Star Wars actor John Boyega, the son of immigrants from Nigeria, had grown up on “tough streets” in crime-riddled South London. Boyega responded by tweeting: “Inaccurate. Stereotypical. NOT my story.” The desire to impose a struggle narrative on the experiences of women or people of color can sometimes be its own straitjacket. In the wrong hands, it can patronize the past and sound smug about the present.Which brings me back to I, Joan. This is not a subtle play. It begins with the young lead actor Isobel Thom (who is nonbinary) walking onstage in a T-shirt that reads: PRIDE BEGAN WITH AN UPRISING. Thom’s first words are: “Trans people are sacred.” At the performance I saw, the audience applauded at this line, and I had the answer to my most pressing question: How would I, Joan deal with its lead character’s overt religiosity? The historical Joan claimed that her visions came from God. Her inquisitors (and Shakespeare, in Henry VI, Part I) thought that they were demonic and accused her of being a witch.Instead of making Joan into a secular character, Josephine, the playwright, has leaned into the religiosity, making transness interchangeable with godliness. “We are the divine,” says Joan. Later in the play, Joan cannot see the trap that has been laid for them because people keep calling them “madam.” Joan’s god-given superpower is an acute ability to sense danger, but being misgendered is their kryptonite.The unfortunate side effect of claiming divinity for the nonbinary is to depict everyone else as somehow lesser, a mere cis muggle. The dauphin, later king, is a posh man-child, bored and feckless. His male courtiers are starchy and pompous. His wife’s sole distinguishing characteristic is being pregnant. Her mother is a Hillary Clinton–esque girlboss who delivers dialogue like: “Isn’t it true, in this world of men, if you want something done, you hire a woman?” She then snaps open her fan. The audience whooped.Joan doesn’t fit into this world. After the shy, lowborn courtier Thomas tells them that they cannot lead the army—“No offense, but you’re a girl”—they take a sword and cut off their mullet, strip to their boxers and chest binder, and put on a blue boilersuit. Is Joan going to lead the French army or fix its drains? Luckily, it’s the former, and they successfully break the siege of Orléans.The ecstasy of battle delivers a revelation: “I hate this body I’m in … People think I’m a girl … I’m not.” Then, as if the playwright remembered that this might sound sexist, Joan quickly adds: “I love girls! I actually think I’m in love with girls … Girls are great. Nothing wrong with being a girl! Except if you’re not one.” In the middle of this defensive paragraph, surely written to fend off critics like me, Josephine does offer one beautiful metaphor, which I imagine will resonate with many people who feel uneasy with their body. Joan’s gender identity makes them a walking “civil war”—the bitterest kind—caught between a body and mind in conflict.After Orléans, a few more battles follow, and Joan comes out to dependable Thomas: “I’m wordless, and it’s lonely, not having language.” When French soldiers turn up to ask if “she” is ready, Thomas replies: “They will be soon.” The crowd went “aww,” and the soldiers onstage accepted the update instantly. (Given their annoyance with the English occupation of Paris, they’d probably be up for a land acknowledgment or two as well.)In the second half, of course, it all goes wrong. The newly crowned king is jealous of Joan’s popularity and annoyed by their stubbornness. His queen and her mother try to get Joan to put on a pink dress and marry a nice man, and Joan’s ingratitude prompts the mother-in-law to say, in exasperation, “You’re too much.” Joan replies: “Maybe you’re not enough.”You can tell I’m getting old because my sympathies were largely with the queen’s mother here, trying to fill a power vacuum while delicately tiptoeing around her idiot son-in-law. Maybe this is at the core of the generational divide over gender? Punk—that desire to burn down the system, screw the pigs, smash it all up, and start again—is a young person’s game. When you get older, you make all kinds of grubby compromises in exchange for the English army not starving you out of your castle. The play works best when it gestures toward Joan’s youth, reminding us that they are a teenager. This is an underexplored part of the story: The closest thing the modern world has to a Joan of Arc is Greta Thunberg, an unearthly child sent to condemn the corrupt adult world.That this play is at the Globe, the home of Shakespeare, only underscores that it is not in the Shakespearean tradition. The great English playwright is still revered today because he drove the possibilities of drama forward, creating characters with psychological depth and ambiguity. I, Joan is part of an older tradition, the medieval morality play. These pitted virtues and vices against one another for the soul of the protagonist: Greed and Sloth raged against Chastity and Patience. In I, Joan, that conflict has given way to one between Cisnormativity and Authenticity. I, Joan’s supporting characters exist not as people but as conduits for the moral lesson being delivered to the audience. “I hope you’re all watching so this shit don’t happen again,” Joan cries out in the second half. Soon after, Joan asserts that the “hardest pronoun to use is we,” which sounds like something Meghan Markle would say on a podcast.That takes us to the climax, with Joan on trial, complaining about being put in a men’s prison before launching into a passionate denunciation of the clerical court and society at large. “Man tricked woman into hating trans,” Joan says, which again shows how ultraprogressive beliefs can shade into reactionary ones. Do women not have agency? Can’t they be bigots of their own volition? “The women are angry,” Joan continues, “about pronouns and toilets and Twitter and all the wrong things.” Well, Imma let you finish, but a major plot point not one hour ago was about you changing your pronouns, Joan. Also, yes, this woman is angry about toilets, having stood in line for the ladies’ during the intermission while the men breezed past into the urinals. (I’ll concede the point about Twitter being awful.)Thom, in their debut professional role, commands the stage as Joan, and the direction is fast-paced and fluid, but the play’s tendency toward cheap laughs and agitprop overshadows moments with the potential to be intensely moving. After the trial, Joan recants their gender identity—“I’m a girl; I’m a girl”—thereby winning a brief reprieve from execution. But Joan cannot live a lie, and when returned to jail they once again cut their hair and put on overalls. Death is preferable to disguise.Staged the right way, this could be as chilling as John Proctor’s famous speech in The Crucible as he finds himself unable to sign the document confessing to witchcraft: “Because it is my name! Because I cannot have another in my life! … How may I live without my name? I have given you my soul; leave me my name!” The most recent Crucible I watched had a female actor playing Proctor. It struck me that this speech could help the rest of us understand why trans people come out, despite the violence and rejection they face: because they want their name, their true name, to be recognized. How can someone live without their name? (Incidentally, The Crucible became the best dramatic interrogation of McCarthyism in postwar America by transposing its action to 17th-century Massachusetts; I suspect the best interrogation of modern identity politics will also come from an oblique angle.)I wish I could have found The Crucible’s emotional depth, and empathy, in I, Joan. My sadness here is that Josephine and gender-critical feminists share a political goal, that of female liberation. Many of us, no matter our identities, can relate to Josephine’s admission that they had always wanted to play Mercutio, the flamboyant trickster, in Romeo and Juliet: “I’ve never really felt like I’m a ‘Juliet’ (whatever that means?) and always wondered why the lads get the best parts.”The real Joan of Arc was part of this pattern. She dared to take on the traditionally masculine role of soldier and commander. In her day, everyone wondered: Was she holy—a saint, a sacred being, a vessel of enlightenment—or merely a woman? Four centuries later, the Globe is asking the same question.",

        "description": "Scores, news, and notes, from around the Detroit Tigers’ farm system for Thursday, September 1, 2022. Rochester Red Wings 17, Toledo Mud Hens 0 (box)\nNot a whole lot to say about this one. Austin Bergner got clobbered right out of the gate and knocked out of the game in the first inning. Things didn’t improve from there. The scoring was relentless, and the Hens were down 10-0 after the sixth inning. Zac Houston then completely melted down in a five-run relief appearance, while catcher Chris Rabago allowed a pair of runs in mop-up duty. \nCameron: 1-2, 2 BB\nLipcius: 1-4, 2B, SO\nComing Up Next: RHP Bryan Garcia (1-3, 3.42 ERA) gets the ball on Friday night as the Hens look to erase this one from the memory banks.\nErie SeaWolves 3, Bowie Baysox 2 (box)\nReese Olson was absolutely filthy in this one as Erie turned the tide after back-to-back losses to win on Thursday. \nThe young right-hander struggled in June and July after a strong start, but as his fastball command has started to improve, the month of August went much better. Hopefully he’s set for a strong finish, and he certainly looked it on Thursday, striking out nine Baysox. Olson allowed a solo shot in the first, yes, it was that damned Connor Norby again, and another run in the second, but really locked it down to eventually go six innings of two-run ball.\nGage Workman got the run back in the bottom of the first with a solo shot of his own, making it three straight games with a homer. Parker Meadows then walked, and Dane Myers launched a two-run shot, his 23rd on the year, to make it 3-1. Myers isn’t really a prospect, but it’s been somewhat gratifying to see it come together for him as a hitter after the Tigers spent a few seasons tinkering with him as a pitcher. The power has been impressive even if the approach remains rudimentary. \n\n\nGage Workman is on fire   He ties the game with his 14th home run of the year, and extends his hitting streak to 11 games. @Greg_Gania on the call. pic.twitter.com/xCusN9MvJW— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nBoth pitching staffs dialed it in after the second inning, and the SeaWolves only managed three hits on the night while striking out 13 times. They made those three hits count, and the SeaWolves bullpen was solid in holding the lead.\nWorkman: 1-4, R, RBI, HR, SO\nMyers: 1-3, R, 2 RBI, HR, SO\nOlson (W, 7-6): 6.0 IP, 2 ER, 3 H, BB, 9 SO\nComing Up Next: First pitch is set for 6:05 p.m. EDT on Friday night. No starters are announced yet.\n\nWest Michigan Whitecaps 5, Fort Wayne TinCaps 2 (box)\nThe Whitecaps made it three in a row behind a strong outing from Keider Montero and big contributors from most of the prospects in the lineup.\nMontero scattered three hits while blanking the TinCaps for five innings. He struck out four and didn’t allow a walk, enjoying being staked to an early lead.\nIn the top of the first, Danny Serretti singled and Jake Holton walked with one out. Jace Jung struck out, but singles from Josh Crouch and Izaac Pacheco made it 2-0 Whitecaps and they never looked back. Serretti singled home Ben Malgeri in the fourth. Eduardo Valencia launched a solo shot in the sixth. Jace Jung doubled and later scored on a wild pitch in the seventh. Chavez Fernander allowed a pair of runs in the eighth as the TinCaps finally broke through, but that was as close as they’d get. \n\n\n3-for-3 for Danny Serretti with this RBI single    3-0 West Michigan. pic.twitter.com/QQID3XcQUc— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nIzaac Pacheco lashes a single to center to score Jake Holton (BB) and make it 2-0 @wmwhitecaps pic.twitter.com/tQMzR4L6vQ— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nIt was a peculiar night for Jace Jung in particular. Not only did he score from second a wild pitch, he also managed to crack his bat fouling off a pitch in the first inning, and got his hand pinched in the crack. That’s a new one. He still managed to double twice in the contest anyway. \n\n\nBefore the @wmwhitecaps scored twice something strange happened to Jace Jung. Not exactly sure, but it appears he broke his bat on a foul ball and then got his hand pinched between pieces of wood. pic.twitter.com/K9PMAr7X1X— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nJace Jung scores from all the way from second base on the wild pitch. pic.twitter.com/NcPbApJbQA— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nSerretti: 3-5, R, RBI, CS\nJung: 2-5, R, 2 2B, 3 SO\nCrouch: 2-4, RBI\nMontero (W, 7-7): 5.0 IP, 0 ER, 3 H, 4 SO\nComing Up Next: RHP Dylan Smith (7-6, 4.42 ERA) is looking to get back on track after a midseason injury. He’ll take on LHP Jackson Wolf (6-8, 4.07 ERA) on Friday night.\n\nLakeland Flying Tigers vs. Clearwater Threshers (suspended)\nEven the makeup games need makeup games in Florida during the summer months. The Flying Tigers were leading the makeup game from Wednesday’s rainout 5-0 in the third when play was again suspended. They’ll try to finish that game in seven inning fashion on Friday starting at 4:00 p.m. EDT, and hopefully get a doubleheader in to get this series back on course.",

        "description": "John Podhoretz: “Joe Biden has become America’s leading troll — and he’s trolling Donald Trump. The president’s supposedly grand speech in ‘defense of democracy’ under attack by ‘Trump and the MAGA Republicans’ was hardly a visionary call to renew our commitment to the Republic.”\n\n\n\n“If it had been the highfalutin speech we were promised, Biden wouldn’t have spent ludicrous time praising himself for things like prescription-drug costs and burn-pit health coverage. No, this speech was nakedly, even comically, designed not to elevate but to offend — to poke and taunt and push his predecessor and his predecessor’s camp followers and acolytes into firing back about how evil Biden is.”\n\n\n\nRich Lowry: “Trump and Biden compensate for each other’s problems, and they are effectively working together to get Trump nominated — which Trump wants because it’s the necessary precondition for winning a second term and Biden wants because Trump would be the riskiest GOP candidate in a general election.”\n\n\n\n“It’s not the most edifying relationship. Indeed, it’s a de facto partnership toward a demoralizing rerun of 2020. But neither Trump nor Biden is as likely to get where they want to go without the other.”",

        "description": "Duke of York’s theatre, LondonThis one-man, one-note show is a blandly sanitised history of Take That. While it won’t thrill you with its drama, its slightly smug star does have one hell of a voiceI’ll tell you what, that Gary Barlow can really sing. Every time the pop star performs a snippet of one of Take That’s greatest hits, this strange hybrid of a show lights up. His singing is still properly powerful – authentic, emotional and intriguingly enigmatic – and it’s a thrill to experience it at such close quarters. If only this one-man show had explored the places that Barlow’s music takes him. Instead, this is effectively a shrunken pop concert turned inside out, with the stage patter stretched to breaking point and the songs stripped right back. Could it be magic? No.Barlow created the show alongside Calendar Girls writer Tim Firth and the script feels far too sentimental and, despite a number of self-deprecating skits, just a little bit smug. As Barlow recounts his relatively straightforward path to success, from playing at the local labour clubs in Cheshire to fairly quickly being discovered and hitting the road with Take That, there are very few surprises or gritty details. There’s little tension either. This is effectively the Take That story – and we all know that turned out pretty well.At Duke of York’s theatre, London, until 25 September; then touring.

        "description": "An over-styled darts bar that’s hoping to score big in the gastro-gaming futureEven though I haven’t played darts for decades, Oche grabbed my attention, because it promised an insight into the new era of so-called gastro-gaming. An oche, in case you don’t know, is the line behind which you have to stand when throwing darts, and this new, rather chic, central London venue with about 30 electronic dartboards also has oysters, ceviche and sliders on the menu. The decor is heavy on the pinks and peaches, and features a rhapsody of fake succulents and neon “Live Laugh Love”-style signs, so it’s a bit like a wealthy teenager’s Instagram content studio. Oche may well be a darts bar, but while you’re chucking arrows, Valrhona chocolate desserts are being delivered from the open kitchen under cloches and billowing smoke. Meanwhile, on the screen above the dartboard, your victories, or embarrassments, are broadcast for all to see. Darts purists will sneer to find that Oche offers one game that counts down from 201, and three others with a fantasy vibe featuring swords, shields and axemen.The term gastro-gaming, which features large on Oche’s PR material, intrigues me, because many of its investors clearly sense that this is the future. Yes, several bars focusing on darts, ball pits and crazy golf have opened in recent years, but Oche is much sleeker and, well, grown-up. There’s no attempt at a pub darts vibe, and I’d hazard that no one playing on the Saturday we went would get the significance of Jim Bowen’s Bullseye or staying “out of the black and into the red, nothing in this game for two in a bed”. The gastro-gaming landscape is for a demographic who missed out on sticky-floored pubs , and who want a venue with an activity where they can eat Korean-inspired bao buns alongside their pornstar martinis.

        "description": "President Joe Biden delivers a primetime speech at Independence National Historical Park on Thursday in Philadelphia.Alex Wong/Getty ImagesDemocrats have picked up some momentum this election cycle with wins in multiple special elections, following the Supreme Court&#x27;s overturning of Roe v. Wade. And the FBI search of former President Donald Trump&#x27;s Florida home has thrust Trump back into the spotlight, front and center. Lots of his candidates have won contentious primaries; he&#x27;s consolidated his base; and his renewed presence has threatened to make the November elections a choice rather than a referendum on President Joe Biden. Biden and the White House leaned into that Thursday night with an unusual prime-time address that broke no news or made any big announcements. Instead, Biden took the opportunity to elevate Trump and make it a choice between what Biden and Democrats stand for and MAGA Republican extremism, as he sees it, and their rising influence in positions of power throughout the country.&quot;I believe America is at an inflection point,&quot; the president said in front of Independence Hall in Philadelphia, the same city, where he launched his 2020 presidential campaign, &quot;one of those moments that determine the shape of everything that&#x27;s to come after. And now America must choose to move forward or to move backwards.&quot;On the eve of Labor Day weekend, the traditional pivot to the final sprint of general elections across the country, here are three takeaways from Biden&#x27;s speech:1) Biden tried to reinforce the idea that this election is a choice, not a referendum... on himElections, especially midterm elections, are traditionally a check on the president. Inflation is high, Biden is unpopular and people are pessimistic about the direction of the country. That usually would mean a wipeout in a president&#x27;s first midterm. So this gave Biden an opportunity to deflect from that — and lay out a choice.&quot;MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,&quot; Biden said, &quot;backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.&quot;He highlighted threats to democracy as being urgent and instigated by Trump. Biden doesn&#x27;t often use Trump&#x27;s name, but he name-checked him three times in this speech. And when you do that, it&#x27;s going to look and sound political. And that was obviously intentional. With Trump back in the news, it offered Biden a way to elevate him, hold him up as the standard-bearer of the GOP, what it stands for, and draw a line in the sand.&quot;It&#x27;s pretty clear they want to amplify the MAGA message,&quot; said Democratic strategist Joel Payne. &quot;Almost feels like a pre-argument against what a Republican House might be pushing for the next two years, setting up a broader narrative about how he is fighting to stop Republicans from anti-democratic moves.&quot; 2) This may have been a political speech, but that doesn&#x27;t mean there aren&#x27;t real threatsYou&#x27;d be forgiven if you confused Biden&#x27;s address for a convention speech, because that&#x27;s where you draw contrasts with your opponent and lay out a vision for the country.But that&#x27;s not to say there aren&#x27;t real or urgent threats. Election deniers are closer to controlling elections in key places, and as we&#x27;ve said many times watching the Jan. 6 hearings, the institutions of democracy may have held in 2020, but only because of the people who were running them. Now many of those structures are run by people who support Trump and his election lies all the way. We&#x27;ve seen political violence, the FBI is facing threats, as are poll workers and local election officials. There is no doubt that conspiratorial elements of Trumpism are more potentially operational now than they were before the 2020 presidential election. &quot;Democracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an election — either they win or they were cheated,&quot; Biden said.And with the election two months away, the White House would argue highlighting that threat is key.3) There is a degree of risk in Biden&#x27;s strategyDemocrats&#x27; recent momentum in multiple special elections has largely been due to abortion rights, not necessarily about threats ts to democracy.Yes, a recent NBC poll showed threats to democracy rising to the No. 1 issue, and that is significant, as it overtook cost of living, which was second. But it was only with 21% of respondents. Economic-related items when combined – cost of living and jobs and the economy – were 30 percent, higher than threats to democracy. What&#x27;s more, when you break down those who said threats to democracy were their top issue, 53 percent were Democrats, while 32 percent of Republicans and 11 percent of independents did. And Democrats and Republicans certainly view the &quot;threats to democracy&quot; very differently. Democrats obviously see Trump and &quot;MAGA extremism&quot; as the threat, while many Republicans, who have believed Trump&#x27;s election lies, believe Democrats and (not) rigged elections are the problems. So the White House might be overreading polls here. Republicans, many of whom are now aligned with Trump, are incensed. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy gave a speech before Biden spoke and said the president needed to apologize for what he saw as insulting the millions of Americans who voted for Trump. It certainly shows the 180-degree shift McCarthy has made since after Jan. 6 in his quest to become House speaker. But it also highlights the high bar Biden has in trying to make clear he is talking about Republican elected officials and not voters. &quot;Not even a majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans,&quot; Biden said. &quot;Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. I know because I&#x27;ve been able to work with these mainstream Republicans. But there&#x27;s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.&quot;That is a very fine line for a president, who isn&#x27;t always artful with his words, to walk and stick to. The GOP will obviously use this to fire up their base against Democrats and Biden in these midterms, but the White House is gambling that conservatives who dislike him are already fired up – and Democrats need to keep their base engaged.&quot;There is a risk of overreaching on this,&quot; Payne said, &quot;especially at a point when Republicans are on their heels trying to protect some anticipated gains in the &#x27;22 midterms.&quot;But, he added, &quot;I think it also helps juice the base [with] moral clarity on saving the democracy.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "A T-shirt that was popular with veterans for much of America’s nearly 20-year war in Afghanistan showed a helicopter in flight with the caption We Were Winning When I Left. U.S. generals seem to be the only ones who didn’t get the joke. On the first anniversary of our botched withdrawal, the military leaders most responsible for America’s disastrous outcome in Afghanistan have continued to loudly insist that the war was winnable when they were in charge, and that responsibility for the debacle must lie with someone else.Retired Generals Frank McKenzie and Joseph Votel, the last two commanders of U.S. Central Command, which includes Afghanistan, recently made the case that America should have stayed indefinitely, arguing that the pullout was a mistake and that America could have defended its interests—and kept the Taliban at bay—with a small residual force of a few thousand soldiers. And in The Atlantic, the retired general and former CIA director David Petraeus, who commanded the war in Afghanistan after presiding over the surge that helped bring temporary stability to Iraq, wrote that more than a decade ago “we had finally established the right big ideas and overarching strategy.” But the problem, he maintained, was that America did not have the stomach for a “sustained, generational commitment.”A sustained, generational commitment? The United States spent more than $2 trillion in Afghanistan and sacrificed the lives of 2,461 service members over those two decades. And in that time, the top brass mostly got their way. President Barack Obama caved to his generals, agreeing to a substantial troop surge in a war he was trying to end. President Donald Trump did the same on a smaller scale, entering office on a promise to end the war but eventually agreeing to a “mini-surge” and deferring a full withdrawal to his successor.[From the magazine: My escape from Afghanistan]The outcome of America’s commitment was an Afghan government and military that couldn’t hold out long enough even for U.S. forces to leave with a semblance of dignity. The “right big ideas” deployed by a generation of generals proved to be empty slogans: “government in a box,” “money as a weapons system,” “ink spots.” All of these were tactical approaches or overly simplistic frameworks that ignored the nuances of Afghan politics and the reality of attempting to modernize a fractured country that was mired in corruption and a continuing civil war.This myth of a sustainable stalemate is contradicted by a mountain of evidence and experience. U.S. casualties in the Afghan War’s last years remained low because of the Doha Agreement, whatever its flaws. The Kabul government’s forces that had to fight and win the war were losing “gradually and then suddenly,” as Ernest Hemingway described bankruptcy.By 2017, Afghan army and police recruiting began to dry up, a result of high casualties, corruption, and mistreatment, as well as successful Taliban propaganda that capitalized on those failures. Later that year, the U.S. government classified Afghan security forces’ size and stopped collecting district stability data, a fraught but valuable metric of security. These were not the hallmarks of a winning campaign. General McKenzie admitted to the Senate Armed Services Committee in 2018 that Afghan security forces were suffering unsustainable attrition. And when Afghan forces failed in battle with the tools and training we had given them, the answer from the generals was not to shift our approach but always to ask for more time and more money.We both first deployed to Afghanistan more than a decade ago; our combined experience in the war covers the period from 2009 to 2014. What became clear during those deployments was that the war was a fundamentally doomed endeavor. Our efforts to build a national Afghan army in the image of our own military were not only ineffective; they also made the Afghan government’s crisis of legitimacy worse. We both served alongside a range of Afghan government forces and saw firsthand how the model we were imposing on their military simply did not fit the country we were fighting in.In June 2011, a full decade before last year’s total withdrawal, President Obama announced a major troop reduction in Afghanistan and a future “responsible end” to the war. Trump successfully campaigned in 2016 on a pullout promise; as president, he signed the February 2020 Doha Agreement that would deliver just that. President Joe Biden ordered an Afghanistan policy review, and then chose to delay the withdrawal but ultimately honor the Doha terms.[Read: The Afghanistan withdrawal: a potential disaster in the making]In the face of all these signals that the U.S. intervention was coming to an end, America’s generals seemed to think they could keep a small war in Afghanistan going forever. If the war didn’t end, hard questions about the fundamental flaws in execution never had to be acknowledged. U.S. military leaders could continue to pretend that they had achieved something in the country.As for the inevitable chaos of the withdrawal itself, the U.S. State Department deserves most of the blame for the shameful condition of the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa program, which prevented tens of thousands of our Afghan partners from getting out of the country safely, and the White House must own some final operational and timing decisions in Kabul. But the bulk of the blame for the failures of analysis, planning, and execution still rests on the shoulders of our military and its leaders. They built a house of cards in Afghanistan. As years of reporting and research have shown, whether it would come crashing down was never in doubt; it was only a matter of when and how.Defeat is a bitter pill for any army to swallow. And unfortunately, blaming operational and tactical failures on politics at home—a stab in the back—is a long and dangerous tradition: You can find Iraq and Vietnam versions of that sardonic T-shirt. Plenty of blame can be spread around for America’s defeat in its longest foreign war. But don’t let the generals fool you: We were losing when they left.",

        "description": "Karl Merton Ferron/Baltimore Sun/Tribune News Service via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Colton Cowser, Jordan Westburg and Connor Norby homer in team losses while Bowie’s Noah Denoyer and Aberdeen’s Xavier Moore impress in relief. \nTriple-A: Lehigh Valley IronPigs (Phillies) 13, Norfolk Tides 6\n\nWell… Norfolk was in a seven-run hole before they ever got on the board, so not an easy one to win. The game actually began with three scoreless innings from Beau Sulser, but after him came a trio of some suckitude: Travis Lakins Sr. (L, 0-1) allowed four runs in 1.1 innings. Zac Lowther gave up three runs in 1.2 innings on a two-run triple and a wild pitch. And new guy Phoenix Sanders allowed four more, courtesy of an RBI single and a three-run home run. Morgan McSweeney threw a scoreless eighth, but Pat Conroy allowed the 12th and 13th Lehigh runs to score in the ninth. \nOther than that, Mrs. Lincoln? Well, Tides hitters did stay competitive even in a blowout, putting up six runs in the final four innings, five coming on a pair of long balls. One was a two-run bomb off the bat of Colton Cowser, his 15th of the year and first hit with Norfolk. The other was Jordan Westburg’s 14th of the season for the Tides, good for three runs. Catcher Brett Cumberland also had three hits.\n\nDouble-A: Erie SeaWolves (Tigers) 3, Bowie Baysox 2\n\nIt was a good day for both bullpens, as neither team scored a run after the second inning. Justin Ambruester (4-1, 3.81 ERA) got stuck with the loss after allowing three runs on two home runs in the first inning. He’d go three innings, striking out five, so it wasn’t a bad day. After that Noah “The Destroyer” Denoyer was spotless, throwing four scoreless/hitless innings in which he struck out six. Wow. Connor Loeprich pitched a scoreless eighth inning, allowing one hit and striking out two hitters. \nNot a great deal of offense for the Baysox, as you could tell: they put up six total hits, only two for extra bases. One was an Andrew Daschbach double; the other was a solo home run by Connor Norby (his fifteenth of the season). Norby also added a single on a 2-for-4 day. Coby Mayo singled to lead off the second inning, advanced to second on a Toby Welk walk (1-for-3, BB), and scored the Baysox’s second and final run on a single by Andrés Angulo, a catcher signed to a minor league deal in February. \n\nHigh-A: Aberdeen IronBirds 4, Hickory Crawdads (Rangers) 3 \n\nIt’s not easy to win when your No. 1-4 hitters (Billy Cook, Heston Kjerstad, TT Bowens and Trendon Craig) go a combined 0-for-11 with one walk, but Aberdeen did just that, lifted by a two-triple performance from Donta’ Williams. Williams also scored two runs, both courtesy of Jud Fabian, who hit a sac fly and a single. Catcher Ramon Rodriguez singled, doubled, and scored. Chris Givin went 1-for-2 with a run scored. \nThe real spotlight here, however, was on Grayson Rodriguez in his first rehab outing since he strained his lat back in June. G-Rod, on a strict pitch count, threw just 31 pitches in 1.1 innings, allowing zero runs on one hit, two walks, and one swinging strikeout. But his fastball velo reportedly got up to 98 mph and, in his words, he felt healthy and was finally able to “let it eat.” It’s nice to see G-Rod back out on the mound. Peter van Loon provided valuable length (5.0 IP, 2 R, 1 H, 4 BB, 5 SO). Kade Strowd allowed the Crawdads’ third run to squeak in in the eighth inning, which put closer Xavier Moore in a high-leverage save situation, protecting a one-run lead in the ninth. Moore (1.44 ERA, 52 K is 30.1 IP) did not come to play around: he struck out the side. \n\nLow-A: Fredericksburg Nationals 11, Delmarva Shorebirds 9\n\nThis one was, as a certain CC writer likes to put it, a donnybrook. Fredericksburg raced out to a 4-0 lead but Delmarva responded with eight runs of their own. Their lead lasted only half an inning, as Fredericksburg scored five runs off relievers Ryan Long and Cooper Chandler. The Shorebirds closed the gap with a home run in the ninth inning, and even got the tying run to the plate, but the rally died with two consecutive strikeouts. \nShorebirds starter Deivy Cruz threw a rocky 3.1 innings, with six runs allowed on six hits, four walks, a HBP and a wild pitch. It was a bit of a hot mess. \nAnother decent day for the Shorebirds offense, which put up nine hits and took seven walks, but again, not enough to overcome a pitching meltdown. No. 9 hitter Noelberth Romero had three hits and scored two runs. Carter Young hit a run-scoring double and homered in the ninth. Dylan Beavers hit two doubles. Former Terp Maxwell Costes went 1-for-2 with a two-run single. Jackson Holliday drove in two runs with a single and an RBI groundout. Elío Prado worked an RBI walk. \nBox scores for Thursday’s games can be found here.\nFriday’s Scheduled Games\n\nTriple-A Norfolk: vs Lehigh Valley, 7:05.

        "description": "Photo by Dustin Bradford/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Colorado Rockies news and links for Friday, September 2, 2022 The September decisions of which position players get penciled into the lineup each day seem more complicated this year. Without any kind of playoff contention, the Rockies find themselves playing the same game for the fourth-straight season: who plays today? Do veterans or rookies get more time?\nThe curveball this year that makes things more difficult is the lack of pitch hitting with the universal DH. There is one more batter every day getting usually at least four at-bats, but on most days, it really is just the one extra hitter. The Rockies aren’t big on using pinch hitters to get ideal matchups or making midgame changes (unless it’s a blowout). Once the lineup is set, that’s usually it.\nThat needs to change in the Rockies final 30 games.\nIn 2022, through 131 games, Rockies pinch hitters only have 22 at-bats. That is the lowest in all of baseball. While using a pinch hitter doesn’t translate to wins (the Braves are the second lowest at 33 at-bats), the MLB average is 72. If you look at teams who have the most pinch hitter ABs, they are actually teams who aren’t in contention: The Giants (163), A’s (113), Rangers (106), Diamondbacks (103), and Pirates (101). Those are teams who know they don’t have a winning roster. So they are trying to give more players a chance, learning what might be a better roster along the way.\nThe Rockies also haven’t been bad when they do use the DH this season. In 28 plate appearances, they have totaled one homer, two doubles, eight RBI, six runs, and six walks (including one intentional).\n\nStarting on Thursday, MLB bumped up roster sizes from 26 to 28 and the Rockies brought up Alan Trejo and Chad Smith. The Rockies current roster has nine players who can play infield, including Garrett Hampson, Michael Toglia, and Connor Joe. They also have six players who can fill roster spots in the outfield, with the aforementioned versatile trio. If Bud Black has nine hitters in each lineup and doesn’t make changes, that leaves a lot of guys just chewing gum and spitting sunflower seeds for nine innings. With waiting lists at first base, third base, and DH, there has to be more pinch hitting or midgame changes of any kind.\nIn the case of San Francisco’s pinch hitting, they are looking for ideal matchups. They average using five pinch hitters every four games. The Rockies are using one pinch hitter every six games. Over the last 30 games, the Rockies should be aiming for an average of at least one pinch hitter a game.\nFor the many who were against the universal DH, one of the main arguments against it was that it took out the strategy of the manager. But it doesn’t have to. Instead of pinch hitting for a pitcher, pinch hit for players. There isn’t one single Rockie this season who is hitting so well that they aren’t worth subbing out if there’s a better matchup on the bench. It also might be worth it to give younger players more chances to hit in different situations.\nThis roster logjam is the pickle a team finds itself in when they don’t have a plan and without making trades, even though a position might be flooded with candidates. The roster can’t change now, so the best thing Black can do is favor the young. Show your managerial skills with lineup construction in putting guys in different places to see if they can succeed. Pinch hit and make defensive substitutions more often. Get more players more action, even if it isn’t for a whole game.\nIf winning doesn’t matter, which the Rockies certainly seem to be showing with their actions, try to go for player evaluation. Black’s shown a willingness to do this by putting Ryan McMahon in the leadoff spot. Keep experimenting. Try to find something to build from this offseason and into 2023. If nothing else, the front office might at least be able to get a clearer picture of whose time with the Rockies might be coming to an end.\n★ ★ ★\nCharlie Blackmon on Atlanta roots and coming back home | Rox Pile\nKevin Henry checked in with the longtime Rockie on what it was like to return to his home state during the Rockies three-game series against Atlanta. Blackmon even got to spend Monday’s day off with friends and family. This is a good check-in on some behind-the-scenes stuff for Chuck Nazty and what he thinks about Truist Park vs. Turner Field.\n★ ★ ★\nOn The Farm\nTriple-A: Albuquerque Isotopes 9, Sugar Land Space Cowboys 7\nThings didn’t look good when the Isotopes found themselves down 7-2 after the first inning, but they immediately started to climb back into the game. In his first rehab start since going on the IL with a left shoulder dislocation on Aug. 12, Yonathan Daza hit an RBI single and Sam Hilliard followed with a three-run triple to cut the Sugar Land lead to 7-5. Jonathan Morales added another run with an RBI groundout in the sixth and then the home-run show started. Tim Lopes and Bret Boswell hit back-to-back homers in the eighth with Boswell’s putting the Isotopes ahead. \n\n\nBACK-TO-BACK! @bboswell17 delivers a Topes lead with this solo blast!  It's the ninth set of back-to-back jacks for Albuquerque this season.M8: Isotopes 8, Space Cowboys 7 pic.twitter.com/RsFYxz5oBQ— Albuquerque Isotopes (@ABQTopes) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nCoco Montes added another solo shot in the ninth for insurance that Albuquerque didn’t end up needing. Daza went 3-for-4 and scored two runs, while Dom Nuñez and Montes both posted two-hit nights. After Zach Neal had a rough start, giving up seven runs (five earned) and didn’t get out of the first inning, five Isotopes came out of the bullpen to combine for 8 1⁄3 scoreless innings with eight strikeouts. Joel Peguero recorded the win and Zach Lee earned the save. \nDouble-A: Hartford Yard Goats 4, Reading Fightin Phils 3\nJulio Carreras connected for three hits and drove in a run, Aaron Schunk added three more hits, Daniel Montano added an RBI triple, and Hunter Stovall chipped in an RBI single to carry the Yard Goats to their third straight win. Tony Locey entered the game in the fifth, giving up one run on three hits with three strikeouts in three innings to earn the win. Jared Biddy and Stephen Jones each posted a shutout inning with Jones getting his sixth save of the season. \nHigh-A: Spokane Indians 4, Vancouver Canadians 3\nThere were two outs when Robby Martin Jr. stepped up to the plate in the bottom of the ninth and he hit a walk-off, ground-rule double to score Bladimir Restituyo to set off a Spokane celebration. The Indians found themselves behind 3-0 in the seventh inning when Nic Kent hit a two-run homer to make it a one-run game. In the bottom of the eighth,  Restituyo hit a sac fly that ended up sending the game to extra innings. Chris McMahon had a solid start for Spokane, giving up three runs in six innings on seven hits with seven strikeouts. Juan Mejia threw two scoreless innings with five strikeouts, Blake Goldsberry pitched two more scoreless frames, and Anderson Bido was perfect in the 11th to earn his first win of the season. \nLow-A: Fresno Grizzlies 11, Modesto Nuts 0\nCapping off a 4-0 night for the Rockies farm system, the Grizzlies put up a blowout win over that saw 13 Fresno hits and five Nuts errors. Benny Montgomery and Sterlin Thompson both recorded two-hit nights with a double, Yanquiel Fernandez hit a two-run double, and Bryant Quijada and Benjamin Sems drove in a pair of runs a piece. All nine starters and two pinch hitters recorded either a hit or scored a run for Fresno. Brayan Castillo threw five scoreless innings with six strikeouts to earn the win and three other Grizzlies pitchers held Modesto to five hits on the night.\n★ ★ ★\nPlease keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting.

(WTEN) — Food poisoning incidents, thought to be caused by bad lettuce at Wendy's restaurants, have spread to both New York and Kentucky, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Thursday. \n\n\n\nThe new cases raised the number of states where diners have fallen ill to six.\n\n\n\nAccording to the CDC, as of Aug. 31, a total of 97 people nationwide have been infected with an outbreak strain of E. coli after dining at the popular fast-food spot. The agency has not confirmed the cause of the outbreak but said many sick people reported eating sandwiches with romaine lettuce at the restaurants before falling ill.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tConcerns raised about rollout of new variant-specific COVID vaccine\t\n\n\n\n\nOfficials did not specify where in New York or Kentucky the new cases were reported. It had previously noted incidents in Indiana, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. In New York, between one and five cases had been reported as of Thursday's release.\n\n\n\nIn an Aug. 19 statement, Wendy's said it was removing the sandwich lettuce at some of its affected restaurants as a precaution. Several lawsuits have been filed against the fast-food giant after some victims of the outbreak suffered severe symptoms, including diarrhea that can lead to kidney failure.\n\n\n\nSymptoms of E. coli can also include a fever higher than 102 degrees Fahrenheit, vomiting to the point of being unable to keep down liquids, and signs of dehydration, the CDC said. \n\n\n\nCDC map showing where the 97 people in this E. coli outbreak lived:\n\n\n\nContent source: Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Emerging and Zoonotic Infectious Diseases (NCEZID), Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases (DFWED)\n\n\n\nIf you are experiencing these symptoms, the CDC asks that you keep a record of what you ate in the week before becoming sick to help identify the possible source of the infection. \n\n\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "description": "The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Thursday recommended that tech giant Amazon’s objections to votes by the Amazon Labor Union (ALU) be blocked.\n\n\n\n“I conclude that the Employer’s objections be overruled in their entirety,” wrote the NLRB hearing officer, according to documents posted by ALU President Christian Smalls.\n\n\n\nThe report continues: “The Employer has not met its burden of establishing that Region 29, the Petitioner, or any third parties have engaged in objectionable conduct affecting the results of the election.”\n\n\n\nRegion 29 of the NLRB initially held the election to decide whether the ALU would officially represent fulfillment center employees working at Amazon’s JFK8 building. The company’s dispute was transferred to Region 28 of the board after Amazon claimed that Region 29 displayed questionable conduct in the election.\n\n\n\nThe election, which took place in March, found that employees voted to be represented by the ALU by a margin of 10.8 percent.\n\n\n\nAmazon spokeswoman Kelly Nantel told The Hill that \"We strongly disagree with the conclusion and intend to appeal.\"\n\n\n\n\"As we showed throughout the hearing with dozens of witnesses and hundreds of pages of documents, both the NLRB and the ALU improperly influenced the outcome of the election and we don’t believe it represents what the majority of our team wants,\" she said.\n\n\n\nThe ALU praised the decision, with Smalls calling it \"a great day for Labor.\"\n\n\n\n“While we are pleased with her findings, the Amazon workers in the ALU understand that this is just the beginning of a much longer fight,” the ALU said of the NLRB officer’s recommendation.\n\n\n\nThe statement added: “It is our hope that the Regional Director for Region 28 can expedite our certification and that the NLRB enforces Amazon’s legal obligation to negotiate with the workers of the ALU.”\n\n\n\nUpdated: 9:15 a.m.",

        "description": "Reports of an imminent return to the Iran nuclear deal have reached a fever pitch once again. Washington and Tehran are going back and forth over the European “final text” for reviving the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). The Biden White House and State Department have launched an intensive round of news briefings to prepare the public for a forthcoming announcement.\n\n\n\nBehind the intensity of the negotiations and speculation about their outcome is a disturbing but irrefutable truth: The nuclear deal does not solve the Iran nuclear problem. By pretending that it does, the Biden administration threatens to leave the United States with unappealing options: using force to destroy Iran’s nuclear facilities, driving Israel to do so, or living with a nuclear-armed Iran.\n\n\n\nFor the better part of a decade, analysts have debated the costs and benefits of the deal, with interminable finger-pointing characterizing the back-and-forth. Nevertheless, except for the most zealous JCPOA advocates, observers agree on several undisputable points.\n\n\n\nMost significantly, they acknowledge that the deal’s primary restrictions on Iranian uranium enrichment are limited and temporary. By 2031, the JCPOA allows Iran to enrich and stockpile uranium without limitation, using advanced centrifuges in hardened underground facilities that Tehran previously hid from the International Atomic Energy Agency, in violation of Iran’s obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty.\n\n\n\nDeal supporters argue that restricting Iranian enrichment now is worthwhile, even though the JCPOA legitimizes unrestricted Iranian enrichment later and provides Tehran hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief. Deal opponents argue that the deal leads to a much richer, nuclear-armed Iran and has sparked a Middle East nuclear arms race, as Iran’s neighbors seek to secure for themselves the same capabilities the JCPOA grants the Islamic Republic.\n\n\n\nEven deal proponents have noted that Iran’s JCPOA violations since 2019 — in particular, high levels of enrichment, uranium stockpiling, and experimentation with uranium metallurgy — have no civilian justification. Deal critics agree and have pointed out that these violations — which are directly relevant to the production of nuclear weapons — would be permitted under the JCPOA in the coming years. The difference is only a matter of timing.\n\n\n\nBut seven years after the original conclusion of the nuclear deal, and as its provisions have begun to expire, the timing is now critical. Because the JCPOA does not provide a long-term solution to the Iranian nuclear problem, the United States needs a “Plan B,” whether or not it reenters the deal.\n\n\n\nOfficials in the Biden administration used to speak of negotiating a “longer, stronger deal,” implicitly acknowledging the JCPOA’s inherent flaws and the need for a backup plan. After nearly a year and a half of talks, Iran has made it clear that it has no desire to extend or expand the deal. Why would it? Returning to the JCPOA would remove economic and diplomatic pressure on the regime, thereby also removing the main incentives to make future concessions. Unsurprisingly, the Biden administration quietly abandoned talk of a longer, stronger deal months ago.\n\n\n\nPresident Biden has asserted that U.S. policy is to prevent Iran from ever acquiring nuclear weapons. If this is still the case, what is his plan to genuinely block Iran’s paths to nuclear weapons for the long term? With the relaxation of pressure, how does the administration intend to dissuade or deter Iran from its decades-long pursuit of nuclear weapons?\n\n\n\nDuring Biden’s visit to Israel last month, a reporter asked if he would use force to prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. He answered that he would, if that was the last resort. Yet by returning to the JCPOA, the president is forcing himself down the path that he claims he wants to avoid.\n\n\n\nIf he discards economic and diplomatic pressure to rejoin an agreement that will unfetter Iran’s nuclear program in just a few short years, the use of force will be Biden’s only remaining option to stop Iran from going nuclear — the last resort. Instead, Biden should walk away from the deal. Doing so would allow him to develop a Plan B that uses the entire spectrum of coercive tools and possibly to avoid the use of force.\n\n\n\nWith or without the deal, Biden needs to prepare his Plan B. Failing to do so would almost certainly result in an Israel-Iran war, a nuclear Iran, or both. Biden claims that he wants none of these outcomes, but his policy choices suggest otherwise. Time is running out.\n\n\n\nJonathan Schachter is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute.",

        "description": "New York Times: “With an opposition party that has largely embraced the lie that the last election was stolen and remains in thrall to a twice-impeached and defeated former president who encouraged a mob that attacked the Capitol to stop the transfer of power, Mr. Biden’s appeals to national unity have found little traction. Some Republicans have argued that his efforts to build consensus were fainthearted at best, while some Democrats complain they were excessive.”\n\n\n\n“Either way, they have made little difference in the national conversation. And so with the midterm congressional campaign getting underway in earnest, Mr. Biden has dispensed with the unity message, at least for now, reaching into the 2020 file cabinet and bringing out the call to win ‘a battle for the soul of this nation’ that was the cornerstone of his successful election.”\n\n\n\n“The immediate strategy is self-evident. Rather than a referendum on his own presidency, which has been hurt by high inflation and low public morale, Mr. Biden wants to make the election a choice between ‘normal’ and an ‘extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,’ as he put it on Thursday.”",

And he took it to Mr. Trump directly, calling him out by name and seeking to differentiate between ‘the MAGA Republicans’ loyal to Mr. Trump and what he deemed reasonable Republicans who still stand by the American democratic experiment.”\n\n\n\n“Midterm elections are usually a referendum on the party of the president in power, especially when that party also controls Congress. But Mr. Biden and the Democrats are betting that if they can make this November a choice between Democratic and Republican control, they can win, or at least keep their losses to a minimum. Mr. Biden’s speech was all about making the choice this Election Day between what he called ‘the light of truth’ and ‘the shadow of lies.’”",

Vance has been difficult to find,” CNN reports.\n\n\n\n“The rookie GOP candidate goes days without any public events, and his campaign gives little information about his whereabouts.”\n\n\n\n“He has been slow to build a fundraising operation, and a ground game, and is being dramatically outspent on air while racking up a nearly $900,000 in campaign debt last quarter. And now, a super PAC with ties to Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is planning to spend a staggering $28 million on television ads here to save a Senate seat once viewed as a lock— and deny Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan a chance for a major, midterm upset.”",

In advance of the 2020 election, President Trump almost tripled payouts to farm families to offset the pain of his trade war with China, from $11.5 billion in 2017 to $32 billion in 2020. But Biden’s college-debt-relief program is far larger than Trump’s handout to farmers, adding up to at least $330 billion over 10 years, and possibly as much as $1 trillion.&#8221;\n&#8220;The lesson for Republican leaders and donors is that sticking with Trump will be expensive. Trump himself and pro-Trump candidates are hurting the GOP’s election chances. Trump lost the presidency in 2020. Pro-Trump candidates cost the GOP its hold on the U.S. Senate in 2021. More pro-Trump candidates are slumping badly in 2022. More GOP stumbles mean more cash for Democratic constituencies.&#8221;",

At this point, one might say, Trump is just another Crazy Uncle with a social-media account. And, besides, instead of parsing what he says on the Internet, shouldn’t we be focused on the FBI’s continuing self-abasement, which occasioned the flare-up in the first instance?&#8221;\n&#8220;But the thing is: None of that is really true, is it? Donald Trump has been talking like this for 18 months now. He is not some Crazy Uncle; he is the most likely person to be the next Republican nominee for president — and, for that matter, the next president. And while I strongly agree that the FBI needs wholesale reform — if not outright abolition — that does not change the fact that what Trump is saying in response on his failing social-media platform is nuts.&#8221;",

        "description": "Don&#8217;t automatically believe what you read online about spiders, say researchers.\n&#8220;The quality of spider information in the global press is rather poor—errors and sensationalism are rampant,&#8221; says Stefano Mammola of the National Research Council, Verbania Pallanza, Italy, and University of Helsinki&#8217;s Finnish Museum of Natural History.\n&#8220;Spider-related information in the press flows through a highly interconnected global network, and the spread of misinformation is driven by a limited number of key factors, the sensationalistic tone of an article being particularly important.&#8221;\nMammola says he was inspired to do the study initially based on general disappointment about the quality of spider-related newspaper articles in Italy. &#8220;Many articles on spiders in the Italian press are full of errors, alarmistic, or even fake news, or a combination thereof,&#8221; he says.\nSo, he and dozens of colleagues wanted to see whether this was a global problem. Their team collected all the data, representing 41 languages and 81 countries. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the project also offered a way to explore important questions on a global scale from home while spider fieldwork wasn&#8217;t possible. Their findings appear in the journal Current Biology.\n&#8220;We found that the level of sensationalism and misinformation drops when the &#8216;right&#8217; expert—namely an expert on spiders rather than a medical doctor or other professional—is consulted by journalists doing the writing,&#8221; explains Mammola.\n&#8220;This result is actually really encouraging, because it suggests that there is a solution to this problem&#8221; explains Catherine Scott, a postdoctoral fellow in McGill University&#8217;s Lyman Lab. The authors plan to create a global database of arachnologists that are willing to speak to journalists and they are working on a set of guidelines for journalists covering stories about spiders.\nThe data they amassed also show the importance of events and news coverage on a local scale, as small-town stories can quickly hit the international news. &#8220;I was particularly surprised by the fact that even very local-scale events—say, the story of a farmer bitten by a spider in some remote village in Australia—published by a regional newspaper can quickly become broadcast internationally,&#8221; Mammola explains.\n&#8220;This implies that improving the quality of the information produced in these local nodes could have a positive effect reverberating across the information network—a typical example of a &#8216;think globally, act locally&#8217; management strategy&#8221;.\nMisinformation about spiders has many real-world implications. Some notable cases have led to school closures due to alarmist responses to false widow &#8220;invasions,&#8221; they report. In another instance, a man lit his house on fire while blowtorching (harmless) spider webs from his backyard. The tone and quality of &#8220;news&#8221; stories about spiders shape people&#8217;s perception and ideas about them, with implications for them and for spider conservation.\nAs for next steps, the researchers now want to explore more about how poor-quality information on spiders relates to the persistence of arachnophobic sentiments in the population. They also want to understand better how differences in cultural, social, and other factors influence differences in the way spiders are represented and talked about across various countries and regions.\nSource: McGill University\nThe post The internet is teeming with bad spider info appeared first on Futurity.",

Police knew of this in 2011 but details of it were established only three years later.The testimony of a GP in April 2011 that Halliwell visited their surgery on 3 January 2003 with severe scratches to his face and damage to his hand, claiming he had been assaulted by a passenger in his taxi.

The Royals dropped the finale against the White Sox, but it was a learning experience for the young hitters.\n\n“Cueto lives on the edges,” Massey said. “If you swing at a changeup or just a ball off the plate, now it’s 0-1 instead of 1-0, and he can keep extending out there or throw a cutter in. If you lay off that, now you get yourself to a 1-0, 2-0, 3-1 count off of him, knowing that that’s what he’s going to do. He’s going to nibble, not come over the heart of the plate until he has to. \n“I think just trying to get those guys into a bad count is something that’s key to hitting them and something that’s key for us to take away moving forward.”\n\nAnne Rogers has an update on Vinnie Pasquantino.\nPasquantino traveled with the Royals on their trip to Chicago and is “tracking well,” per manager Mike Matheny, swinging and fielding pregame each day. Pasquantino is eligible to come off the IL on Friday, and he seems primed to return to the Royals’ lineup at some point during the weekend or early next week.\nKevin O’Brien at Royals Reporter makes the case for bringing Zack Greinke back next year.\n\nGreinke’s home ERA is 4.35 points LOWER than his ERA on the road which is pretty remarkable. He seems to not only benefit from the pitcher-friendly yard (only one home run at the K in comparison to 13 on the road), but he also seems to command the ball better at home as well (3.33 K/BB ratio at the K in comparison to a 2.83 K/BB ratio away).\nBut, what could get in the way of a Greinke return to the Royals in 2023?\nWell, a big roadblock could be Greinke himself.\n\nMLB.com writers list the most underappreciated player for each team.\n\nRoyals: Brady Singer, RHP\nThe Royals have been waiting on their 2018 first-round pick to work himself into a reliable rotation piece, but he has been more than that this year: He has been an ace, one who gives the Royals a chance to win every time he takes the mound.\n\nJacob Milham at Inside the Royals writes about the Royals prospects to watch in September.\nThe Royals signed power-hitting catcher Jakson Reetz to a minor league deal and assigned him to Omaha.\nThe Giants and Padres will play a regular season series in Mexico City next year.\nWhite Sox manager Tony LaRussa is out indefinitely with health issues.\nFormer Phillies GM Lee Thomas dies at the age of 86.\nJon Heyman writes that Roger Maris, not Barry Bonds, owns the single-season home run record.\nWhat are the top storylines in baseball in September?\nSinclair Broadcasting signals they may sell their regional sports networks, including Bally Sports Kansas City.\nPitcher Carlos Martinez receives an 85-game suspension for violating MLB’s domestic abuse policy.\nMLB argues in court that they pulled Angel Hernandez from working a World Series game after getting overturned three times in the playoffs.\nBroncos quarterback Russell Wilson signs a five-year, $245 million contract extension.\nThe Utah Jazz trade star Donovan Mitchell to the Cleveland Cavaliers.\nA private company plans to send a probe to Venus next year, but it will have just five minutes to look for signs of life.\nIs the internet killing the nude beach?\nAmazon is betting a lot of money on its new Lord of the Rings show.\nYour song of the day is Ass Ponys with Little Bastard.",

        "description": "Photo by Michael Owens/Getty Images\n    \n\n  It seems Tony Gonsolin might miss more than just the two starts previously expected on his injured list stint with a right forearm strain. The Dodgers right-hander will undergo an MRI exam on Friday in Los Angeles after suffering a setback.\nGonsolin hasn’t progressed as well as the Dodgers have hoped, Juan Toribio at MLB.com notes.\nDave Roberts on Thursday in New York told reporters, per Bill Plunkett at the Orange County Register, “Tony is gonna be shut down for a few more days. ... We’ll see where it goes. I just don’t know. I said initially it’s only going to be two starts. That’s still our hope. I’ll leave it at that.”\nGonsolin has a 2.10 ERA and 3.34 FIP in 23 starts this season, with 116 starts in 128⅓ innings, the latter eleven innings shy of his professional career high. Gonsolin led the National League in ERA when he was placed on the injured list Monday, but fell off the leaderboard on Wednesday with fewer than one inning per Dodgers team game.\nBrusdar Graterol, who was placed on the injured list Thursday with right elbow inflammation, is also expected to get an MRI, which makes for an eventful weekend for a pair of pitchers expected to play key roles in October.\nLinks\n\nFabian Ardaya at The Athletic on the importance of getting a healthy Clayton Kershaw back.\nFormer big league outfielder Chris Dickerson, who co-founded the nonprofit organization Players for the Planet, is not a fan of the increased travel, and subsequent carbon footprint, of MLB’s new schedule.

Hoornstra at the Orange County Register about the schedule, and Hoornstra offered a suggestion for realignment.\nCody Thomas was called up to the A’s on Thursday as September rosters expanded, and went 1-for-2. The outfielder was traded by the Dodgers to Oakland with left-hander Adam Kolarek in February 2021 for Sheldon Neuse and pitcher Gus Varland. Thomas was drafted by the Dodgers in the 13th round in 2016, making him the 14th player drafted and signed by LA that year to reach the majors.\nFrom Amazin’ Avenue’s Chris McShane, the Mets and Timmy Trumpet beautifully mixed live music and baseball on Wednesday.",

        "description": "Dan Brink\n    \n\n  With the Yankees idle last night, we’ll compare Judge’s home run pace to a few more monster seasons. Welcome back to the Aaron Judge Home Run Record Tracker! We’re taking a daily look at where Aaron Judge’s monster season tracks compared to some of the other historic single-season home run leaders in anticipation of Judge potentially joining their ranks. We’ll be going by Team Game because not every player’s seasons were in sync with the calendar days and everyone didn’t play all of the team’s games, which makes this our universal standard.\nJake, Madison, and I have been doing this post every day for the past week as the Yankees have played games and tweaked the necessary check-in points. However, the Yankees were off yesterday, so all is stagnant with Judge and the usual suspects — Roger Maris ‘61, Barry Bonds ‘01, etc. Nonetheless, we’ve enjoyed peaking in on how Judge’s pace at 51 bombs compares to these historic campaigns, so for the offday, we’ll do the same with a few other notable seasons.\nMark McGwire and Sammy Sosa followed up their iconic 1998 chase for 62 with an oft-forgotten sequel in ‘99, as they each surpassed Maris again: 65 for “Big Mac” and 63 for “Slammin’ Sammy.” Due to injuries and early retirement, that was McGwire’s last true hurrah, but Sosa clubbed 64 dingers in 2001, though he once again* finished second to a home run king (Bonds). And while Judge’s now-teammate Giancarlo Stanton couldn’t quite reach 60 during his MVP 2017 with the Marlins, his 59 marks the closest that anyone has come to that threshold since Bonds. (Plus, there’s actually quality video of him!)\n*In one of my favorite fun facts, none of Sosa’s record three 60-homer years ever led the league, though he did win crowns with “only” 50 and 49 in 2000 and 2002, respectively.\nGiancarlo Stanton through Game 131 of 2017: 51 HR\nTeam Game 131: 8/29 — 1-for-3, 1 HR, 2 RBI, 1 BB (1 IBB), 1 SF, 1 K\nTwo days after becoming the first Marlins player to ever cross the 50-homer plateau, Giancarlo Stanton was at it again. It was a cold, wet night in DC and Max Scherzer had held him hitless the previous day, but Edwin Jackson was no Max Scherzer. In his first at-bat, Stanton went deep for No. 51. Later on, he launched a ball 386 feet in a bid for No. 52, but it died at the left-center-field warning track, so he had to settle for a sacrifice fly.\nThe Marlins lost, 7-3. They were lousy in 2017, so don’t expect to hear much about in-game heroics from this under-.500 team.\n\nMark McGwire through Game 131 of 1999: 51 HR\nTeam Game 131: 8/29 — 0-for-4, 2 BB (1 IBB), 1 K\nMark McGwire had impressively matched his 1998 home run pace with 50 through his first 118 games of ‘99, but this was around when he faltered — by his standards, anyway. McGwire cracked just 5 in his next 20 games, and this was one of those blank nights. John Smoltz held him hitless as the Braves won in 12 innings on Chipper Jones’ homer.\nSammy Sosa through Game 131 of 1999: 55 HR\nTeam Game 131: 8/31 — 1-for-3, 1 HR, 2 RBI, 1 K\nSammy Sosa was on fire after the ‘99 All-Star break, belting a ridiculous 25 homers in 48 games to bring him to 55 through the end of August. That pace through 131 is only surpassed in MLB history by 2001 Bonds, though a merely adequate September slowed him down. This was Sosa’s 15th and final bomb of August, a ninth-inning shot at old Qualcomm Stadium off Andy Ashby, who shook it off to finish his complete game.\n\nSammy Sosa through Game 131 of 2001: 52 HR\nTeam Game 131: 8/28 — 2-for-6, 1 HR, 2 RBI, 1 BB (1 IBB), 2 K\nSammy just loved months of absurd homer totals. He famously walloped a record 20 in June of ‘98, hit 15 in August of ‘99 (as noted above), and then smacked 17 in August of ‘01. Remarkably, he was just four homers behind Bonds after this first-inning missile against future teammate Ryan Dempster. Alas, it did not continue.\n\n\nAs a a reminder, here’s how the most familiar big-homer seasons fared through 131 games, with Madison’s excerpt on Judge from yesterday included.\nAaron Judge through Game 131 of 2022: 51 HR\nTeam Game 131: 8/31 — 0-for-2, 2 BB, 2 K, 1 SB“It was probably asking for too much to see Judge hit a home run in three straight games, but you never know with a slugger this good. Alas, Judge did not manage to do so, working a couple of walks and stealing a base in the ninth inning instead. Judge was the tying run in that instance, but the Yankees couldn’t do anything after he got to second base and dropped another nail-biter.”\nRoger Maris through Game 131 of 1961: 51 HR\nBabe Ruth through Game 131 of 1927: 44 HR\nBarry Bonds through Game 131 of 2001: 56 HR\nMark McGwire through Game 131 of 1998: 53 HR\nSammy Sosa through Game 131 of 1998: 51 HR",

        "description": "Karl Merton Ferron/Baltimore Sun/Tribune News Service via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Colton Cowser, Jordan Westburg and Connor Norby homer in team losses while Bowie’s Noah Denoyer and Aberdeen’s Xavier Moore impress in relief. \nTriple-A: Lehigh Valley IronPigs (Phillies) 13, Norfolk Tides 6\n\nWell… Norfolk was in a seven-run hole before they ever got on the board, so not an easy one to win. The game actually began with three scoreless innings from Beau Sulser, but after him came a trio of some suckitude: Travis Lakins Sr. (L, 0-1) allowed four runs in 1.1 innings. Zac Lowther gave up three runs in 1.2 innings on a two-run triple and a wild pitch. And new guy Phoenix Sanders allowed four more, courtesy of an RBI single and a three-run home run. Morgan McSweeney threw a scoreless eighth, but Pat Conroy allowed the 12th and 13th Lehigh runs to score in the ninth. \nOther than that, Mrs. Lincoln? Well, Tides hitters did stay competitive even in a blowout, putting up six runs in the final four innings, five coming on a pair of long balls. One was a two-run bomb off the bat of Colton Cowser, his 15th of the year and first hit with Norfolk. The other was Jordan Westburg’s 14th of the season for the Tides, good for three runs. Catcher Brett Cumberland also had three hits.\n\nDouble-A: Erie SeaWolves (Tigers) 3, Bowie Baysox 2\n\nIt was a good day for both bullpens, as neither team scored a run after the second inning. Justin Ambruester (4-1, 3.81 ERA) got stuck with the loss after allowing three runs on two home runs in the first inning. He’d go three innings, striking out five, so it wasn’t a bad day. After that Noah “The Destroyer” Denoyer was spotless, throwing four scoreless/hitless innings in which he struck out six. Wow. Connor Loeprich pitched a scoreless eighth inning, allowing one hit and striking out two hitters. \nNot a great deal of offense for the Baysox, as you could tell: they put up six total hits, only two for extra bases. One was an Andrew Daschbach double; the other was a solo home run by Connor Norby (his fifteenth of the season). Norby also added a single on a 2-for-4 day. Coby Mayo singled to lead off the second inning, advanced to second on a Toby Welk walk (1-for-3, BB), and scored the Baysox’s second and final run on a single by Andrés Angulo, a catcher signed to a minor league deal in February. \n\nHigh-A: Aberdeen IronBirds 4, Hickory Crawdads (Rangers) 3 \n\nIt’s not easy to win when your No. 1-4 hitters (Billy Cook, Heston Kjerstad, TT Bowens and Trendon Craig) go a combined 0-for-11 with one walk, but Aberdeen did just that, lifted by a two-triple performance from Donta’ Williams. Williams also scored two runs, both courtesy of Jud Fabian, who hit a sac fly and a single. Catcher Ramon Rodriguez singled, doubled, and scored. Chris Givin went 1-for-2 with a run scored. \nThe real spotlight here, however, was on Grayson Rodriguez in his first rehab outing since he strained his lat back in June. G-Rod, on a strict pitch count, threw just 31 pitches in 1.1 innings, allowing zero runs on one hit, two walks, and one swinging strikeout. But his fastball velo reportedly got up to 98 mph and, in his words, he felt healthy and was finally able to “let it eat.” It’s nice to see G-Rod back out on the mound. Peter van Loon provided valuable length (5.0 IP, 2 R, 1 H, 4 BB, 5 SO). Kade Strowd allowed the Crawdads’ third run to squeak in in the eighth inning, which put closer Xavier Moore in a high-leverage save situation, protecting a one-run lead in the ninth. Moore (1.44 ERA, 52 K is 30.1 IP) did not come to play around: he struck out the side. \n\nLow-A: Fredericksburg Nationals 11, Delmarva Shorebirds 9\n\nThis one was, as a certain CC writer likes to put it, a donnybrook. Fredericksburg raced out to a 4-0 lead but Delmarva responded with eight runs of their own. Their lead lasted only half an inning, as Fredericksburg scored five runs off relievers Ryan Long and Cooper Chandler. The Shorebirds closed the gap with a home run in the ninth inning, and even got the tying run to the plate, but the rally died with two consecutive strikeouts. \nShorebirds starter Deivy Cruz threw a rocky 3.1 innings, with six runs allowed on six hits, four walks, a HBP and a wild pitch. It was a bit of a hot mess. \nAnother decent day for the Shorebirds offense, which put up nine hits and took seven walks, but again, not enough to overcome a pitching meltdown. No. 9 hitter Noelberth Romero had three hits and scored two runs. Carter Young hit a run-scoring double and homered in the ninth. Dylan Beavers hit two doubles. Former Terp Maxwell Costes went 1-for-2 with a two-run single. Jackson Holliday drove in two runs with a single and an RBI groundout. Elío Prado worked an RBI walk. \nBox scores for Thursday’s games can be found here.\nFriday’s Scheduled Games\n\nTriple-A Norfolk: vs Lehigh Valley, 7:05.

        "description": "President’s Biden’s forgiveness of up to $20,000 of the amounts owed on 45 million outstanding student loans represents the official death knell of any semblance of market discipline in America. Unfortunately, his administration has not been alone in giving away taxpayer money without attaching strings to ensure that everyone has some skin in the game.\n\n\n\nHigher education is a good thing, and the more well-educated people we have, and the better educated they are, the better it is for the nation. But there are much better ways to achieve those goals than by using taxpayer money in undisciplined ways that distort the incentives underlying financial markets. \n\n\n\nGovernment subsidies abound, and it may indeed be in the public interest from time to time to accept the moral hazard that accompanies a massive taxpayer-funded bailout when the benefit outweighs the moral hazard created. But this delicate balance increasingly seems to be relying on political expediency rather than financial reality.\n\n\n\nThe ultimate cost to U.S. taxpayers from student loan forgiveness may exceed $500 billion, or about one-third of the $1.6 trillion outstanding student debt. That is roughly equivalent to the time-adjusted price tag for the entire savings and loan crisis — a cost authorized by Congress, not just the president or a single political party.\n\n\n\nStudents can now freely walk away from $20,000 of their debt without committing to serve at a non-profit, in the military or in federal, state, tribal or local government office — factors that under current rules can be the basis for extraordinary student loan relief. The Treasury will simply write a check to the ultimate holders of the loan for most of the amount forgiven or write that amount off the federal ledgers, leaving the taxpayers to once again foot the bill. But consider the moral hazard created. If you had another $50,000 of student loans left, would you pay another dime?\n\n\n\nThis is only the tip of the financial iceberg that government largesse has constructed. Since 1980, the total cost of both four-year public and private college has nearly tripled, even after accounting for inflation. Because the federal government lends students the money to subsidize these skyrocketing fees, any sense of market discipline is completely obliterated, particularly when universities do not share in the loss. Unfortunately, it’s not just students and universities that the government has incentivized to disassociate themselves from reality.\n\n\n\nThe government has created so many financial safety nets that there is a national expectation that consumer and institutional markets will be bailed out when things get tough enough. In the Great Depression, taxpayer money was used to fund a wide array of job-creating activities, including the construction of the Hoover Dam, subsidization of farmers and the hiring of authors to write state guidebooks.\n\n\n\nSince then, depositors of failed financial institutions, car manufacturers, insurance companies, airlines, small businesses, investment banks and mutual funds all have enjoyed some sort of bailout subject to varying degrees of financial pain. Rational fiscal policy would suggest that there be rules that condition government largesse and that they include meaningful commitments and limitations if we are serious about not distorting the incentives and risks that make markets work.\n\n\n\nIn the 1980s, when the failure of Continental Illinois and 3,000 financial institutions threatened the national economy, significant costs were imposed on senior management, directors and stockholders in return for the use of government money.\n\n\n\nThe authors of the 2020 book “The Rise of Carry” suggest that when the government continuously bails out financial markets without significant strings attached, it is actually incentivizing large financial entities to take excessive risk to maximize short-term profits (and annual compensation packages), expecting that the government will come forward with a taxpayer-funded bailout when the bubble explodes.  \n\n\n\nThe Founders would be appalled to see taxpayers subsidizing financial companies that take massive risks, student borrowers that walk away from their loan commitments when the vast majority of our youth do not attend or graduate college and wealthy educational institutions that increasingly charge unbelievable sums to support their unrestrained infrastructures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe more we forget about the importance of skin in the game, the more we ensure that taxpayer-funded bailouts will beget even more taxpayer-funded bailouts. We should care about that, even if politicians no longer seem to.\n\n\n\nThomas P.

        "description": "A series of experiments that included stickleback fish hookups, CRISPR, and lake hopping has confirmed a long-standing, yet unproven, assumption about natural evolution.\nIt also debunks a talking point favored by proponents of intelligent design, who have argued that naturally occurring mutations will only damage or destroy an animal and can&#8217;t lead to useful new traits and body structures.\nThe researchers identified repeated changes in the regulation of a key developmental gene that increase the number and govern the length of the major defensive spines of a fish called the stickleback. New spine traits improve the fish&#8217;s survival in the face of varying predators—flying in the face of a key assertion by anti-evolutionists that major changes will always leave animals unfit to survive in the wild.\n&#8220;Scientists already know that changes in the regulation of this gene, called HOX, control the development of major body structures during development,&#8221; says David Kingsley, professor of developmental biology at Stanford University. &#8220;What&#8217;s new is that we conclusively show that mutations in this gene produce major changes in wild animals—new features that help fish thrive in natural environments.\n&#8220;Our findings refute the common argument that these types of genes are so important, so fundamental, that animals with mutations in these regions wouldn&#8217;t survive in nature—that if you play with master regulators, you&#8217;re only going to make a hopeless monster.&#8221;\nKingsley is the senior author of the research, which appears in Nature Ecology and Evolution. Graduate student Julia Wucherpfennig is the lead author of the study.\nAlthough the concept of evolution is widely accepted, it can happen in different ways. Regressive evolution is the loss of existing, previously useful but now disadvantageous or useless traits, resulting in an animal that is more suited to its natural environment. These changes are almost always either neutral—think about cave fish that have lost their eyes after generations in darkness—or helpful, as in early humans&#8217; shedding the hairy suit of our ape relatives, enabling us to chase prey for long distances without getting overheated.\nProgressive evolution\nIn contrast, progressive evolution occurs when organisms acquire new traits that allow them to outcompete their peers. But such changes are essentially a leap of faith equivalent to rolling the genetic dice and hoping they all come up sixes. Smaller, more gradual changes are less risky. Big structural changes, sometimes called large-effect mutations, can be particularly dicey: Imagine one day you strut out of your apartment sporting a third leg, or two heads. Would you have an advantage over your neighbors when you run for the bus, or are you more likely to trip and fall head(s)-first into traffic?\nAlthough there have been some instances in which animals have gained beneficial traits in nature from changes in HOX genes—fruit flies evolved specific patterns of sensory bristles on their legs and some honeybees gained distinctive coloring on their abdomens—most major structural gains caused by mutations in these regions have been detrimental.\n&#8220;Laboratory-bred four-winged fruit flies are a famous example of how relatively simple genetic alterations in regulatory regions of the HOX genes can dramatically change the body shape of an animal,&#8221; Kingsley says. &#8220;But because these flies can&#8217;t survive in the wild, anti-evolution proponents have seized on them—not as good examples of how genes drive evolution, but as proof that gene changes can only make animals less functional.&#8221;\nTwo- to four-inch-long stickleback fish, which sport varying numbers of pointy spines along their backs, are great research subjects because they evolve rapidly and dramatically in response to changing environmental conditions. A lake rife with fish-eating insects often houses sticklebacks with fewer and shorter spines to grab. But a pond with larger fish or birds that swallow their fish sticks whole is likely to boast a population of sticklebacks with longer, more numerous, throat-scratching spines. Forests of watery weeds are great for flexible, slippery fish who can hide in the vegetation, while in the open ocean, armored plates and formidable spines are the way to go.\nThe Kingsley lab started the study with a spot of watery matchmaking. Previous graduate students crossed a two-spined female stickleback from a freshwater lake in British Columbia with a three-spined male stickleback from the salty waters of Bodega Bay, California. They then crossed the progeny from that match with one another and analyzed the number and shape of their spines. Most of the 590 grand-fish had three spines, but six had two spines and 21 had four spines—more than any of their ancestors. Extensive genetic studies of the variably spined fish pinpointed differences in the region around a gene called HOXDB, which is a member of the HOX family of genes.\nStickleback fish with new structures\nWucherpfennig continued collecting and crossing sticklebacks from myriad North American lakes and streams, studying their genetic makeup and using CRISPR methods to confirm the effects of the HOXDB gene on dorsal spines. She found a panel of changes in regions near the HOXDB gene and showed they were associated with major anatomical changes that are evolving in the defensive armor of wild fish.\n&#8220;In Nova Scotia, some of the stickleback populations have evolved to have five or even six spines,&#8221; Kingsley says. &#8220;Nature left the coding region of this gene intact but altered how and when it is expressed during normal development to add structures rather than stripping them away. And fish with these new structures are thriving in a completely wild environment subjected to a whole range of environmental pressures.&#8221;\nWucherpfennig and her colleagues show that repeated changes in the regulatory regions of the HOXDB gene are responsible for the recent evolution of new spine patterns in two different stickleback species she studied from across North America. They are now interested in learning whether similar changes are responsible for differences in fish that are even more distantly related.\n&#8220;Are there predictable rules that govern evolutionary change?&#8221; Kingsley says. &#8220;Are natural species using the same trick over and over, or do they have to invent a new trick each time? So far, it&#8217;s been the same gene even in these very divergent sticklebacks from different environments. Here we show that nature routinely adds major structures to generate animals that are more suited to the environment, and that it does so repeatedly using the same master regulatory gene. It&#8217;s a decisive argument for progressive evolution, which has been debated in academic and non-academic circles for decades.&#8221;\nResearchers from Duke University School of Medicine, the University of Victoria, UC Berkeley, and Saint Mary&#8217;s University in Nova Scotia contributed to the study.\nThe research had support from the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, a Stanford graduate fellowship, a Helen Hay Whitney Postdoctoral Fellowship, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.\nSource: Stanford University\nThe post Stickleback fish refute &#8216;hopeless monster&#8217; theory appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "President Joe Biden last night used the backdrop of Philadelphia’s Independence Hall to accuse his political opponents of betraying American democracy. The complaints from GOP leaders are loud. How dare Biden use this birthplace of the republic to speak that way about former President Donald Trump and his tens of millions of supporters?During his presidency, Trump repeatedly used places of national memory for partisan purposes. He gave a slashing partisan interview to Fox News from the Lincoln Memorial. At Mount Rushmore, he denounced “a new far-left fascism” that seeks “to wipe out our history, defame our heroes, erase our values and indoctrinate our children.” Accepting the 2020 Republican nomination on the grounds of the White House, he predicted that his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden, would be “the destroyer of American greatness.”These deviations from past custom elicited some tut-tutting from a few who cared. But the complaints were ineffectual; Trump did it again and again.So last night, President Biden followed the old adage: If you can’t beat them, join them. He briefly drew a distinction between those Trump-loyal Republicans and the bulk of the Republican Party. But that was a mere courtesy, because he almost immediately added, “There’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven, and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans.” Biden presented the 2022 ballot question as a stark choice between right (his party) and wrong (the party that has become Trump’s party).“Ladies and gentlemen,” he said, “we can’t be pro-insurrectionist and pro-American. They’re incompatible. We can’t allow violence to be normalized in this country. It’s wrong.”[David Frum: Kevin McCarthy, have you no sense of decency?]To drive home what the speech was all about, Biden turned at the end from his defense of democracy to a reminder of his party’s record of accomplishments over the past two years: COVID relief, infrastructure spending, action to reduce prescription-drug costs, action to slow climate change. (An interesting indication of what Democrats are learning from their polling was that student-debt relief went unmentioned in Biden’s list.)The response from Biden’s Republican opponents has been hotter than mere tut-tutting. Biden’s sharp speech has only one justification: So much of it is true.“There are public figures today, yesterday, and the day before predicting and all but calling for mass violence and rioting in the streets,” Biden said. That’s a reference to the threats from Senator Lindsey Graham and others of “rioting in the streets” if Trump were to face charges for taking classified documents home with him after he left the White House.“We’ve seen election officials, poll workers, many of them volunteers of both parties, subject to intimidation and death threats,” Biden said. As he could have said but did not, the intimidation and threats have come almost exclusively from Trump supporters in the grip of delusions about the 2020 election spread by the defeated ex-president.“FBI agents just doing their job as directed, facing threats to their own lives from their own fellow citizens,” Biden said. He could have added that those threats were encouraged when Trump released information about the search at Mar-a-Lago and did not redact the names of the agents whose job it was to execute the search.“I will not stand by and watch the most fundamental freedom in this country, the freedom to vote and have your vote counted, … be taken from you and the American people,” Biden said. In state after state, Republicans are nominating candidates—and appointing officials—who are committed to exactly that.“We hear—you’ve heard it—more and more talk about violence as an acceptable political tool in this country,” Biden said. That’s a reference to the fantasies of “Civil War II” being promoted by right-wing chat groups. Those fantasies have led two in five Americans to fear (or hope) that a second civil war could happen in the next 10 years, according to one opinion poll.[David A. Graham: Trump can’t hide from the Mar-a-Lago photo]Whatever was true four, five, or six years ago, in 2022 Trumpism cannot be regarded as some anomalous strain in U.S. politics. What began as deviation has become mainstream. What once could be minimized as a recessive tendency within the Republican Party has become the dominant one.Facing that reality is the way to prevent it from doing worse harm. Only recognition of that unwelcome new reality can change behaviors across American politics—not just those of Trump supporters, but also those of Trump opponents.Biden won a great many votes in 2020 from people who did not especially support the Democratic agenda but hoped that a Biden presidency would restore politics as normal in the United States. They hoped that the defeat of Trump would jolt his party back toward accepting the rules of the democratic game. (I know because I was one of those who hoped so. I did not fully believe so, but I fiercely hoped so.)Those hopes have been brutally dashed since January 6, 2021. Trumpism is not the repudiated past of the Republican Party. It’s the party’s near-term future. If Republicans gain control of one or both houses of Congress in 2022, and in almost any state where they wield power, Trumpism is the country’s near-term future.For American women especially, what’s on the ballot in 2022 is a referendum on the policing and controlling of their most intimate rights—in ways that will unite the most retrograde ideas of women’s place in society with the newest technologies of surveillance.Trump changed the rules of politics. Everybody, on all sides of politics, has no choice but to adapt. You may feel nostalgia for other days, but these are your days.",

We&#8217;ve heard about the company&#8217;s game control overlay before, but today, it&#8217;s announced and shown off this incredibly neat tool.\n\n\n\nStarting with an alpha release for select games (below), Google has revealed that this &#8220;game controls feature&#8221; is meant to quickly get you into the action, especially on ChromeOS devices (like those without touchscreens). To clarify, the tech giant&#8217;s &#8220;workaround&#8221; is not meant to be seen as a replacement for devs doing the work to implement support for peripherals. The focus is instead on the end user who often has to wait many years for developers to add something that most have no intention of taking the time to support. Because there&#8217;s historically been little need or want for peripheral support on games created for touchscreen phones, who could blame them?\n\n\n\nHowever, with the release of Google Play Games for PC, along with many handheld gaming accessories like the Backbone One and the GameSir X3 taking the market by storm, the idea of using a powerful mini-PC that&#8217;s always on your person for more tangible gaming experiences is no longer so far fetched or undesirable.\n\n\n\nWith that out of the way, let&#8217;s take a look at this new game control overlay for Android games, shall we? Below, you&#8217;ll notice that there is a new game controller icon on the right side of the screen. Similar to the Play Games floating action button, tapping this will open well, an overlay, that can be used to access several options.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen first opening a game with game controls support, there will be an overlay showing the keys you can use to simulate various touches on screen via the keyboard. Currently, game controls can send keyboard input as tap actions and simulate touch-and-drag interactions commonly used for on-screen virtual joysticks/dpads. You can customize the key bindings via the game controls menu, which you can access by clicking the white square hovering on the right center portion of the game&#x2019;s window.ChromeOS.dev\n\n\n\nYou can map specific keyboard keys to the screen to simulate tap or tap and drag actions like joystick movement. Let&#8217;s say for example that you want to tie the commonly used W,A,S, and D keys to the movement of your character in games where you use a virtual joypad on the screen to do just that. Well, you can! This alone is so significant for games like Order &amp; Chaos and other titles that don&#8217;t have keyboard support naturally built-in that it can&#8217;t be understated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe first batch of games to support the control overlay are limited, but Google hopes to appeal to a wide range of ChromeOS gamers in the future. Let me know in the comments which games you hope they add next. Google says it&#8217;s adding an editor to make adding game controls support possible for just about any game from the Play Store that Chromebooks run, so mouse, gamepad support and even addition types of touch interactions should all be a snap in the future!\n\n\n\n\n\nJoystick games\n\n\n\nArchero&#x2060;AXES.io&#x2060;Heroics Epic Legend of Archero&#x2060;Wizard Legend: Fighting Master&#x2060;Pixel Blade R &#8211; Revolution&#x2060;Zombero: Archero Hero Shooter&#x2060;Archer Hunter &#8211; Offline Action Adventure Game&#x2060;Mr. Autofier&#x2060;\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle button games\n\n\n\nGeometry Dash Lite&#x2060;Stack Ball &#8211; Crash Platforms&#x2060;Fire Balls 3D&#x2060;Stack Smash&#x2060;Drop Stack Ball &#8211; Fall Helix Blast Crash 3D&#x2060;Helix Smash&#x2060;Stack Crush Ball&#x2060;Crush Stack Ball Blast&#x2060;Stack Fall&#x2060;Helix Stack Jump: Smash Ball&#x2060;Tap Titans 2&#x2060;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMulti-button games\n\n\n\nHill Climb Racing&#x2060;Ninja Arashi 2&#x2060;Ninja Arashi&#x2060;Ninja warrior: legend of adventure games&#x2060;Power Hover&#x2060;Grimvalor&#x2060;\n\n\n\n\n\nSwipe games\n\n\n\n2048 (Androbaby)&#x2060;2048 Original&#x2060;2048 (Solebon LLC)&#x2060;2048 Number puzzle game&#x2060;2048 (S2 Apps)&#x2060;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson announced on Thursday that the state government is working with police to investigate a possible illegal selling of a voter assist terminal.\n\n\n\n“We are actively working with law enforcement to investigate allegations of an illegal attempt to sell a voter assist terminal acquired in Michigan,” Benson wrote in a statement.\n\n\n\nBenson explained that a voter assist terminal is normally used to assist voters, often those with disabilities, who require help in marking their ballots.\n\n\n\n“While our elections remain secure and safe, we take seriously all violations of election law and will be working with relevant authorities to ensure there are consequences for those who break the law.”\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Benson for further comment on the situation.\n\n\n\nMichigan election law prevents citizens from withholding, breaking or destroying voting equipment, as well as obtaining “undue possession” of a voting machine.\n\n\n\nBenson cited an article written by Michigan’s Cadillac News saying that the voting machine was sold through Goodwill’s online auction site as well as listed on the popular auction site eBay.\n\n\n\nThe machine disappeared from the Colfax Township in Wexford County, Michigan.\n\n\n\n“It was a touchscreen VAT machine,” Wexford County Clerk Alaina Nyman told Cadillac News of the sold voting equipment, referring to a voter assist terminal.\n\n\n\n“No election data was on it and you can’t get into the machine without the program cards and those were all accounted for.”\n\n\n\nNyman added that the investigation is attempting to discover how the voting machine was acquired by its seller and when it went missing.\n\n\n\n“We are going to do things differently and will sign things in and out,” Colfax Township Clerk Becky Stoddard told Cadillac News, discussing future responses to the disappearance of the VAT machine.",

growth slowed slightly in August but remained well above pre-pandemic levels as steady consumer spending powered another strong month of hiring.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. added 315,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose to 3.7 percent, according to data released Friday by the Labor Department, up from 3.5 percent in August.\n\n\n\nEconomists expected the U.S. to gain roughly 300,000 jobs last month without the unemployment rate budging, according to consensus estimates. While the unemployment rate rose by 0.2 percentage points, the labor force participation rate also rose by 0.3 percentage points, to 62.4 percent. \n\n\n\n\"Given how low the unemployment rate is now and the slowing economy, ongoing improvement in the unemployment rate is likely to be inconsistent,\" wrote Daniel Zhao, senior economist at Glassdoor, in a Friday analysis.\n\n\n\n\"However, the rise in unemployment is not an immediate red flag as it was married with a rising labor force participation rate,\" he continued.\n\n\n\nRising unemployment and slowing job gains are rarely good news for an economy. But the August jobs report showed the economy moving toward ample job growth and lower inflation. \n\n\n\nThe U.S. has recovered all of the 21 million jobs lost at the onset of the pandemic and has already added close to 3 million jobs in 2022 alone. But businesses have still struggled to hire enough workers to meet intense demand from consumers, even after raising wages at rapid rates.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome economists and policymakers have been concerned that the national labor shortage could be fueling high inflation by forcing businesses boost wages and prices quickly. As the size of the workforce increases, businesses may have an easier time finding workers without having to raise wages at rapid rates. That could also help businesses keep their prices stable and sap momentum from inflation.\n\n\n\n\"The best news in this jobs report is that the unemployment rate went up. It did so for all the right reasons: people are coming back to the labor force. And so despite stiff headwinds—inflation, rising interest rates, a strong dollar—employers are finding it a little bit easier to hire,\" wrote Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, in a Friday analysis.\n\n\n\nWage growth slowed slightly in August as more workers entered the job market, posting a 0.3 percent monthly gain. Wages are up 5.2 percent on the year, but would have only increased 3.6 percent at August's pace of earnings growth.\n\n\n\n\"Cooling wage growth and rising labor force participation keep the labor market on course for a soft landing where job gains can continue without adding to inflationary pressures,\" Zhao wrote.\n\n\n\nThe U.S has now gained 240,000 more jobs than it had before the pandemic derailed the economy in March 2020, with several sectors well above their pre-COVID-19 employment levels.\n\n\n\nProfessional and business services firms led all other sectors last month with a gain of 68,000 jobs and has added 1.1 million jobs over the past 12 months. Retail trade companies added 44,000 jobs in August.\n\n\n\nHealth care employment rose by 48,000, but remains 37,000 workers short of pre-pandemic levels despite the rising need for medical services. \n\n\n\nThe leisure and hospitality sector also added 31,000 jobs in August, a notable decrease from several months of rapid job growth. The industry is still 1.2 million jobs short of its pre-pandemic level.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9:43 a.m.",

        "title": "What Gorbachev taught us about leadership",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3624554-what-gorbachev-taught-us-about-leadership/",
        "description": "Forty-seven years to the day after the United States suffered the then-bloodiest attack on our territory at Pearl Harbor, our nation exited an era of continuous fear of annihilation. From World War II through the Cold War, first the Japanese and German war machines and then the Soviet military had threatened to destroy the United States and its most vital partners around the world.\n\n\n\nBut on Dec. 7, 1988 a most unlikely hero, Soviet General Secretary Mikhail Gorbachev, opened a new pathway to peace.\n\n\n\nSpeaking to the United Nations General Assembly, the heir to Joseph Stalin’s brutal empire transformed international politics. He already had begun by allowing more free speech and movement in Soviet territories that had before suffered oppression and tyranny. He had signed a treaty with the United States eliminating a whole class of intermediate nuclear missiles. Now, he did the unthinkable: He unilaterally slashed his forces in Central Europe — the crucible of the most fraught and terrifying conflict for the last half-century. Gorbachev announced the unconditional withdrawal of 50,000 soldiers and 5,000 tanks from the countries his predecessors had fought so hard to dominate: East Germany, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. Overall, the Soviet Union would eliminate 500,000 soldiers from the fearsome Red Army.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis was just the beginning of what would become a sprint for peace after four decades of arms races.\n\n\n\nFrom the vast concrete hall of the General Assembly, the Soviet leader drove through a warm, boisterous crowd of once cynical, now euphoric New Yorkers to meet President Ronald Reagan and Vice President (and President-Elect) George H.W. Bush on a small island in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty. With the world watching, the current and future leaders of enemy superpowers embraced one another as friends.\n\n\n\nGorbachev had not acted alone; he had a vital partner in Reagan. The American president recounted that, despite their differences, he and Gorbachev had “walked a long way together to clear a path to peace.” Beginning with their first meeting more than three years earlier in Geneva, Reagan said he and the Soviet leader were “two men in a room together who had the capability of creating the next world war, or the capability of bringing peace to the world.” Reagan said “it was evident that they had decided to keep the world at peace.”\n\n\n\nThe Soviet leader responded that “he highly valued their personal rapport,” and although they faced many domestic and international difficulties, together they had begun “movement toward a better world” — the undeniable aspiration of his United Nations speech. Gorbachev explained that his country “had become a different one” — less tyrannical and threatening to those around it. “It would never go back to what it had been three years before,” no matter who was leading it.\n\n\n\nAs the last Cold War leaders bid goodbye, watched by thousands of stunned, joyous onlookers, the last half-century of Russian-American nuclear conflict was fading rapidly into history. The Soviet leader and his American partner had done more than negotiate treaties; they had restored trust between two long-suspicious societies. Gorbachev and Reagan modeled and promoted that trust, and it quickly spread.\n\n\n\nYounger readers who came of age after the Cold War are spared the memories of what it was like to live in that four-decade stand-off: the fear of Soviet tyranny, the unrelenting terror of nuclear weapons, and the constant, gnawing knowledge that every day could be the last day of human existence.\n\n\n\nThis is why the Reagan-Gorbachev moment was so transformative. Now, Americans no longer believed the Soviet Union wanted to annihilate us. Soviet citizens no longer worried that a deranged American president was about to launch a nuclear strike. And soon enough, citizens of East Germany and elsewhere behind the Iron Curtain no longer feared that Moscow would crush their aspirations for freedom as they tore down the long-hated Berlin Wall.\n\n\n\nWe were young witnesses to this incredible transformation. We both graduated from high school in 1990, one of us in New York City, the other in Tucson, Ariz. After an adolescence filled with Cold War fears, in our senior year of high school we felt the exuberance of a flowering of peace and the enormous promise of new freedoms. These changes were captivating and continued into our college years as we saw other visionary leaders such as Lech Walesa, Vaclav Havel, Helmut Kohl, and Nelson Mandela lead their nations — and the world — into new moments of reconciliation, unity, peace and freedom. Together they helped inspire our decisions to become historians and policy scholars. They taught us that cooperation across deep divisions is possible, that longstanding problems can be solved, and that leadership is indispensable.\n\n\n\nNow we are both professors. As we prepare undergraduate and graduate students to take up the mantle of leadership, we are fortunate to have the examples of Gorbachev and Reagan to show a new generation what is possible, even in the most challenging of times. We also share the obvious evidence that, despite Gorbachev’s prediction, the world has retreated to many of the old nightmares because of venal, misguided leadership, accompanied by craven complicity from so many who know better.\n\n\n\nToo many voices now despair for the future. Too many leaders seem intent on fueling conflict, rather than preventing it. Too many citizens have lost hope in an intoxicating swirl of social media rage. Too many scholars have abandoned any belief in the power of leaders to overcome structural challenges and solve big problems.\n\n\n\nThis pessimism has good cause but it is self-defeating. It echoes the low points of the 47 years of conflict after the attack on Pearl Harbor. It neglects how individuals of enormous courage, commitment and integrity ran against the tide and brought warring sides together for mutual gains. It forgets how leaders set aside enmity and chose to make peace.\n\n\n\nWe need leaders who are willing to do the same today. We can try to encourage them, but the drive to abandon hate and encourage hope must come from within the people in power. There is no substitute for leaders who work to unleash what Abraham Lincoln called “the better angels of our nature.” That was the true greatness of Gorbachev that we witnessed, despite his many flaws. That is the greatness a new generation of responsible citizens must find to build peace and partnership again.\n\n\n\nWilliam Inboden is associate professor at the LBJ School of Public Affairs, executive director of the Clements Center for National Security, and a distinguished scholar at the Robert S.

        "description": "A man walks past a &quot;now hiring&quot; sign posted outside of a restaurant in Arlington, Va., on June 3.Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty ImagesThe U.S. job market remains unusually hot heading into the Labor Day weekend. Employers added 315,000 jobs in August, according to a report from the Labor Department. The unemployment rate rose to 3.7 percent from 3.5 percent in July, as nearly 800,000 new people entered the workforce. Employment gains for June and July were revised down by a total of 107,000 jobs.Retailers, factories and health care all added jobs last month. The labor market continues to shine, despite slowing economic growth and rising fears of recession. Earlier this summer, payroll employment rebounded to levels not seen since the start of the pandemic. That leaves workers with more money to spend and helps to support the consumer-driven economy.But a strong labor market also has the potential to fuel even higher inflation at a time when businesses are already struggling to keep up with rising demand for goods and services. Prices in July were up 8.5% from a year ago. Inflation remains near a four-decade high, despite the recent drop in gasoline prices. Employers have added 3.5 million jobs so far this year, and they&#x27;re eager to add more. In July, there were nearly twice as many jobs openings as there were unemployed workers to fill them. Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell worries that mismatch could push wages — and eventually prices — even higher.The number of people working or looking for work rose sharply last month, after falling in the two previous months. The U.S. labor force is still short about 163,000 workers compared to pre-pandemic levels.&quot;The labor market is particularly strong, but it is clearly out of balance, with demand for workers substantially exceeding the supply of available workers,&quot; Powell said last week, while speaking at an economic conference in Jackson Hole, Wyo.The Fed is raising interest rates aggressivelyAverage wages in August were up 5.2 percent from a year ago — unchanged from July.Nela Richardson, chief economist for the payroll processing company ADP, believes wage gains have begun to level off. &quot;Wages have jumped up but they&#x27;ve stabilized,&quot; Richardson said. &quot;And so, depending on your view — half empty or half full — [that] could be interpreted as good news for the future of inflation.&quot;The Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates aggressively in an effort to tamp down demand and bring prices under control.  The central bank has boosted rates by 2.25 percentage points since March. Another rate hike of 0.5 to 0.75 percentage points is expected later this month.Higher interest rates are already taking a toll on the housing market. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage has jumped to 5.66 percent this week, from less than 3 percent a year ago. Both new home construction and the sale of existing homes have slumped as a result. Construction companies added only 16,000 jobs last month.While a few, high-profile businesses like Bed Bath &amp; Beyond have announced job cuts in recent days, most employers are reluctant to lay workers off, despite signs of waning economic growth. New claims for unemployment benefits — a proxy for layoffs — have fallen in each of the last three weeks, and claims remain very low by historical standards. What&#x27;s more, a preliminary estimate from the Labor Department shows job growth in the 12 months ending in March was even stronger than initially reported.  The estimate, released last week, is based on a more comprehensive tally of businesses. It shows there were 462,000 more payroll jobs in March than were reported in the monthly survey. A final job count will be released early next year.   Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Getty Images | Aurich Lawson)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUSB has come a long way since the 12Mbps days of the '90s. It has waved goodbye to USB-B and is inching away from USB-A in favor of the slim, reversible USB-C connector. Data transfer rates have increased so dramatically that we can run powerful setups with high-resolution monitors, speedy external storage, and numerous other devices from the USB Implementers Forum's latest open standard, USB4.\nUSB4 unifies the USB and Intel Thunderbolt protocols for the first time, expanding USB's capabilities while further dividing the technology into different performance classes. Adding features like dynamic bandwidth allocation ensures that USB4 is by far the most advanced USB generation. While there are PCs, docks, and cables supporting USB4, we've yet to see everything the protocol can do, like powering an eGPU without Intel branding.\nWith all that going on, we thought it would be a great time to put a spotlight on the latest and greatest generation of USB. We've whipped up a handy refresher for all things USB4, breaking down the various key aspects of the spec, from how it differs from other specs to protocol tunneling, Alt Mode, and power delivery.\nRead 55 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Photo by Bryan Cereijo/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Amid one of the worst months in franchise history, we still found it our hearts to point out the positives from the month of August. If you or anyone you know watched the Miami Marlins this August, you don’t need us to tell you they aren’t a good baseball team. The Fish played 28 games, lost 20 of them, scored the fewest runs in baseball, had the lowest team OPS, and posted the lowest August batting average (.196) since the 1903 Washington Senators, who hit .192. \nHow do you put an optimistic spin on that?\nOnce again, we’ll try our best. \n\nPitching-First Organization\n\n\nPablo López with the *huge* strikeout to escape the jam!!!6 shutout innings for Pablo  @Marlins | #MakeItMiami pic.twitter.com/pLIJly6Rnl— Bally Sports Florida: Marlins (@BallyMarlins) August 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\nYou may have grown weary of this narrative, but it remains true. While the team’s 20 losses paced all of baseball in the month of August, their collective 3.55 ERA—ranking 11th-best in the majors—suggests that the problem doesn’t lie on the mound.  \nThe Marlins’ two complete games thrown—both authored by Sandy Alcantara—were good enough for 2nd, trailing only the New York Yankees whose starters went the distance three times. Even more absurd is the fact the team’s five shutouts were tops in all of baseball.\nThe team received contributions across the board in the rotation, with Edward Cabrera ringing off 4 consecutive scoreless outings, back-to-back 6-inning starts by Pablo López to finish the month strong, and the pleasant surprise that was Trevor Rogers’ return to the majors on the month’s final day. \nNow if only the team could score some runs for them.\nSandy Avenges a Demon\nThree weeks ago, critiquing Sandy Alcantara’s 2022 season would be like pointing out flaws on the Mona Lisa. \nOn August 21st though, Alcantara came face-to-face with the Los Angeles Dodgers. Against an opponent that could go down among the best single-season teams ever, the results were, shall we say, un-Sandy-like. Lasting just 3 2⁄3 innings in Dodger Stadium in what was his shortest outing of the season, the Dodgers took Alcantara to the cleaners, chasing him for 10 hits and 6 earned runs, both season-worsts. The Marlins ace’s ERA in 4 career starts against the Dodgers to that point: 14.79.\n  \n        \n      Jayne Kamin-Oncea-USA TODAY Sports\n  \n\nSix days later, now pitching in his home environment of LoanDepot Park, Alcantara hit the reset button, shutting down the Dodgers to the tune of 1 run and 10 strikeouts in a complete game victory. His gem in front of a live audience of more than 23,000 spectators that evening serves as an undeniable Marlins season highlight.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile not quite a perfect season, it’s been pretty darn close. With 7.0 rWAR ahead of his scheduled start in Atlanta on Friday, Alcantara appears the runaway winner for NL Cy Young.\n\nFuture on the Farm\n\n\nJordan Groshans9 extra-base hits in 67 AAA games before the trade8 extra-base hits in 22 AAA games since the trade pic.twitter.com/LtcIL3zOWx— Fish Stripes Prospects Coverage (@FishProspects) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\nIf and when he makes his big league debut, fans in Miami will be quick to embrace SS/3B Jordan Groshans. \nThe former 12th overall draft pick was acquired in the deadline deal that saw Zach Pop and Anthony Bass sent to Toronto. He had hit to the tune of a .644 OPS at AAA Buffalo up to that point, but has turned it on since his change of scenery. In his first 23 games and 97 plate appearances in Jacksonville, Groshans has slashed .329/.402/.471 (.873 OPS).\nWith Miguel Rojas continuing to be a non-factor at the plate—.169/.214/.205 in August—and now battling a lingering wrist injury, Groshans may soon be in line to prove himself by facing MLB pitching during the season’s final month.",

        "description": "2023 with a side of Sonny Gray? | Photo by David Berding/Getty Images\n    \n\n  There are four players that have options on the table with the club for next year. It’s September already, so it’s time to look ahead and see what decisions the Minnesota Twins have to make for 2023. The front office has four players that have either a mutual option or a club option for next year’s campaign. There’s a clear option to take advantage of while the other three might end up in free agency this winter.\nChris Archer, mutual option ($10m, $750,000 buyout)\nThe one outlier in this group of options for 2023 is Chris Archer’s, which is a mutual option. Archer has not really proven that he is worth $10 million next season. Although he is tied with Dylan Bundy for the most starts on the team so far this year, he has the least number of innings pitched from a starter’s standpoint, leaving the already over-taxed bullpen to take over after four or less innings most times. “Quality over quantity.” The right-hander may be best suited for a bullpen role, but there have been rumblings that Archer’s approach to warming up is not suitable for the role and with the impending advent of the pitch clock, his whole pitching routine will most likely need to be re-worked. His walk and strikeout rates have flip-flopped from previous years, posting a 1.80 K/BB ratio this season versus a 10.0+ K/BB ratio in most of his previous campaigns.\n\nSonny Gray, club option ($12.5m)\nIt would be absolutely psychotic if the Twins did not exercise their club option on the 10-year veteran for 2023. Sonny Gray has been a ray of sunshine in a cloudy-ish starting rotation this year. His 3.04 ERA is the best among the qualified starters on the team, and although his K/9 is down from previous seasons (down from 10.3 in 2021 to 8.9 this year), he has improved in other areas, such as his BB/9 (2.9, down from 3.3 last year) and HR/9 (0.8, down from 1.3 in 2021). Gray would be a solid piece in a rotation that could include Kenta Maeda, Joe Ryan, Chris Paddack, and Bailey Ober in most of 2023. \n\nDylan Bundy, club option ($11m, $1m buyout)\nThat last sentence is a good segue to talking about Dylan Bundy. Bundy has certainly been serviceable in 2022, but has he done enough to earn $11 million in 2023? He’s improved somewhat from 2021 - he posted a 6.06 ERA/5.51 FIP in 90.2 innings of work - as he’s been holding to a 4.53 ERA/4.26 FIP so far this year. His walk rate has also improved along with how often he’s giving up home runs. If the Twins did not want to fill in the rotation with younger arms to start the season, the front office could pay the $1 million buyout and possibly work out a one-year deal with him. However, with the depth the team has on the starting pitching front, it may be best for the two to part ways after 2022.\n\nMiguel Sano, club option ($14m, $2.75m buyout)\nWe’ve most likely seen the last game of Miguel Sano as a Twins player. Although his power numbers say otherwise (his career .808 OPS is good for a 117 OPS+), the rest of his slash line (.234/.326/.482) along with his strikeout numbers - a whopping 36.5% strikeout rate in his career - are something to grimace and pass at. Although a power bat would be a welcome addition in a Twins lineup, Sano’s strikeout numbers heavily weigh down the chances of the team taking the club option.",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Recap of the series in New York, plus pitching comings and goings We end the week of Leading Off with True Blue LA podcasts with a recap of the Mets series, the first time the Dodgers dropped two games in a row, or lost a series, in over five weeks.\nThursday’s loss featured sloppy play that certainly didn’t help, but the overwhelming takeaway was that Clayton Kershaw looked very good and, more importantly healthy in his first game back after missing four weeks with low back pain.\nKershaw shrugged off early wildness, including his first bases-loaded walk in seven years, to retire his final 13 batters faced (hey, only 16 batters behind Evan Phillips), including six strikeouts.\nThat was good news on a day that Brusdar Graterol landed on the injured list with right elbow inflammation, putting the rest of his season in doubt. Graterol will get an MRI in Los Angeles this weekend, as will starter Tony Gonsolin, who suffered a setback and will be shut down from throwing for a few more days.\nGonsolin was placed on the injured list Monday with a right forearm strain, and that initial thought that he’d only miss two starts sure seems overly optimistic right now.\nThe Dodgers head into the weekend with Blake Treinen ready to be activated and the first of two straight weekend series against the Padres on the docket. Plus, a magic number breakdown.\n\nPodcast links\nWays to listen\nRSS feed\nEpisode link (time: 17:42)",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Your Friday morning dose of Mets and Major League Baseball news, notes, and links. Meet the Mets\nThe Mets took the series finale against the Dodgers yesterday at Citi Field, giving them a win in both the three-game series and the season series against the only team in the National League with a record better than their own. And from here on out, the Mets have the easiest schedule in baseball in terms of their opponents’ combined winning percentage.\nChoose your recap: Amazin’ Avenue, Faith and Fear in Flushing, New York Daily News, New York Post, Newsday\nLike Clayton Kershaw yesterday, Carlos Carrasco will return from the injured list on Sunday without making any rehab appearances first. His absence has been far shorter than Kershaw’s was, though, and he gets to face the Nationals in his return.\nIn other potential return news, Tylor Megill made a relief appearance for Binghamton last night and struck out all three of the batters he faced as he prepares for a return to the Mets in a relief role.\nAnd speaking of injuries, Francisco Álvarez has a loose body in his ankle and does not require surgery at this time. There had been fears that the top catching prospect in baseball would miss the rest of the season.\nIn very important news, if you’re attending the game at Citi Field tonight, Taijuan Walker will be handing out free tacos from 5:30 to 6:30 in partnership with The New York Foundling organization.\nRosters expanded yesterday, and the Mets called up an unexciting pair of players in Deven Marrero and Adonis Medina. Anthony DiComo asked Billy Eppler about the team choosing not to call up Mark Vientos.\nNewsday has you covered if you were wondering about the things that are on Buck Showalter’s mind.\nIf you’re feeling joyous about the Mets’ win over the Dodgers, you are under no obligation to click on the next two links. Joel Sherman is here to rain on your parade by telling you that it’s meaningless because the Dodgers have dropped series to lesser teams this season, too. David Lennon struck a similar tone in trying to downplay the series. You know things are going well for the Mets when writers are trying to discredit the their wins against the best teams rather than their wins against the worst teams.\nAmong other baseball notes, Jon Heyman writes that Max Scherzer thinks bad mechanics are playing a role in baseball injuries. He also wrote about the free agent market.\nAndrew Tredinnick wrote about five things we learned from the Mets’ series with the Dodgers.\nAround the National League East\nSpencer Strider went eight scoreless as the Braves beat the Rockies last night.\nThe Phillies and Marlins were off, but the last-place Nationals beat their fellow cellar-dwelling A’s.\nAround Major League Baseball\nThe Orioles had a busy day, as they called up Jesús Aguilar and beat the Guardians, the latter of which has them 1.5 games behind the Blue Jays for the final Wild Card spot in the American League. FanGraphs looked at why Baltimore’s playoff odds remain so low.\nAlso in the American League playoff race: The Mariners beat the Tigers with ease.\nThe Brewers continue to struggle, as were shut out last night by the Diamondbacks and are three games back of the last Wild Card spot in the National League and 6.5 games back of the division-leading Cardinals.\nIf you’re a college student, you can get a free MLB.tv account that covers the rest of the regular season and runs through the winter. The playoffs are notably not available on the service domestically.\nCarlos Martinez, who was a free agent, has been suspended 85 games for violating Major League Baseball’s domestic violence policy.\nYesterday at Amazin’ Avenue\nDavid Capobianco about the Mets doing things right and embracing fun, while I made note of the team’s very good mix of live music and baseball. And we dropped Episode 139 of APOTO.\nThis Date in Mets History\nThe Mets have started catching up in the number retirement department, but on this date in 1965, the team retired #37 for original manager Casey Stengel.",

        "description": "Photo by Duane Burleson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Recapping how the Yankees’ top AL opponents fared on September 1st. The Yankees got one more buffer day yesterday from their atrocious August before having to gear up for their true beginning of September. They weren’t the only ones off, as the Astros, Rays, Blue Jays, and Twins all rested as well, but a couple notable American League teams did play.\n\nSeattle Mariners 7 (73-58), Detroit Tigers 0 (50-81)\n\nThe Rays are obviously the Yankees’ most immediate threat since they threaten their long-held grip on the AL East crown at just six games behind with a series looming at the Trop this weekend to kick off an important month. However, one of many extremely unfortunate consequences* of the Yankees’ disastrous August is that they must now consider the possibility of dropping into the Wild Card race.\n*Remember when New York was 15.5 games up? Ah, salad days.\nIf the Rays (or even the not-too-distant Blue Jays) find a way to overtake New York, then the Mariners’ ultimate record will impact seeding. Absolutely no one will be happy about actually playing the potential first-round Wild Card Series, but, well, this could be what it very well comes to for this collapsing team. And guess what? There are no guarantees that Yankee Stadium even sees playoff baseball because the Mariners are right there with Tampa Bay now at six games behind the Yankees after thumping Detroit yesterday, and after a few more series with contenders, boy do they have a cushy landing pad for the home stretch:\n\n\nThe Mariners play their final 20 regular season games against teams with losing records.— Corey Brock (@CoreyBrockMLB) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nImagine telling yourself at the All-Star break that the Yankees might stumble to the lowest Wild Card seeds (or worse). It would still take another great fall like August, but I wouldn’t blame anyone for worrying.\nAnyway, all that pessimistic talk is more interesting than this actual game. (The most interesting play was ruled a dead ball.) Eduardo Rodriguez surrendered back-to-back homers to Julio Rodríguez and Ty France in the third as the Mariners stormed ahead, 6-0, by the middle of the fourth. Logan Gilbert tossed six shutout innings while striking out nine and allowing two hits; Detroit mustered only four in the afternoon shutout.\n\nOther Contenders\n\nBaltimore Orioles 3 (69-61), Cleveland Guardians 0 (68-61): Cedric Mullins homered on Shane Bieber’s first pitch of the ballgame, and while Biebs fanned 11, he also coughed up solo shots to Anthony Santander and Ryan Mountcastle. Kyle Bradish outdueled the former Cy Young Award winner with seven shutout innings, allowing just two hits. Félix Bautista closed out the win, and Baltimore inched its way up to 1.5 games behind Toronto for the last Wild Card spot.",

        "description": "We’re all just as happy to see you, Gunnar. | Photo by Nick Cammett/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Henderson is the second Orioles #1 prospect to debut this year, which hasn’t stopped being exciting yet. Over the offseason, Camden Chat published an article about each member of the Orioles 40-man roster. During the 2022 season, we will update on new arrivals after they make it to the roster.\nHow he arrived: Drafted by Orioles, second round/42nd overall in 2019; contract selected 8/31/22\nWho left: Denyi Reyes designated for assignment 8/31/22\nYou could hardly have scripted a better major league debut for Gunnar Henderson. Two hits, including a home run. Hitting the ball with authority every time, even when making outs. Made every routine play that went his way in the field. Beyond just that, there were the immediately memorable images of Henderson swinging so hard as he hit his home run that his helmet flew off, prompting gleeful laughter from Jim Palmer as the cameras showed Henderson with luxurious mane flowing as he dashed around the bases.\nHardly anyone would have predicted that something like this would happen during the 2022 season before it began. Henderson himself did. It’s great he had that confidence and lived up to it. As a general rule, though, there are not many players who are age 20 (or younger) who are ticketed for an MLB debut in the coming season. One way you can see this is easy: Henderson, now that he’s arrived in MLB for the final month-plus of the season, is the youngest player there, having debuted at the age of 21 years, 63 days.\nHenderson’s ascent as a prospect, making his way as high as the #1 prospect in the game on some rankings before this debut, has accelerated over the past 12 months or so. He didn’t exactly start out in complete obscurity. While no one whose favorite team was picking in the top five or ten picks in the 2019 draft would have been salivating over Henderson, he had a pretty solid late first round/early second round talent ranking. \nAt MLB Pipeline, Henderson was the 27th ranked prospect. FanGraphs rated him 40th in the class, while Keith Law had him 41st. The Orioles picked him 42nd and gave him a bonus commensurate with the 31st pick slot value, $2.3 million. There was nothing not to like in the Pipeline scouting report from before Henderson even turned pro:\nOne of the better hitters in this year’s high school class, Henderson produces a lot of hard contact from gap to gap. He has shown more bat speed from the left side of the plate this spring and his power is catching up to his hitting ability as he continues to add muscle to his 6-foot-3 frame. He has been a little faster this year as well, more consistently recording above-average run times. ... There’s still some debate (about whether Henderson will stick at shortstop or slide to third base.)\nHenderson has lived up to this fairly sunny initial report, but it was no sure thing. It is not hard to find reports that highlight amateur prospects that seem to have all the foundational tools to be successful but it never quite all comes together in development. FanGraphs report noted the risk: Henderson faced weaker competition in his senior season, and he also hadn’t shown any elite-level tools up to that point. \nMike Elias and the Orioles liked something they saw from a player who was still just 17 on the day he was drafted. That’s looking like solid judgment now. The prospect writing world started to notice Henderson in midseason updates last year. By then, FanGraphs had started flipping to true believers on Henderson, writing this:\nHenderson has a very promising hit/power combination and is not only very likely to stay on the dirt, but might also be an above-average third base defender ... Henderson can drop the bat head to impact pitches down and in, or he can flatten it out to barrel pitches up and away from him, and he often laces the latter to left field. He does all of this with quiet control of his swing; he’s not selling out to generate the power or swinging conservatively just to make a ton of contact.\nEven as someone who was buying into the Henderson hype, my most optimistic scenario for him this season is one where he’d spend about half the season at Double-A Bowie, the second half at Triple-A Norfolk, then be in the Opening Day roster consideration for next year. \nMaybe that was even the plan the Orioles had for him. Henderson was just too good for them to stick with that. With an OPS over 1.000 after 45 Bowie games - all this before he turned 21 - he forced the promotion to Norfolk. There, Henderson’s numbers weren’t quite as gaudy but were still impressive. Before the Baltimore call-up, he batted .288/.390/.504 in 65 games there. He hit 11 home runs and stole 10 bases. \nYou could find some little warts to point out if you were, say, a general manager looking for a plausible public excuse that didn’t require admitting the real reason Henderson wasn’t called up sooner. Henderson’s strikeout rate increased at Triple-A, over 30% in July and August. The lefty batter has had some struggles against left-handed pitchers as well. It seems now that the true reason was in order to preserve his rookie status into the 2023 season. This requires fewer than 45 days of service time and fewer than 130 MLB at-bats.\nHenderson’s first MLB game featured some excitement from his bat. His second game, where he played shortstop, he was exciting with the glove, making two phenomenal defensive plays. I’m still thinking about when he turned a 6-3 double play by fielding a tricky chopper on the run, letting his momentum carry him to touch second base unassisted, then firing an accurate throw to first without steadying himself at all. The Orioles have turned a lot of double plays this year. Not many have looked like that.\nEven with the top prospect status, this was an aggressive addition. We haven’t seen Elias be this aggressive in getting a prospect to the big leagues as the rebuild project reached this point. The final month of the season with the Orioles trying to chase down and then stay in a postseason spot is going to be that much more exciting with Henderson making an impact. He’s just been that good.\nStill to come: Jesús Aguilar",

        "description": "Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images\n    \n\n  MLB active rosters expanded from 26 to 28 on September 1. These Cubs roster moves were actually announced Thursday, September 1, which is the day MLB team rosters could be expanded from 26 to 28 players, but I was on the road back to Chicago from Toronto, so I didn’t have a chance to weigh in on them here.\nThese are the official roster moves. I’ll follow with some thoughts about how the 31 games remaining for the Cubs could look.\n\nAdrian Sampson and Justin Steele were reinstated from the restricted list.\nJeremiah Estrada and Brendon Little, who replaced Sampson and Steele on the active roster in Toronto, were returned to Triple-A Iowa.\nThen, Estrada was added to the 40-man roster and called up to the 28-man roster.\nTo make room for Estrada on the 40-man roster, Wade Miley was transferred to the 60-day injured list.\nDavid Bote was recalled from Iowa to the 28-man active roster.\n\nFor Miley, who threw 54 pitches in a rehab assignment for South Bend Wednesday, this probably ends his season and tenure with the Cubs. Miley made four starts for the Cubs and pitched reasonably well (2.84 ERA, 1.211 WHIP), but he just couldn’t stay healthy. Claiming his $10 million contract from the Reds last November was a reasonable gamble; it just didn’t work out.\nThat leaves the Cubs with the following players on the active roster:\nStarting pitchers (5): Adrian Sampson, Drew Smyly, Marcus Stroman, Justin Steele, Javier Assad (listed in likely rotation order beginning Friday)\nRelief pitchers (9): Jeremiah Estrada, Luke Farrell, Brandon Hughes, Mark Leiter Jr., Sean Newcomb, Manuel Rodriguez, Michael Rucker, Erich Uelmen, Rowan Wick (listed in alphabetical order)\nCatchers (3): Willson Contreras, Yan Gomes, P.J. Higgins\nInfielders (5): David Bote, Nico Hoerner, Nick Madrigal, Zach McKinstry, Alfonso Rivas\nOutfielders (6): Ian Happ, Christopher Morel, Rafael Ortega, Franmil Reyes, Seiya Suzuki, Nelson Velázquez\nThere will be several more moves upcoming in September, the way I see it. Patrick Wisdom is eligible to come off the injured list Monday. There’s been no word on whether he’ll be activated then, but whenever that does happen, I’d expect either Bote or Rivas to be sent to Iowa (both have options).\nAdbert Alzolay is currently on a rehab assignment with Iowa. When he’s activated, I would expect either Farrell or Newcomb to be designated for assignment. Personally, I would like to see Alzolay get opportunities to close games. I think he’s a strong candidate to be the Cubs’ closer in 2023.\nSteven Brault was placed on the 15-day injured list August 24 with a shoulder strain. There’s been no word on if/when he’ll return, but if he does, either Farrell or Newcomb would be let go. It’s also possible the Cubs could DFA Anderson Espinoza to make room on the 40-man roster. Even though Espinoza has struggled at times in his MLB stints, he’s got more of a chance to be on the 2023 Cubs than Farrell or Newcomb, who are both placeholders.\nKeegan Thompson has been throwing bullpens and is eligible to return from the injured list September 4. Whenever he’s activated... well, that’s a good question. I suppose the Cubs could option Assad back to Iowa and put Thompson back in the rotation, but given the likely desire to limit Thompson’s innings the rest of the way, having him “piggyback” with Assad might be a good idea. There’s been no word on when Thompson might return and they could send him on a rehab assignment, as the Triple-A season runs through the end of September.\nThat appears to be it as far as Cubs on the injured list who could return before the 2022 season ends. Thought you’d like to discuss further as we await the Cubs/Cardinals series to begin Friday evening. As always, we await developments.",

And, to my mind, that prompts a change in drinking.I know many of you gaily carry on swigging rosé right through the winter, and there may be the odd day when I do, too, but I’m definitely in the mood to return to reds.

        "description": "Randy Lubin recalls the exact moment his life became an improvised musical. The 35-year-old game designer from San Francisco never used to sing, not even in the shower or alone in the car. At his wife’s request, he would perform the kiddush, a Jewish prayer sung each week during Shabbat, but that was it. “Singing wasn’t something I sought out or particularly found a lot of joy in,” Lubin told me.Seeing his son, Curio, for the first time changed everything. “I remember just being overwhelmed with love for him and also just the sense that he seems so fragile,” Lubin said. It was in the newborn intensive-care unit, while marveling at the baby’s small hands, that Lubin started singing: “Tiny fingers and tiny toes / Oh, Curio, we love you so.” These lyrics—unrehearsed, sweet, sincere—became the start of a new dad’s musical awakening. Now his original tunes provide a soundtrack to many aspects of domestic life: “Sleepy Boy” for nap time, “Get You Clean” for washing up, and the always relevant “Mr. Poop Machine.”Singing made-up songs can be an active and rich part of home life, and one common starting point is the inception of parenthood. But people don’t just serenade their babies; pets or even plants might also become unsuspecting audiences. On the surface, these songs are little more than nonsense—spur-of-the-moment, creatively feral melodies that fall out of people as they interact with the small beings in their care. But they also offer caregivers and dependents a meaningful way to communicate when speech alone is limiting.This musical connection begins with how we talk to little ones. Caregivers across cultures often intuitively interact with young children using “parentese,” a speech style that captures a baby’s attention with a higher pitch, more repetition, elongated sounds, and roller-coaster variations in intonation. It promotes language learning while inviting interaction between a parent and child, even if the response is just a baby’s babble. Many of these same qualities feature in how we address our pets—consider the singsong way you might ask a dog if he’s a very good and fluffy boy—which some researchers believe stems from a similar caregiver instinct.But singing to children or pets, as opposed to just speaking, carries distinct benefits. Studies show that infants prefer a mother’s singing to speech, displaying greater alertness, happiness, or calm depending on the type of song. Babies also find a father’s singing highly engaging, especially if he uses a higher vocal pitch. This power of singing appears to be language-independent; infants will relax to a lullaby in any language, even if it’s not their native one. Although there is less data on how human singing affects animals, playing music for dogs—particularly the easygoing grooves of soft rock and reggae—has been shown to make them less anxious in kennels. (My partner tries to wield this soothing power by serenading our cats as they yell for their morning meal; we like to think they appreciate “Do You Hear the Kitties Sing, Singing the Songs of Hungry Cats,” inspired by a classic tune from Les Misérables.)[Read: Why people pretend to talk as their pets]Singing also helps parents feel competent and engaged in the everyday labor of child-rearing. One longitudinal study of a mother with a preterm infant in the NICU, for instance, found that singing to her son on a daily basis helped the mother bond with the baby, reducing her symptoms of postpartum depression and increasing her self-esteem as she adjusted to her parental role. And these songs of care, often performed with remarkable consistency in pitch, rhythm, and tempo, can become reliable and validating scripts for parents to coax their little ones into different modes, such as sleep or playtime. “Babies are pattern detectors,” says Elise Piazza, a University of Rochester professor who has studied early-childhood communication through language and music. Piazza told me that singing creates a feedback loop, where a baby’s enjoyment motivates parents to sing more and builds parents’ confidence. One can imagine that inventing their own songs to celebrate their particular child might further empower parents. It could help them make sense of a new person, one who requires immense time and energy but who can’t talk to them.When parents sing, they create a shared context for their tiny listener and themselves. “Music is a form of joint attention,” Psyche Loui, a Northeastern University professor studying music cognition, told me. Some researchers think that the song itself becomes a kind of meeting ground, which helps the listener and the singer sync up not just emotionally but physiologically—their heart rates, for example, rising and falling together. Singing may also signal to both the child and the parent that the other is fully present. “That’s useful for infants to feel comforted and safe,” Loui said.For all that singing gives us, it has faded from many parts of American public life. These homespun anthems are commonly kept deeply private, intended only for the child and the caregiver. Chris Maury, an engineering manager in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, told me that singing became a way to establish an individual connection with his daughter, Sydney. “When she was younger and couldn’t talk back, it was more comfortable for me to sing to her than to talk to her,” Maury said. One lullaby he created turned into a special way to calm her: “It was just for the two of us.”To an outsider, these songs may sound strange, silly, or poorly sung by tired people. None of that takes away from their effectiveness in forging social bonds. Rather, there is a gorgeous power in creating personal, imperfect music to connect with the small creatures who depend on us.In fact, with enough time and repetition, these songs might become part of family legacy. Parents I spoke with for this story shared hopes of treasuring their songs into the future and imagined someday using them to reconnect with the experience of raising a young child. Loui noted the power of music to conjure a particular time, place, or, perhaps most important, relationship.It certainly works for me. A few years ago, a longtime family friend reminded me of a silly song my mom would entertain me with during long car rides when I was a wiggly toddler. He assured me, with great pride, that he could remember all the lyrics to “Be Especialee,” a tune in the style of a cheerleader’s chant that spelled out the letters of my old nickname. To prove it, he started singing aloud with all the pep and volume the number demands. After swallowing a twinge of embarrassment, I joined in. It was ridiculous: two full-grown adults at a dinner table belting out a baby song. But as we sang that beautiful nonsense, dreamed up by my mother decades ago, old feelings began to stir. By the time we finished the song, I knew that I was deeply cared for.",

        "description": "Peter Spiegel: &#8220;After more than a half decade of Trump scandals, those of us who follow the vicissitudes of the ex-president for a living have, I think, come to a general theory of what compels the man to transgress so spectacularly.&#8221;\n&#8220;There are no grand, well-planned conspiracies, despite what many once feared. The Russia scandal that dogged the early months of Trump’s presidency, for instance, did not turn up evidence that he was some kind of Manchurian Candidate, in the direct employ of the Kremlin, doing its bidding.&#8221;\n&#8220;Instead, there is mere industrial-scale venality. The man will seemingly do anything for sex (Stormy Daniels, Billy Bush); money (Deutsche Bank, Trump Foundation); or power (the Zelensky call, January 6). The Russia scandal, the Mueller report suggested, fell under the heading of &#8216;power&#8217;: Trump was willing to rely on the assistance of his own country’s foreign adversary if it helped him get elected. And then he tried to hide that eagerness from federal investigators.&#8221;\n&#8220;If his official and political sins are tied to his outsized human vices, though, how to explain the zealousness with which he clung on to hundreds of pages of the US’s most highly-classified secrets — including, it appears, the identities of clandestine foreign sources that were feeding intelligence to the CIA? Keeping hold of those documents doesn’t immediately suggest a way to make money, or regain power, or attract women.&#8221;",

But Charlie Josephine’s reimagining, which makes France’s patron saint non-binary, got a barrage of criticism last month, before anyone had even stepped foot on stage.But the mass fury hurled at this production has only shown it to be all the more essential. And as for the cries of historical inaccuracy? Well, the decision to make Joan non-binary has parachuted the tale into current times. Beginning with a monologue on the divinity of trans people, Josephine’s script is as much protest as play. Driven by a God characterised as a deep, internal instinct rather than a deific force, this Joan urges us to follow our own authentic truths. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Jeff Robinson/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  On a day the Braves system was swept, Ozzie Albies got another day closer to his return to the Braves lineup. Thursday was a tough day on the farm as the Atlanta Braves system got swept and the offense really struggled to get going across all levels. On the positive side we saw Ozzie Albies continue his rehab assignment, Keshawn Ogans had a good debut in High-A, and we saw Nacho Alvarez play another game at short.\nJacksonville Jumbo Shrimp 3, Gwinnett Stripers 1\nBox Score\n\nOzzie Albies, DH: 0-4\nRylan Bannon, 2B: 2-4, RBI, .795 OPS\nIan Anderson, SP: 5.2 IP, 9 H, 3 R, 2 ER, 1 BB, 5 K\n\nIan Anderson got the start and made it one out shy of six innings. Anderson gave up three runs (two earned) with a walk and five strikeouts, but was a little too hittable giving up nine hits on the night. After Anderson the pen shut down the Jumbo Shrimp with Victor Vodnik, Odalvi Javier and Jesus Cruz closing things out. The bullpen allowed just two hits and two walks without allowing any additonal runs home over the final 3 1/3 innings.\nOn the hitting side, Ozzie Albies began his rehab assignment by going 0-for-4 with a strikeout on a night without much offense, as Gwinnett combined for just five hits and one walk. Rylan Bannon singled twice and picked up the lone RBI, while the lone extra base hit was an Alex Dickerson double. Tyler White and Delino DeShields Jr (who scored the only run) had the rest of the Stripers’ hits.\nTennessee Smokies 7, Mississippi Braves 1\nBox Score\n\nJalen Miller, 2B: 2-4, 2B, BB, .721 OPS\nTanner Gordon, SP: 5 IP, 3 H, 1 ER, 2 BB, 6 K, 5.50 ERA\nIndigo Diaz, RP: 1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 BB, 2 K, 3.22 ERA\n\nDespite the ugly final score Tanner Gordon turned in a fine start on Thursday, giving up just one run on three hits and two walks over five innings while striking out six. The bullpen was what made this one a blowout, as AJ Puckett and Hayden Deal each gave up three runs over an inning of work, putting this one out of reach. Indigo Diaz pitched a solid inning with a pair of strikeouts once this was already out of hand, and Jason Creasy also threw a scoreless frame.\nLike Gwinnett the Mississippi offense didn’t do much. They combined for six hits and seven walks, with Jalen Miller leading the way by going 2-for-4 with a walk and a double. \nGreenville Drive 4, Rome Braves 1\nBox Score\n\nKeshawn Ogans, SS: 1-3\nJacob Pearson, RF: 2-4, 2B, R, .725 OPS\nIan Mejia, SP: 2.2 IP, 4 H, 2 ER, 1 BB, 5 K\n\nWith 11th round pick Ian Mejia on the bump this turned into a bullpen game due to his limited workload. Mejia was a mixed bag, going 2 2/3 innings while giving up a pair of runs on four hits and a walk, but five of the eight outs he recorded came via strikeout. Rolddy Munoz followed and allowed a run and struck out four in 2 1/3 innings. After a clean inning by Alec Barger, Ben Dum allowed a run in his inning of work, and then Isrrael De La Cruz went the final two scoreless,, picking up five strikeouts.\nJacob Pearson had two hits, including a double and scored the lone run for Rome. Making his High-A debut, recent draft pick Keshawn Ogans went 1-for-3 at the plate, hitting out of the two hole. Brandol Mezquita had a single and drove in Rome’s only run of the game. .\nSalem Red Sox 10, Augusta GreenJackets 5\nBox Score\n\nDavid McCabe, 3B: 1-5, R, 2 RBI\nMahki Backstrom, DH: 1-4, R, .747 OPS\nNacho Alvarez, SS: 0-3, R, 2 BB\n\nAugusta went with a bullpen game with Landon Leach allowing one run over three innings. Things got ugly from there as Rainiery Rodriguez allowed five runs over four innings. Darling Florentino allowed three more in his inning of work. Malcolm Van Buren allowed the final run during his inning in the ninth.\nAugusta may have scored five runs, but this was yet another example of the lack of offense on Thursday night as they managed just three hits. Nine walks and a pair of Salem errors helped the Jackets plate five runs. David McCabe went 1-for-5 at the plate, but scored a run and knocked in two. Mahki Backstrom and Justin Janas both had hits, while Janas also plated a run. The most notable thing about the lineup was Nacho Alvarez playing shortstop again while going hitless with a pair of walks and scoring a run.",

AFL-CIO on Friday launched an organizing drive that will aim to connect more than 100,000 volunteers with nearly 8 million voters ahead of November’s midterms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe mobilization effort is the largest in the history of the labor federation, which represents more than 12.5 million workers. AFL-CIO volunteers will meet with workers in person and send a flurry of texts, phone calls and digital messages in a bid to shore up support for pro-union candidates.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe AFL-CIO aims to translate a wave of organizing around the country and strong public support for unions into political victories in November.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA recent Gallup poll found that 71 percent of Americans support unions, the highest figure since 1965. That comes after workers successfully unionized locations at large corporations like Starbucks and Amazon, overcoming hardline anti-union tactics.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVolunteers will focus on reaching out to voters in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. The AFL-CIO will lean on in-person meetings with union members and other workers, which it believes will be more effective than TV ads and other forms of communication.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This mobilization’s focus on personal connections to engage working people on issues that have a real impact on our families and communities will cut through the political noise to make a critical difference locally and nationally this November and beyond,” AFL-CIO President Liz Shuler said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs part of its organizing drive, the labor federation will highlight voting rights, access to legal abortion and other key issues in addition to labor policies. \n\n\n\nThe mobilization could be a boon for Democrats, who are closely aligned with the AFL-CIO and other labor organizations and have long sought to win back blue-collar workers by touting their pro-union proposals. Those include the PRO Act, a bill to strengthen workers’ ability to organize, which passed the House but couldn’t win 60 votes in the Senate amid GOP opposition.&nbsp;",

– Amend your bucket lists, coffee snobs.\n\n\n\nHowever you take your morning coffee — black, iced, or with a horrifying dollop of mayonnaise in it — you’d prefer it be a quality cup of coffee. But with thousands upon thousands of shops claiming to promise exactly that, it can be daunting for serious java-drinkers to break from their usual routines and try something new or different.\n\n\n\nTo help, the analysts at Yelp have compiled a list of the 100 best coffee shops in the United States, based entirely on the ratings and recommendations from Yelp’s community of reviewers. It’s worth noting, though, that Yelp’s list of “Top Coffee Shops” is based on reviews that not only rate each shop’s coffee, but often the service, ambiance, snacks, and possibly even the availability (or lack) of mayonnaise.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSeriously, watch this college quarterback put mayo in his coffee\t\n\n\n\n\nThe 25 best coffee shops in America, according to an analysis of Yelp reviews and ratings, are below. A full list of the top 100 can be found at Yelp.com.\n\n\n\nYaw Farm Coffee Roaster, Las Vegas, NevadaCafe Makario, Everett, WashingtonOvation Coffee &amp; Tea, Portland, OregonCafe Sapientia, Oak Park, CaliforniaPangolin Café, Reno, NevadaPatria Coffee Roasters, Compton, CaliforniaMission Blue, San Francisco, CaliforniaThe Cuppo Coffee &amp; Tea, Jersey Village, TexasTatiana’s Coffee &amp; Tea, Ventura, CaliforniaTim Is Making Great Coffee, San Juan Capistrano, CaliforniaA T Oasis Coffee &amp; Tea Shop, Phoenix, ArizonaQuince Coffee House, Denver, ColoradoFrenchy’s Food Truck, Brooklyn, New YorkThe Red Bud Cafe, Daytona Beach, FloridaVigiLatte Artisan Coffee, Lahaina, HawaiiCalusa Coffee Roasters, Fort Lauderdale, FloridaWhistle &amp; Fizz, New York, New YorkThe Crepe Shop, Chicago, IllinoisWolfe Club Coffee Roasters, Tacoma, WashingtonLodi Coffee, North Charleston, South CarolinaKoana, Mountain View, HawaiiThe Modern Rose, Deerfield Beach, FloridaEnderly Coffee Co., Charlotte, North CarolinaBurly and The Bean, Seaside, OregonLocal Coffee, Montclair, New Jersey\n\n\n\nIn addition to the list, Yelp also created an interactive map highlighting the locations of every “Top Coffee Shop” in America, making it easy to do some research, plan a trip, or simply see which corners of the country have the highest concentration of quality coffee shops.\n\n\n\nCoffee not quite your cup of tea? Yelp has previously revealed its rankings of the best craft breweries, wineries, pizzerias, margaritas, pie, and even burritos in every state. Very few, however, are served with mayonnaise.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3625279-the-success-of-our-nation-depends-upon-career-civil-servants/",
        "description": "Our government faces tumultuous times characterized by attacks on the legitimacy of the nation’s electoral process, a lack of public trust, serious threats against the FBI and law enforcement, and a recent&nbsp;revival of a proposal&nbsp;that tens of thousands of career federal civil servants should be converted into patronage employees.\n\n\n\nThe increasingly common demonization of federal public servants as untrustworthy “bureaucrats” pursuing their own agendas ignores the reality that policy decisions are made by Congress and the White House, and that professional career employees have routinely implemented those initiatives for both Republican and Democratic administrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile some politicians and their supporters find government employees to be easy targets, the reality is that these individuals are motivated by a desire to serve the nation and our collective interests. They bring true expertise and continuity to our government, give advice based on the facts and data, and represent an integral part of our democratic system. The disturbing efforts to undermine the work of dedicated federal employees for political gain only serves to erode trust in government and weaken our democracy.\n\n\n\nOn a daily basis, the nation’s 2 million civil servants located all across the country, deliver essential services like Social Security and Medicare, assist small businesses, care for veterans, fight crime, maintain the safety of our transportation systems, protect the food supply, find cures for diseases, carry out the nation’s foreign policy and advance our national security.\n\n\n\nThere is often a disconnect, however, between what the public hears about the government and what&nbsp;actually takes&nbsp;place, with missteps magnified and civil servants caricatured. Numerous systems are in place to detect problems, but little attention is paid to important successes or to those responsible for the accomplishments.\n\n\n\nOne of many such achievements can be found in the extraordinary work of Gregory Robinson,&nbsp;whose&nbsp;critical behind-the scenes leadership and management skills led to NASA’s successful December 2021 launch of the revolutionary James Webb Space Telescope that is already revealing amazing discoveries about the origins of the universe.\n\n\n\nAnother dedicated career employee, Cindy Newberg of the Environmental Protection Agency, has played an instrumental role internationally and in the U.S. to curb the use of hydrofluorocarbons, incredibly potent greenhouse gases that are major contributors to climate change. At the Department of Homeland Security, Brandon Wales has protected government and commercial computer networks from highly sophisticated and damaging cyberattacks, including safeguarding the COVID-19 vaccine supply chain and reducing the risks from devastating ransomware attacks on schools and hospitals.\n\n\n\nBarbara Morton has built trust and created a customer-oriented culture for veterans and their&nbsp;families&nbsp;seeking services and benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, while Robert Fenton of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, recently named as the White House National Monkeypox response coordinator, was instrumental in the herculean task of setting up 39 mass vaccination sites and supporting 1,600 smaller locations at the height of the pandemic. These sites administered millions of lifesaving COVID-19 vaccines in a short period of time.\n\n\n\nThese federal employees, all honorees of the&nbsp;Samuel J. Heyman Service to America Medals&nbsp;awarded by the Partnership for Public Service, are just a few of the countless public servants making a huge difference for the country.\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt that federal leaders should deal forthrightly with government’s management challenges and take steps to improve the civil service, but it is equally important to support the workforce and celebrate the achievements of those who have dedicated themselves to the public good.\n\n\n\nAs President John F. Kennedy said 60 years ago, the nation’s civil servants “face problems of unprecedented importance and perplexity” that require “their competence and energy.”\n\n\n\n“The success of this government, and thus the success of our nation, depends in the last analysis upon the quality of our career services,” Kennedy said. Those words were true in 1962 and they are only&nbsp;more true&nbsp;today.\n\n\n\nMax Stier is president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to&nbsp;building a better government and a stronger democracy.",

        "description": "President Biden will host a summit later this month with leaders from Pacific island nations, the White House announced Friday.\n\n\n\nThe U.S.-Pacific Island Country Summit will take place Sept. 28 and 29. The White House did not immediately provide a list of attendees, but said the gathering will focus on collaboration on climate change, the pandemic, economic recovery and \"advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific.\" \n\n\n\n\"The Summit will demonstrate the United States’ deep and enduring partnership with Pacific Island countries and the Pacific region that is underpinned by shared history, values, and people-to-people ties,\" press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe summit comes as the Biden administration has sought to counter Chinese influence in the region by strengthening its ties with other nations in the Indo-Pacific. Biden traveled earlier this year to Japan and South Korea for meetings with leaders there.\n\n\n\nTensions in the Indo-Pacific have been high for years, but there is particular concern about potential Chinese aggression after Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) visited Taiwan. \n\n\n\nThe U.S. has routinely warned China against making moves on Taiwan while insisting it maintains the \"One China\" policy that recognizes Beijing as the representative government of China but considers Taiwan’s status unsettled.\n\n\n\nBiden said during his trip to Asia in May that the U.S. would come to Taiwan’s defense if China invaded, prompting an angry response from Beijing.",

The sweet blackberries cook down to become jammy, while the sage-speckled crumble adds a fragrant, earthy warmth. A good, buttery base is essential for any crumble bar, so bake it before adding the fruit to avoid a soggy bottom. I like to think of these as a bit of a farewell to summer and a welcome to autumn.

        "description": "In Corinne Hoex’s Gentlemen Callers, sex is a dream. The book’s protagonist floats between abstract, ethereal trysts. When she visits a gas-station attendant in her sleep, she is a soapy sponge in his hands. Caressed by a pet groomer, she purrs; she’s his cat. Her liaisons are absurd and illicit—yet, crucially, never dangerous. Gentlemen Callers is not a classic romance novel or a straightforward bodice ripper, Zoë Hu points out. But it shares a similar affection for unrestraint. The novel’s “urgency and fidelity to naive pleasure are, in their own way, political,” Hu writes. “Reading Hoex, one can’t help intuit the meagerness of our culture’s erotic imagination.”A subversive romance is a great antidote to that stunted imagination. W. E. B. Du Bois also knew the genre’s gifts. His overlooked novel, Dark Princess, tells the love story of a Black ex–medical student and an Indian unionist princess, both members of an international coalition against white imperialism. At times, Du Bois leans into melodrama, but the syrupy bits are important; they suffuse this narrative of revolution and solidarity with joyful optimism, the kind that realist literature rarely allows. Octavia E. Butler’s Fledgling also finds freedom in fantasy. The science-fiction novel is not interested in conventional romance; the consent dynamics between a Black vampire and the white man she feeds on are complex and unsettling. They also make space for a new vision of how we can navigate power, desire, and mutual dependence in our intimate relationships and larger communities.The romance genre’s oldest clichés can become modern tools for liberating readers’ thoughts, erotic or otherwise. In 1907, Elinor Glyn published Three Weeks, a mass-market novel about an obsessive affair. Though loaded with sexual innuendo, the book was not simply salacious. By foregrounding a woman’s pleasure and interiority for a mainstream audience, it was radically, wonderfully transgressive.Jasmine Guillory’s romance novels are eye-opening for the boundaries they celebrate rather than the ones they cross. “The sex scenes are scintillating not just because of the acts they describe, but because of the attention Guillory pays to pacing and communication,” Hannah Giorgis writes. The author imagines a story of love without domination; she frees our minds to do the same.\r\n​Every Friday in the Books Briefing, we thread together Atlantic stories on books that share similar ideas.

E. B. Du Bois’s forgotten romance novel“I had believed that romance was a breezy daydream on a hot afternoon, but after reading Dark Princess, I realized that the genre could help us see beyond the limits of our reality, opening our minds to fantastic possibilities.”📚 Dark Princess, by W. E. B. Du BoisAlice ArnoldThe Octavia Butler novel for our times“[The vampire] Shori’s arc feels especially prescient in this moment, as society continues reeducating itself about boundaries, agency, and the true stakes of living together.”📚 Fledgling, by Octavia E. ButlerIllustration by Nícolas Ortega. Source: Jean Honoré Fragonard.The subversive power of romance novels“[Three Weeks] made the case, while the Victorian era and its mores still loomed large in the popular imagination, that women’s sexual desire not only existed—a heretical concept—but burned with an intense heat. … Its power was so great, in fact, that it threatened the patriarchal structures that the 20th century was built on. If women experience desire with a fervor equal to men’s, what else might they also secretly be craving?”📚 Inventing the It Girl: How Elinor Glyn Created the Modern Romance and Conquered Early Hollywood, by Hilary A. Hallett\r\n📚 Three Weeks, by Elinor GlynKatie Martin / The AtlanticHow to write consent in romance novels“For Guillory, romance novels … help soothe the difficulty of existing in a world that is often hostile to women, and to people of color of all genders. They lessen collective and individual burdens, if not by changing others’ conceptions of marginalized people, then at least by providing a welcome distraction from the chaos of everyday life.”📚 The Proposal, by Jasmine Guillory\r\n📚 The Wedding Date, by Jasmine Guillory\r\nAbout us: This week’s newsletter is written by Nicole Acheampong.

        "description": "In the introduction to her book Essential Labor: Mothering as Social Change, Angela Garbes describes these times as “strange and difficult years of instability, loss, and grief—both general and intimate.” That’s it, I thought. Sometimes it feels as though decades of tragedy and erasure have been smashed into the past 30 months. During the upheaval of the summer of 2020, for example, my son also had his third unexplained seizure, and I faced the disorienting truth that I couldn’t promise to keep him safe, even within my own house.It can be hard to find space to live and grow and breathe in the U.S., let alone mother. (Here I borrow from Alexis Pauline Gumbs, who defines mothering expansively as “the practice of creating, nurturing, affirming, and supporting life.”) How does one cultivate and pass along anything more than rage and despair?For me, reading and writing can be restorative acts, even when they require me to face dark or uncertain realities. The right book can whisk you away; others draw you in without your permission. When I wrote my memoir, This Boy We Made, about my son’s medical and developmental challenges, re-creating scenes of hospital visits and emergencies drained me, and yet I knew that if I didn’t convey the intensity of those moments, my words wouldn’t connect with the readers I wanted them to reach. And, to find solace after dwelling in painful memories, I read widely. Books did not offer me an escape; instead, they inspired the hope that I can love deeply and create something beautiful in the world. The five titles below helped me reimagine how to mother in an inhospitable time and place.\r\nBold Type Books\r\nWe Live for the We: The Political Power of Black Motherhood, by Dani McClainIn McClain’s reported guide to parenting Black children, her prescience stands out. “I wonder … whether US institutions and our confidence in them will continue to collapse,” she wrote in 2019, ahead of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, the January 6 insurrection, and a devastating pandemic. “I also wonder just how bad things can get and how soon.” McClain’s work is notable for its vulnerability. She weaves together research, conversations with activists, and her personal experience of raising a Black daughter. McClain doesn’t provide us with pat answers, but she offers a wealth of perspectives that broaden our definitions of motherhood and family before returning her focus to what we can control. Community-based institutions can seed freedom and joy, she reminds us. “In these pages I have mentioned my desire to find a place where I could flee with my daughter, a place that will allow her to flourish into her full potential as a black girl,” she writes. “I know that no such perfect place exists. It’s not something to find but something to create.”\r\nCoffee House Press\r\nThe Breaks: An Essay, by Julietta SinghSingh opens this intimate and breathtaking letter to her 6-year-old by describing a common yet gutting event: Her daughter has come home from school with a picture book telling a whitewashed version of the Thanksgiving story. An initial feeling of pride that her daughter “colored all four children Brown like you” gives way to the need to explain how the holiday connects to a legacy of genocide. “My job as your mother is to tell you these stories differently,” she writes. Throughout the book, Singh fights to teach her daughter about her origins in a queer, mixed-raced family, and to consistently connect their lives to the global realities of climate change, racism, and colonialism. What pulls me to Singh is the way you can almost hear her voice breaking on the page, even as she gathers herself to press on: “No, I do not want to leave this planet,” she tells her daughter. “What I want is another world. And when I say another world, I mean this one, toppled and reborn.” This is a mother working to complicate simplified and harmful narratives—a mother I could stand and dream alongside.[Read: Where to turn when you feel “at odds with being human”]\r\nGrand Central Publishing\r\nThe Trayvon Generation, by Elizabeth Alexander In her new book, Alexander expands on an essay published in The New Yorker in June 2020, about the generation whose lives have been shaped, for the past 25 years, by stories of Black people being killed by police officers or neighborhood vigilantes. This group includes her two sons, and she writes with a mother’s and poet’s touch. Every word cuts just so, like when she describes how “the specter of violence hangs as constantly as the moon over Black people.” Alongside visual artwork and poems by others, this writing dares to ask if art can really change us. It might seem an outrageous question, when, as Alexander puts it, Black mothers know “that we cannot fully protect our children.” Why, when the country casually marches on despite mass shootings, lynchings, and high Black maternal mortality rates, should we look to art? Because “artists make radical solutions all day long, soup from a stone, beauty from thin air,” Alexander answers. She ends her book with a powerful declaration that Black people have the distinct ability to articulate both the problems with and the possibilities of America, the kind of vision that has continually produced life and wonder even amid darkness and danger.[Read: The civil-rights movement’s generation gap]\r\nBeacon Press\r\nBreathe: A Letter to My Sons, by Imani PerryThe scholar and Atlantic contributing writer Perry constructed an unsparing, lyrical guide to motherhood in this dispatch to her Black sons. Similar to Singh, she’s honest with her children about the hostility they’ll face, but her warnings can be more urgent: “There are fingers itching to have a reason to cage or even slaughter you,” she writes, recalling a night when she feared that cops responding to a false alarm would mistakenly shoot one of her children. “My God, what hate for beauty this world breeds.” But Perry emphasizes that her boys are not the issue—“Mothering you is not a problem. It is a gift,” she writes tenderly. She also critiques the notion that more knowledge, more videos, more images can save America. “Awareness is not a virtue in and of itself, not without a moral imperative,” she notes, explaining her decision to stop watching videos of police shootings. “I knew the imperative wasn’t there.” The greatness Perry wants for her sons is not tied to money or prestige, but to imagination and connection. And the way she encourages her children to cherish small pleasures, like smooth sheets or a hug, makes existing and parenting when bad news never stops seem more bearable.[Read: How we must raise our children now]\r\nHaymarket Books\r\nHope in the Dark: Untold Histories, Wild Possibilities, by Rebecca SolnitI was initially nervous about reading a book with hope in the title. How would the author speak to my experiences of despair and anxiety as a Black mother? But Solnit is a writer who can tear down the walls of your brain with a single acute observation, and she earned my attention early, in the 2016 reissue’s new foreword. “It’s important to say what hope is not,” she declares. “It is not the belief that everything was, is, or will be fine.” What she writes about is instead “an account of complexities and uncertainties, with openings.” It’s a hope that makes space for grief and asks us to remember times when the world did, indeed, change for the better. Progress often happens incrementally, and Solnit comes with detailed receipts. Crucially, she points to the merits of not knowing what will happen next: As long as there’s ambiguity, we have to leave room for the chance that we could build a future that will blow our minds again—in a good way.​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

        "description": "Do you think Dean Kremer feels threatened by Gunnar Henderson’s hair? | Photo by G Fiume/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Orioles play three games against the worst team in the American League and they must take advantage. The only thing you really need to know about this weekend’s series between the Athletics and the Orioles is that the Orioles really need to win most, if not all, of these games. To come off of a 4-2 road trip against the Astros and Guardians just to lose to the A’s would be the absolute worst. \nIn the midst of this tough schedule, with the Orioles fighting to get back into wild card position, the hope is that the A’s will offer some relief. They currently sit in last place in the AL West, having already racked up 82 losses. They have the worst record in the American League and in the NL their only rivals to their .374 winning percentage are the Pirates and Nationals. \nThis is a team the Orioles should be handily, which, to me at least, makes this series even scarier than the series against good teams. The pressure is fully on the Orioles to take these games. There is zero pressure on the A’s. To get knocked further out of the wild card race while playing the Astros is one thing, but to lose two out of three to these jabronis would be mortifying. \nAfter this series, the Toronto Blue Jays come to town for four games in three days. And while the O’s are battling the A’s in Baltimore, the Blue Jays will be facing off with a similarly bad Pirates in Pittsburgh. It’s unlikely that the Orioles will get any help from the Pirates, so to lose this series to the A’s ahead of seeing the Blue Jays could be devastating. \nThe clock is winding down on the 2022 season and the Orioles have no room for error. They currently sit 1.5 games back of the Jays for the final postseason spot (two games in the loss column) and losing to the A’s could put them several more game back in a hurry. They need to be in a position to tie or pass the Blue Jays next week. \nThis is the second series these teams have played this season. In the first, the Orioles lost three out of four. That was pretty embarrassing even when it happened, but it was also a full month before Adley Rutschman debuted. At the end of that series their record was 4-9. It was a bizarre early season west coast road trip and long before anyone imagined the Orioles could be good. \nSome Orioles featured in that first series were Kelvin Gutierrez, Anthony Bemboom, Chris Owings, Travis Lakins, Paul Fry, and Chris Ellis. I have a hard time remembering most of those players. This is a different team in many ways now. \nIf you’re wondering what players you know on the A’s, the answer could very possibly be none. They traded a number of the players you’d recognize, like Matt Chapman, Matt Olson, Sean Manaea, and Chris Bassitt, in spring. Then they got rid of some more players, the biggest name being Frankie Montas, at the trade deadline. \nThe A’s are averaging 3.39 runs per game this year, better than only the Tigers in the AL. Their team OBP is worst in the AL at .280. We have watched the Orioles struggle to score runs of late, but they are actually exactly league average a 4.21 runs/game. On pitching, the A’s allow 4.53 runs per game, better than only the Royals and Red Sox (LOL). \nThat’s not even to mention that this will be Gunnar Henderson’s first series in Baltimore. The A’s aren’t usually a big attendance draw but between the arrival of Gunnar, the overall great play by the Orioles, and the soccer jersey giveaway on Saturday, hopefully the Yard will be rocking. \nI can’t reiterate this enough: This is a team the Orioles need to beat. \nGame 1: Friday, Sept 2nd, 7:05 \nDean Kremer, RHP (6-2, 3.24 ERA) vs JP Sears, LHP (5-1, 2.28 ERA) \nSears may be an Athletic whose name you recognize. He’s a rookie who has already pitched twice against the Orioles this year when he was with the Yankees. On April 16th, Sears pitched a scoreless inning in Baltimore, and on May 25th he pitched five scoreless. He was traded to the A’s as part of the package that brought Frankie Montas to New York. \nThis could be a tough one for the Orioles. In four starts with the A’s, Sears has been quite good. He hasn’t yet pitched deep into a game, though, and the Orioles have proven themselves capable of running up a starter’s pitch count. \nAs for Kremer, he just needs to keep going in September what he had going in August. He pitched to a 2.25 ERA over five August starts, and that’s including when he gave up four runs in 5.2 innings to Boston. He has been just dominant and he should be able to handle this A’s team. \nGame 2: Saturday, Sept 3rd, 7:05\nAustin Voth, RHP (4-2, 4.48 ERA) vs TBD\nThe Austin Voth revival tour continues this weekend. Voth wasn’t quite as good as Kremer in August; in five starts his ERA was 2.57. I want very much to trust in Voth and every start he gets me a little closer, but I’m still having trouble flipping that switch. His Orioles’ ERA is just 2.72 for the entire year, but he was just so bad before that. For like, awhile. \nAs Fox Mulder says, I want to believe. \nGame 3: Sunday, Sept 4th, 1:35\nSpenser Watkins, RHP (4-5 4.26 ERA) vs TBD\nThere is a whole lot of TBD in this series!\nSince returning from the injured list on June 25th, Watkins has dropped his ERA from 6.00 to 4.26. He has looked like a different pitcher. His August wasn’t quite as sparkling as the other to starters in this series, and he’s coming off of a real clunker against the Guardians. But he has earned the chance to stay in this roster, something that I sure didn’t see coming at the start of the season.",

        "description": "Bruce Kluckhohn-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Royals pitching has done everything they can do to tell the team it’s time to find a new pitching coach after the season.  Some things stick with you throughout the course of a long season and even over multiple years. I can still hear Dayton Moore say he needs to be more transactional and then literally never making good on that promise, for example. But one thing that I think about a lot during the season, and it’s because the team almost forces it on me, is how big of an emphasis they made on throwing strikes this season. I will say that I was surprised they’ve only thrown the 11th lowest percentage of pitches in the strike zone of any team in baseball (but third-most total pitches in the zone…you know, because they throw a lot of pitches). This isn’t news or anything new to you, both because you have eyes and because this happens every single year. The Royals have the most games in baseball with four or more walks, five or more walks, six or more walks, seven or more walks and eight or more walks. Weirdly, teams have more games with nine and 10 or more walks in a game, but yeah, it’s bad. This is the 54th season of Royals baseball and with 30 games left to play, this version has walked more than (19 2to 22) previous versions. Which is not great. All of this is to say that there’s a lot to be excited about with the bats, but they need to fix this.\nThis won’t fix the pitching, but it’ll make me feel better to watch all the walks if you’d be so kind as to subscribe to Inside the Crown. It’s totally free and you’ll get it in your inbox most weekday mornings!\n\nStarting off on the wrong foot\nSticking with the pitching and control issues, the other big thing they preached during spring training was throwing first pitch strikes. Now, of course, a strike can be on a pitch outside the zone, but heading into yesterday’s action, the Royals staff has thrown 50.8 percent of first pitches inside the zone, which is the sixth-lowest total in baseball. When you combine that with having one of the lowest chase rates of any staff in baseball, you get to the point where they’re nearly a full two percent behind the second-lowest first-pitch strike staff in baseball. The difference between 29th and 30th is roughly the same as the difference between 12th and 29th. I’m no mathemagician, but that seems bad to me. The league average for first pitch strikes is 61.2 percent and the Royals have four pitchers still in the organization who have thrown more than two games this year above it. For starting pitchers, the league average is 61.8 percent, so even higher. That means that Brady Singer, Kris Bubic, Amir Garrett, Daniel Lynch, Carlos Hernandez, Jonathan Heasley, Brad Keller, Wyatt Mills, Josh Staumont, Dylan Coleman, Jackson Kowar and Collin Snider are all below average. \nAgain, I’m aware I’m not providing you any news you didn’t know, but it’s just crazy to see how bad it is when it’s all presented like that. I believe Cal Eldred is in his last month (and a few days) on the job. When the Royals are searching for the next coach, I really think they need to simplify things and think about what organizations do the things well that lead to success. I know, that’s a very obvious thing to say, but look at the organization at the top of the chase rate list. It’s the Rays, Blue Jays, Braves, Yankees, Mets, Guardians and Mariners. All seven of those teams are in a playoff spot right now. The top of the swinging strike leaderboards are the Braves, Rays, Mets, Yankees, Astros and Dodgers. All playoff teams. First pitch strike rankings are more of the same, just in a different order. Find the guy who pushes those teams to success and poach him. They did it with their hitting, going to the Dodgers for instruction and we see how that’s worked out well. I think they need an organizational overhaul here and it is blatantly obvious where they should be turning. I anticipate we’ll find out where they decide to go in about six weeks.\n\nWho to move?\nI think we’ve thought for a long time that the Royals might do something similar to the 2012/2013 offseason this winter and make a move to add some veteran presents and presence to the roster. The general consensus around these parts from the James Shields (eventually Wade Davis) deal was that it was a year too early. I know that was my thought on it. Turned out I was wrong, which happens way more than I’d like to admit but people do a great job of reminding me. It’s probably a year too early to be considering a move like that from a competitive factor, but as I noted on Inside the Crown on Monday, this is the winter to make a payroll splash with what they owe to players over the next few seasons. But the issue is that the strong farm system they had to start the year is mostly in the big leagues now. It just gets so much more difficult to trade a guy once they’ve come to the big leagues. Either they perform well enough that you’ve seen them perform in your uniform or they struggle enough that it takes some shine off them. So if the Royals are going to make this move, who goes?\nI think it’s fair to say that Bobby Witt Jr. isn’t getting traded. I don’t believe MJ Melendez is going anywhere, though his weird days off on Sunday and Tuesday make me wonder if there’s something there we don’t know about it. I think Vinnie Pasquantino has reached that point where he isn’t going anywhere because of his performance. So that leaves Nick Pratto, Michael Massey and Drew Waters. I can tell you the Royals think the world of Waters, so he’s not the guy and I don’t think he can headline a deal anyway. I don’t think Massey can headline a deal either. So that leaves Pratto. He’s going to need to continue to hit well as he has over the past few games, but he has the prospect pedigree and the long-term power to potentially headline something. Otherwise, there just isn’t much they can do outside of pairing someone like Lynch, which they don’t want to do, with Massey to bring back something of value. And this is where I think their timing is just off. Because it wouldn’t surprise me if next offseason, guys like Cayden Wallace, Gavin Cross, Tyler Gentry (if he doesn’t make the big leagues next year) and someone else who we probably aren’t even thinking about could be the type to headline a big trade. I’m just especially intrigued with how they might go about making this sort of move if thy choose to do it. \n\nInnings limits closing in\nThis is something that old school baseball watchers will probably cringe at, but the Royals starting rotation is getting awfully close to some innings milestones, which are something we should at least be monitoring. Brady Singer has thrown 135.1 innings this year between AAA and the majors. His career high is 128.1 in the majors and 148.1 in 2019. Kris Bubic is at 118. His career high is 130 in the majors and 149.1 in 2019. Daniel Lynch is at 110.1 between his rehab starts and the big leagues. His big league career high is 68 and his professional career high is 125 last season. Jonathan Heasley is at 110 innings. His career high was 120 last season. It’s easy to forget because we’ve gotten farther and farther away, but while Singer and Bubic threw a few innings in 2020, Lynch and Heasley didn’t throw a competitive pitch that year. I think pitchers are babied a little too much as they’re being developed but there’s also a right way to continue to expand their workload year over year and, like it or not, everyone with young pitching is still dealing with the lost season of 2020. \nI wonder if we’re going to see some ugly-ish starts (yes, more than before you heathens) down the stretch as they do what they can to give guys an extra day here and there. Maybe we see some bullpen days, but I think that’s going to give us a chance to hopefully see Max Castillo more after his strong start against Tampa Bay a few weeks ago. I almost wonder if we’ll see Brad Keller starting some more games because I don’t know that the Royals thought ahead to the fact that we might see some guys get shut down. This kind of goes back to what I wrote about last week with next year being the first “normal” year since 2019 and I think that after this season, things should be back on track for young pitchers to be able to work a little bit deeper into the season, but for now, it looks like it might be another September of figuring things out on an almost daily basis. \n\nSlump busting\nYears ago, I heard a GM for a team that wasn’t the Royals talking about how they wanted to see a prospect fail. I honestly can’t remember who it was and I’ve heard the Royals echo that sentiment since, but it struck me as something that was just so odd. Why on earth would you want someone to fail if you’re rooting for their success? As I got older, it became something that made a lot more sense and it’s really stuck with me ever since. Part of playing in the big leagues is failing. The idea that even the best hitters make an out 60 percent of the time is true. And there are times when even those hitters struggle. The best way to learn how to get out of a slump is to actually have to get out of a slump. And I’ve been very encouraged by so many of the Royals young hitters figuring out how to work their way out of slumps and it makes me believe that when the next one hits, they’ll find their way out even quicker because they have an idea of what works now. \nSure Pratto went 0 for 4 yesterday, but he’s still 9 for 25 with seven extra base hits in his last six games. That came on the heels of going 2 for 35 over a 13-game stretch. He and Melendez both have the experience of a terrible full season and bouncing back, but it’s nice to see him do that. Michael Massey came into yesterday’s game 4 for his last 30 over his last 11 games and he went 3 for 3 with a walk. He also had one hit in each of the first two games of the series. For him to break out of that will be big if he can continue. We’ve seen Witt do it this year. We’ve seen Melendez do it this year. As much as it hurts to see the struggles, sometimes those struggles are what can allow them to be better faster moving forward and I’m glad they’re taking those lumps this year. There will be other slumps. Heck, Luis Arraez is leading the league in hitting and he had a 4 for 33 stretch recently. But it’s about coming out of those stretches even better and I feel good about the Royals hitters learning how to do that.",

        "description": "Photo by Eric Espada/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Yankees head to the Trop for a crucial series against the Rays. After wrapping up their West Coast road trip with yet another frustrating loss, the Yankees are set to come back out east this weekend. However, they’re not coming back to the Bronx just yet, as instead a trip to Tropicana Field to play the Rays awaits. Thanks to the Yankees’ second-half play, it’s also become quite the important series — one that will see the recently-recalled Oswald Peraza make his MLB debut as well.\nComing into this weekend, the Yankees lead the AL East by just six games, down quite a bit from where their edge once stood. The team is second is the Tampa Bay team they’re set to face off against starting tonight. Should the Yankees get swept, the lead would down to a miniscule three games. On the other hand, a Yankees’ sweep would help restore a decent-sized lead over at least the Rays. Anything in between wouldn’t lead to quite as big a swing, but at this point of the season, every game counts.\nBefore things get started tonight, let’s check in on the pitching matchups we’ll see over the next couple days.\nFriday: Domingo Germán vs. Jeffrey Springs (7:10 PM ET)\nGermán continued his pretty good start to his 2022 against the A’s last Saturday, only for the offense to contribute essentially nothing. He allowed just three hits and no walks in 7.2 scoreless innings, before the Yankees eventually lost in extras. Since Germán’s disastrous season debut against the Astros, he has a 1.82 ERA in 29.2 innings in five starts. However, the worst start in that stretch came against the Rays, as he was knocked out after three runs in 4.2 innings. That was the game that eventually ended with Josh Donaldson’s walk-off grand slam.\nA couple weeks ago, when the teams met in the Bronx, the former reliever Springs held the Yankees to one run on two hits in five innings. In general, he’s been good this season, including a 2.45 ERA in 11 innings against the Yankees.\nSaturday: Clarke Schmidt vs. Corey Kluber (6:10 PM ET)\nAlthough he had already made one start the season, Schmidt joined the rotation in a more official capacity last Sunday, as the Yankees have dealt with injuries on the pitching front. That start didn’t go ideally, as he allowed four runs in 4.1 innings against Oakland. Schmidt struck out seven in the outing, but had some issues putting hitters away, throwing 83 pitches in his outing.\nIn the second game of the series, the Rays will roll out Corey Kluber. The former Yankee has been mostly below average this season, but he has been good against New York so far this year, naturally. In three starts, he’s held the Yankees to just 3 earned runs in 18 innings, as hitters have OPS’d just .522 off him.\nSunday: Frankie Montas vs. TBD (1:40 PM ET)\nMontas was one of two Yankee pitches to get Shohei Ohtani’d in the recent Angels’ series, allowing a home run to LA’s superstar in an outing that had been mostly OK prior to the 2021 MVP’s bomb. The home run ended up dooming Montas to a six-inning, four-run outing. Instead of a perfectly nice start, which he seemed on pace to put up prior to that, the game ended up just adding to the pile of less-than-stellar outings since the trade that brought him to New York.\nIn the series finale, the Rays seem to be leaning towards Ryan Yarbrough on Sunday, although he might follow an opener. He pitched four scoreless innings in that role back on August 15th, and had a two-run, 5.1 inning outing against the Yankees back in May.",

        "description": "Photo by Jayne Kamin-Oncea/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Miller’s previous career-high was 11 The Dodgers have seen flashes of brilliance from their most intriguing pitching prospect this season and on Thursday night, Bobby Miller showed out for the best start of his career to this point.\nThe right-hander struck out a whopping 14 of the 21 batters he faced in six innings, giving up just two hits and a walk in the process. Miller was so locked in at the end of his outing that he struck out the final eight hitters of his night.\n\n\nBobby Miller was electric for the @okc_dodgers.The No. 2 @Dodgers prospect fanned a career high 14, including the last eight batters he faced: https://t.co/Cu7V0IWbdq pic.twitter.com/mQ1LVqbPW4— Minor League Baseball (@MiLB) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\n“I can’t really put it into words,” he told Michael Avallone of MiLB. “When something like that happens, you’re so zoned in on your job that nothing else around you is even noticeable. Add in the fact it’s a close game and it just ratchets things up. I give [catcher] Tony Wolters a lot of credit. It was my first time throwing to him and he was great. He knew exactly what to call and when to call it.”\nMiller has now struck out 24 and walked just three in his first three starts with OKC after being promoted August 16. Unfortunately, the only walk issued Thursday would lead to a two-run homer for Sandro Fabian, providing the only score of the game when he turned on a fastball and snuck it inside the foul pole down the left field line.\nTriple-A Oklahoma City\nDespite striking out three in the inning, Miller gave up the two-run homer with two outs after walking the leadoff man in the second inning. The game was called after the sixth inning due to rain and Oklahoma City didn’t fully get the chance to climb out from the deficit, falling 2-0 to Round Rock (Rangers).\nOKC had two runners on in three different innings, including the top of the seventh that wouldn’t be finished. There were runners on second and third with two outs when the game was called.\nThe only multi-hit effort of the night for the Dodgers came from James Outman as he stayed hot with a pair of singles in three at-bats. The second of his two hits was the best chance OKC had of scoring but Michael Busch was thrown out trying to score from second.\nDouble-A Tulsa\n\n\nTonight’s game has been rained out.

Two wild pitches allowed all three of those runs for Lake County (Guardians) as Great Lakes fell 8-5.\nAfter a walk and single quickly loaded the bases in the extra frame, Reinaldo De Paula uncorked the first wild throw to bring that placed runner in with the go-ahead run. The Loons would bring in Joan Valdez with two outs and runners still on second and third.\nValdez intentionally walked the first batter he faced to load the bases before tossing a wild pitch of his own that amazingly scored two runners. The Loons had no answer in the bottom half of the inning.\nGreat Lakes had early leads of 2-0 and 3-1 before the Captains scored three in the sixth to take their first lead of the game. The Loons scored in the bottom half and the two clubs traded runs in the seventh.\nTop prospect Diego Cartaya was hitless in three at-bats but did walk twice and scored a run while bringing in two runs on ground outs in each of the third and seventh innings.\nSecond baseman Jorbit Vivas had two more hits to give him 124 on the year, just five short of his total a year ago.\nReliever Ben Harris continued his scoreless streak out of the bullpen for the Loons. Though he gave up a double in the eighth Thursday, the lefty hadn’t allowed a hit in his previous 14 games and still hasn’t allowed a run in his last 20 innings of work.\n\n\nBen Harris completed his 15th scoreless performance in a row &amp; 26th of the year. He has given up just 1 run in his last 22 innings &amp; has 35 Ks &amp; just 7 walks during that span. Even more incredible, he hasn't given up a hit in his last 14 outings which spans 17.2 innings. #dodgers pic.twitter.com/laOrjg8EQa— Dodger Poke Report (@dodger_poke) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nDrafted in the eighth round last year, Harris has been great since the Dodgers promoted him to High-A towards the end of June, giving up two runs in 19 games to go 2-0 with a 0.75 ERA while striking out 39 against 11 walks.\nLow-A Rancho Cucamonga\nDespite the leadoff hitter reaching in five of the nine innings and having multiple runners on in three of those, Rancho couldn’t push a run across until the eighth inning. By that time it was way too late to attempt a comeback as they were already being run out of town with a 9-1 loss on the road in downtown San Bernardino to the Inland Empire 66ers (Angels).\nSeven of the nine starters for the Quakes had at least one hit, including two for Bubba Alleyne. But they were 0-for-8 with runners in scoring position as a team and Inland Empire scored at least one run in six of the first seven frames.\nIt didn’t lead to many unearned runs but Rancho committed four errors to round out the night. The two teams will be back at it over the weekend as Rancho’s playoff hopes are on life support.

In his time, he fanned 4 against nary a walk, and that’s a very good sign for all parties involved. Unfortunately, the Bats’ bats stayed mostly silent and Eddy Demurias was tagged for a pair of late runs and the blown save in the loss. Albert Almora, Jr., who will still probably be a starting outfield on the Rebuilding Reds in 2023, walked while in his own rehab appearance.\nChattanooga Lookouts 3, Pensacola Blue Wahoos 2 (AA)\nMike Siani launched his 12th homer of the season on Thursday to lead the Lookouts to the W. Considering he’d socked a grand total of 14 homers across 4 seasons (5 years, thanks to 2020), this newfound power output paired with his plus-plus CF defense and plus-plus-plus-plus baserunning might well have him on-track for a role as a big league outfielder in short order. Garrett Wolforth chipped in with a pair of doubles to help pace the offense, while Joe Boyle had a vintage Joe Boyle start: 5.1 IP and just a lone ER, but with 5 BB to go alongside his 6 K. \nDayton Dragons 6, Cedar Rapids Kernels 2 (High-A)\nJay Allen II had a pair of ribbies, Tyler Callihan backed up his monster Wednesday game with an RBI double, and Justice Thompson doubled as part of a 2-hit evening to lead the Dragons to the win. Thomas Farr was mostly brilliant on the bump for the evening, yielding just a lone ER in 6.0 IP with 7 K (and 4 BB) to his credit. Ashton Creal walked, tripled, and scored a pair of runs, to boot.\nPalm Beach Cardinals 5, Daytona Tortugas 3 (Single-A)\nDaggum Cardinals and their dang ol Cardinal Way, man. Braylin Minier had a pair of singles and a pair of ribbies as the lone true bright spot on an otherwise quiet offensive night, while reliever Kevin Abel (3.0 IP, 7 H, 5 ER) let this game mold and spoil after a brilliant outing from starter Jose Acuna (5.0 IP, H, 0 ER, 0 BB, 4 K). The bullpen is not mightier!",

        "description": "Brad Mills-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Mets look to keep up their positive momentum after taking two of three against the Dodgers. The Mets (84-48) conclude their 10-game homestand with three against the last-place Nationals (45-86). The Mets have won 10 of 13 games against the Nationals this season, including all three they’ve played against them at Citi Field. They Mets have gone 5-2 on this homestand so far.\nThe Mets are coming off one of their most impressive series wins of the year, taking two of three from the Dodgers. They dropped the opener 4-3 in a back-and-forth affair. The Mets held a lead in the first on a Starling Marte bunt single, which brought home Brandon Nimmo thanks to a throwing error from Andrew Heaney that allowed Marte to go to third. Los Angeles would jump ahead 3-1 in the third after Taijuan Walker hit Joey Gallo with the bases loaded and then surrendered a two-run single to Gavin Lux. Marte homered in the third to cut the lead, and Mark Canha homered in the fourth to tie the game up. Things remained tied into the seventh, when Lux singled to drive home Freddie Freeman with the game-winning run. As a result, the Mets were denied the opportunity to utilize Timmy Trumpet.\nThe Mets would get the opportunity and capitalize in Wednesday’s electric 2-1 win. The game was a pitcher’s duel between Tyler Anderson and Jacob deGrom, and both pitchers delivered. The Mets got both their runs on a Marte two-run homer, while Los Angeles broke through on a solo homer from Mookie Betts in the sixth. The Dodgers almost tied the game in the seventh, but Nimmo robbed Justin Turner of a game-tying homer. Edwin Díaz came into the game with a live performance from Timmy Trumpet, and the right-hander shut the door on the Dodgers for the save.\nThe Mets got a 5-3 victory on Thursday afternoon to close out a series win. The Mets took a lead in the first against an unusually erratic Clayton Kershaw, who walked home a run. Los Angeles got two runs in the second on a Chris Taylor single, and Kershaw retired 13 straight, but the Mets jumped back in front on a Francisco Lindor double and a Darin Ruf sacrifice fly in the sixth. The Mets got two insurance runs in the seventh on hits from Nimmo and Marte, which gave a cushion for a Díaz in the eighth. The right-hander gave up a run but no more and finished with the hardest pitch of his career, and Adam Ottavino shut the door in the ninth.\nAugust was a great month for Jeff McNeil, who led the club with a 178 wRC+ and a 1.7 fWAR while slashing .385/.414/.560 in 29 games. Canha also had his best month of the season and has been an extra base hit machine of late. The outfielder hit .292/.395/.583 with four home runs, a 175 wRC+, and a 1.0 fWAR in 26 games. Marte, meanwhile, led the club with five homers in the month while hitting .266/.339/.468 with a 133 wRC+ and a 0.7 fWAR in 29 games. Francisco Lindor, who suffered through an 0-for-20 stretch later in the month, still ended it slashing .286/.372/.420 with four home runs, a 132 wRC+, and a 1.3 fWAR in 30 games.\nThe Nationals come into this series after winning two out of three against the Athletics. Before that, they dropped two of three to the Reds.\nJoey Meneses, who debuted against the Mets on August 2 and hit a home run in his first major league game, carried an 11-game hitting streak after that feat and ended the month leading Washington’s offense with a 165 wRC+ while posting a .333/.367/.591 slash line and a team-high six home runs and a 0.7 fWAR in 24 games. Ildemaro Vargas, who also came up on August 2 following the team’s fire sale, led the club with a 0.8 fWAR in 23 August games while slashing .325/.369/.494 with three home runs and a 140 wRC+.\nFriday, September 2: Josiah Gray vs. David Peterson, 7:10 p.m. on SNY\nGray (2022): 123.1 IP, 140 K, 53 BB, 32 HR, 4.67 ERA, 5.66 FIP, 1.31 WHIP, 1.0 bWAR\nGray is coming off three solid starts in a row. His last time out, he allowed one earned run on four hits over 5.0 innings, though he did walk a season-high five batters. Prior to that, he struck out ten batters for the third time this year, allowing three earned runs on five hits over 6.0 innings. Gray has served up 32 home runs this season, the most of any NL starter. His 2.34 HR/9 is the worst mark among NL starting pitchers who have pitched at least 120.0 innings.\nPeterson (2022): 89.2 IP, 104 K, 40 BB, 9 HR, 3.21 ERA, 3.68 FIP, 1.28 WHIP, 1.4 bWAR\nPeterson had perhaps his strongest start of the year against Colorado his last time out. The left-hander tossed 6.0 shutout innings and limited the Rockies to four hits. He didn’t walk a batter—the first time he’s gone without issuing a free pass in a major league start since July 1 against the Rangers—and struck out seven. With Carlos Carrasco returning, Peterson will get another start which should, in effect, give deGrom an extra day of rest between starts.\nSaturday, September 3: Patrick Corbin vs. Max Scherzer, 7:10 p.m. on SNY\nCorbin (2022): 127.2 IP, 113 K, 45 BB, 24 HR, 6.56 ERA, 4.97 FIP, 1.76 WHIP, -2.4 bWAR\nCorbin has had a horrendous season, there’s no other way to put it. He has the most losses (17) among NL starters and has allowed the most hits (180) and earned runs (93). His ERA and WHIP are the highest among NL starters with at least 120.0 innings pitched, while his FIP is second-highest only to his teammate Gray. He did pick up his fifth win of the season his last time out, allowing two runs (one earned) on four hits in 6.0 innings against Cincinnati. Three of his losses have come against the Mets.\nScherzer (2022): 122.2 IP, 148 K, 2 BB, 9 HR, 2.27 ERA, 2.47 FIP, 0.93 WHIP, 4.5 bWAR\nScherzer suffered a hard-luck loss in his last outing against the Rockies. The right-hander was superb, going 7.0 innings and allowing one earned run on four hits. He struck out 11 and walked one, but the run he let through in the seventh proved to be the difference, as the offense could do nothing all game. It was his second straight start missing out on his 200th career win, and he will hope that the third time’s the charm.\nSunday, September 4: Erick Fedde vs. Carlos Carrasco, 1:40 p.m. on SNY\nFedde (2022): 100.1 IP, 80 K, 49 BB, 15 HR, 5.29 ERA, 4.94 FIP, 1.57 WHIP, 0.1 bWAR\nFedde has had a typical Fedde year, which is to say, his ERA’s been in the mid-fours for most of it. The right-hander, who has been a staple in the Washington rotation for the past few years, had a rough one his last time out, allowing six earned runs on a season-high nine hits over just 2 2⁄3 innings against Oakland. It was his second straight start absorbing a loss, and fourth time in five outings. The Mets pummeled him at Citi Field back on May 30, collecting six runs on eight hits against Fedde and knocking him out of the game after 1 1⁄3 innings.\nCarrasco (2022): 126.1 IP, 124 K, 33 BB, 15 HR, 3.92 ERA, 3.65 FIP, 1.30 WHIP, 1.6 bWAR\nCarrasco was set to miss 3-4 weeks with a low grade oblique strain, but he’s returning on the low end of that projection and without a rehab assignment. The right-hander tossed a simulated game and a bullpen session and was deemed well enough to return on Sunday, though he will likely be limited in how deep he can go into the game. He exited his last start against the Atlanta Braves after only 2.0 innings, where he gave up three earned runs on four hits with two strikeouts and a walk (and a rain delay interruption in the middle). Before that, he was on a nice run of three straight quality starts, and had posted a 1.70 ERA, a 2.80 FIP, and a 1.16 WHIP in a six-start span from July 9 through August 9.\nPrediction: The Mets sweep the Nationals!",

He offers his analysis, and thoughts on how to overcome the major problems it has created.\nIbram X. Kendi, professor in the Humanities and the founding director of the Boston University Center for Antiracist Research, and the author of How to Raise an Antiracist (One World, 2022), talks about his new book offering guidance to parents and caregivers.\nNeil deGrasse Tyson, astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, a host of the StarTalk Radio podcasts, author of the forthcoming Starry Messenger: Cosmic Perspectives on Civilization (Henry Holt &amp; Co, 2022), explains why everyone is so excited about the images from the Webb telescope.\nA new company recently purchased eighteen Spanish-language stations that will serve ten of the largest Latinx-populated cities in the country. Graciela Mochkofsky, dean of the Craig Newmark School of Journalism, contributing writer for The New Yorker, and the author of The Prophet of the Andes: An Unlikely Journey to the Promised Land (Knopf, 2022), talks about what this means for the Spanish speaking community, plus her thoughts on the state of journalism as she enters her new role as dean of the Craig Newmark School of Journalism.\nDuring this moving season, listeners call in to share the best way to get rid of unwanted household items and others share where to pick up the best freebies.\n\n \nThese interviews were polished up and edited for time.

Your job, as this titular lamb, is clear: gather devotees to worship the eldritch being, and murder the four heretic bishops who oppose him.

        "description": "The principles of classical liberalism that underlie the American political system emerged in an era, the late 17th century, when people were exhausted by violent religious wars. The philosophy that eventually created our democracy was therefore designed to “lower the temperature of politics,” as Francis Fukuyama has recently written, to take issues of existential truth off the table so that people could live in safety. In liberal democracies, citizens were persuaded to adopt a culture of moderation, restraint, and adherence to the rule of law; respect for the rights of others to think what they want; support for independent courts, checks and balances, and neutral institutions such as election boards. None of that has necessarily been very inspiring to people who want high emotion, feelings of unity, or moral crusades in public life. In Liberalism and Its Discontents, Fukuyama argues that the values of liberal democracy are by definition “thinner than those offered by societies bound by a single religious doctrine,” and he is right.[Shadi Hamid: America without God]This is the deep source of the most serious problem facing Joe Biden, and not just Joe Biden: how to energize citizens to defend moderation, how to create excitement about institutions that were designed not to be exciting, how to build enthusiasm for the political center—the people of all political beliefs who still respect the rules and understand why they are important. Above all, how to get Americans to see that the challenge presented by the “MAGA Republicans,” as the president called them in his speech last night, is not a normal political challenge. Trump’s political movement is not a threat to liberal democracy because of its beliefs about taxes, spending, welfare, immigration, energy policy, or even abortion, however vehemently some Americans might disagree with them. Nor is it threatening because it is conservative, for it is not conservative in the traditional sense at all.MAGA Republicans are rather a threat because their leader does not accept the outcome of elections when he loses them; because he does not believe that the rule of law applies to him; because he does not adhere to the culture of restraint, tolerance, and moderation; and because he is now seeking to help elect other politicians who feel the same way. In their drive to change the political system, and to ensure that they can retain power even if they lose, Trump’s followers have verbally and sometimes physically attacked Capitol police officers, election workers, the FBI, the Department of Justice, and civil servants. He and his acolytes use violent language, and they inspire violence in return. As Biden put it last night, they “tried everything last time to nullify the votes of 81 million people. This time, they’re determined to succeed in thwarting the will of the people.”For most of his presidency, Biden has dealt with this problem by largely ignoring it, scarcely mentioning Trump at all. Instead, he sought to change the subject, to speak about infrastructure or climate policy rather than existential issues. As a way of dealing with violent political division, this tactic has a long history. It was used in Northern Ireland, for example, where the idea was to get people to talk about building community centers so that they would stop talking about killing one another. Some European politicians challenged by the far-right in their own countries have tried something similar. Pablo Casado, until recently the leader of the Spanish center right, once told me he wanted to focus on the economic issues underlying the culture wars. He hoped to build support among people who wanted a pragmatic conversation, not an ideological one.[David Frum: The justification for Biden’s speech]But in a culture as noisy as ours, and in a world where social-media algorithms automatically promote the most emotional thoughts and messages, this tactic can fail. Moderate language gets drowned out. Talk of infrastructure sounds boring; climate change seems too distant a prospect to matter. Restraint can seem like weakness or indifference. Another European politician, the Polish center-right leader Donald Tusk (who is also fighting an antidemocratic political movement), has told me that he thinks politicians have to be “willing to sacrifice something, risk something” or their voters won’t take them seriously. In Biden’s case, moderation can also seem like exhaustion, as if he is too old and too tired to care deeply anymore.But clearly Biden does care. And so he has taken the risky and genuinely brave decision to use emotional language in defense of our rules-based political system. The speech he gave last night at Independence Hall in Philadelphia, the place where a lot of those rules were written, was indeed lit and orchestrated to evoke drama. It was also meant to evoke strong feelings of patriotism, unity, and connection. Biden referenced American history—”We, the people, have burning inside of each of us the flame of liberty that was lit here at Independence Hall”—as well as American pride. He contrasted Trump’s dark, apocalyptic worldview with his own: “I see a different America, an America with an unlimited future, an America that’s about to take off.” The United States, he said, “is still the beacon to the world, an ideal to be realized, a promise to be kept. There’s nothing more important. Nothing more sacred.”Biden in fact used the religious word sacred three other times, speaking of “sacred ground,” the “sacred flame,” and the “sacred proposition that all are created equal in the image of God.” But he sought to evoke anger as well as patriotism. When he excoriated the MAGA Republicans, he did not use the normal political language of disagreement but called their movement a form of “extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.” Finally he issued a call to action, telling Americans what he thought they should do about it: not commit retaliatory violence but “speak up, speak out, get engaged, vote, vote, vote!”The use of political emotion in a deeply divided society carries some dangers. It is guaranteed to provoke an equally emotional response on the other side, raising temperatures instead of lowering them. Angry language makes the other side angry too, and can also galvanize voters. Precisely that reaction rippled across pro-Trump media and social media last night after the speech. The Fox News host Tucker Carlson declared that the president had “crossed into a very dangerous, very dangerous place.” Biden was accused of “criminalizing political opposition.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said Biden had chosen “to divide, demean, and disparage his fellow Americans.” The Republican Party will undoubtedly start fundraising among those Americans who do indeed feel demeaned and disparaged. I expect that some Democrats will feel uneasy about Biden’s speech for the same reason.Another danger is that the speech will be seen as partisan, as a plea for people to vote for Democrats, rather than as a call for all Americans to support liberal democracy. Clearly the White House was aware of this danger, which is why Biden addressed himself to “Democrats, independents, and mainstream Republicans.” That’s also why he went out of his way to note that “not every Republican, not even the majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology. I know, because I’ve been able to work with these mainstream Republicans.” Unfortunately, the timing of the speech, in the run-up to the midterm elections, will lead many to dismiss it anyway. So will Biden’s oblique and (in this context) possibly unnecessary references to abortion and contraception. Republican politicians and television presenters will deliberately frame the speech so that GOP voters interpret it as partisan, and many voters will only ever hear that commentary, and not listen to the words of the speech at all.Most dangerous of all, though, is the possibility that in a tribalized political system like ours, the Constitution, once it is championed by one political camp, may itself come to seem like a partisan cause, a thing that Democrats and maybe Liz Cheney care about, but nobody else. If, to be a fully paid-up member of the Republican Party, you have to go on pretending that the 2020 election was stolen and the January 6 insurrectionists were patriots, then you may eventually come to believe that rule of law is something to be defeated, not respected. Election laws become something that your enemies care about, not you.[Mark Leibovich: Liz Cheney, the Republican from the state of reality]Biden is betting that we are not at that stage yet. The language of his speech presumed that, in making an emotional appeal in favor of liberal democracy, he was still speaking to a decisive majority of the country. That’s why he kept using the expression we the people, a phrase that, of course, references the Constitution, but also expresses a sense of unity—a unity that should, in principle, still include people with a huge range of political tastes and views.  “We the people,” he said, “accept the results of free and fair elections.” We the people “see politics, not as total war, but mediation of our differences.” And once again: “We the people,” Biden said, “have burning inside of each of us the flame of liberty that was lit here at Independence Hall.”That sentence assumes that the 17th-century ideas debated in Philadelphia in the 18th century still mean something to the citizens who live by them today. Biden clearly believes they do. The future of liberal democracy in America depends on whether he is right.  ",

        "description": "Far more has gone wrong than right for the 2022 Giants, but the team&#8217;s offseason signing of outfielder Joc Pederson to a one-year, $6MM contract has proven to be a shrewd investment. Pederson has hit well in his first season as a Giant, and he&#8217;s apparently made a good impression on the organization in all facets, as president of baseball operations Farhan Zaidi said in an appearance on KNBR&#8217;s Tolbert &amp; Copes show yesterday that he&#8217;s had discussions with Pederson and his agent about re-signing him (link to full 23-minute interview).\n&#8220;We&#8217;d love to have him back next year,&#8221; Zaidi said when asked what the future held for Pederson. &#8220;We&#8217;ve talked some to his representative. I&#8217;ve talked to Joc about it himself. He&#8217;s from here. He&#8217;s played well. He was an All-Star for us.&#8221;\nPederson, 30, has indeed enjoyed a strong year in San Francisco. The Palo Alto native has appeared in 107 games, tallied 348 plate appearances and slashed .263/.339/.519 with 20 home runs, 17 doubles and three stolen bases (in five attempts). He&#8217;s walked at an 8.6% clip, and this year&#8217;s 21.6% strikeout rate is his lowest mark since 2019 (and tied for the third-lowest of his career). The Giants have shielded him from lefties almost entirely &#8212; he has just 46 plate appearances against same-handed opponents &#8212; but that&#8217;s nothing new for Pederson, who carries just a .210/.285/.334 batting line against southpaws (compared to .240/.342/.494 against righties).\nIt&#8217;s been the best offensive showing for Pederson since his career-high 36 home runs back in 2019, but defensive metrics on the slugger are down across the board. Each of Defensive Runs Saved (-7), Ultimate Zone Rating (-6.6) and Outs Above Average (-6) are critical of Pederson&#8217;s glovework. He&#8217;s also spent 10 games at designated hitter for the Giants, though, and Pederson&#8217;s pop against right-handed pitching is plenty sufficient to fill that role if the Giants are concerned about his defensive work moving forward.\nIf Pederson does reach the market, he&#8217;ll be one of the more appealing options on a fairly thin market for corner outfield bats. Aaron Judge, of course, is the top free agent on the market, and Andrew Benintendi will be in a nice position heading into his age-28 season on the heels of a strong all-around showing. Beyond that pairing, Pederson will slot into the next tier alongside names like Mitch Haniger, Joey Gallo and Jurickson Profar (who seems likely to opt out of the final year of his Padres contract).\nAs with any potential free agent, Pederson&#8217;s return (or his departure) is largely dependent on the context of the roster around him. In-house outfield options for the Giants next year include Austin Slater, LaMonte Wade Jr., Luis Gonzalez and Mike Yastrzemski &#8212; to say nothing of prospects Heliot Ramos, Luis Matos and Vaun Brown. Ramos and Matos, however, have had down seasons in the minors, just as Yastrzemski has in the big leagues. Struggles notwithstanding, however, Zaidi implied that the team plans to tender a contract to Yastrzemski in arbitration this winter and retain him for the 2023 campaign.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s just been a down season for him,&#8221; Zaidi said of Yastrzemski. &#8220;He&#8217;s been frustrated. Last year, the batting average wasn&#8217;t there but he still hit 25 homers, so you still had offensive production in a certain way. He&#8217;s still a guy who brings a ton of intangibles to the table. He&#8217;s a great defensive player. We view him as part of this team going forward, and I know he&#8217;s going to be as motivated as anybody to come back strong next year.&#8221;\nYastrzemski, who just turned 32 a couple weeks ago, will be due a raise on this year&#8217;s $3.7MM salary but has stumbled to a .203/.303/.361 batting line in 439 plate appearances. He&#8217;s still drawing walks at a strong 11.6% clip, however, and Yastrzemski&#8217;s strikeout rate, exit velocity, hard-hit rate and broader batted-ball profile are all quite similar to his prior, more productive seasons.\nThe Giants can control Yastrzemski for three more years beyond the current campaign, so there&#8217;s good reason to place a reasonably low-cost bet on a rebound if the team doesn&#8217;t believe his skill set has begun to decline. That said, both Yastrzemski and Pederson are left-handed hitting outfielders who could require platoon partners &#8212; Yastrzesmki has struggled severely against lefties in each of the past two seasons &#8212; so the extent to which the Giants again want to lean on a platoon, matchup-based outfield set will drive the decisions on both players. For the time being, it sounds as though the Giants are open to again leaning heavily on both lefties in the outfield again next season.",

        "description": "Just as Chinese President Xi Jinping is readying to further consolidating his power by obtaining another five-year term at China’s upcoming 20th Party Congress, former Soviet prime minister Mikhail Gorbachev’s posthumous return to media headlines evokes glasnost, an open political system that is the antithesis of Xi’s rule. Moreover, the memory of Gorbachev’s advocacy of perestroika, the termination of central planning and the opening up of markets, poses an even greater headache for the Chinese leader, since Xi has done the very opposite. \n\n\n\nIn the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, Chinese leaders, academics and think tankers all studied what had happened in the USSR with intent to preserve the central role of the Chinese Communist Party and avoid the mistakes that led to that superpower’s implosion in 1991. Perhaps the most important conclusion that then-Chinese leader Deng Xiaoping drew was that China had to open up its economy in order to ensure the Communist Party’s continued authoritarian rule. \n\n\n\nDeng’s vision was the impetus for the country’s remarkable growth during the last decade of the 20th century and the first dozen years of the 21st. From 1991 to 1997, China’s gross domestic product never fell below 9.2 percent and in four of those years it exceeded double digits. China’s GDP returned to double digits in 2003 and never fell below 9.4 percent until 2012. By then, Deng was long gone and the second of his two successors as supreme Chinese leader, president Hu Jintao, would retire the following year, to be succeeded by Xi. China has never achieved 9 percent GDP growth at any time during Xi’s rule.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn contrast to Deng’s economic vision, which was meant to ensure that the basic thrust of perestroika would never overflow into glasnost, Xi’s policies have restricted free economic activity, while supporting inefficient state-owned enterprises. In line with his regression to centralized state economic management, Xi has supported major works projects, many of which are nothing more than white elephants. All of those policies have compounded the weaknesses of an economy that is riddled with corruption, has an ongoing real estate crisis, and maintains a banking system whose real estate-based assets are, as a consequence, highly questionable. \n\n\n\nBeijing’s harsh and unrelenting response to the COVID pandemic — ordering lockdowns of major cities affecting the movement of millions of people — has further undermined Chinese growth. Indeed, the International Monetary Fund estimates that Chinese GDP will grow by only 3.3 percent in 2022, while private estimates are even lower. Goldman Sachs now projects Chinese GDP to grow by only 3 percent in 2022, and Nomura Securities is even more pessimistic, lowering its GDP projection to 2.8 percent. Chinese industrial production has slowed, as have retail sales. Such declines threaten the fundamental balance of economic growth and rising standards of living, coupled with tight political control that was Deng’s compact with China’s citizens. The result could well be the very instability that Xi and his circle fear could threaten their rule. \n\n\n\nIn recent weeks, Xi has begun to speak of the need to reset the economy, which in practice would require him to undo the damage that he has inflicted upon it. Perhaps he has come to recognize that while his belligerent harassment of Taiwan might stir up popular jingoism, it will not substitute for the economic growth that has improved the lives of hundreds of millions of Chinese since 1991. Indeed, Deng Xiaoping drew more than economic lessons from the fall of the Soviet Union under Gorbachev’s leadership. He not only called for a more open economy to prevent internal discontent, but also advocated a restrained foreign policy to entice the West in general and the United States in particular to assist China’s development. \n\n\n\nChina’s current economic travails can be remedied only if Xi recognizes the wisdom of Deng’s economic policies and his studied avoidance of regional and international tensions, which contributed to saving Communist China from the fate of the Soviet Union. Thus far, however, Xi has shown no indication that he is prepared to restore Deng’s policies, which would lead him to reverse the backward economic course that he has pursued for a decade and to dial back his militaristic pressure on not only Taiwan but all his East and Southeast Asian neighbors.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe prospects that he will do so anytime soon remain dim, at best, to the detriment of both a stable region and a healthy Chinese economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDov S.

Group of Seven (G-7) agreed to a price cap on Russian oil Friday as Moscow countered with its own plans to halt energy flows to Europe amid an already fraught European energy situation.\n\n\n\nThe group of advanced global economies agreed that it would refuse to ship oil from Russia if it is sold at a price higher than the price cap, an attempt to curb Russian profits from the sale of the fuel.\n\n\n\n“Today we confirm our joint political intention to finalise and implement a comprehensive prohibition of services which enable maritime transportation of Russian-origin crude oil and petroleum products globally – the provision of such services would only be allowed if the oil and petroleum products are purchased at or below a price ('the price cap') determined by the broad coalition of countries adhering to and implementing the price cap,” the group said in a statement sent out by the U.S. Treasury Department.\n\n\n\nThe countries did not announce what the price cap would be, saying that this decision would come later.\n\n\n\n“The initial price cap will be set at a level based on a range of technical inputs and will be decided by the full coalition in advance of implementation in each jurisdiction,\" the statement continued. \"The price cap will be publicly communicated in a clear and transparent manner. The price cap ́s effectiveness and impact will be closely monitored and the price level revisited as necessary.”\n\n\n\nRussia is the third largest oil producer in the world. Some countries, including the U.S., have already said they will not import Russian oil, but other countries, including China and India, have continued to provide a market for the oil.\n\n\n\nThe refusal to ship Russian oil not sold below a price cap appears to be an attempt to cut into these continued profits.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFollowing Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, global oil prices spiked as many feared embargoes. However, in recent weeks, prices have calmed down as Russian barrels found other buyers and amid fears of a recession.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe G-7 countries are the United States, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom.",

        "description": "Short online trainings show promise for reducing mental health bias among probation and parole officers, findings indicate.\nStudies show having mental illness can affect the chances of someone on probation or parole getting out from under government supervision. To combat this, it&#8217;s not only important that individuals have access to mental health resources, but also that the officers involved know how and when to use them.\nAccording to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, more than 4 million people in the United States are currently on probation, and more than 15% of these people have some kind of mental health need. University of Missouri professor Ashley Givens created an online training about mental illness for Missouri Department of Corrections probation and parole officers when the department reached out.\nTo measure the module&#8217;s success, she recorded the officers&#8217; level of bias about mental illness both before and after the training, and she found that even this low amount of training can be successful at reducing stigma towards mental illness, especially for people who had a low level of stigma going in.\nGivens gave participants from the state of Missouri surveys to understand their baseline beliefs about people with mental illness. The goal of the training is for officers who run into issues with individuals on their caseload to consider what mental illness can look like and what behaviors might be symptoms of a mental illness rather than non-compliant actions. Trainings like the ones that Givens puts together can help provide the officers with the knowledge they need to determine if their supervisee needs additional resources before being punished for non-compliance. However, Givens found they are also successful in fighting stigma.\n&#8220;There are two main takeaways from this study,&#8221; Givens says. &#8220;First is that even very basic training can reduce stigma surrounding mental illness. We trained for about an hour or so, and even that minimal amount of training reduced the bias of the officers. The second big takeaway is that the larger their pre-test stigma was, the less change in stigma was tracked in the test after the training.&#8221;\nIn other words, the research shows that the more bias an individual had before the training, the less effective the training actually was. However, the training did have an effect, even if it was a minute one. Givens believes this finding should actually encourage those that are attempting to free people of their stigma.\n&#8220;We tend to think of stigma as a huge issue, and that it is impossible to get somebody to overcome their unconscious biases,&#8221; Givens says. &#8220;What this shows is that even moving the needle by just a little bit is better than not trying to address it and not moving that needle. If we can take small increments and move the needle little by little, we can take small steps that can make a large impact overtime.&#8221;\nGivens says this underscores the importance of introductory and regularly dispersed trainings, but also shows the importance of vetting.\n&#8220;If we want to address this problem, we have to really think about who is being hired, who is interacting with these folks, and what their attitudes are coming in,&#8221; Givens says. &#8220;We have to think about how do we, from the very beginning of their employment, really set these officers up to take mental illness seriously, and not interpret a psychotic episode as a non-compliance?&#8221;\nThe study appears in the journal Criminal Behavior and Mental Health.\nSource: University of Missouri\nThe post Can training cut bias among probation, parole officers? appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "An insulin-suppressing protein may be the fountain of youth for ants and provides clues about aging in other species, according to a new study.\nPublished in Science, the study shows that queen ants exhibit high metabolism for reproduction without undergoing aging by generating an anti-insulin protein that blocks only part of the insulin pathway that is responsible for aging.\nIn many animals, having many offspring is linked to a shorter lifespan. This trade-off between fertility and longevity in animals is thought to result from how nutritional and metabolic resources are allocated.\nInsulin—a hormone that helps convert food into energy—plays a major role in metabolism, but also in aging. Producing eggs is energy intensive and requires extra food, which raises insulin levels, but increased activity of the insulin pathway required for reproduction leads to shorter lifespan in most animals.\nIn contrast, dietary restriction keeps insulin levels down and prolongs life; in fact, other researchers are exploring whether fasting improves longevity.\nBlack garden ant queens can lay one million eggs and live for 30 years.\nAnts are a notable exception to the trade-off between reproduction and longevity, as their queens—which are responsible for the whole colony&#8217;s reproduction—live much longer than worker ants while sharing the same genome.\nIn a species such as the black garden ant, a queen can lay one million eggs and live for 30 years, while her sterile worker sisters only live for a year.\nIn Harpegnathos saltator ants, a species of jumping ant native to India that was the focus of the current study, queens typically live for five years while workers live for only seven months.\nWhen the Harpegnathos queen dies in a colony, a peculiar event occurs: female worker ants duel each other with their antennae, vying to become the next queen. The duel winners change &#8220;caste&#8221; in the ant society and become pseudoqueens, also known as gamergates, while still remaining in the (smaller) body of a worker.\nPseudoqueens acquire queen-like behaviors, including laying eggs, and their life expectancy substantially increases from seven months to four years. But, if they are replaced by another queen, they revert to their worker status, stop laying eggs, and their lifespan is shortened back to seven months.\n&#8220;By undergoing reversible &#8216;caste switching&#8217; from workers to pseudoqueens that results in a dramatic increase in both their lifespan and ability to reproduce, Harpegnathos ants provide a unique opportunity to study how aging and reproduction can be disconnected,&#8221; says co-senior author Claude Desplan, professor of biology and neural science at New York University.\nUsing bulk RNA-sequencing, the researchers studied tissue samples from both workers and pseudoqueens, focusing on parts of the ant involved in metabolism and reproduction including the brain, fat body (the liver of insects), and ovaries.\nThey found that the ants that switched from worker to pseudoqueen produce more insulin in their brains in order to produce eggs. This increased insulin results in the activation of one of the two main branches of the insulin signaling pathway, MAPK, which controls metabolism and egg formation.\nThe increased insulin in pseudoqueens induces ovary development, which then begins producing an insulin-suppressing protein called Imp-L2. Imp-L2 blocks signaling in the other main branch of the insulin signaling pathway, AKT, which controls aging and whose increased activity leads to shorter life span.\n&#8220;The two main branches of the insulin signaling pathway appear to differentially regulate fertility and lifespan, with increased signaling in one aiding reproduction in pseudoqueens and decreased signaling in the other consistent with their extended longevity,&#8221; says the study&#8217;s co-senior author Danny Reinberg, professor of biochemistry and molecular pharmacology at NYU Grossman School of Medicine and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator.\n&#8220;This interplay, which evolved in ants and perhaps in other insects, may contribute to the unusual longevity and many offspring in reproducing ants,&#8221; says Hua Yan, the study&#8217;s co-first author and a former postdoctoral researcher at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, who is now an assistant professor of biology at the University of Florida.\n&#8220;Our work also illustrates the importance of using the appropriate model systems to ask questions about essential biological questions. For instance, most manipulations of longevity in animals like mice or flies usually extend their lifespans by 10 to 20%. Ants exhibit a remarkable 500% increase in longevity, which makes studying them much more powerful,&#8221; adds Desplan.\nAdditional study authors are from South China Agricultural University and NYU. The Howard Hughes Medical Institute Collaborative Innovation Awards, the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Human Frontier Science Program funded the work.\nSource: NYU\nThe post Anti-insulin protein drives queen ant longevity appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Photo by John McCoy/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Astros (84-47, 1st in AL West) return to the West Coast for a weekend series against the disappointing Angels (57-74, 4th in AL West) Quick Notes\nI’m squeezed on time for this post, so gonna have to make this short and sweet:\nThe Angels have been bad this season.\nOk, a little less short: After much ballyhoo that the Angels were going to finally be able to break out in 2022, those predictions have been proven very false.  They had a big blow a while back with superstar Mike Trout missing a couple of months with a back injury, but really the familiar saga of big offense anchored by several stud players being unable to overcome bad pitching has reasserted itself.\nThat’s not to say that the Angels are a cakewalk as any professional MLB team is going to strike gold every once in a while.  In fact, the Astros arrive in town just as the Angels seem to be on the upswing, winning 5 of their last 6 games, which came against the Blue Jays and Yankees.  Though it certainly is germane to point out that they were swept by the Rays in a 4-game series, and lost a series to the Tigers immediately before that.\nThey won’t be playing October baseball this season, though, so we’ll see if their motivation to play spoiler for the Astros’ #1 seeding motivates them to a series win this weekend.\nOffensive Stats: YTD, Last 7 Days\nPitching Stats: YTD, Last 7 Days\nLast 10 Games: 5-5 Record, 2 Series Win, 1 Series Swept, +1 Run Differential (41 scored, 40 allowed)\nW/L Splits: 28-37 at home, 29-37 on the road, 27-48 against teams over .500\nInjured List: Jared Walsh: 60-Day IL (rib), Mickey Moniak: 10-Day IL (finger), Michael Lorenzen: 60-Day IL (shoulder), Archie Bradley: 60-Day IL (elbow), Anthony Rendon: 60-Day IL (wrist), Chris Rodriguez: 60-Day IL (shoulder), Griffin Canning: 60-Day IL (back)\n\n\n\nStarters\nGame 1: Lance McCullers, Jr. (RHP, 1-1, 1.69 ERA, 13 K’s) vs Reid Detmers (LHP, 5-4, 3.47 ERA, 99K’s)\nGame 2: Luis Garcia (RHP, 11-8, 4.14 ERA, 132 K’s) vs Shohei Ohtani (RHP, 11-8, 2.67 ERA, 176 K’s)\nGame 3: Jose Urquidy (RHP, 12-5, 3.69 ERA, 109 K’s) vs Tucker Davidson (LHP, 2-4, 5.77 ERA, 21 K’s)\n\nFor Your Viewing and Listening Pleasure\nGame 1: Friday, September 2nd @ 8:38 pm CDTListen: Astros - KBME 790 AM/94.5 FM HD-2, KTRH 740 AM/99.1 FM HD-2, TUDN 93.3/KLAT 1010 / Angels - KLAA 830, KWKW 1330Watch: Astros - ATT SportsNet-SW / Angels - Bally Sports West\nGame 2: Saturday, September 3rd @ 8:07 pm CDTListen: Astros - KBME 790 AM/94.5 FM HD-2, KTRH 740 AM/99.1 FM HD-2, TUDN 93.3/KLAT 1010 / Angels - KLAA 830Watch: Astros - ATT SportsNet-SW / Angels - Bally Sports West\nGame 3: Friday, September 4th @ 3:07 pm CDTListen: Astros - KBME 790 AM/94.5 FM HD-2, KTRH 740 AM/99.1 FM HD-2, TUDN 93.3/KLAT 1010 / Angels - KLAA 830Watch: Astros - ATT SportsNet-SW / Angels - Bally Sports West",

The Japanese yen and the euro have fallen to their lowest levels against the greenback in two decades; the euro, long worth more than one dollar, is now hovering close to parity. The US Federal Reserve’s broad trade-weighted dollar index has almost reattained the peak it reached in March 2020 amid the panic triggered by the start of the Covid-19 pandemic. In fact, if one adjusts for inflation in the US and its trading partners, it is already higher.This is happening despite the US recording its highest annual inflation rate in four decades and its worst trade balance since the global financial crisis. What is going on, and is the dollar set to plummet? Continue reading...",

        "description": "Peter Spiegel: &#8220;After more than a half decade of Trump scandals, those of us who follow the vicissitudes of the ex-president for a living have, I think, come to a general theory of what compels the man to transgress so spectacularly.&#8221;\n&#8220;There are no grand, well-planned conspiracies, despite what many once feared. The Russia scandal that dogged the early months of Trump’s presidency, for instance, did not turn up evidence that he was some kind of Manchurian Candidate, in the direct employ of the Kremlin, doing its bidding.&#8221;\n&#8220;Instead, there is mere industrial-scale venality. The man will seemingly do anything for sex (Stormy Daniels, Billy Bush); money (Deutsche Bank, Trump Foundation); or power (the Zelensky call, January 6). The Russia scandal, the Mueller report suggested, fell under the heading of &#8216;power&#8217;: Trump was willing to rely on the assistance of his own country’s foreign adversary if it helped him get elected. And then he tried to hide that eagerness from federal investigators.&#8221;\n&#8220;If his official and political sins are tied to his outsized human vices, though, how to explain the zealousness with which he clung on to hundreds of pages of the US’s most highly-classified secrets — including, it appears, the identities of clandestine foreign sources that were feeding intelligence to the CIA? Keeping hold of those documents doesn’t immediately suggest a way to make money, or regain power, or attract women.&#8221;",

The president’s supposedly grand speech in ‘defense of democracy’ under attack by ‘Trump and the MAGA Republicans’ was hardly a visionary call to renew our commitment to the Republic.”\n\n\n\n“If it had been the highfalutin speech we were promised, Biden wouldn’t have spent ludicrous time praising himself for things like prescription-drug costs and burn-pit health coverage. No, this speech was nakedly, even comically, designed not to elevate but to offend — to poke and taunt and push his predecessor and his predecessor’s camp followers and acolytes into firing back about how evil Biden is.”\n\n\n\nRich Lowry: “Trump and Biden compensate for each other’s problems, and they are effectively working together to get Trump nominated — which Trump wants because it’s the necessary precondition for winning a second term and Biden wants because Trump would be the riskiest GOP candidate in a general election.”\n\n\n\n“It’s not the most edifying relationship. Indeed, it’s a de facto partnership toward a demoralizing rerun of 2020. But neither Trump nor Biden is as likely to get where they want to go without the other.”",

The school, the police, the security forces who had been monitoring the girls’ communications with IS recruiters – every institution responsible with their protection put forward tales to explain how three working-class girls aged just 15 and 16 had made their way out of Britain and navigated their way across multiple national borders to the most dangerous war zone on the planet.

        "description": "As the new school year kicks off, several California school districts are finding creative ways to provide housing for teachers who are being priced out of the neighborhoods they serve.\n\n\n\nJust south of San Francisco, voters approved the construction of a 122-unit apartment complex on property owned by the Jefferson Union High School District,&nbsp;CBS News&nbsp;reported. The building rents to the district’s teachers and staff at more affordable rates.\n\n\n\nTerra Nova High School, a school in the district that had previously faced job vacancies over the high cost of living, is now fully staffed, according to CBS.\n\n\n\nAnother school district in the San Francisco Bay Area recently asked parents if they had rooms available for teachers to rent, The Washington Post reported. The Milpitas Unified School District lost 10 teachers in the previous academic year over the lack of affordable housing.\n\n\n\n“Many of the Milpitas Unified School District moderate-income employees are working families and are finding it increasingly difficult to purchase or rent a home within a 15 mile radius or close to the Milpitas Unified School District where they work,” the Milpitas school board noted in a&nbsp;recent resolution.\n\n\n\nSchools across the country are facing severe teaching shortages and dealing with the lack of educators in unique ways. Arizona removed the requirement that its teachers have bachelor’s degrees. In Florida, veterans can become temporary teachers, also without a bachelor’s degree. \n\n\n\nIn California, known for its astronomical housing prices, teachers’ salaries have not kept up with the housing market. In 2016, a Redfin analysis of several California counties found that just 17 percent of homes for sale were affordable on the average teacher’s salary, according to the Post.\n\n\n\nAs of the 2019-2020 school year, the average teacher’s salary in California was $84,531, according to the California Department of Education. The average home in the state now costs $683,000, according to Forbes.",

Department records unsealed on Friday offer new details about the volume of documents former President Trump stored in his personal office at Mar-a-Lago, as well as other items seized during the search of his Florida home.\n\n\n\nThe filing underscores just how many presidential records Trump was storing at his home and offers a breakdown of the more than 100 classified documents the Department of Justice (DOJ) says it recovered from Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nFBI agents found 43 empty folders with classified banners in Trump's personal office as well as another 28 empty folders that were labeled “return to staff secretary/military aide,” according to the inventory.\n\n\n\nThe records were unsealed Friday by order of a federal judge who is reviewing a request from Trump to appoint a third-party special master to review the evidence seized, including a motion to block the FBI’s investigation during that review.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tREAD: Full inventory of documents seized in Trump search\t\n\n\n\n\nThe inventory offers few new details about the classified materials themselves stored at Mar-a-Lago, but it does shed light on the extent classified materials were intermixed with Trump’s personal belongings.\n\n\n\nA brief filed by the government just before midnight Tuesday indicated they found three classified records within Trump’s very own desk.\n\n\n\nBut the Friday inventory details in broad strokes the others that were found within his office: three documents marked confidential, 17 documents marked secret and seven documents marked top-secret.\n\n\n\nTheir location in Trump’s office could be significant to the Justice Department's investigation, particularly after it alleged earlier this week that items were “likely concealed and removed.”\n\n\n\nStorage in Trump’s personal office, rather than the storage room at Mar-a-Lago, could undercut potential claims that staff were unaware of the extent classified materials were stored on the property.\n\n\n\nEarlier review of items seized indicates some of the items recovered were stored alongside Trump’s passports.\n\n\n\nIn a filing accompanying the latest inventory, the Justice Department noted that “all evidence — including the nature and manner in which they were stored” — will inform their investigation.\n\n\n\nAn FBI affidavit the DOJ used to request the warrant that allowed for the search indicated the storage of such documents at Mar-a-Lago could constitute a violation of the Espionage Act.\n\n\n\nAnd the Tuesday filing from DOJ also expanded on the government’s rationale for including an obstruction statute on its warrant, breaking down numerous efforts to recover documents and indicating Trump’s team failed to turn over some documents even after receiving a subpoena. \n\n\n\nThe filing also breaks down the staggering number of government documents Trump was storing at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nTrump retained nearly 10,000 of what the Justice Department calls “US government documents/photographs without classification markings.”\n\n\n\nOf those, 1,463 records were kept in Trump’s office with another 8,141 kept in the storage room at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 11:37 a.m.",

        "description": "Russia’s invasion of Ukraine is a reminder that energy security is both a national security issue and a household financial security issue.&nbsp;When oil and gas prices go up for any reason, including due to supply side constraints from this war, the nation struggles to find affordable alternative supplies and ends up buying energy from disagreeable and undemocratic foreign regimes, undoubtedly helping to prop them up.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEverything energy related – from the price at the pump to the energy we consume to run air conditioners or, before you know it, heat for the winter – has been skyrocketing.&nbsp;When that happens, we should find ways to bring energy prices down, especially from domestic sources, instead of supporting frivolous litigious escapades that drive up prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet, the latter is exactly what we see happening with&nbsp;dozens of pending lawsuits in state and federal courts&nbsp;across the country brought in recent years by&nbsp;states, counties and municipalities against fossil fuel companies.&nbsp;The&nbsp;cases seek to hold these companies liable for climate change damages under novel theories of “public nuisance”&nbsp;and consumer fraud.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe cases are not only legally deficient but also&nbsp;effectively impose a tax on producing energy.&nbsp;Even if the energy companies eventually win, the costs of the litigation alone drive up prices.&nbsp;Further, even though the legal theories are flawed, the settlement pressures are huge, again threatening additional increases in the cost of doing business that will be passed on to consumers in the form of higher energy prices to cover the bounty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe looseness of our standards for tort lawsuits is directly proportional to increased prices for consumer goods.&nbsp;This is the reason to see tort lawsuits as effectively taxes on goods.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIndeed,&nbsp;some of the activist plaintiffs in these climate lawsuits have&nbsp;expressly stated that one purpose of these lawsuits is to drive energy prices up&nbsp;to cut into profitability and reduce demand to hobble the fossil fuel industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn fact, some&nbsp;activists have acknowledged that they purposefully&nbsp;hope to directly harm not just companies but also consumers&nbsp;by making it hard for the average household to afford fossil fuel-based energy&nbsp;under a paternalistic desire to force these consumers to choose alternative sources. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is the havoc wreaked when plaintiffs’ attorneys and other crusaders abuse the legal system for personal profit or political causes.&nbsp;The legal system is sometimes unabashedly manipulated by activists to try to effect social change.&nbsp;Too often lost in the conversation is the tax the activists’ advocacy have on society as a whole, and how their efforts, if successful, impose costs on all of us in terms of increased prices caused by the liability and litigation costs they impose on producers of consumer goods.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese climate-change lawsuits are just the latest example of this effect.&nbsp;Notably, these dozens of climate change lawsuits target almost exclusively U.S. and European energy companies&nbsp;(already the most regulated in the world) rather than the less environmentally sensitive operators such as Venezuela’s PDVSA, Russia’s Gazprom or Rosneft, or Saudi Arabia’s Aramco, which are much harder to get jurisdiction over in U.S. state and federal courts, in part because they are often foreign state-owned.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe consequence of this selectivity is that the privately held U.S. and European companies see their cost of doing business increase.&nbsp;That’s what litigation liability is — an added cost on production.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOf course, the companies not sued operating in dangerous and less environmentally sensitive countries do not face such costs.&nbsp;The natural consequence is that the U.S. companies must increase prices and suffer a competitive disadvantage in the global energy market.&nbsp;The resulting global competitive advantage these lawsuits offer to Venezuelan, Russian, Saudi Arabian and other similar foreign companies increases their market power and helps prop up the often oppressive and aggressive regimes in which they operate.&nbsp;This is destabilizing for the world and a real national security threat to the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese lawsuits are dangerous and ungrounded, and we should hope the courts continue to recognize that.&nbsp;But because plaintiffs keep filing away and are clearly not getting the message that their cases are weak, more should be done.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVoters should ask their local municipal officials and state attorneys general to make their position on these lawsuits known in the coming midterm elections.&nbsp;Beyond the specific issue, it will tell voters a lot about whether these politicians see their role as prudent agents of the voters focused on local problems and about how they see separation of powers. And voters should reject local and state candidates this fall who&nbsp;are willing to waste their taxes and government resources&nbsp;pursuing frivolous litigation that only increases the voters’ costs for filling their tanks and cooling or heating their homes.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFurther, Congress should consider very clearly and expressly preempting these lawsuits in any future or existing climate legislation packages, sending a clear signal to courts and litigants that solving our climate problems is not the province of the judiciary.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSuch an action would also signal the commitment of the elected branches to addressing climate change and leave them better situated to succeed without interference from the courts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAny temptation to expand the law to accept these kinds of lawsuits should at the very least be tempered by an understanding of the unintended consequences that adventurous tort litigation can bring.&nbsp;At a time when America’s energy security is already tenuous, these lawsuits are not only unwise and ungrounded but also a real threat to national security.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDonald J.&nbsp;Kochan&nbsp;is professor of law and deputy executive director of the Law &amp; Economics Center at George Mason University Antonin Scalia Law School.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Source: Pennsylvania Capital-Star\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Thursday issued a warning against what he described as “MAGA Republicans” and extremist threats to the nation, reminding Americans that democracy is not guaranteed.\n\n\n\n“We have to defend it. Protect it. Stand up for it. Each and every one of us,” Biden said in his remarks, delivered outside Philadelphia’s Independence Hall. “That’s why tonight, I’m asking our nation to come together, unite behind the single purpose of defending our democracy, regardless of your ideology.”\n\n\n\nBiden has largely refrained from talking about former President Donald Trump during his first year in office, referring to him as “the former guy.” But after a series of legislative victories, the Democratic president has shifted his tone as unsubstantiated claims of election fraud and political violence continue ahead of high-stakes elections this November.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe speech also comes amid an ongoing investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and after the F.B.I. served a search warrant at Trump’s Florida residence for classified documents last month.\n\n\n\nThree minutes into his 30-minute-long televised speech, Biden named Trump directly, characterizing the former president and his supporters as representing “an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic.”\n\n\n\nREAD: ‘Thousands Of Little Brush Fires All Over The State’: The PA GOP’s Plan To Subvert Future Elections\n\n\n\n“MAGA forces are determined to take this country backwards,” Biden said. “Backwards to an America where there is no right to choose, no right to privacy, no right to contraception, no right to marry who you love.”\n\n\n\nTrump plans to host a rally in Wilkes-Barre on Saturday to support Mehmet Oz and Doug Mastriano, the Republican nominees for U.S. Senate and governor in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nThe president clarified that he wasn’t referring to all Republicans, “not even a majority of Republicans are MAGA Republicans,” he said. Biden praised GOP members who have stood against Trump and MAGA Republicans, citing former federal Judge Michael Luttig, who called them a “clear and present danger to American democracy.”\n\n\n\nREAD: The Christian Right And Its Top Crusader Seek To Conquer Pennsylvania\n\n\n\nInstead, he focused on individuals who “do not believe in the rule of law” or “recognize the will of the people.” Biden cited those who refuse to accept the results of the 2020 election and are already casting doubt on upcoming contests.\n\n\n\n“They fan the flames of political violence that are a threat to our personal rights, to the pursuit of justice, to the rule of law, to the very soul of this country,” Biden said. “They look at the mob that stormed the United States Capitol on Jan. 6 — brutally attacking law enforcement — not as insurrectionists who placed a dagger at the throat of our democracy. But they look at that as patriots.”\n\n\n\nSomeone cannot be “pro-insurrectionists” and “pro-American,” Biden said. He also condemned threats, saying there is “no place for political violence in America” and described himself as “an American president, not a president of red America or blue America, but all America.” Addressing counter-protesters at the event, he said they’re “entitled to be outrageous.”\n\n\n\n“The MAGA Republicans believe that for them to succeed, everyone else has to fail,” Biden said. “I believe America’s big enough for all of us to succeed, and that is the nation we’re building — a nation where no one is left behind.”\n\n\n\n\n.@RepBrianFitz Votes Against Combatting White Supremacist &amp; Neo-Nazi Activity in Military &amp; Law Enforcement | The Pentagon has already raised alarms about white supremacist inroads into our armed forces. #PA01’s Republican congressman is unconcerned. https://t.co/we3tteelrr&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) July 14, 2022\n\n\n\n\nHe referenced the 2017 white supremacist protest in Charlottesville, Va., which Biden previously said was a motivation for him to run for office. He also incorporated themes of unity, which he promised to do for America during his inauguration in January 2021.\n\n\n\nMaking a plea to save the nation’s soul, Biden called on Americans to come together, get engaged, and “vote, vote, vote” to preserve democracy.\n\n\n\n“There’s nothing more important, nothing more sacred, nothing more American. That’s our soul. That’s who we truly are. And that’s who we must always be. I have no doubt — none — that this is who we will be and that we’ll come together as a nation. And we’ll secure our democracy,” Biden said, expressing his hope for the future. “We just need to remember who we are.”\n\n\n\nThursday’s speech marks Biden’s second visit to Pennsylvania — a battleground state with high-stakes elections this fall — in the past week. He will return on Monday to celebrate Labor Day in Pittsburgh, which hosts one of the largest and oldest Labor Day celebrations nationwide.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania Capital-Star is part of States Newsroom, a network of news bureaus supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

        "description": "On yesterday&#8217;s episode of The Chrome Cast, we spoke at length about the incredible value and performance offered up by Acer&#8217;s latest premium 2-in-1 Chromebook. At a retail price of $729, the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 gives buyers nearly everything you could ask of a new ChromeOS laptop. Along with powerful 12th Gen internals, tons of storage, and a premium aluminum chassis, Acer delivered on much better speakers than the previous Spin 713 models. This model also opted for a 16:10 display that seems to gaining popularity with ChromeOS users. \n\n\n\nWith all those premium features and a CPU that&#8217;s powerful enough to handle any task and that includes support for Steam gaming on ChromeOS), there&#8217;s little else we could ask from a device in this price range. That said, Acer went above and beyond and for the first time in three years, brought back the garaged stylus. This Chromebook Spin 714 features a garaged, rechargeable USI pen that pops directly into the front of the keyboard chassis. Bonus!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 received a $100 discount at Best Buy that placed it squarely on my weekly Top 5 Chromebook deals list. Here in the office, we all agree that most users will be 100% satisfied with this Chromebook at $729 but $629 is an absolute no-brainer. If you took advantage of that deal, good on you. If you were still waiting to pull the trigger, today is your lucky day. Our good friend George E. alerted us to another price drop on the Spin 714 that brings the price down to the drool-worthy price of only $599. \n\n\n\nThis puts the 14-inch premium convertible at the exact same price as the comparable 11th Gen Spin 514 that was recently on sale over on Amazon. Pound for pound and dollar for dollar, this deal on the all-new Acer Chromebook Spin 714 is an absolute steal. Anyone in the market for a late-model premium Chromebook would be wise to snatch one of these up before this deal is gone. That&#8217;s my two cents and here&#8217;s the link. \n\n\n\n\nAcer Chromebook Spin 714\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Astros already have a logjam at multiple positions. Yainer Diaz was supposed to be a lottery ticket of sorts. \nA secondary piece in 2021’s deadline deal that saw Myles Straw go to Cleveland in exchange for Phil Maton, Diaz was merely an intriguing catching prospect in A-ball at the time of the trade. He possessed good power and a strong arm, but his impressive numbers were against younger competition. FanGraphs’ Eric Longenhagen ranked Diaz 58th out of the 75 prospects dealt at last year’s trade deadline.\nWhile Maton was an integral part of the bullpen during the subsequent postseason, he’s unlikely to be remembered as the best player the Astros received in the Straw trade. Despite having Diaz in their system for just 13 months, the 23-year-old Dominican native has quickly become one of the Astros’ top prospects, as well as one of the better catching prospects in all of baseball.\nDiaz has made quick work of upper-minors pitching in 2022, compiling a .306/.356/.542 slash line with 25 home runs across 486 plate appearances in Double-A and Triple-A combined, all while striking out just 16.2 percent of the time. Defensively, Diaz has a competent glove to go with his plus arm, according to Longenhagen.\nIt’s quite the overall profile, which is ostensibly why the Astros have promoted Diaz to the big leagues as rosters expand. Diaz more than warrants a call up, but there doesn’t appear to be a path to playing time.\nBackup catcher and recent deadline acquisition Christian Vázquez has already shown himself worthy of a larger role, and he would be the everyday starter were it not for Martín Maldonado’s presence. Outside of pinch-hitting and garnering the rare start behind the dish, catcher doesn’t seem to be an option for Diaz.\nThe Astros, like most teams, try to amplify their prospects’ defensive versatility by playing them at multiple positions in the minors. Diaz is no exception, having appeared at first base in 36 games between Double-A and Triple-A this year. But like catcher, first base is also quite occupied, with Yuli Gurriel and Trey Mancini firmly atop the depth chart.\nWhile it’s rare for catchers to DH, Diaz’s bat is good enough to justify his inclusion in the Astros’ DH fold. But like the other two positions, it would be nothing more than a limited role, considering Yordan Álvarez’s prodigious bat isn’t going to cede playing time to anyone.\nIdeally, there would be a spot awaiting Diaz. Even on a team as good as the Astros, he does possess the ability to meaningfully help the club right away. But even excluding him, there’s already a logjam at the three positions where he could contribute. He’s only going to add to it. It’s a great problem for the Astros to have, though it’s not without its negatives.\nOn one hand, continuing to play everyday in Triple-A would be helpful for Diaz developmentally. While his bat is MLB-ready, he has all of 219 plate appearances in Sugar Land. Accruing more experience against Triple-A pitching certainly wouldn’t hurt. \nBut on the other hand, perhaps spending time with the big club in a reserve role would be more valuable for Diaz. He’s not a raw player who needs every at-bat he can get, he’s a polished hitter who has talent behind the plate. Being around Maldonado and Vázquez — two of the savviest backstops in baseball who each possess a wealth of experience — could be highly beneficial.\nThere’s no question that Diaz will have a notable role to play in the future, but for the time being, he’s likely to be on Houston’s bench for the duration of the September stretch run. If nothing else, the experience of being part of a playoff push could prove valuable long-term for what looks to be the Astros’ catcher of the future.",

And in fact A Couple is very different to his habitual output: it’s a belletristic homage to the most famously unhappy marriage in literary history; an intimate, pared-down chamber piece about Sofia Tolstoy, wife of Leo. The indefinite article in the title is misleading. This is the couple: a legendary relationship.Sofia is played by Nathalie Boutefeu, who addresses the camera (and by that token Leo, or herself) in a series of yearning monologues which have been adapted from her diaries and letters. It is a thoroughly intelligent production, a film festival event that could not exist in the rough-and-tumble of regular movie distribution but will I hope find a home on streaming services.

This is a strange, rather baffling film – stark and austere, a stylised, theatrical bad dream in candlelight about the personal torment of Padre Pio and his private spiritual agony as a young priest in the few years that immediately followed the first world war. The actual Pio, who died in 1968 and was canonised in 2002, became a controversial figure for his apparent stigmata, but the film shows none of this. He is played with a highly combustible mix of sadness, rage and anguish by a heavily bearded Shia LaBeouf, but in terms of screen time Pio/LaBeouf is not in the film that much. Continue reading...",

        "description": "David Richard-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Things didn’t go very well against Seattle, but there are some new faces in the lineup Friday. After suffering a sweep at the hands of the Seattle Mariners, the Detroit Tigers are back at home on Friday to kick off a weekend series with the Kansas City Royals.\nUnlike the Mariners, the Royals aren’t a playoff-bound team and should be far easier to beat. That said, these two clubs won’t be phoning it in. They play six times over the next 10 days and those games will not only settle a season series that Kansas City currently leads 6-4, but it also will help determine who finishes last in the division.\nSpencer Torkelson and Ryan Kreidler are expected to join the starting lineup today after being called up to start the month. Fans are collectively holding their breath to see if Torkelson’s second stint in the Motor City will go better than his first. He batted just .197 over 83 games before the All-Star Break and has a -0.9 career fWAR. More on him in a bit.\nKreidler is making his major-league debut. It’s been a long journey that our own Jay Markle broke down when the call-ups were announced. Kreidler seemed bound to make his way to Detroit at some point this year after posting strong numbers in Triple-A. \n\nDetroit Tigers (50-81) vs Kansas City Royals (53-79)\nTime/Place: 7:10 p.m., Comerica ParkSB Nation Site: Royals ReviewMedia: Bally Sports Detroit, MLB.TV, Tigers Radio NetworkPitching Matchup: RHP Drew Hutchison (2-7, 4.01 ERA) vs. LHP Daniel Lynch (4-9, 4.70 ERA)\n\nOn the mound for Detroit will be Clutch Hutch himself, Drew Hutchison. He’s been good for about five to six innings for the last two months but doesn’t get enough run support to sport a winning record. Hutchison features a 92-93 mph four-seamer and likes to use the slider to put guys away. His strikeout percentage isn’t insanely high, but over 40% of the balls batters put in play against him end up on the ground. He should be able to get it done against the Royals, but nothing’s guaranteed with this team.\nKansas City will throw left-hander Daniel Lynch. His metrics aren’t too scary, but a 20.7% strikeout percentage is concerning for the Tigers. How many times have we seen the Tigers flail away into double-digit strikeouts this year? Too many times. Lynch could easily rack up eight or nine Ks in six innings if Detroit isn’t diligent at the plate.\nHowever, Lynch’s tendency to get the strikeout doesn’t mean he’s unhittable. He’s given up at least three runs in each of his last three games and usually surrenders half a dozen hits per outing. The Tigers need to jump on him early, but that might be asking too much.\nKey Matchup: Torkelson vs himself\nA former No. 1 overall pick in the MLB draft, Torkelson’s expectations for himself might be the highest of anybody. Some Tigers fans have already written him off as a bust, but that’s frankly ridiculous. This is a guy who is who has hit well at every level of the game, and it’s not the first time he’s struggled to adjust.\nHe worked on his swing during his 35-game stint with Toledo and the process slowly but surely turned into a success. Everything isn’t figured out just yet — Torkelson hit just .229 with the Mudhens with a 100 wRC+ and his strikeout rate actually worsened — but this quote from him in The Athletic gives me hope that he will figure it out.\n“When things started finally to click a little bit, I felt my mind rest,” Torkelson said. “I’d go home from the field and I’d be like, ‘I didn’t think about where my hands were today. That’s a win.’”\nOverthinking can prolong slumps like you wouldn’t believe. Torkelson is a natural-born hitter who struggled with the pressure of the majors. It happens. It sounds cliche, but getting back to his roots and enjoying the game a bit more will help him swing less like a robot and get him to start launching bombs like he’s used to.",

        "description": "Photo by J. Conrad Williams Jr./Newsday RM via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Internal metrics be damned, it has to be Peraza Time in The Bronx. To the relief of almost everyone, the Yankees finally did it. They called up their No. 3 prospect, shortstop Oswald Peraza, as the 26-man roster expanded to 28 with the start of September. This all comes on the heels of a forgettable rubber match against the Los Angeles Angels that saw current shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa botch a routine groundball that would’ve had the bottom of the sixth inning at two outs with a runner on second instead of one out and two runners on. Instead, Gerrit Cole threw his self-proclaimed “worst fastball of the night” to 2021 MVP Shohei Ohtani, and he crushed it to give the Halos a 3-2 lead that held up. \nThe outrage surrounding Kiner-Falefa and the Yankees losing a very winnable game seemed amplified despite it being a common trend over the last month. After a terrible month of August (10-18, their worst month in 31 years), the anger appeared to boil over even more. With players in the pipeline and the major leaguers on the field not getting the job done, why not call up somebody earlier, especially with the division lead they previously held? I, like everyone else, do not know.\nNonetheless, Peraza is here, and that’s what matters. In Triple-A with the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre Railriders, he struggled initially but found his stride halfway through the season. Before being pulled from the game and hugging his teammates, he hit his 19th bomb of the year.\n\nPrior to play on Thursday, Peraza slashed .258/.329/.440 with a wRC+ of 104 with an eight-percent walk rate and a 23.2-percent strikeout rate. Steamer projects the 22-year-old to slash .242/.296/.392 with a wRC+ of 97. Yes, those numbers aren’t flattering, but growing pains are real, and they’re only projections. That wRC+ figure sitting 17 higher than the Yankees’ current shortstop should do wonders for the lower end of the lineup. In the fielding aspect, Peraza has a 60-grade ranking per FanGraphs, along with the quote, “An outstanding international find for $175,000, Peraza is a plus-run, plus-glove shortstop, and scouts see some untapped power potential.”\nAny defensive replacement is good, but one that many scouts consider excellent is perfect. The fact that other outlets like Baseball America and MLB Pipeline agree that his glove looks terrific only makes it better.\nCalling up Peraza is all well and good, but actions speak louder than words, especially in sports. Manager Aaron Boone provided a pretty divisive quote about Kiner-Falefa and his error in a postgame presser.\n\n\nAaron Boone on Isiah Kiner-Falefa's error tonight: \"He's been one of the best defenders in the league at shortstop. Shortstop, infielders make an error every now and then. It's a play he should make but he's been one of the best defenders in the league.\"— Chris Kirschner (@ChrisKirschner) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nPer usual, we must issue a disclaimer that Boone is almost always going to be adamantly protective of his players because that’s just been his managerial style for five seasons now. He doubled down on his defense of IKF yesterday afternoon as well though, so this is all either a smokescreen or legitimate confidence.\nSo the question becomes whether or not Boone and the Yankees are willing to play Kiner-Falefa less and give Peraza more time in the lineup. All but 12 games of Peraza’s six-year professional career have been at shortstop, so unless the Yankees feel comfortable with that remaining sample at second, he’s going to have to take Kiner-Falefa’s spot at the six-hole if he’s starting. Given how the many shifts these days tend to move infielders around, it wouldn’t be shocking to see Peraza occasionally appear at the keystone or maybe even third base, but even if IKF wasn’t in the picture, it would make the most sense for the rookie to begin where he’s most comfortable. \nOne notable point in Peraza’s favor is that GM Brian Cashman was unwilling to part with him at the trade deadline, which indicates a belief that he can make an impact at the major league level — particularly at shortstop, where they just so happen to have another near-MLB ready prospect who might one day pair with him. I don’t believe that they would call Peraza up to warm the bench, either; that was always the stated reluctance for not promoting him earlier since they wanted him to develop and play every day. However, considering the long leash that the Yankees have granted Kiner-Falefa in 2022, I also can’t say that anything would surprise me at this point. \nA new month has started, and it’s time for the Yankees to put up or shut up. Their steep division lead has been chipped down, and with a huge three-game series against the Tampa Bay Rays coming up, they could very well face a tight race as the season dwindles. Calling up Peraza should have been done a while ago, but it wasn’t, and there’s nothing anyone can do to fix it now. But now that he’s in the Bronx for the foreseeable future, he needs to play.\nIt sounds so simple, right? The best players need to play, and IKF is hurting the team right now. So, as much as the internal metrics reportedly love him, it’s time for the effects of that infatuation to end, especially if Peraza comes in with a bang like Oswaldo Cabrera did after his call-up. It’s now or never for the Bombers, and part of this hopefully-restorative September involves giving the 22-year-old a legitimate shot.",

        "description": "Max G. Levy, Anima Anandkumar, \nQuanta Magazine, \nSept 02, 2022\n\n\n\t\t           \n\t\t           If you look into the mathematics of deep learning AI algorithms, you find that a lot of it is based on calculations using matrices (two dimensional grids of values). That's where the Stanford AI course began, for example. But this limits the complexity AI can comprehend, as Anima Anandkumar explains. \"In practice, matrix methods in machine learning can't effectively capture higher-order relationships.\" Instead, \"with their multiple dimensions and flexibility, tensors seem like a natural fit for higher-order problems in AI.\" But as capacity increases, the questions become more urgent. \"It's always important to question how our work is going to impact the world... so much of the way we teach in universities is derived from military school. Engineering came from that background, and some of it lingers. Like thinking that scientists and engineers should focus on the technical stuff and let others take care of the rest. It's wrong. We all need humane thinking.\" See also: Building Neural Networks with Tensorflow.\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

I can imagine, for example, that I could just take my full set of clips from my bikepacking trip and have the AI professionally produce a nice set of videos (to be clear: that's not what I did). And the same with writing - I can imagine a time where I feed my 36,000 OLDaily posts into an AI and have it auto-generate some treatises representing my thoughts about knowledge, ethics and the future of technology (and with the right clips library and lots of voice samples, it could convert those into a series of accessible videos).

        "description": "By affixing his signature to the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden kicked off a green energy gold rush as companies will look to take advantage of the many tax subsidies and benefits for clean energy development.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, as part of the new laws legislative negotiations, Senate Democrats ostensibly agreed to advance a permitting reform bill touted by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) that would speed the permitting process for energy infrastructure projects of all kinds, including fossil fuel projects like pipelines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo, on the surface it would seem that we are making progress toward the development of all-important energy infrastructure. And it couldn't come at a better time, as global events remind us that leveraging a diverse set of domestic energy resources is the best way to provide affordability and reliability to consumers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, as we repeatedly see, the development of new and the completion of existing projects aimed at delivering those benefits are often snarled in regulatory and legal delays. The Vineyard Wind offshore wind project had to push its in-service date back to 2023 after redundant federal reviews slowed the timeline for the project, which started in 2018. Likewise, natural gas pipelines and new on-shore and off-shore oil and gas exploration projects take several years to bring to fruition.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe court challenges, typically initiated by local environmental activists, sometimes last just as long. The Enbridge Line 5 project in Michigan has been bantered back and forth between state and federal courts for the past three years. \n\n\n\nAll of these delays add costs to already expensive undertakings. In some cases, the companies pull out altogether, leaving consumers in the projected service area with reduced energy access. All the while, energy demand is increasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut all of these projects, whether they be wind farms or pipelines, share two things in common.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFirst, even in a deeply polarized climate, they have the backing of bipartisan state and federal policymakers who have studied their value and energy reliability potential and the support of business-focused organizations that see their job and general economic development growth possibilities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNext, and most importantly, it is almost always local entities operating outside of traditional political and policy channels that oppose and, ultimately, defeat them. These groups are well-funded, they are well-organized, and they get ample media attention. They are passionate champions of their cause.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis second point is the most important because it highlights why companies and developers themselves are always taken by surprise and slow to respond to these local threats. In their view, the project has the support of “the people” in the form of elected representatives and the business class through chambers of commerce. But as it turns out, there is a difference between these official entities and actual people. \n\n\n\nIn most cases, there are no local citizen voices willing to stand up and say: Yes, build that pipeline because I want energy security for my family.\n\n\n\nThe companies say it, their trade association, if they have one, says it. You might even get a local elected official to go on-record and support a specific project. But sadly, most of these projects lack any significant grassroots support.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is what needs to change if we are going to realize the vast opportunities for energy infrastructure development presented by the IRA and the prospect of federal permitting reform. Companies and trade associations need to be thinking much more locally about their approach to communications and engagement. News outlets ranging from the Wall Street Journal to the Huffington Post are predicting that the future of energy development will be decided at the local level.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe good news is that poll after poll after poll show that people support more domestic energy production as a means to bring down costs and meet emissions reductions goals here at home and support allies abroad. But these voices are not being heard when local decisions are being made about the actual projects. That void is instead being filled by those activist groups that do not support the development of any energy projects.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe path forward is clear. Whether you support the development of advanced nuclear, new oil and gas refineries or pipelines, solar and wind developments or geothermal, you must build support locally and bring the voice of the energy consumer to the table.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGreg Lemon is the executive director of US Energy NOW, an advocacy organization dedicated to advancing American energy infrastructure.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3625726-chinas-increasing-aggression-signals-a-looming-war-over-taiwan/",
        "description": "Today,&nbsp;China sent two drones toward Taiwan’s Kinmen County island grouping, but the craft returned to Xiamen — a major Chinese port — after soldiers fired warning flares.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYesterday, Taiwan&nbsp;shot down a Chinese drone&nbsp;violating airspace over Lion Islet, part of Kinmen. The incident occurred on the fourth-straight day&nbsp;unidentified drones were spotted&nbsp;near or over those islands. Lion, a rock outcropping, lies just 2.5 miles from Xiamen.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChina’s aggressive drone actions are almost certainly an attempt to provoke Taiwan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChina’s regime immediately tried to play down the Wednesday incident. Hu Xijin, once editor of the Communist Party’s “Global Times” tabloid and now China’s “most famous propagandist,” maintains the drones buzzing Taiwan islands on Thursday were operated by “mainland civilian drone hobbyists.\"\n\n\n\nThat contention is extremely difficult to believe. Due to the sensitivity of the drone flights, it is far more likely the crafts seen during the five days were launched under the orders of the Chinese ruler, Xi Jinping. \n\n\n\nThere are three especially disturbing aspects to&nbsp;yesterday’s&nbsp;incident. First, the Chinese operators of the downed drone did not retreat after Taiwan’s soldiers fired flares as warnings. In other words,&nbsp;it&nbsp;looks&nbsp;like the flight was designed&nbsp;to trigger an incident. That says, in turn, the Chinese regime is prepared to go to war now, or at least authorize provocations that can result in conflict.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSecond, China created Thursday’s incident despite a clear warning from the Biden administration. On Wednesday, National Security Coordinator&nbsp;John Kirby called Tuesday’s drone incursions&nbsp;“a clear attempt by the Chinese to permanently alter the status quo in and around Taiwan and to sort of set a new normal for their activities and behaviors, be that behavior crossing over the medium line with air and maritime assets or in this case, overflight by unmanned aerial systems.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Changing the status quo is unacceptable,” he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBeijing was evidently not impressed by Kirby’s words and does not appear&nbsp;to be&nbsp;deterred by America.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThird, traditional diplomacy is not working. Yesterday’s shoot-down is the culmination of Chinese overflight incidents.&nbsp;On Feb. 5, China sent a Harbin Y-12 utility plane over Tungyin, one of Taiwan’s offshore Matsu Islands. Taipei, hoping to avoid a crisis, first tried to ignore the clear violation of Taiwan’s airspace and then, after local residents would not keep quiet, minimized the incident.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTaipei’s strategy failed. Xi Jinping did not respond to Taiwan’s restraint with restraint. His response was, among other things, this week’s drone flights, which became progressively bolder through Thursday. \n\n\n\nJust about everyone is in favor of “measured” and “proportional” responses to China these days, but the overflight incidents show they do not work. China’s regime has become militant, and it is not clear that any policies, other than extreme ones, will have any effect. Yesterday’s shoot-down did not stop the drone flights, but at least China exhibited more caution today.\n\n\n\nSo far, the Biden administration has not abandoned long-held beliefs about China. As Kirby said on Wednesday, there are “active efforts” to arrange a meeting between the American and Chinese leaders. There is&nbsp;speculation&nbsp;that Biden and Xi will talk on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Bali in November.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmericans have unshakable faith in communication with China, and U.S. diplomats for decades have chased — both literally and figuratively — their Chinese counterparts to arrange dialogue. Now, after&nbsp;five phone and video calls&nbsp;between Biden and Xi, relations are breaking down fast.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmerica’s general policy of restraint on Taiwan — the policy of “strategic ambiguity” is meant in part to placate Beijing — has kept the peace for decades, but that policy approach worked in a generally benign era. The policy is obviously failing now&nbsp;as&nbsp;Beijing&nbsp;ramps&nbsp;up tensions with neighbors, especially&nbsp;India,&nbsp;Japan&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Philippines, in addition to Taiwan.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo what could work?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPerhaps only robust responses. President Biden should realize China has become combative and adjust policy fast. He can do that by publicly declaring that the United States will defend Taiwan, offering the island republic a mutual defense treaty, extending diplomatic recognition to Taiwan as a sovereign state and basing American troops on the island as a “tripwire” force.  \n\n\n\nIn any event, the Pentagon should move to a higher state of worldwide readiness,&nbsp;DEFCON 2. After all, China’s regime, with its various overflights, has shown an apparent willingness to back up its warlike talk with warlike actions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOf course, robust responses would outrage Xi and could escalate the situation, but at this moment, traditional non-escalatory approaches have failed. Now, every path forward is exceedingly dangerous, but the most dangerous path of all is to continue policies that have allowed Beijing to think it can engage in provocation without cost.  \n\n\n\nGordon G.

        "description": "The United Nations's human rights office has condemned China's treatment of the Uyghur minority in its Xinjiang region, saying China may have committed \"crimes against humanity.\"\n\n\n\n“The extent of arbitrary and discriminatory detention of members of Uyghur and other predominantly Muslim groups … in context of restrictions and deprivation more generally of fundamental rights enjoyed individually and collectively, may constitute international crimes, in particular crimes against humanity,” the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) concluded in its report Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe report, released by outgoing U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet, stated that the Chinese government’s application of its broad counterterrorism and counterextremism laws “has led to interlocking patterns of severe and undue restrictions on a wide range of human rights.”\n\n\n\n“Allegations of patterns of torture or ill-treatment, including forced medical treatment and adverse conditions of detention, are credible, as are allegations of individual incidents of sexual and gender-based violence,” the office declared.\n\n\n\nChinese representatives to the U.N. published a report responding to the OHCHR in which they denied all allegations of human rights abuses.\n\n\n\n“People of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are living a happy life in peace and contentment,” the Chinese government said, calling the accusation that its policies are discriminatory “groundless” and accusing the U.N. report of interfering \"in China's internal affairs.\"\n\n\n\nThe OHCHR proposed recommendations to the Chinese government, including that it immediately take steps to release those held in Xinjiang.\n\n\n\nThe office also recommended that China “promptly investigates allegations of human rights violations in [vocational education and training centers] and other detention facilities, including allegations of torture, sexual violence, ill-treatment, forced medical treatment, as well as forced labour and reports of deaths in custody.”\n\n\n\nChina responded by blaming the U.S. and its allies for opposing its government and called on the U.N. to investigate other countries instead.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecause supplements (i.e. vitamins and minerals) are regulated as food by the FDA, they do not need to undergo efficacy and safety testing prior to market entrance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis classification, determined by the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act, has prompted increased calls for regulation, as the number of supplements brought to market has skyrocketed since the act’s passage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn part two of this series, Changing America explores current safeguards in place to protect consumers and proposed legislation aimed at increasing ingredient transparency.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRead part one of this 2-part series, which looks into causes behind the recent supplement craze and the myriad risks these products can pose to consumers.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve ever spent time scrolling through Instagram or YouTube, chances are you’ve likely come across some form of advertising or sponsored content for nutritional supplements.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearchers from Northwestern University estimate that in 2021, the industry spent around $900 million on marketing alone.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd although federal law prohibits supplements from being marketed to treat, cure, diagnose or prevent a disease or condition, many products are targeted to individuals looking to “boost” their wellness or “enhance” their well–being.\n\n\n\nOne area where this practice is rampant is the market for hair, skin, and nails supplements.\n\n\n\nInfluencers and sponsored content&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBecause the 1994 Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act (DSHEA) does not require safety warnings on supplement labels — as they are classified as “food” not “drugs” — some influencers and consumers may be in the dark when it comes to dangerous adverse effects.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You'll have influencers promoting these [products] but they don't talk necessarily about what the ingredients [are] and they rarely talk about the risks,” explained Rajani Katta, a voluntary clinical faculty member at the Baylor College of Medicine and the McGovern Medical School, University of Texas, Houston.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs a dermatologist, one of Katta’s main interests is understanding the intersection between diet and dermatology, she explained in an interview with Changing America. However, after realizing the public was more interested in supplements’ effects on the skin rather than diet’s, Katta began studying the health risks and efficacy of these products.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInstead of focusing on dosing, ingredients, or efficacy of so-called beauty supplements, Katta’s research shows influencers tend to focus more on the fact that the products they’re promoting are all-natural.\n\n\n\n“A lot of patients who I've spoken to believe that because supplements are ‘all natural,’ that therefore they are not going to cause harm,” Katta said. But regardless of where a product originates it can still cause harm, she explained, noting poison ivy is also “all-natural.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor example, the botanical saw palmetto can be used in supplements for hair loss but can also decrease levels of a particular testosterone, Katta said. In pregnant women, this can be of particular concern as it may cause abnormalities in male fetus genitalia, but supplement labels are not required to contain that information. “Certainly at a minimum, I think [manufacturers] really need to enhance their labeling laws for products that might cause birth defects,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Beyond that, patients do need to realize that supplements are produced in a factory. And so when you have a product that contains 5,000 percent of the recommended daily allowance of a certain vitamin, that's not found in nature. That's produced in a factory,” Katta added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother market witnessing a boost in online promotion is the customizable, prescription vitamin service. These companies allow users to take online health quizzes to determine which combination of pills or gummies would be right for them, or offer specific formulations tailored to address stress relief and even anxiety.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, say an individual was concerned about hair loss and was looking to take one of these individualized supplements, there are myriad different causes for hair loss, Katta said, and a quick online health quiz may not discern which is the root cause.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It's an excellent marketing strategy. It makes absolutely no sense from a consumer perspective,” said Pieter Cohen, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School and an internist at Cambridge Health Alliance, when asked about the personalized services.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn essence “this is just a way of positioning your product, charging more to consumers to give them something they don't need,” Cohen told Changing America. “It's a great deal for the manufacturer because you have the same inexpensive vitamins, minerals that you're selling, but now you can sell them for more because you're claiming that you've got a mix that's just right for this individual person.”\n\n\n\nNumerous studies have shown that for the average healthy person, taking multivitamins does not preserve health or make healthy people healthier, while experts stress the best way to receive all necessary minerals and nutrients is through a well-balanced diet.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRoom for reform&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConcerns regarding the supplement industry are compounded by the fact its governing regulation is nearly 30 years old and thus was not created with online marketing in mind. And although the DSHEA has been updated in the years since its passage, some argue the law is insufficient to address the estimated 80,000 supplements on the market in 2022.\n\n\n\nThese problems have not gone unnoticed by lawmakers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn April, U.S. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin (D-IL) and U.S. Senator Mike Braun (R-IN) introduced the Dietary Supplement Listing Act of 2022, which would require manufacturers to provide the FDA with names of their products, a list of ingredients, electronic copies of the labels, and a list of the health claims made about their products, Durbin explained in a contributor piece for The Hil.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“FDA would then be tasked with making this information available to the public, in an easily searchable online database,” Durbin wrote.\n\n\n\nOn its face, the bill seems to be a step forward in that at least the FDA could keep an adequate list of what products were being sold by which individual companies, said C. Michael White, department head and distinguished professor of pharmacy practice at the University of Connecticut School of Pharmacy, in an interview with Changing America.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf individuals began reporting adverse reactions to a certain supplement that’s manufactured by a particular company, the FDA “would have a much easier time trying to figure out what other products it is that those companies are selling,” White said.\n\n\n\nThen, if the FDA “wanted to invest some of their very limited testing dollars into testing some of the other products from that same company, that may be a more efficient use of their funds,” he continued.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), a trade association representing the supplements industry, strongly supports the act, CRN CEO Steve Mister told Changing America, underscoring the importance of ingredient transparency for consumers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the law is currently written, we believe the kind of accountability it gives to the FDA is very important for the future of the industry, Mister said. CRN has also been spearheading the effort to advance mandatory product listing. Should this practice be enshrined into law with the passage of the Listing Act, “FDA can actually see what the marketplace looks like and find those offending products more easily,” Mister added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, the law has been met with some criticism from those who say it does not go far enough.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe law does not give the FDA any additional regulatory powers or allow it to read a label prior to listing supplements on the market, Cohen stated. “Rather, it would create the impression of reform while leaving the current lax regulatory framework largely untouched,” he wrote in a July 2022 perspective article in The New England Journal of Medicine. The piece was co-written by Jerry Avorn and Aaron S. Kesselheim.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFurthermore, the bill’s “requirements could distract the FDA’s Office of Dietary Supplements, which has fewer than three dozen employees, from enforcing the authority it has under DSHEA to inspect supplement facilities, issue import alerts, and recall hazardous supplements,” authors said.\n\n\n\nCurrently, the Listing Act is rolled into the FDA user fee authorization bill that is passed every 5 years to maintain the FDA’s revenue stream. Because this bill has to pass, there’s a good chance the Listing Act will soon become law, but whether or not the content will change following negotiations remains to be seen.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe current authorization bill is set to expire on September 30th.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I don't think [the Listing Act] would do anything to protect consumers from dangerous supplements or ensure that advertising is accurate,” Cohen told Changing America.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe FDA is funded in large part by user fees, but these fees cannot be used to regulate supplements under the FDA’s structure, meaning it already has limited resources to allocate to supplement oversight.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne thing critics and supporters of the Listing Act agree on is that the FDA needs more resources to better regulate the industry, while any significant reform has to come from congressional action.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“FDA can always be more proactive in its enforcement,” Mister said, adding, “we do think they need to be much more aggressive in prosecuting the bad actors.”\n\n\n\nHowever, “In terms of whether the current law [DSHEA] gives [FDA] the right amount of authority, I think the existing authority is appropriate because supplements are not drugs. They are not allowed to make drug-like claims…and they shouldn't be regulated in the same way that drugs are.”\n\n\n\nCurrent practice&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGiven extensive supplement contamination documented in previous research, “at some point you need to move away from naturally assuming that everything is fantastic until you prove otherwise, into a system where you want somebody to be able to show you,” the products aren’t contaminated before consumption, White said.\n\n\n\nIn the absence of significant FDA reform several groups like the NSF and US Pharmacopeia (USP) carry out independent analyses of supplements on the market and provide seals to those whose labels accurately reflect contents.\n\n\n\nJust because these products are approved, the seals do not guarantee active ingredients will actually do what labels claim, “but at least you know that it doesn't have any of these extraneous issues that could be risky to your health,” White explained.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCertain retailers have latched onto these practices and CVS was at the forefront of the movement with its Tested To Be Trusted program. All supplements sold at the chain have been tested by third parties and are guaranteed to be free from harmful levels of heavy metals, pesticides, microbiological components, and other contaminants.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCRN member companies also abide by federal regulatory standards and additional voluntary programs “to make sure that consumers are getting high quality safe products,” Mister said. The organization is working to give FDA more authority to carry out remote inspections and record examinations, along with allowing third parties to conduct audits of supplement companies.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to advertising, the FDA is responsible for oversight of claims made on labels and packaging, but the Federal Trade Commision (FTC) oversees online and print advertising, including sponsored content and product promotions from social media influencers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMister said CRN constantly reminds its members about FTC online advertising requirements and hosts webinars and conference sessions each year to do so.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the combined responsibility of supplement regulation can get complicated. Going forward, the FTC would definitely “need to be part of the solution to get consumers accurate information about what they're putting into their body,” Cohen said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne more safeguard in place to ensure supplement companies abide by federal regulations is the threat of private litigation. Class action lawsuits alleging consumers have been misled by marketing or that labels are inaccurate serve as a major deterrent for the industry to not step out of line, Mister said. “That's another, I think, very important piece of what keeps the industry honest.”\n\n\n\nHowever, not all supplements on the market are CRN members, and the numerous independent protections in place means a large responsibility is put on consumers to vet products before purchase.\n\n\n\n“For a lot of things that are on the market, there's very little science to show that it actually helps,” Katta said. This awareness, along with researching store policies and assessing product labels for certification seals, can all help consumers make more informed decisions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor Cohen, being skeptical is key. “Claims on the bottle do not have to be supported by scientific evidence in humans,” he said. “You have to really try to ignore any health claims on supplement bottles. And that's hard to do.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOverall, it’s important to remember the reasons why consumers may seek out supplements, White noted. Rising health care costs and lack of insurance coverage have prompted some to take their health into their own hands, and in a sense, the market represents some pitfalls of the United States health system.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConsumers are “looking for the ability to be able to do something that would promote their own health. And so there's a value in giving people access to some things that may allow for that to happen,” White explained.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut without being able to guarantee products are devoid of heavy metals, microbial contamination, and other prescription drugs, and that they actually contain the active ingredient listed on the label and others at safe doses, is ultimately “doing the consumer a disservice.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "Recent revelations of&nbsp;deepening Russo-Turkish economic ties despite the Ukraine war forces the U.S. to reckon with Russia’s wider strategy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Kremlin’s strategic objective in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Black Sea since the late 2000s has been to reorient Turkey, peeling it from the Atlantic Alliance and shifting it to the Russian camp.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. can no longer afford to ignore the realities of geopolitics: Turkey must be returned to the Western fold. The U.S. must apply the inducements, positive and negative, necessary to ensure Turkish compliance.&nbsp;Most critically, it should modify the geopolitical situation to remove the incentives Russia has created for reorientation, and to support Ukraine in its liberation of the Crimean Peninsula.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Ukraine war’s strategic prize is clear for the Kremlin.&nbsp;Russia sought to subjugate Ukraine and draw it into an autarkic bloc that presses NATO’s eastern flank overland.&nbsp;It still seeks this goal but, more immediately, it hopes to solidify a land corridor to Crimea, allowing it to project power in the Black Sea, while driving Ukraine from the Donbas region.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGeopolitically, however, the prize lies farther south.&nbsp;By consolidating its position in Ukraine and, by extension, in the Black Sea, Russia hopes finally to peel Turkey away from the Western camp, thereby opening an unchallenged maritime route from Sevastopol to the Eastern Mediterranean.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe reason for Russia’s desire to reverse Turkey’s political-strategic orientation is simple: As a solid member of a hostile maritime coalition — NATO — Turkey is a mortal and historic threat to Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring World War I, Turkey condemned a Russian regime when the&nbsp;Anglo-French failure to take Gallipoli, combined with insufficient sealift capacity, starved Russia of supplies and set it firmly on the path to revolution in 1917.\n\n\n\nThroughout the Cold War, Turkey was equally problematic.&nbsp;The Kremlin cultivated clients throughout the Eastern Mediterranean (namely Syria, Egypt and Libya) but so long as Turkey remained a reliable member of the Atlantic Alliance, Russia could never sustain an extended Mediterranean naval deployment or project power over time. Once American diplomacy reoriented Egypt, and American-intensified Israeli military superiority placed Syria at a long-term disadvantage, the Kremlin’s position in the Mediterranean became untenable in wartime.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan’s authoritarian bent, and the apparent parallels between Vladimir Putin’s&nbsp;United Russia party&nbsp;and Erdogan’s&nbsp;AK (Justice and Development) party, may help explain Turkey’s tilt towards Russia — but not the inconstancy of Turkish-Russian relations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTurkey shot down a Russian aircraft in 2015 and, in 2016, intervened in Syria, partly against the Russian-supported Assad regime.&nbsp;Then, in 2017, Turkey agreed to purchase S-400 air-defense systems from Russia and persisted with the deal despite its suspension from the U.S./NATO F-35 program in July 2019.\n\n\n\nThe following year, Turkey again reversed course, intervening in the Second Libyan Civil War on behalf of the Tripoli-based Government of National Accord (GNA).&nbsp;Turkish intervention decisively shifted the military balance between the GNA and the Russian-backed, Benghazi-based House of Representatives;&nbsp;Turkish forces directly fought Russian-backed Wagner Group mercenaries and nearly confronted Russian units directly.\n\n\n\nIn February 2020, Russian warplanes killed around 100 Turkish soldiers in the deadliest incident of Turkey’s involvement in Syria.&nbsp;Months later, Turkish-supplied Azerbaijani forces smashed the Russian-backed Armenian military.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToday, we hear accusations of&nbsp;Turkish evasion of Western sanctions&nbsp;on Russia, Turkish acquiescence to Russian tourists, and&nbsp;record-breaking Turkish energy imports from Russia.&nbsp;Yet Turkey closed the Bosporus and Dardanelles straits just days after Russia invaded Ukraine, and Turkish arms company Baykar still delivers Bayraktar TB2 drones to Ukraine’s military. (Cultivating the Turkish military-industrial base is a key priority for Ankara, hence few sales occur without explicit political consent — and Baykar, specifically, is one of Erdogan’s pet projects. Not only has its TB2 provided Turkey with significant marketing cache in the defense community, but Baykar’s chief technical officer, Selçuk Bayraktar, is Erdogan’s son-in-law.)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSuch incertitudes and about-faces complicate the situation, while creating the appearance that Turkey is neither pro-Russian nor pro-Western.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut deeper geopolitics explain Turkey’s strategic vacillation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn one sense, Putin’s Kremlin is reactive. The Ukraine crisis is of his own making; his pressure on Ukraine’s former president, Victor Yanukovych, and intransigence over Ukrainian economic links to the European Union sparked Ukraine’s 2013 Euromaidan protests and generated the strategic contradictions Putin had sought to resolve through conquest.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, the Kremlin also is shrewd.&nbsp;Russia’s&nbsp;2008 war with Georgia&nbsp;and 2014 annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region&nbsp;stabilized Moscow’s position in the Black Sea. Next, Russian intervention in Syria drew Turkish ire, but Russia cut deals with other regional powers, most notably with Israel — and thus, by bracketing Turkey from the north in the Black Sea and from the south in the Eastern Mediterranean, it tilted Turkey away from the West.&nbsp;Turkish support for Azerbaijan complicates the issue, but Russia has thus far accepted Turkish aggrandizement without jeopardizing its own strategic position.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe opportunity for a formal realignment has existed since the early 2010s. Despite multiple flair-ups, the Kremlin has never fully locked Turkey out of a potential entente. Once again, a Western-aligned Turkey is an insurmountable impediment to Russian power projection in the Mediterranean and a constant potential spoiler to Russia’s Black Sea ambitions.&nbsp;Thus, Putin will have achieved a significant strategic objective if he can formally split Turkey from NATO and bring it into Russia’s orbit.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is not to say that the West should avoid pressuring Turkey over its links with Russia.&nbsp;It should make its diplomatic red lines clear to Ankara and put in place the structures needed to compensate for a Turkish exit from NATO, if it occurs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt is, however, possible to shape Turkey’s political calculations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf Russia no longer holds Crimea, its position in the Middle East and Eastern Mediterranean will become untenable.&nbsp;The Russian port of Novorossiysk can support the Black Sea Fleet’s submarines, but its surface combatants will need all their logistics capacity modified if Sevastopol in Crimea falls under Ukrainian control again.&nbsp;Without Crimea, providing air cover to Russian naval forces in the Black Sea, or supporting them with anti-ship missiles, is far more difficult.&nbsp;Moreover, the right weapons in Crimea could, at minimum, disrupt Russian naval activity from Novorossiysk and, at best, destroy the naval base outright.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration would benefit from a dual-track diplomatic-military approach with Turkey. It should make clear the risks of increased economic engagement with Russia, while providing Turkey with economic inducements to alleviate its economic crisis, including tariff reductions, foreign direct investment support, and institutional assistance from major financial actors.&nbsp;Complementing this, the U.S. should ensure that Ukraine has the weapons required to retake Crimea from Russia.\n\n\n\nIt is neither politically nor strategically prudent to leave Crimea in Russian hands.&nbsp;Ukraine already has called Putin’s nuclear bluff and attacked Russian positions on the peninsula. The U.S. should make clear to Moscow that it will entertain the possibility of a negotiated settlement only if Russia withdraws from Crimea.\n\n\n\nSeth Cropsey is founder and president of&nbsp;Yorktown Institute.

        "description": "Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n\n  As seen in the last series between Acuña and the Fish, he still takes special pleasure in raking against them. The Marlins are in Atlanta to face off against the reigning World Series champions. Last series resulted in a sweep as the Marlins were dominated by the Braves in every single aspect of the game. One play from that is looping in my brain non-stop: the leadoff home run that Ronald Acuña Jr. deposited over the center field fence to start game 3 of the series. \nWhen Acuña connects, he makes sure everybody in the stadium knows about it. This time was no different. On the first pitch of the game he turned around a sinker at 109 MPH off the bat, sending it 442 feet to dead-center. He began his obnoxious strut to first base with his bat still in his hand, took eight steps, then flung his bat in the air. He then proceeded to reenact the LeBron James silencer celebration and bang on his chest before he began jogging. \nBut wait, there’s more. In an effort to rub it in the Marlins’ face, he imitated Jazz Chisholm’s signature euro-step celebration rounding third base. You could tell he was a little more amped up than usual when he was crossing the plate.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs a fan of the franchise, and baseball in general, you can tell Acuña always turns it up a notch when he’s playing against the Fish. He has hit more home runs (22) versus the Marlins than he has against any other team in the league while having a slash line of .324/.425/.624. No, that’s not a typo: that’s a 1.089 OPS. Are you kidding me? Those are MLB The Show numbers! \nThe numbers alone don’t tell the full story.\nTension between Acuña and the Marlins began on August 15th, 2018, when he was just coming on the MLB scene as a rookie. He had that incredible streak of 5 consecutive games with a home run, becoming the youngest player to ever do so. \nJosé Ureña decided he would rather plunk Acuña than give up another leadoff bomb, so he did. Ureña threw his signature power sinker at 98 MPH off of the rookie’s elbow. Benches cleared, which led to a shoving battle, and Ureña was ejected. Acuña would have to leave the game to get medical attention, snapping his streak. \n\n\nBenches clear in Marlins-Braves after José Ureña hits Ronald Acuña Jr. in 1st inning.Acuña Jr. (5 straight games with HR, 3 straight with leadoff HR) exits in 2nd inning. pic.twitter.com/V2aSu97YEX— MLB (@MLB) August 16, 2018\n\n\n\n\nLater in the season, the Marlins were hosting the Braves in a four-game set. In his second at-bat of the series, he left the building yet again. Crushing a hanging slider from Elieser Hernandez 432 feet, he pimped it before beginning his trot around the bases. His very next trip to the plate? Another heater up and in off of his hands. Acuña would scream in frustration and slam his helmet before making his way to first base.\nFast forward to 2020, after many Acuña home runs and 2 more HBPs, the Marlins would face off with the Braves in the NLDS. To lead off the game, Acuña set the tone with a backside home run off of Sandy Alcantara. Acuña would watch it fly and toss his bat in the air. No surprise, Sandy beaned him in their next matchup with 98 to the front hip. He would proceed to walk to first while chirping at Sandy. In the postgame interview, Sandy states, “If he’s ready to fight, I’m ready to fight.”\nIt was then that Acuña fired off his most famous tweet known to the Marlins fan base:\n\n\nThey have to hit me , because they don’t get me out    — Ronald Acuña Jr (@ronaldacunajr24) October 6, 2020\n\n\n\n\nShenanigans picked back up the following year. On July 2nd, 2021, Pablo López would hit Acuña to open up the game. López got tossed because of the bad blood between the parties, and so would Don Mattingly. Tough beat losing your pitcher and your manager after one pitch. \n\nThough there have been several instances where Acuña has been hit by Marlins pitchers, it’s hard to tell which ones were intentional. This is a hitter who likes the ball on the outer third. He does get uncomfortable with the ball in on his hands, so it’s a valid strategy to attack him there, even if it means risking occasionally giving him an automatic base.\nLet’s see how Acuña performs in the latest chapter of his rivalry against the Fish.",

        "link": "https://laughingsquid.com/listen-to-someone-who-stutters/",
        "description": "The second episode of a three-part series about living with disabilities by filmmaker James Robinson features the story of John Hendrickson, a talented professional writer who stutters.  This powerful short documentary looks at what stuttering is, how it needs to be understood, and how it has affected Hendrickson&#8217;s life.  Hendrickson, who is a Senior Editor at The Atlantic, explains the daily challenges he faces around his stuttering.\n\n\n\nJohn has a curious relationship with language. As a journalist and author, he writes words for a living. But he also has a stutter and struggles to say them out loud. While most people who stutter as children grow out of it, John is part of the 20 percent who continue stuttering into adulthood. And there’s no real cure. For John, no amount of therapy, exercises, or hypnosis has done the trick.\n\n\n\nRobinson also conducts an imaginary experiment using creative editing that lets Hendrickson speak without his stutter. Robinson further notes that patience is the key to understanding those who stutter.\n\n\n\nWe now know that anxiety isn’t the cause of stuttering. It’s a neurological condition with a complex genetic component. But anxiety can still trigger a stutter. So showing your own impatience, guessing the end of a sentence or interrupting and telling John to relax, can actually cause a stutter to intensify.",

        "description": "Photo by Harry How/Getty Images\n    \n\n  LA plays SD in three series over the next four weeks The Dodgers play the Padres for three series and nine games over the next four weeks. The first of these National League West meetings begins Friday night at Dodger Stadium.\nAfter suffering their first series loss in over five weeks, the Dodgers enter the weekend at 90-40, with an 18-game lead over San Diego in the National League West. LA’s magic number to clinch their ninth division in ten years is 14, which means it’s going to be a little bit before the NL West is officially won. The earliest the Dodgers can clinch is next Friday, September 9.\n\nThe Dodgers are 8-2 against the Padres this season, and with no more Games 163, winning the head-to-head battle is the first tiebreaker should the two teams end up tied atop the NL West. That’s a long way of saying if Los Angeles beats San Diego two more times this year, they will clinch the season series, and in the process lowering their magic number by one.\nThe Padres are currently in the final wild card position at 73-59, but they are mired in a three-team race with the Phillies (73-58) and Brewers (69-61) for two playoff berths. San Diego is a half-game behind Philadelphia for the No. 5 seed, and three games up on Milwaukee, who is on the outside looking in at the moment.\nSan Diego comes to town having won five of their last six games, including a three-game sweep of the Giants in San Francisco.\nThe Padres were off Thursday, but among their two September call-ups as rosters expanded to 28 players was old friend Matt Beaty, who was traded by the Dodgers on March 28. Beaty struggled in the early going this year, going 4-for-37 (.108) with a double and a triple before landing on the injured list in May with a left shoulder impingement, which knocked him out for nearly three months.\nBlake Treinen is expected to be activated by the Dodgers on Friday, after seven minor league rehab games in Triple-A. The right-hander has been sidelined since April with shoulder inflammation.\nIn addition to this weekend in Los Angeles, the Dodgers and Padres play two more series in San Diego — next weekend (September 9-11) and September 27-29 at Petco Park.\nThe series finale Sunday night will be exclusively televised by ESPN, with Karl Ravech, David Cone, and Eduardo Perez on the call, along with reporter Alden Gonzalez. The Dodgers have won all three games on ESPN ‘Sunday Night Baseball’ this season, including a win over the Padres at Dodger Stadium on August 7.\nDodgers-Padres pitching matchups\nFriday: Dustin May vs. Yu Darvish7:10 p.m., SportsNet LA\nSaturday: Julio Urías vs. Sean Manaea6:10 p.m., SportsNet LA\nSunday: Andrew Heaney vs. Mike Clevinger4:08 p.m., ESPN",

Mandatory Credit: Thomas Shea | Thomas Shea-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  See the best performances during the month of August. Let’s take a look at the best performances in the Astros system in August.\n*Just a note, these are my picks for the month*\nPrevious POTM:\nApril\nMay\nJune\nJuly\nAAA: Sugar Land Space Cowboys\nHITTER: Korey Lee, C\n\nAugust Stats: 21 G, .288 BA/.387 OBP/.700 SLG, 3 2B, 10 HR, 26 RBI\nLee struggled a bit to start the season but really turned it on in August. The right hander slugged 10 HR and drove in 26 runs in just 21 games. This was good for a 156 wRC+ and something that many wanted to see, Lee driving the ball in the air.\nPITCHER: Hunter Brown, RHP\n\nAugust Stats: 5 G, 2.45 ERA, 25.2 IP, 12 H, 7 ER, 9 BB, 28 SO\nBrown put together another dominant month, this time posting a 2.45 ERA with 28 K in 25.2 innings. He was nearly un-hittable allowing just a .140 BAA and had a WHIP of just 0.82 as he earned a call-up to the big leagues.\nAA: Corpus Christi Hooks\nHITTER: Shay Whitcomb, INF\n\nAugust Stats: 24 G, .297 BA/.347 OBP/.626 SLG, 7 2B, 3B, 7 HR, 16 RBI, 7 SB\nWhitcombb started the season well and fell off a bit but together a strong month of August posting an OPS of .973 in 24 games. He finished with 7 2B, 7 HR and 7 SB on his was to his best month of the 2022 season.\nPITCHER: Jose Bravo, RHP\n\nAugust Stats: 4 G, 3.05 ERA, 20.2 IP, 18 H, 7 ER, 2 BB, 10 SO\nBravo has been a steady starter for the Hooks this season and in August he had one of his better months posting a 3.05 ERA over 20.2 innings. He also only walked 2 keeping his WHIP below 1.00, which led the Hooks’ staff.\nA+: Asheville Tourists\nHITTER: Joey Loperfido, INF/OF\n\nAugust Stats: 23 G, .381 BA/.455 OBP/.607 SLG, 8 2B, 3B, 3 HR, 23 RBI\nLoperfido has been really good this season and put together a monster month of August. The lefty hitter batted .381 with an OPS of over 1.000 in 23 games for Asheville. He showed why he is considered one of the more advanced bats in the system.\nPITCHER: Aaron Brown, RHP\n\nAugust Stats: 6 G, 2.89 ERA, 28.0 IP, 25 H, 9 ER, 5 BB, 20 K\nBrown has been a consistent starter for Asheville and pitching well since the beginning of July. He had a really good month in August posting a 2.89 ERA in 28 innings while walking just 5 hitters. He had the lowest WHIP of any pitcher in Asheville with at least 15 innings pitched.\nA: Fayetteville Woodpeckers\nHITTER: Jacob Melton, OF\n\nAugust Stats: 14 G, .351 BA/.415 OBP/.596 SLG, 5 2B, 3 HR, 10 RBI, 4 SB\nMelton joined the Woodpeckers offense and immediately started hitting. The 2022 second rounder batted .351 with 8 XBH in just 14 games during the month of August posting an OPS over 1.000 for Fayetteville. \nPITCHER: Edinson Batista, RHP\n\nAugust Stats: 4 G, 1.02 ERA, 17.2 IP, 8 H, 2 ER, 10 BB, 26 K, .133 BAA\nBatista was here for July but I had to have him here for August too. The right hander posted a 1.02 ERA with 26 K in 17.2 innings for the Woodpeckers before being promoted to Asheville where he tossed 5 no-hit innings. Dominant numbers from the 20-year-old.",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Lots of interesting, funny, idiotic, and insightful things were said by the Mets—and about them—recently. Here are some of our favorites. Your 2022 Mets: Backed Taijuan’s confidence with two follow-up wins.\n“I think we match up well against [The Dodgers], but it’s always going to be a dogfight when you face good teams. Tonight was a dogfight. They came out on top tonight, but I think we’ll be back tomorrow.” -Taijuan Walker [New York Post]\nSincerely, Old Timers’ Day was an absolute joy to watch.\n“I think it’s a big day for the families of the players, too. Some of the kids and people here have never seen their fathers or grandfathers play. I think to see the response that people have for them, means a lot to their families.” -Buck Showalter [New York Post]\n“Believe me, it doesn’t go unnoticed. I told [Cohen], ‘Thank you.’ He didn’t want to hear it.” -Buck Showalter [New York Post]\n“[Cohen’s] brought a sense of hope, that’s probably the best way to put it. The whole fan base has a sense of hope now that this is sustainable. Year in and year out, that whatever it takes, it’s going to be done. That’s just a great feeling as a fan. He seems to understand the modern way of doing things and what the fan base responds to.” -David Cone [New York Post]\n“It’s their day, it’s not my day, OK. I’m just happy I could bring them together. It’s better late than never. We have such great history with the Mets, it’s important to celebrate it.” -Steve Cohen [New York Post]\n“These are simple things. I think the fans just want to know you care, and want to know that ownership is listening. That’s all I’m trying to do. I’m doing this for the fans, and so I’m listening to what they have to say. I don’t always have to agree, right, but it’s important to me to know what they’re thinking and it’s important to me that they know that I care.” -Steve Cohen [New York Post]\n“He’s definitely changing things. He knows, he gets it. … Nothing against the Wilpons, they were great, too, but he’s taking it to a whole ’nother level. What I mean by that, getting alumni back involved, putting the fans first and the organization, putting a competitive team back on the field.” -Doc Gooden [New York Post]\n\n\nKnight: \"It's a special thing for me to be here and think maybe I'm back to being a part of this organization.... Mr. Cohen spoke to me today. I hadn't spoken to Jeff Wilpon in 30 years.\" https://t.co/0sp0gZ9YoD— Tim Britton (@TimBritton) August 27, 2022\n\n\n\n“The biggest thing that I saw was the smiles on their faces for the recognition and the people that showed up to acknowledge what they’ve done for the organization. You could tell that everyone that was there wished they could go back to those days and it made me realize that this is pretty darn cool … and tried to take that out to the game.” -Brandon Nimmo [New York Post]\n\n\nPedro Martínez says he stepped into the Mets clubhouse today and asked Max Scherzer and Jacob deGrom to \"get it done for me.\"\"I feel like it's unfinished business,\" Martínez said of his own time in Flushing. \"I just pray to God that those guys do what I couldn't do.\"— Anthony DiComo (@AnthonyDiComo) August 27, 2022\n\n\n\nReally high praise when Scherzer says it’s fun to watch you pitch.\n“When he’s out there he can absolutely dominate anybody. The fastball just jumps out of his hand, and yet he has such precision with his slider, as well. It’s definitely been fun watching and talking to him.” -Max Scherzer [New York Post]\nIt’s a joy to get to watch Jake pitch when he’s healthy. I hope he wants to stay.\n“Listen, he certainly has the right to do that. We love Jacob, and I think he’s the best pitcher in baseball. We’ll do whatever we can to make sure he stays. But it’s his decision, not ours. We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it, all right. Right now we’re trying to win our division and we’re going to sit down with Jake and try to figure it out at the end of the season.” -Steve Cohen [New York Post]\n\n\n\"He's pretty much the best, maybe the best to ever pitch.\"- Mookie Betts on Jacob deGrom pic.twitter.com/BRXpz4geZS— SNY Mets (@SNY_Mets) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nOn Brandon’s Nimmo’s catch.\n“This had a playoff feel to it. It’s a sold-out crowd. It’s electric. The atmosphere is awesome. The 7 Line is right there behind it. So I think it’s just the culmination of the atmosphere, the teams that are playing and how important these games are becoming down the stretch.” -Brandon Nimmo [MLB]\n“That was awesome. I made a mistake there, and he helped me out.” -Jacob deGrom [MLB]\n“It’s robbing a home run and we end up winning by one run. So that’s probably at the top.” -Brandon Nimmo [MLB]\n“It was a big moment. I came through for my guys. I love when I can contribute and help these guys, because they pour their blood, sweat and tears out there on the field every day. I want to be there with them, helping them the best that I can. That was just the emotion of me helping my guys out pouring onto the field.” -Brandon Nimmo [MLB]\nHas deGrom ever been able to say that before?\n“I had good defense behind me tonight. Thankful for that.” -Jacob deGrom [New York Post]\nNot to get lost, but besides the Dodgers Series and Old Timers’ Day, the Mets had another come from behind walk off win prior.\n“Not panic and just trust how good we are.” -Chris Bassitt [MLB]\n“Nothing needs to be said. It’s just kind of looking around and going, ‘OK, it’s time to go to work here.’ … It’s kind of like our thing.” -Mark Canha [MLB]\n“As long as they’ve got an out left, these guys are going to continue to grind. It’s a lot of fun to be a part of and to watch.” -Buck Showalter [MLB]\n“It’s a privilege to be put in those situations. I’m just trying to put the ball in play hard every single time I go up there.” -Pete Alonso [MLB]\nTimmy Trumpet unsurprisingly crushed his interview.\n“It’s absolutely insane. It’s incredibly humbling and a great honor that a world-class athlete is using my song as inspiration to run on that pitch. This guy’s such a professional, he could do this with any song. But I’m very thankful to the Mets supporters and anyone that’s adding this track to their playlist and supporting ‘Narco.’” -Timmy Trumpet [MLB]\n“But I can tell you. I can assure you, I’m officially a Mets fan for life.” -Timmy Trumpet [MLB]\n“I can’t wait to see Díaz play this at the World Series in a victory.

        "description": "Getty Images\n    \n\n  And he had a chance for five! Back in the long-ago times when the Cubs occasionally wore blue alternate jerseys for home games at Wrigley Field, Kerry Wood was wearing one of those when he accomplished the feat headlined here: Four strikeouts in an inning.\nThis one happened in the second game of a doubleheader against the Brewers. \nOf all the Cubs pitchers who did the 4-K feat, Wood’s is unique because he allowed two runners to reach base on strikeouts, one on a throwing error by Todd Hundley, the other on a wild pitch. Thus Wood might have had a chance to strike out five batters in an inning, but the other out was recorded on a groundout. The Cubs won the game 17-4; in addition to the K mark, Wood hit one of five Cubs home runs in this game.\nThe 4-K inning was the top of the fifth. It began with the groundout, hit into by former Cub Matt Stairs. Then Bill Hall struck out and Hundley’s error allowed him to get all the way to third. Wood then struck out Ryan Thompson and another future Cub, Paul Bako. But Bako also reached base, that one on a wild pitch, but Hall held at third. The next batter was a former Cub, Brewers pitcher Andrew Lorraine, and Wood struck him out to end the inning.\nHere’s Wood’s 4-K inning [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nIt all happened at Wrigley Field 20 years ago today, Monday, September 2, 2002. There’s another one of these 4-K innings we’ll celebrate a “decade” anniversary for, later this month. I’ll keep you guessing as to who that pitcher is.",

        "description": "On the night Spencer Strider broke the Braves’ single-game record with 16 strikeouts, he also broke the franchise’s rookie record, a total that now sits at 174. | Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n    \n\n  On Spencer Strider’s epic night and how Max Fried’s pickoff has surprised his first baseman and influenced a teammate ATLANTA — Is it time to call the National League Rookie of the Year race?\nSixteen strikeouts, an Atlanta-era record and one of the most dominant pitching performances by a Braves pitcher in the last quarter century. \n“It’s pretty wild, the guys who’ve thrown in this organization, it’s a long, incredible list,” Strider said after allowing just two hits with no walks over eight scoreless innings in the Braves’ 3-0 win over the Rockies on Thursday night. “I’m just grateful to be here and having success.”\nThe 16 strikeouts broke the Atlanta record of Hall of Famer John Smoltz, who fanned 15 on both April 10, 2005, vs. the Mets and May 24, 1992, against the Expos. \nAnd how does one react when realizing they’ve one-upped a franchise icon? \n“I lost track after five,” Strider said. “I came out of the game and Kyle [Wright] was telling me something about John Smoltz or whatever, and I had no idea what he was talking about. It didn’t make any sense. And then somebody else said something and I just kind of looked cross-eyed at them and they were like, ‘You know what just happened?’” \nIt was part of a record night as Strider ran his season strikeout total to 174, breaking the Braves rookie record of 170 set by Julio Teheran in 2013. \nThe overall rookie fWAR leader at 4.2, Strider nearly doubles the next closest pitcher — the Mariners’ George Kirby at 2.3 — and is 0.4 ahead of the top position player — Seattle’s Julio Rodriguez — and leads teammate and fellow ROY candidate Michael Harris II by 0.5.\n\n\nSpencer Strider broke an all-time Atlanta record in just his 17th career start.The rookie is now one of nine MLB pitchers with 4+ fWAR this season. pic.twitter.com/pdXuL0T7oA— Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nStrider’s production is staggering considering he didn’t make a start until May 30 and didn’t pitch past the fifth inning until June 10. \nHarris’ impact has been undeniable in solidifying the Braves’ outfield and in the Atlanta era, only Dusty Baker (4.8 in 1972), Jason Heyward (4.6 in 2010) and Ronald Acuña Jr.’s 4.0 during his ROY 2018 have produced better fWARs, and Harris is all but certain to equal or surpass Acuña.\nBut to find a Braves rookie pitcher that has been as valuable as Strider, you have to go back to pre-war, like World War I. Dick Rudolph, who had a 4.7 fWAR in 1913, is the last Braves pitcher to put up a bigger number than Strider, who already surpassed Mike Soroka (4.0 in 2019) for the Atlanta mark.\nFrom that end, how can anyone deny Strider?\nThere will be more bold-faced lines of his ROY resume — Strider is on pace for 214 strikeouts, which would be the 13th 200-strikeout season by a rookie in the Live-Ball Era, and the first since Yu Darvish fanned 221 in 2012 — but Thursday night is a tentpole in that candidacy.\nWth a Game Score of 94, Strider’s gem is fourth among all Braves since 1966. He trails only Kevin Millwood (98 on April 14, 1998, and 96 on Aug. 28, 1999) and Greg Maddux (96 on May 2, 2001).\n“I’m watching some of the replays of the pitches and it’s like, ‘My God,’” said manager Brian Snitker. “Some of those breaking balls, the depth on them, it’s just ... and he holds his velocity, too. It’s pretty impressive.”\nLet’s take a spin around the diamond, starting with one of Max Fried’s biggest weapons\n\n\n\"It's as good of a pickoff move as there is.\"— Brian Snitker on Max Fried's pickoff wizardry   pic.twitter.com/lXiwar23Fj— Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) June 10, 2022\n\n\n\n1. Fried’s pickoff move is deadly. Just ask Olson\nThe leg kick, then the slight drift home. That’s the part that lulls the runner into a false sense of security, just before Max Fried fires to first base. \nAnother victim of what first baseman Matt Olson calls “the best lefty move I’ve ever seen.”\nIf you think the runners are stunned, they’re not alone. When Olson first arrived at spring training after being acquired from the A’s, Fried told the two-time Gold Glove winner he had a good pickoff move. Olson saw glimpses of it during pitcher fielding practice drills, but it reaches another level when the lights turn on.\n“Honestly, he still surprises me every once in a while,” Olson said. “It’s definitely gotten a lot better. ... I actually almost took one in the teeth (early in the season). After that, I realized I had to watch him a little longer than I thought.”\nFried laughed when told he nearly cost Olson his teeth, but he did warn him.\n“A lot of it just feeling the game out and being attentive and ready,” Fried said. “We’ve had conversation, but a lot of its kind of in the moment, like spur-of-the-moment.”\nSince 2017, Fried tops all pitchers with 22 pickoffs, four more than the second player on that list, the Brewers’ Eric Lauer. That includes four seasons of four or more pickoffs, the most of anyone, with the Cubs’ Wade Miley — who has three such seasons — the only other pitcher with more than two. \nIt’s helped Fried claim back-to-back Gold Gloves, and he’s picked off two runners so far this season, keying a rundown between first and second to get the Pirates’ Ke’Bryan Hayes on June 9, and he nabbed the Giants’ Luis Gonzalez at first on June 20. \n“Everybody’s pretty shocked,” Olson said of opposing players’ reactions. “When you see base stealers getting on base and they’re shutting it down, like that’s part of their game and they don’t want to run, that’s when you know it’s a pretty good move.”\nCall it the Fried Fear Factor. \nHe has the highest caught stealing percentage (66.6 percent) among left-handers with at least 500 innings pitched over the past four seasons, largely because few want to be his next victim. In that span, the 27 steal attempts — in which runners have been successful 18 times — are the lowest of anyone lefty within that innings plateau. \nThe secret is in Fried making the pickoff move look exactly like his delivery, until it’s not. It’s a part of his game that’s been there since he was playing youth ball. \n“Something that I was always good at when I was younger, when we were first doing pickoffs and leadoffs and all that kind of stuff,” Fried said. “Just something I kind of took to and has been natural for me.”\nFried’s move is so good it’s created pickoff envy, at least with fellow left-hander A.J. Minter.\n“I’m so envious that I was working so hard this offseason to beat him in pickoffs this year,” Minter said. “But obviously, he has one of the best ones.”\nMinter watched film of his teammate and asked him for advice on improving his own move, and it’s paid off.\nIn his first four seasons, Minter had never picked anyone off and runners were 11 for 12 on stolen base attempts with him on the mound. But last season he picked off two runners and has one this season. \n“In the past I wasn’t very good at picking off,” Minter said. “I don’t want to say I was scared to; I just didn’t practice it enough. Watching him, I realized it is an advantage to keep runners honest on first and second base. I have gotten some pickoffs this year because of just practicing it and watching him. Still got a ways to go, though.”\nSaid Fried “It’s really cool that someone would be able to look at me to kind of look to (for that). I’ve definitely seen an improvement in A.J.’s pickoff over the years. It’s a part of his game that he’s really taken into more consideration ... he’s asked me a couple things.”\nAfter ranking first or second in pickoffs in each of the last three seasons, Fried is further down the MLB rankings in 2022 in a tie for sixth with 28 other players, and he’s not even the Braves’ leader (that would be Charlie Morton with three). \nCredit that to the Fried Fear Factor, with runners not being added to a pickoff ledger that has the 28-year-old climbing up the Braves’ all-time ranks.\nOn a list topped by Warren Spahn (74), Fried is tied with Dick Rudolph (1913-1927) for eighth in franchise history, and he’s two from Bob Smith (1923-1937) for seventh. In the Atlanta era (1966-on), Fried is fifth, six from Tom Glavine, and he’s not yet halfway to Phil Niekro, who tops all pitchers since the club’s relocation with 48.\nBut it’s how quickly Fried has reached that top five that’s so staggering. Glavine’s 28 came in 3,408 innings, Julio Teheran amassed 34 in 1,360 innings, Steve Avery’s 34 came over 1,222 1/3 frames and Niekro’s total was over 4,532 2/3 innings. Fried has thrown just 605 1/3 innings.\n\n\nRonald Acuña Jr. provides an update on his knee a couple hours after hitting a 444-foot home run   pic.twitter.com/Snr2Qh3PUt— Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n2. Where Snitker’s concern with Acuña lies\nThe Braves are better with Ronald Acuña Jr. No one’s debating this. On the season, they’re 64-29 (a .688 winning percentage) when he’s in the lineup, and 17-22 (.436) when he’s not.\nThat impact was on full display Wednesday vs. the Rockies, when he clubbed a 444-foot home run to dead center, helping the Braves to a win after losing their last three games, all of which Acuña missed as he dealt with “intense pain” in his surgically repaired right knee.\nAfter that victory, when asked about his knee, a laughing Acuña said it feels “terrible, but we’re going to play through it until the season is over.”\nMaybe Acuña’s tenor when saying “terrible” underscores that nobody seems overly concerned about it, and the fact that Acuña has avoided a stint on the injures list backs that up. But as manager Brian Snitker discussed Tuesday, the biggest issue with Acuña has come with starting and stopping, hence Acuña slotting in as the designated hitter Wednesday and Thursday vs. Colorado. \n“Probably stealing bases, just the takeoff isn’t great,” Snitker said of his top area of concern. “A lot of it is the slowing down, running in on balls, shutting it down, things like that irritate it pretty good. It’s better. It’s quieted down a lot since we last played him, so that’s good.”\nSnitker admits that it’s hard to get Acuña to town down the parts of his game that lead to those issues, though he’s taking steps to limit the wear and tear. Acuña has attempted one steal in the past eight games, that after being caught in his last three tries and last successfully stole a bag Aug. 13).\n“It’s hard to do that. It’s hard to do those parts of the game,” Snitker said. “When a ball’s hit, he’s going to run. In the outfield he’s going to try and catch everything and it’s hard to do that. Just trying to limit the stolen bases if we can and he’s been pretty very about managing it out of the box when it’s a routine play compared to something he feels like he can beat and he can turn it on.”\nThe reality is his knee isn’t likely to get any better during the grind of the season, meaning managing his pain is going to be a continued topic, especially as the postseason draws near.\n“It’s hard,” Snitker said. “It does bother him, but it’s like we’ve talked about many times, it’s just something I think he’s going to have to deal with to get through the year.”\n\n\nMike Soroka appreciation   pic.twitter.com/NE4pnXovig— Bally Sports South (@BallySportsSO) August 21, 2022\n\n\n\n3. Could Soroka return next week?\nMike Soroka will make his fourth rehab start Friday for Gwinnett — the third at Triple-A — and Soroka told me he’s aiming for 90 pitches, as he continues to work his way back to a big-league mound for the first time since Aug. 3, 2020.\n“Just got to keep pitching,” Soroka said.\nSoroka threw 75 pitches in his last outing, though he wasn’t particularly sharp, giving up four runs on four hits with three walks and three strikeouts. He’s been building after throwing 58 pitches and 45 pitches in his first two starts.\n“It’s all going in the right direction,” Snitker said. “It’s all about getting the repetitions now.” \nReaching that 90-pitch mark would seem to suggest that would be the end of Soroka’s rehab and getting him back in the fold — beyond being a remarkable comeback story from two Achilles surgeries — could be a major benefit to the rotation. \nKyle Wright — who has already skipped due to arm fatigue — has thrown 154 2/3, the most of any of his six professional seasons, and the same with Spencer Strider (114 2/3), though Strider just keeps looking stronger (see his record-setting 16 strikeouts Thursday vs. the Rockies). Soroka would allow the Braves to manage their innings over the last month, while also adding a former All-Star to the mix.\nShould all go well Friday, could we see Soroka return as early as the Sept. 6 or 7 games in Oakland? Those would time out with either Wright or Strider’s next start.\n\n\nOzzie Albies back on a baseball field.Repeat: @ozzie back on a baseball field. pic.twitter.com/BYQedQzUK7— Bally Sports: Braves (@BravesOnBally) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n4. Albies’ impending return brings questions, no answers\nOzzie Albies began his path back to the Braves’ lineup Thursday, going 0-for-4 as DH for Gwinnett as in his first action since breaking his foot June 13. There’s no firm timetable on when Albies will be back on the field in Atlanta, with Snitker saying at this point it’s more about monitoring the two-time All-Star, but it’s within reason to think he’s back in a Braves uniform next week.\n“He’s in good shape. He’s done a lot of work and everything,” Snitker said. “But until you get out there and put the cleats on and play the innings and everything, just get his body into game shape. I think we’ll be able to tell. Just day to day, see how he’s feeling, things like that.”\nBut as Albies inches closer, the questions that everyone has been asking are going to need answers. Chiefly, what will it mean for Vaughn Grissom. \nThe rookie has cooled off after hitting .420 through 14 games, going 3-for-27 since to drop his average to .312 with an .821 OPS and he hasn’t had an extra-base hit in the last eight games. \n“It’s great experience for (Grissom),” Snitker said. “Time will tell going forward what happens. It’s been very encouraging and great to see another young guy called up and doing well.”\nGrissom was in the outfield during batting practice Wednesday taking some reps, the most obvious spot defensively to assure he gets continued at-bats. He’s never played the position as a pro, though the shortstop is already playing out of position at second base, anyway. Plus, with William Contreras and Travis d’Arnaud (when they aren’t catching), Eddie Rosario and Marcell Ozuna (if he remains in the plans), Orlando Arcia and Acuña, when he isn’t used in the field, ABs at designated hitter, are going to be hard to come by.\nThe Braves are going to have to get creative to make it all work and having to piece together that puzzle is becoming more of a reality, though it’s likely a welcome issue if it means Albies is back in the fold.\n“We miss a guy like Oz, what he brings to our club, day-in and day-out, who he is,” Snitker said.\n\n5. Running their way into Braves history\nWhile we may not see Acuña trying to swipe bags with regularity the rest of the season, he’s done his part to create a place in Braves history. Now it’s up to Michael Harris II and Dansby Swanson to do the same.\nHarris stole his 16th base on Tuesday, making the rookie 16-for-16, and putting him four more from becoming the sixth player ever to have more than 20 steals without being caught in a single season (joining record-holder Chase Utley with 25, Alcides Escobar with 22, Quintin Berry with 21, Kevin McReynolds with 21 and Paul Molitor with 20).\nBut that’s not the history we’re talking about, as Harris and Swanson both need four steals to give the Braves three players with at least 20 stolen bases for the first time since 2000. Rafael Furcal, Andruw Jones, Reggie Sanders and Quilvio Veras all did it that season, and if Acuña/Harris/Swanson can all get to 25 steals, they’d be the first Braves trio since Ron Gant, Otis Nixon and Deion Sanders in 1992 and just the third since 1911.\n\n\nKyle Wright, Wicked Curveballs.   pic.twitter.com/ZZR8Ri6v6t— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n6. Kyle Wright’s bid to join Tom Glavine\nWright picked up his MLB-leading 17th win Tuesday, stifling the Rockies over seven scoreless innings. He was dealing against a Rockies lineup that didn’t include a single player who had ever seen Wright before.\nNo Braves pitcher has led the National League in wins since Russ Ortiz in 2003 (which was also the last time they had a 20-game winner) and Atlanta hasn’t had the majors’ wins leader since Tom Glavine won 21 in 2000.\nWright’s chances of doing so increased with the two players who went into Wednesday sharing the MLB lead with him at 16 wins — the Dodgers’ Tony Gonsolin and Astros’ Justin Verlander — both landing on the injured list. \nGonsolin is on the 15-day IL with a right forearms strain, which is expected to cost him two starts. Meanwhile, Verlander is also on the 15-day IL after undergoing an MRI that revealed a right calf injury.\nGonsolin and Verlander have teammates that are on Wright’s heels, though, with Houston’s Framber Valdez and Los Angeles’ Julio Urias both sitting on 14 wins. But should Wright continue his normal rotation turns — which, again, is something to monitor as the innings are a new high each time he takes the mound — he’s in a strong position to end the Braves’ league and MLB wins’ leader drought. \n\n\nGoing, going, GONE!Not so fast..On 8/24, Atlanta Braves' Matt Olson hit a monster grand slam into the Allegheny River. River Rescue completed a different kind of rescue, so @Braves, if you want Olson’s grand slam ball, we have it. Have your people call our people (send a DM). pic.twitter.com/S0INeJbhOX— Pittsburgh Public Safety (@PghPublicSafety) August 30, 2022\n\n\n\n7. Deep diving for souvenirs \nMatt Olson has five career grand slams, but the fifth — and first with the Braves — had someone reaching entirely new depths to retrieve it.\nLiterally.\nPittsburgh River Rescue went diving into the Allegheny River on Tuesday to retrieve the ball Olson hit on Aug. 24, a 420-foot homer that was part of a 14-2 Atlanta win. Olson is the only player in Braves history to hit a ball into the water.\nThe Pittsburgh River Rescue, for those wondering, is a unit within the city’s government offices. Pittsburgh’s web site say it combines “the efforts of the Bureau of Emergency Medical Services’ SCUBA Search &amp; Rescue Team with those of the Bureau of Police River Patrol.” \nPeople of Pittsburgh have to love this fantastic use of tax dollars at work rescuing this baseball, as the public safety department used the recovery for a training exercise.\n“Braves, if you want Olson’s grand slam ball, we have it,” Pittsburgh Public Safety posted on Twitter. “Have your people call or people (send a DM).”\n\n\n3 HOMERS FOR ADAM DUVALL  That’s B2B nights of a Braves player hitting 3 HRs in a game at Fenway(via @MLBONFOX)pic.twitter.com/3VharjlpXI— Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) September 3, 2020\n\n\n\n8. Happy anniversary to Duvall’s history-making outburst\nWhile Adam Duvall is out for the season dealing with a torn tendon sheath in his left wrist, we’ll dial it back to two years ago on this day, when he made history at Fenway Park.\nOne night after Marcell Ozuna hit three home runs, Duvall followed it up with three of his own, making them the only teammates to ever have three homers in back-to-back games.\nTechnically, Lou Gehrig and Babe Ruth did it on May 21 and 22, 1930, but that included part of a doubleheader in between. Duvall bashed two-run homers in the second and sixth innings, then followed with a solo shot in the eighth.\nTold of the feet, the aw-shucks Duvall replied “Wow, that’s pretty neat. That’s pretty cool.” Yes, pretty cool indeed.\n9. HBD to a former Braves top prospect\nBack in 2014, I caught up with Christian Bethancourt, who was at his locker before a game in which he was scheduled to catch, headphones in and poking at his iPad. He was playing a Japanese baseball game where he was working on his create-a-player and the then-rookie Bethancourt told me of his playing prowess “I’ve played 11 seasons and I’ve been MVP eight times.”\nGo ahead and enter your jokes at this stage, as Bethancourt’s actual production has yet to match up to his virtual avatar.\nThe now-31-year-old has played for four different teams, bouncing from the Braves to the Padres, A’s and now Rays. He’s played catcher, first base, second base, third base, right field and left field and even pitched nine innings, amassing a career fWAR of minus-0.6.\nBut rest assured, somewhere in virtual form, he’s meeting the hype that came with being a consensus top-100 prospect.",

Biden on Friday announced a total of $1 billion in funding for regional economic development projects in 24 different states.\n\n\n\nBiden and Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo held a virtual event with winners of grant money through the Build Back Better Regional Challenge, an initiative funded through the American Rescue Plan intended to revitalize communities with new manufacturing, biotech and clean energy projects.\n\n\n\n“As we invest and grow critical industries in the U.S., we want to create industry hubs in diverse communities across the country,\" Raimondo said in a statement. \"These grants will provide critical and historic funding directly to community coalitions to invest in new infrastructure, research and development, and workforce development programs while creating good-paying jobs, supporting workers, and prioritizing equity.”\n\n\n\nEach of the projects will receive between $25 million and $65 million. Among those chosen from hundreds of applicants are a Nebraska robotics initiative to invest in research and innovation, which will receive $25 million; $52 million for a Detroit foundation to modernize its supply chain around the mobility industry; $44 million for a New Hampshire coalition working on the production of regenerative tissues and organs; and $62 million for a West Virginia based coalition leading the transition to clean energy in the Appalachian region.\n\n\n\nSen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) joined Friday’s event virtually and was recognized by Biden at one point.\n\n\n\n“I applaud every community that received a grant and that applied. You’re the reason I’m so optimistic about the future of this country. I mean it,” Biden said at the virtual event with several of the beneficiaries.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe president asked the recipients questions about how specifically their projects would benefit their communities and how the funding would be used to boost the local economy.\n\n\n\nFriday’s announcement came on the heels of a jobs report that showed the U.S. added 315,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose to 3.7 percent, up from 3.5 percent in August.\n\n\n\nRising unemployment and slowing job gains are rarely good news for an economy. But the August jobs report showed the economy moving toward ample job growth and lower inflation.\n\n\n\nBiden touted the jobs report, paired with the latest round of funding from the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan passed last year, as evidence that his economic plan is working.\n\n\n\n“The bottom line is jobs are up, wages are up, people are back to work and we’re seeing some signs that inflation may be — I’m not overpromising — may be beginning to ease,” Biden said Friday.",

        "description": "First female singer signed to Motown whose later hit for Stax, Your Good Thing, became a classic of deep soulIn 1959, after she had been acting as his chauffeur and general assistant for three years, Mable John became the first female singer signed by Berry Gordy Jr, the founder of Motown Records. “Berry didn’t know how to drive and he didn’t have a car,” she said. Although Gordy acted as her mentor, pianist and songwriter, they were never able to come up with the sort of hits with which Mary Wells, Martha Reeves and Diana Ross, his other female signings, would soon be turning the Detroit-based label into a colossus of the music industry.John, who has died aged 91, had a voice that was too bluesy, too strong and direct, to suit the lighter, pop-angled records that became, in the label’s slogan, “the sound of young America”.

        "description": "Sainsbury Centre for Visual Arts, NorwichAncient Egypt has inspired passion and awe in the western world for centuries – yet this confused show wants to chide us for itVisions of Egypt is a blockbuster having a breakdown. It argues that modern racism towards Egypt began with the Battle of Actium in 31BC when Octavian defeated Mark Antony and his lover Cleopatra, the ruler of Egypt, and annexed it. The Romans looted Egypt’s art, “demonised” its queen, and “laid the groundwork for western perceptions … that still persist today”.But to claim that ancient Rome still influences perceptions of Egypt is just bad history. It ignores the complexities, changes and contradictions of such a huge stretch of time. Anyway, why don’t they start with ancient Greece, which borrowed Egypt’s art in Kouroi statues, while Herodotus saw it as a mysterious, exotic other? By lumping 2,000 years into one unbroken wall of western prejudice, this show kills the art it conspicuously fails to love. Surely it’s obvious that when, say, Andy Warhol portrayed Elizabeth Taylor as Cleopatra and Kenneth Williams mugged it up in Carry On Cleo they were saying something about the 1960s, not the first century BC?

        "description": "Patrick McGee, reporting for The Financial Times:\n\n\n  The 50 per cent landmark — the iPhone’s highest share since it launched in 2007 — was first passed in the quarter ending in June, according to data from Counterpoint Research. Some 150 devices using Google’s Android operating system, led by Samsung and Lenovo, accounted for the rest.\n\n\nI was not aware that Lenovo is second behind Samsung in Android phones.\n\n\n  The numbers are based on smartphones in use, known as the “active\ninstalled base”, what Apple finance chief Luca Maestri dubbed “the\nengine for our company” in a July earnings call. This is a wider\nand more meaningful category than new phone shipments, which\nfluctuate from quarter to quarter and have already demonstrated\nApple’s newfound strength.\n\nThe active installed base takes into account the millions of\npeople brought into Apple’s ecosystem through the used phone\nmarket, as well as those who use iPhones purchased years ago.\n\n\nYou don’t hear so much about “open beats closed” anymore.\n\nI also continue to think Google is bored with Android. Two years ago I wrote:\n\n\n  Do you get the sense that Google, company-wide, is all that\ninterested in Android? I don’t. Both as the steward of the\nsoftware platform and as the maker of Pixel hardware, it seems\nlike Google is losing interest in Android. Flagship Android\nhardware makers sure are interested in Android, but they can’t\nmove the Android developer ecosystem — only Google can.\n\nApple, institutionally, is as attentive to the iPhone and iOS as\nit has ever been. I think Google, institutionally, is bored with\nAndroid.\n\n\nNothing in the last two years has changed my mind on that. Android is certainly still a thing for Google. It’s a priority. But it’s nowhere near the top of Google’s priorities. Nothing ranks higher amongst Apple’s priorities than the iPhone and iOS. Year after year, that difference in prioritization adds up.\n\nThe other interesting takeaway here is that iPhone usage share outperforms iPhone sales share. iPhones are simply more durable and get meaningful software updates for longer. People use their iPhones longer, and they have far more resale value.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "description": "Bruce Kluckhohn-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Give up on the Sox if you want, but don’t give up on Rafael Devers So, 0-24. . . that’s pretty bad, huh? It is. But frankly, focusing on Rafael Devers’ recent O-fer actually masks just how bad Devers has been lately. An O-fer will always get the headlines, but 24 at-bats is just a handful of games, and any unusual results that arise out of that small of a sample size can be chalked up to random variance as much as anything else. \nBut Devers’ struggles haven’t been over just a handful of games. This past August was the single worst calendar month of Raffy’s career, as he slashed .164/.226/.289 with 22 strikeouts over 26 games. For the entire second half, he’s been the fifth worst hitter in baseball as measured by wRC+. It’s been ugly watching Rafael Devers, is what I’m saying. \nAnd yet, as I sat down to watch last night’s game against the Rangers, Devers was, by far, the player I most wanted to watch.\nThe season is over - some would say mercifully so, in light of how frustrating the past five months have been. No one will blame you if you stop flipping to NESN every night at 7:10 from here on out, if you start your mornings by catching up on the latest news about the Pats instead of the Sox, if you completely check out until the first shots of Jason Varitek wearing a windbreaker next to a Fort Myers batting cage crawl across your Twitter feed. That’s what most New Englanders will likely be doing.\nBut something happens to the way you watch a baseball game when the outcome of the game itself no longer matters in the wider competitive landscape. The game assumes a different rhythm. You find yourself noticing and watching for different things.\nYou want to see Reese McGuire get another hit not because it will help the Sox in the standings, but because you want to see just how hot a career 82 OPS+ backup catcher can get. You want to see Rich Hill strikeout 10 Tampa Bay Rays not because the Sox are chasing them in the Wild Card, but because it’s fun as hell watching someone who looks like a First Republic account executive pitch what will likely be the last truly great game of his life. And you really, really, want to see this: \n\n\npic.twitter.com/rqW4DBFzLv— Red Sox Stats (@redsoxstats) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nRaffy Devers has been this bad before. There was a 31-day stretch in 2018 in which he hit .155/.219/.278 with 30 strikeouts, and another in 2020 in which he hit .222/.276/.398. But he wasn’t just a different player back then, he was a different person. He was a kid in 2018, just getting his first taste of big league baseball on one of the greatest teams of all-time. He was still a kid two years later, struggling with the loss of a manager who’d been mentoring him toward stardom. And he’s still a kid now, albeit one who’s in the midst of turning into the thing he’s always dreamed about: one of the best hitters in the world.\nRafael Devers is an emotional player. We see this in, not only every at-bat, but in every single pitch. So it’s impossible not to try to imagine the emotions that have been swirling inside him for the past 31 days. What must it feel like to think you’ve finally climbed the mountain of professional baseball, to be sure that you finally belong - not just in the game, but in its highest echelons - and then to see it all unravel over the course of just 31 days? To go from the fourth best hitter in baseball, sandwiched in between Aaron Judge and Mike Trout, to the fifth worst, amongst the likes of Victor Robles and Myles Straw? \nI sat down last night to watch the Red Sox, not because I wanted to watch them win their 64th ballgame of the year, but because I wanted to watch a man try to fight his way out of the lowest point in his baseball life. He did just that, so I’ll watch again tonight. That’s all we have left at this point, but it hopefully it’s enough. \n\n\n.",

        "description": "The White House on Friday asked Congress to approve $13.7 billion to address Russia’s continued military invasion of Ukraine as part of a short-term funding bill. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration is requesting that Congress authorize $11.7 billion in additional security and economic assistance for Ukraine and $2 billion to help shore up domestic energy supplies to offset impacts of the war on the global energy market. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We have rallied the world to support the people of Ukraine to defend their democracy and we simply cannot allow that support to Ukraine to run dry,” an administration official told reporters when previewing the request on Friday. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House says that the funds are needed to sustain the pace of aid to Ukraine for the first three months of fiscal 2023, which begins at the start of October. The administration official said roughly three-fourths of the funds Congress has already approved for Ukraine have been spent or obligated. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nCongress on a bipartisan basis has approved over $53 billion in security, economic and humanitarian assistance to address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year. Biden signed the last package, totaling $40 billion, into law in May. At the time, the White House said it expected those funds to last through the end of the fiscal year. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nCongress is expected to pass a continuing resolution to fund the government on a short-term basis to allow lawmakers more time to reach an agreement on a larger funding measure. The administration official noted Friday the duration of the short-term funding bill is up to Congress. It would need to be passed by the time the current fiscal year ends on Sept. 30 in order to prevent a government shutdown. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn addition to more funding for Ukraine, the White House is also asking Congress to authorize billions more in funding for the federal government’s COVID-19 pandemic response, monkeypox response and disaster relief efforts as part of a continuing resolution. The emergency funding request totals $47.1 billion.\n\n\n\nThere is bipartisan support for sending assistance to Ukraine as it grapples with more than six months of attacks from Russia, though it’s possible at least some Republicans will question the latest funding request. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House is asking Congress to approve $4.5 billion for military equipment and replenishing Pentagon stockpiles, $2.7 billion in defense and intelligence aid for Ukraine and $4.5 billion for budgetary support for Ukraine’s government. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe request also asks for $2 billion to support domestic energy sources — $1.5 billion for uranium to fuel nuclear reactors and $500 million to modernize the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to address impacts of Russia’s war on energy supply and prices. &nbsp;",

        "description": "The White House is set to request $22.4 billion in funding for the ongoing COVID-19 response effort and $3.9 billion for the monkeypox response effort in the form of emergency funding from Congress, senior administration officials announced on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe updated request for COVID-19 funding is to meet immediate short-term domestic needs, including testing, research and development of next-generation vaccines and therapeutics, according to the White House. It also would support the global response to COVID-19 and help to prepare for future variants.\n\n\n\n“Without additional funding, we will have to make more difficult decisions,” a senior administration official said on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe federal government on Friday suspended the program for free COVID-19 tests to be sent to Americans. Officials argued that a lack of funding has prevented them from adequately replenishing national stockpiles of at-home tests. They added that they issued a warning in March, stating that without more funding they will miss critical needs. \n\n\n\nOfficials said on Friday that while there are some tests available in the stockpile, there is not enough funding to get through a surge in the fall. Vaccines will be free into 2023, but the timeline for commercialization of vaccines going forward has had to be accelerated without funding.\n\n\n\nThe request to fight monkeypox is to help ensure ready access to vaccinations, testing, treatment and operational support. It also includes $600 million to help combat the spread globally.\n\n\n\nThe request, made ahead of the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30, is for Congress to address critical needs&nbsp;in the event of short-term continuing resolution (CR) that lasts through the first quarter, which includes October, November and December.\n\n\n\n“With one month until the end of the fiscal year, it’s clear that Congress will first need to pass a short-term continuing resolution (CR) to keep the Federal government running and provide the time needed to reach an agreement on full-year funding bills,”&nbsp;Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young said in a blog post released Friday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That’s why today, as part of our prudent planning for the end of the fiscal year, we are providing technical assistance to Congress on a short-term CR.”\n\n\n\nThe White House’s request also includes $13.7 billion to help Ukraine amid the war with Russia and funding to respond to natural disasters in states including Kentucky, California, Louisiana, Texas and others.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3621842-vilifying-ppp-recipients-in-defense-of-student-loan-forgiveness-is-disgraceful/",
        "description": "Since unveiling its Student Loan Debt Relief Plan last week, the Biden administration and its allies have struggled to explain its rationale and defend the policy on its merits. As criticism has mounted — including from prominent Democrats — the administration apparently has decided that the best defense is a good offense, choosing to forgo a coherent, full-throated justification for its approach and instead striking at its critics.\n\n\n\nSome of the attack lines have followed the usual script: shopworn tropes along the lines of “Why can’t the little guy get a break, when the rich [fill in the blank: receive tax breaks, don’t pay their fair share, receive bailouts, etc.]?” As Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said in an interview with George Stephanopoulos on Sunday, “I know it is shocking, George, to some Republicans that the government, on occasion, does something to benefit working families and low-income people.”\n\n\n\nFar worse than garden-variety class warfare is the offensive undertaken in a series of tweets from the White House’s official Twitter account. The thread called out prominent Republican House representatives for criticizing the principle of debt cancellation, even though they themselves personally benefited from loan forgiveness (of significantly greater dollar amounts than contemplated by the Student Loan Debt Relief Plan) associated with the COVID-19 Paycheck Protection Program, or PPP. The administration presumably believed that highlighting the supposed hypocrisy of critics would buttress the case for the policy integrity of its own debt relief plan.\n\n\n\nComparing loan forgiveness granted to borrowers pursuant to the PPP to President Biden’s Student Loan Debt Relief Plan dishonestly conflates two vastly differently conceived policies.&nbsp; While extinguishing any financial obligation owed to government represents a transfer payment benefiting one specific group (in this case, borrowers) at the expense of another, usually larger group (taxpayers), the circumstances that give rise to such transfer — or really, any governmental spending — are integral to assessing the legitimacy of any redistribution scheme.\n\n\n\nEven political conservatives will grudgingly acknowledge that transfer payments as a component of a modern market-based economy are here to stay. Recognizing that wealth redistribution fails to comprise an unassailable public good, as with spending on national defense, policing and the maintenance of a judicial system, the bar should be appropriately high for transfer payments favoring some constituencies at the expense of others. How do the PPP and the Student Loan Debt Relief Plan compare?\n\n\n\nEven for those skeptical of redistributive relief programs, a strong case can be made for the PPP.&nbsp; The following circumstances associated with the creation of the PPP are worth considering:\n\n\n\nThe PPP addressed a crisis of the government’s own making. While the COVID pandemic may not have been the direct “fault” of the federal government, the shutdowns and closures resulting from decisions made at the state and local level in reliance on federal public health guidance directly impacted employers unable to operate their businesses in the normal course. One can also argue that the public health establishment’s failure to anticipate and prepare for a public health emergency of the type that occurred in March 2020 exacerbated the impact of the pandemic and imperiled the prospects of commercial enterprises.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMoreover, a line plausibly can be drawn to the U.S. government’s role in promoting China’s accession to the global rules-based order, where it has been an irresponsible, revisionist actor — as clearly evidenced in its response to the initial coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan and thereafter.\n\n\n\nThe environment in which PPP was enacted was one of exigent threats to the U.S. and global economy, with decisive action required. The CARES Act, which created the PPP, was premised on the notion that keeping employees of small businesses employed was preferable to massive job losses. In addition, in the case where employees remained on the payroll of businesses that were not operating, this “employment” represented a more efficient delivery mechanism for de facto unemployment benefits than the real thing. Further, the public interest is served by keeping workers employed; the positive externalities of gainful employment over receiving a handout (the same argument against a Universal Basic Income) can be readily observed in any community having recently lost its largest employer.\n\n\n\nAlthough focused on wages, the PPP was more than just an employment plan. The program required the proceeds of loans to go to specified uses in order for a company to qualify for forgiveness, primarily employee wages. Since money is fungible, this freed up resources to keep businesses afloat and avoided a wave of insolvencies and industrial distress that might have resulted in longer-lasting disruption to the global economy and financial system.\n\n\n\nI detailed earlier this year why blanket student debt forgiveness of the type reflected in the administration’s relief plan is poor public policy. It is particularly appalling to see student loan forgiveness favorably contrasted with the PPP, particularly given easily discernible and critical distinctions between the respective programs, which suggest student loan relief falls well shy of clearing that high bar.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, PPP loans contemplated subsequent forgiveness, provided program requirements were met. This element was designed to incentivize compliance with the plan’s intended purposes. Student loans, on the other hand, like other forms of traditional debt, are evidenced by a binding contract and a commitment to repay amounts borrowed on agreed terms.&nbsp; They contain no “If you do X, such debt will be forgiven” provisions.\n\n\n\nIn contrast with student loan debt, the PPP was created and implemented in a very short period of time in response to an exogenous, unanticipated crisis. It was not a policy trial-ballooned over several months, formulated to appeal to a particular constituency, and announced just prior to hotly contested midterm congressional elections.\n\n\n\nLastly, as described above, there was a clearly stated, easily comprehended rationale for the PPP.&nbsp; No such rationale exists for forgiving student loan debt, other than “providing relief.” Why this particular relief, at this time, favoring this group, and not some entirely different form of “relief”?\n\n\n\nThat the Biden administration has chosen to vilify Republican lawmakers for receiving the benefit of the bargain they entered into — complying with PPP requirements in order to receive forgiveness of loans made to sustain employment in the public interest — demonstrates just how hollow the policy arguments are in favor of wholesale student loan forgiveness. A president who campaigned on a theme of “unity” instead has advanced a policy nakedly favoring a critical electoral constituency, willfully attempted to confuse the issue by accusing its critics of hypocrisy, and promoted student debt relief without making a credible case for it.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration, evidently out of ideas, cynically believes it can succeed electorally by setting some groups against others. Referring to a plurality of the electorate over the weekend as “semi-fascist” is apparently a feature of this approach, not a bug. The risk in such a strategy is fostering an increasingly resentful and demoralized populace, with groups not benefiting from public largesse rightly wondering, “Why not us?”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZero-sum, “beggar thy neighbor” policies are not the American way. We are better than this, even if our current administration isn’t.\n\n\n\nRichard J.

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;Polio is caused by a virus and spread through contact with feces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe virus infects the throat and intestines, and can cause flu-like symptoms.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParalysis from the polio virus is rare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis year, polio cases have been detected in New York state, London and Jerusalem. Spread mostly through contact with an infected person’s feces, vaccination is protective against illness, paralysis and death from the polio virus. With schools back in session or shortly to begin, here’s what to know about polio.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn July, the case in Rockland County in New York was in an otherwise healthy young adult who was unvaccinated but had a confirmed case of poliomyelitis resulting in paralysis in the leg. The county also found the virus in wastewater samples from June.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPolio was also found in wastewater samples in New York city, suggesting that it is more widespread than a single case. “For every one case of paralytic polio identified, hundreds more may be undetected,” State Health Commissioner Mary T. Bassett said in a statement. “The detection of poliovirus in wastewater samples in New York City is alarming, but not surprising.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMost people who are infected will not have visible symptoms, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). One out of four people may have flu-like symptoms, like sore throat, fever and fatigue. An even smaller number of people may have neurological symptoms because the virus can travel into the spinal cord, including meningitis (infection of covering of spinal cord and/or brain) or paralysis.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to the CDC, the polio virus can spread through person to person contact, most commonly through contact with feces and less so through droplets from a sneeze or cough. It typically enters the body through the mouth and infects the throat and intestines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe current polio situation in New York state is being monitored closely. “The best way to keep adults and children polio-free is through safe and effective immunization – New Yorkers’ greatest protection against the worst outcomes of polio, including permanent paralysis and even death,” says Bassett in the statement. In New York City, there are some pockets where vaccination coverage is under 70 percent in children ages 6 months to 5 years old.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBreakdown of polio vaccination coverage in New York city by boroughs and neighborhoods\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, polio virus has been detected in the wastewater since February. Health experts are warning that the strain that is circulating is derived from an older, less used version of a vaccine that contains a weaker live virus. This virus from the vaccine can mutate and adapt if allowed to circulate in the population. The government in London is aiming to vaccinate all 1- to 9-year-old children.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe polio vaccine is included in the standard childhood vaccination schedule. To find out if you’ve been vaccinated against polio, look for IPV, which stand for inactivated polio virus, on your immunization card. If you received your vaccine in some other countries, it might say OPV, which is the oral polio vaccine.&nbsp;",

        "description": "We don’t need to tell you that the average American worker is being hit hard by inflation, which is now at a record high. A study by Salary Finance earlier this year found that, of the 3,001 Americans surveyed by the personal finance company, 45 percent of respondents felt financially stressed, the highest percentage over the last four years, while 76 percent of respondents said the rising price of consumer goods had impacted their finances.\n\n\n\nAdd to this findings from the recent Wall Street Journal-NORC poll, where more than 8 in 10 believe the state of the nation’s economy is poor or not so good, and the outlook is at best sour, at worst, downright pessimistic.\n\n\n\nThe Wall Street Journal concurred, reporting that the figure represents the highest dissatisfaction level ever recorded on the question, which the outlet has asked every few years starting in 1972.\n\n\n\nSobering statistics\n\n\n\nThese sobering statistics might go some way to explaining why Americans continue to type resignation letters as you read these words. The Great Resignation/Relocation/Re-evaluation rages on despite recession fears, or perhaps because of them. In June, 4.2 million Americans quit their jobs, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s latest Job Openings and Labor Turnover Summary, which is only down slightly from 4.3 million in May.\n\n\n\nTo date, roughly 73 million Americans have left their positions since the beginning of 2021. Prompted by the pandemic, employees have been heading for pastures new, demanding more money, better working conditions, improved work-life balance and more opportunities to advance their career. As a result, the scales have tipped in favor of labor, with employers having to bend over backward to attract and retain talent.\n\n\n\nEven better news for job seekers is that the market is on fire right now, with 10.1 million job openings in June, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. American workers have rarely had so many job opportunities with government figures indicating there are nearly two vacancies for every person looking for work.\n\n\n\nEmployers, by the same token, are struggling to find and hire great talent, and as a result they are offering increasing pay, perks and opportunities, to both new employees and current ones.\n\n\n\nSo, whether you choose to stay in your current role and ask for a salary increase, or look for something new with more money, it pays to do your research, keep the above statistics in mind, crunch the numbers, and explore your options. Speaking of which, if you're looking for a new position, consider your options with these three inspiring roles to get you started:\n\n\n\nDirector of Federal Affairs, City Year, Washington D.C.\n\n\n\nCity Year is seeking an experienced Federal Affairs Director to join its Federal Affairs and National Service Policy team.

You will work closely with the Senior Vice President for Federal Affairs to ensure that City Year/Voices for National Service is a highly visible, trusted and influential resource on Capitol Hill and with the Executive Branch. The ideal candidate will have experience with the legislative process, policy analysis or advocacy and will need to be self-motivated, enjoy working within a fast-paced environment, and have an understanding of, or an interest in, national service and education issues.

        "title": "Biden was right: MAGA ideology is fascism",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/white-house/3625814-biden-was-right-maga-ideology-is-fascism/",
        "description": "President Biden described Make America Great Again (MAGA) ideology as “semi-fascism.” Though leaders of the movement object to the comparison, the two worldviews are disturbingly similar.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFascism&nbsp;developed as a response to the perceived failings of 19th-century&nbsp;liberalism. It began in Italy but reached its fullest potential in Germany. Disillusioned veterans of the Great War swelled the ranks of authoritarian movements, and the&nbsp;Great Depression&nbsp;drove desperate people into the arms of dictators who promised them security, jobs and renewed prosperity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe MAGA movement consists of those who embrace former president Donald Trump’s vision of America. While not all who voted for him share his extreme beliefs, Trump has a strong grip on the Republican party. Members who disagree with him refuse to say so publicly for fear of his wrath. Trump’s most vocal party critic Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.)&nbsp;lost her bid for reelection.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe cult of personality is the defining characteristic of fascism and the MAGA movement. Adolf Hitler posed, not as an elected leader, but as the embodiment of the collective will who knew best what his people needed. He scorned elections asserting his rise to power as de facto justification for the right to hold it indefinitely. “One people, one realm, one leader,” Hitler proclaimed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDonald Trump has the same faith in his destiny and supreme self-confidence in his unique ability to rule. “I am your voice,” he told the&nbsp;Republican convention&nbsp;in 2016. “I alone can fix it. I will restore law and order.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFascism and MAGA ideology also share the same faith in big lies. Dictators and demagogues recognize no objectively verifiable facts. Truth is what they declare it to be. “If you tell a lie big enough and keep repeating it,” Nazi propaganda minister&nbsp;Josef Goebbels&nbsp;declared, “people will eventually come to believe it.” Hitler claimed that Germany did not lose the First World War but had been “stabbed in the back” by Jews, Marxists and corrupt politicians. Trump insists he did not lose the 2020 election. Approximately&nbsp;70 percent&nbsp;of Republicans believe him.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoth movements are racist and xenophobic. The Nazis envisioned a Volksgemeinschaft, or “national community,” comprised of pure Aryan Germans. Everyone else was an alien unworthy of citizenship. Jews, Roma and others ethnic minorities had to be expelled or exterminated. The Nazis designated the disabled and mentally ill as “life unworthy of living” or “useless eaters” and systematically murdered them. They labeled gay people as degenerates and sent them to concentration camps. \n\n\n\nMAGA espouses a narrow definition of American identity. It insists the United States has always been and must remain a Christian nation. While some members of the movement openly embrace&nbsp;white supremacy, others use&nbsp;coded racism, railing against the unfair advantage affirmative action affords people of color.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump has his own list of undesirables. He characterized migrants from Mexico as criminals, rapists and even “animals.” During his&nbsp;campaign&nbsp;for president, he called for a “complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States,” claimed without evidence that Arab Americans in New Jersey cheered as the towers fell on 9/11, and supported surveillance of mosques. He signed an&nbsp;executive order&nbsp;banning travel from seven predominantly Muslim countries for 90 days and suspending resettlement of Syrian refugees. He opposed extending civil rights protection to&nbsp;LGBTQ+&nbsp;people.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to antisemitism, MAGA has taken a page directly from the Nazi playbook. In 2016, Trump tweeted an&nbsp;image&nbsp;of Hilary Clinton against a background of $100 bills with the phrase “most corrupt candidate ever” framed by a star of David. When white supremacists at the&nbsp;Unite the Right Rally&nbsp;chanting “Jews will not replace us” clashed with protestors,&nbsp;Trump said&nbsp;there were “very fine people on both sides.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFascism and MAGA ideology oppose freedom of information and ideas. The Nazis banned a free press and burned books. They provided people with cheap radio sets dubbed the “Goebbels snout” so they could listen to government-controlled stations, which played music as well as propaganda, but&nbsp;banned jazz,&nbsp;which was deemed the product of a “degenerate” race.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump repeatedly dismisses unfavorable coverage as “fake news” and has called the&nbsp;media&nbsp;the “true enemy of the people.” His followers seek to restrict school&nbsp;curriculums.&nbsp;Sixteen states&nbsp;have laws prohibiting critical race theory. Local school boards have imposed similar bans. Other laws limit or prohibit sex education and discussion of gender identity and sexual orientation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn Indiana bill&nbsp;stipulates students \"must receive instruction that socialism, Marxism, communism, totalitarianism, or similar political systems are incompatible with and in conflict with the principles of freedom upon which the United States was founded.\" MAGA thought control extends to banning books with “objectionable” content from&nbsp;libraries.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nViolence was stock-in-trade for fascists. During his rise to power, Hitler relied on the Sturmabteilung [assault division]. Nicknamed “brownshirts” based on their distinctive uniforms, these thugs intimidated opponents. After he became chancellor, Hitler unleashed a reign of terror. On the Night of the Long Knives, Hitler eliminated his rivals, including Ernst Rohm, a founder of the Nazi party. Then there was Kristallnacht [night of the broken glass], the pogrom against German Jews that began the Holocaust. \n\n\n\nThe MAGA movement is no stranger to violence. Extremist groups like the&nbsp;Oath Keepers, the&nbsp;Three Percenters&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Proud Boys&nbsp;have been among Trump’s staunchest supporters. Several group members have been&nbsp;indicted&nbsp;for their part in the Jan. 6 insurrection. Trump himself has been careful not to openly incite violence, but the Proud Boys took his admonition to “stand back and standby” as a call to arms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Jan. 6 committee concluded that he instigated the insurrection. “There can be no doubt that he commanded a mob, a mob he knew was heavily armed, violent, and angry, to march on the Capitol,” committee Chair Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.)&nbsp;stated.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBased on years of writing about extremism and teaching a course on “Germany under the Third Reich” I must agree with Biden’s comparison. Not all MAGA supporters are fascists, but the movement’s ideology certainly is.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTom Mockaitis is a professor of history at DePaul University and the author of “Violent Extremists: Understanding the Domestic and International Terrorist Threat.” ",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/tanner-houck-back-injury-disc-season-ending.html",
        "description": "3:37pm: After meeting with another specialist, Houck will likely undergo back surgery, Cora announced to reporters (Twitter link via MassLive.com&#8217;s Chris Cotillo).\n11:35am: What the Red Sox hoped would be a fairly short-term injury for righty Tanner Houck could actually prove to be a season-ender.  Houck, who was placed on the 15-day injured list in early August due to lower back inflammation, has yet to resume baseball activity, and manager Alex Cora tells reporters there&#8217;s a &#8220;good chance&#8221; he could miss the remainder of the year at this point (link via MassLive.com&#8217;s Chris Smith). Houck met with a back specialist yesterday, and there will be more information on his outlook in the near future.\nHouck was diagnosed with a disc issue in his back not long after being placed on the injured list, and while he was slated to throw a bullpen session earlier in the week, that didn&#8217;t happen due to continued discomfort. Cora, Smith notes, said he was not sure whether Houck would require surgery to address the issue.\nPrior to his injury, Houck had stepped up as a key late-inning option for the Sox, going 8-for-9 in save opportunities and adding a hold along the way. Since a May 15 shift to the bullpen, Houck has pitched to a pristine 1.49 ERA with a 22.6% strikeout rate, a 7.5% walk rate and a huge 58.2% ground-ball rate in 36 1/3 innings. Houck, John Schreiber, Garrett Whitlock and Matt Strahm have been Boston&#8217;s most reliable bullpen arms in 2022, though Whitlock has also spent time in the rotation and Strahm and Houck have now both missed substantial time due to injury.\nThe 26-year-old Houck has long rated as one of the better prospects in the Red Sox organization, and through parts of three big league seasons, he&#8217;s demonstrated the reasoning behind that evaluation. The 2017 first-rounder has tallied 146 big league innings, dating back to 2020, and carries a 3.02 ERA with a strong 27.6% strikeout rate, a roughly average 8.7% walk rate and an above-average 49.3% grounder rate. He&#8217;s worked both as a reliever and as a starter, finding success in both roles (3.22 ERA as a starter, 2.66 as a reliever).\nWhile this wouldn&#8217;t be the manner in which the Sox hoped to see his first full big league season end, Houck has largely solidified himself as a key piece of the team&#8217;s long-term plans &#8212; whichever role he ultimately occupies. Houck will finish this season with one year and 100 days of Major League service time, giving him five additional seasons of club control (and another two years before he even reaches arbitration).\nThe Sox will see Nathan Eovaldi, Michael Wacha and Rich Hill all reach free agency at season&#8217;s end &#8212; Wacha recently told the Globe&#8217;s Peter Abraham that he&#8217;d &#8220;definitely like to&#8221; re-sign in Boston &#8212; which could create a potential rotation vacancy for Houck. At the same time, there&#8217;s plenty of fluidity in the relief corps, particularly with Strahm also set to reach the market as a free agent. Houck could help stabilize the bullpen as well. That flexibility is a boon for the front office as they look to revamp the staff this winter, broadening the options they can explore both via free agency and trade.",

        "description": "With the help of artificial intelligence, researchers have explored the moon&#8217;s permanently shadowed regions.\nThe information they have obtained about the area&#8217;s surface properties will help to identify suitable locations for future lunar missions.\nWith China having landed a robot—and raised its flag—on the far side of the Moon in 2020, NASA is planning for its Artemis program to land in the lunar south pole region, probably between 2025 and 2028. Astronauts will then concentrate their exploration in this area.\nWhat makes the south polar region so fascinating is that the sun hovers near the horizon due to the Moon&#8217;s axial tilt, the sunken floors of impact craters never see sunlight and lie in perpetual shadow.\nThese shadowed regions are consequently incredibly cold—colder even than the surface of Pluto, with temperatures of around −170° to −240° Celsius and approaching absolute zero. At higher temperatures, ice would sublimate and very quickly turn into gas in the vacuum of space. But in this extreme cold, water vapor, and other volatile substances can become trapped or frozen within or even on the lunar soil.\nThis potential for ice to be present makes those shadowed crater floors intriguing sites to explore. Not only might the ice harbor clues as to how water is integrated into the Earth-moon system, it could also prove to be an important resource to be used by future astronauts for consumption, radiation shielding, or as rocket propellant.\nThe researchers developed a method to better understand the moon&#8217;s shadowed region. Their work appears in the journal Geophysical Research Letters. The lead author is Valentin Bickel, a postdoctoral researcher at the chair of glaciology and formerly at the chair of engineering geology at ETH Zurich.\nThe team used images taken by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter Camera, which has been documenting the surface of the moon for over a decade. This camera captures photons that are bounced into the shadowed regions from adjacent mountains and crater walls. Now, with the help of artificial intelligence, the team has succeeded in making such efficient use of this data that these previously dark areas become visible. After analyzing their images, the team has determined that no water ice is visible in these shadowed areas of the moon—even though its existence has been proven by other instruments.\n&#8220;There is no evidence of pure surface ice within the shadowed areas, implying that any ice must be mixed with lunar soil or lie underneath the surface,&#8221; says Bickel.\nThe results in the new paper are part of a comprehensive investigation of potential Artemis landing sites and exploration options on the lunar surface conducted by the LPI-JSC Center for Lunar and Science and Exploration. So far, the team has examined more than half a dozen potential landing sites for Artemis missions. The study&#8217;s findings could have direct implications for future missions, including Intuitive Machines Mission 2, which will be conducted on a commercial basis by a start-up. This robotic mission in the spring of 2023 aims to collect and analyze the first soil samples from the shadowed areas of the moon&#8217;s south pole, before the astronauts reach the moon.\n&#8220;We have discovered a number of previously unknown shadowed craters and other surface features that could be critical to the location where the hopper lander touches down,&#8221; Bickel says.\nThese new research findings will allow for precise planning of routes into and through the permanently shadowed regions, which will greatly reduce the risks Artemis astronauts and robotic explorers encounter. Thanks to the new images, astronauts can target specific locations to take samples and assess the distribution of ice.\nSource: ETH Zurich\nThe post Team gauges moon&#8217;s shadowed side for future landings appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "The successful reintroduction of these charismatic, industrious rodents proves that restoring ecosystems is possible“Merely a trifle! Merely a trifle! And it isn’t really finished!” says CS Lewis’s Mr Beaver when Susan, in The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe, compliments his dam. In icy Narnia, the Beavers come to the children’s rescue after their friend Mr Tumnus is captured. They are ingenious, energetic, helpful to humans – in other words, not entirely dissimilar from how conservationists might describe them (with the exception of Lewis’s thoroughly old-fashioned view of gender roles: while Mr Beaver is the couple’s builder, Mrs Beaver is a seamstress).Beavers were hunted to extinction across much of Europe hundreds of years ago. When The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe was published in 1950 they were, although not mythical creatures, partly imaginary ones in the sense that vanishingly few Britons had ever seen one. It is no wonder, given how warmly their memory lived on in books such as Lewis’s, that their successful reintroduction to England and Scotland is widely if not universally regarded as good news.

        "description": "Patrick McGee, reporting for The Financial Times:\n\n\n  The 50 per cent landmark — the iPhone’s highest share since it launched in 2007 — was first passed in the quarter ending in June, according to data from Counterpoint Research. Some 150 devices using Google’s Android operating system, led by Samsung and Lenovo, accounted for the rest.\n\n\nI was not aware that Lenovo is second behind Samsung in Android phones.\n\n\n  The numbers are based on smartphones in use, known as the “active\ninstalled base”, what Apple finance chief Luca Maestri dubbed “the\nengine for our company” in a July earnings call. This is a wider\nand more meaningful category than new phone shipments, which\nfluctuate from quarter to quarter and have already demonstrated\nApple’s newfound strength.\n\nThe active installed base takes into account the millions of\npeople brought into Apple’s ecosystem through the used phone\nmarket, as well as those who use iPhones purchased years ago.\n\n\nYou don’t hear so much about “open beats closed” anymore.\n\nI also continue to think Google is bored with Android. Two years ago I wrote:\n\n\n  Do you get the sense that Google, company-wide, is all that\ninterested in Android? I don’t. Both as the steward of the\nsoftware platform and as the maker of Pixel hardware, it seems\nlike Google is losing interest in Android. Flagship Android\nhardware makers sure are interested in Android, but they can’t\nmove the Android developer ecosystem — only Google can.\n\nApple, institutionally, is as attentive to the iPhone and iOS as\nit has ever been. I think Google, institutionally, is bored with\nAndroid.\n\n\nNothing in the last two years has changed my mind on that. Android is certainly still a thing for Google. It’s a priority. But it’s nowhere near the top of Google’s priorities. Nothing ranks higher amongst Apple’s priorities than the iPhone and iOS. Year after year, that difference in prioritization adds up.\n\nThe other interesting takeaway here is that iPhone usage share outperforms iPhone sales share. iPhones are simply more durable and get meaningful software updates for longer. People use their iPhones longer, and they have far more resale value.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

The Devon rock trio achieved the feat with their ninth album, Will of the People, which was released last week in the form of a limited edition NFT “digital pressing”, as well as traditional formats such as vinyl, digital, cassette and CD.Will of the People sold 51,500 copies in its first week, outselling the rest of the top 10 combined, although only a fraction of those were NFTs: the digital pressing of the record was limited to 1,000 copies worldwide, meaning that even if every copy of the NFT was sold in the UK, they accounted for at most 1.96% of the UK sales.

        "description": "Earth, LondonTechno producer Dillon and Bhangra percussionist Bhamra seem as one as they take their lightning-fast polyrhythms on an unpredictable musical odysseyThe release of producer Beatrice Dillon’s 2020 debut album, Workaround, heralded a unique talent. Over 14 compositions – each clipping along at a frenetic 150bpm – Dillon manipulated acoustic instruments as varied as the kora, tabla, saxophone and cello to sound as slippery and densely metallic as her computer-programmed electronics. An enveloping soundscape escaped its metronomic constrictions thanks to its shaking bass frequencies, snapping rhythm and piercing melody, resulting in computer music with immense feeling.It’s Bhangra instrumentalist Kuljit Bhamra who plays the tabla on Workaround: by pressing the heel of his hand into the skin of the drum, he creates bass glissandos, bending notes to sound like the manipulations of a digital synth. Tonight’s show at Earth in east London homes in on this electro-acoustic alchemy as the pair perform a selection of works in progress. Bhamra plays cymbals and percussion, including a talking drum, timbale and gourd as well as a new digital instrument he has developed – the Tabla Touch – which converts each strike of a surface that mimics the tabla into a range of programmable sounds. Dillon’s setup, by contrast, is minimal, comprising just a laptop and sequencer. Continue reading...",

According to its update page, it has Bandcamp Fridays scheduled for September 2nd, October 7th, November 4th, and December 2nd.\nBandcamp says that when you buy music during a Bandcamp Friday, 93 percent of that money goes to the artist or label on average (with the rest going to payment processing fees).

Joe Buccino, said in a statement. \n\n\n\nGen. Michael Kurilla, the head of CENTCOM, also spoke by phone with Pakistan's chief of army staff, General Qamar Javed Bajwa, to express “his condolences for the people of Pakistan,” the statement added.  \n\n\n\nFloods that began in mid-June have ravaged Pakistan, and satellite images this week showed more than one-third of the country under water.\n\n\n\nThe flooding has killed more than 1,100 people — at least 400 of them children —&nbsp;affected more than 33 million people,&nbsp;and destroyed millions of acres of crops and hundreds of thousands of livestock, setting the country up for a major food shortage and humanitarian crisis.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe floods are being blamed on a&nbsp;heavier than normal monsoon season, the wettest since Pakistan began keeping records in 1961,&nbsp;CNN reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called the floods “the worst in the country’s history,” estimating that the disaster has caused more than $10 billion in damages. ",

– Country singer Jason Aldean has been dropped by his longtime PR firm days after his wife, Brittany Aldean, made critical comments about gender-affirming care for trans children.\n\n\n\n“Music has always been and remains The GreenRoom’s core focus, so we had to make the difficult decision after 17 years to step away from representing Jason,”&nbsp;said Tyne Parrish, the co-owner of The Green Room, in a statement first shared with Billboard. Parrish also confirmed the news to Variety.\n\n\n\n“We aren’t the best people for the gig anymore, but will always be big fans of his music — he is one of the greatest live entertainers in country music,\" Parrish told Billboard.\n\n\n\nThe Green Room, based in Nashville, declined to specify why Aldean was dropped. A representative for the firm did not respond on Friday to request for more information.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCountry singer Luke Bell dead at 32\t\n\n\n\n\nNews of the Green Room’s decision followed backlash against Aldean’s wife, Brittany Aldean, who wrote last week in an Instagram post that she would “really like to thank my parents for not changing my gender when I went through my tomboy phase.”\n\n\n\nSinger and songwriter Cassadee Pope responded to Brittany Aldean’s post on Twitter, saying that Brittany Aldean’s alleged “tomboy phase” in no way compares “to someone wanting to transition.”\n\n\n\n“The Bones” singer Maren Morris later commented on Pope’s post, writing, “It’s so easy to, like, not be a scumbag human? Sell your clip-ins and zip it, Insurrection Barbie.”\n\n\n\nMorris appeared to be referencing one of Brittany Aldean’s Instagram posts from shortly after the Capitol riots in Jan. 2021, in which she suggested that some of the rioters were actually “Antifa disguised as Trump supporters,” Rolling Stone reported at the time. Such claims have been repeatedly debunked since the insurrection on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\n\nFollowing Pope’s tweet, Brittany Aldean responded to Pope directly in an Instagram Story.\n\n\n\n“Advocating for the genital mutilation of children under the disguise of love and calling it ‘gender affirming care’ is one of the worst evils,” she wrote, in part, as seen in a screengrab shared by People.\n\n\n\nBrittany Aldean would later say on Instagram that her recent comments were “taken out of context,\" though she did not specify which remarks she felt were misinterpreted.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe silly reason Dolly Parton won’t ride Dollywood’s newest — and largest — roller coaster\t\n\n\n\n\nJason Aldean, who released his first studio album in 2005, has been a client of The GreenRoom since 2006 — which is the same year the firm was founded, according to The Tennessean. Other notable clients include Dierks Bentley, Lady A, and Thomas Rhett, per The GreenRoom’s official site.",

primarily on the political right, routinely blasted CNN under previous President Jeff Zucker for what they often said was sensationalism and a partisan slant to the left. \n\n\n\nLast month, Licht canceled the Sunday media show \"Reliable Sources\" and the network parted ways with its host, Brian Stelter. Weeks earlier, legal pundit Jeffery Toobin announced he too would be leaving the network.\n\n\n\nHarwood, in the tweet announcing he was leaving CNN, wrote he was ready to \"look forward to figuring out what's next.\" \n\n\n\nUpdated at 1:14 p.m.",

        "description": "Venice film festival: The actor is utterly magnetic as an imperious maestro in this ultra-stylish drama with a shocking climaxNo one but Cate Blanchett could have delivered the imperious hauteur necessary for this engrossing movie from writer-director Todd Field, about a globally renowned conductor heading for a crisis or crackup or creative breakthrough. No one but Blanchett has the right way of wearing a two-piece black suit with an open-necked white shirt, the way of shaking her hair loose at moments of abandon, the way of letting her face become a Tutankhamun mask of contempt. She holds the screen for two and a half hours, aided by Florian Hoffmeister’s epic cinematography, a tour de force of control, effortlessly keeping us waiting and guessing for an almost tantrically deferred climax. And when it comes, it is certainly shocking, if a little melodramatic and even absurd in ways that this ultra-stylish movie can’t quite absorb.She plays Lydia Tár, imagined to be principal conductor of the Berlin Philharmonic, addressed by colleagues as “Maestro”. There are lots of scenes shot in the real concert hall, and Tár has an onstage interview with a real journalist: the New Yorker’s Adam Gopnik, playing himself – which could have been a gimmicky and self-conscious shortcut to authenticity, but isn’t. Tár is passionate, demanding, autocratic, with a rockstar prestige and an international touring lifestyle approaching that of the super-rich, and now very keyed up as she approaches her new challenge: a live recording of Mahler for Deutsche Grammophon. Tár is in a live-in relationship with her first violinist, played by Nina Hoss and they have a child. They live in a spectacular apartment, but Tár sentimentally keeps her scuzzy old Berlin flat as an office, bolt-hole and composition studio. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Vincent Carchietta-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Calling up Oswald Peraza was the right move, but the Yankees have been shooting themselves in the foot for a long time now. The New York Yankees keep shooting themselves in the foot. With their Wednesday loss against the Los Angeles Angels, they finished August with a historically bad 10-18 record, and they are 15-24 after the All-Star break. \nIt’s hard to believe (and stomach) that the Yanks lost almost as many games in a month than they did before the All-Star break: they went 64-28 in the first half, when it looked like they were on top of the world. It’s a tale of two halves of this partial season to date, as in the first 66 games, they went 49-17; in the 65 since then, they are 30-35. The Yankees once had a 15.5-game lead in the AL East, and the Rays trailed by 15 as recently as August 2nd. Now, the lead is down to six games with over four weeks of baseball remaining.\nThose second-place Rays will host the Yankees on a three-game series starting tonight at Tropicana Field. If New York loses the set two games to one, the Rays will move to five games behind. If they are swept, Tampa will be just three back with a final three-game set looming between the two at Yankee Stadium next weekend.\nLosing the division would likely mean missing the first-round bye as well, because the Houston Astros are five games ahead of the Yankees and showing no signs of slowing down. They are playing like the best team in the American League for a reason, and they have the opportunity to thump a lot of bad teams over the next several series.\nIt would be preposterous, even downright scandalous, to see the Yankees squander the AL East and a first-round bye. They are still leading the division and playoff odds are decidedly on their side (FanGraphs had their AL East-winning odds at 91.5 percent on Thursday), but we would be lying if we didn’t think that this particular scenario is looking increasingly possible. They look lost, and the worst part is that the blame mostly resides on themselves.\nIt took forever for them to call up Oswaldo Cabrera, even with half of the infield struggling to get anything going offensively. It took them forever to call up Oswald Peraza, a top prospect who has a .927 OPS, 13 home runs, and 22 stolen bases in 52 games since June 11 (before last night). They finally gave in on Thursday night, and one would think he should be getting at least semi-regular at-bats.\n\n\nNew Month. Same Peraza.Oswald Peraza's 100th hit of the season was a BOMB! #RepBX #OffTheRails #SCtop10 pic.twitter.com/1gQzdnfjSN— SWB RailRiders (@swbrailriders) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nFrom a roster construction standpoint, there is more than just failing to call up the young guns in time. Although they did make a concerted effort to bring in Frankie Montas, they also ended up trading Jordan Montgomery (who has been pitching like an ace in St. Louis) for a still-injured player in one of the most puzzling moves of the deadline.\nAdditionally, they kept Clarke Schmidt and Ron Marinaccio down in the minors for way too long when they clearly deserved to be on the MLB roster. The former was being stretched out as a starter, so it’s at least understandable. However, there is no way to justify the fact that the Yanks went out of their way to keep Albert Abreu up while demoting the ever-reliable Marinaccio, and that cost them close games in the first half of the month before Abreu went on the injured list. New York lost eight one-run games in August; those are when all these “own goals” tend to turn their ugly heads in bad moments.\nAfter playing like MLB’s best team for three full months, it would be shocking to see the Yankees lose both the AL East division and the first-round bye, but it could conceivably happen if they don’t turn things around soon. This scenario was out of everybody’s plans a month and a half ago, but the Yanks’ lousy play has revived it. A monumental collapse is now within the realm of possibilities.\nCalling up Peraza is a nice first step, or just “step” if we consider bringing up Cabrera the first one. As Jeff argued earlier today, the next one would giving Peraza ample playing time in detriment of Isiah Kiner-Falefa, who has shown that he is just not a starting-caliber shortstop. IKF’s wRC+ is down to 80, and his .315 slugging percentage tells you everything you need to know about his offensive upside. He also made a costly error on Wednesday, and most metrics show that he is below-average defensively.\n\nSome of the Yankees’ recent struggles can, and should, be attributed to not putting their best roster (and their best lineup, for that matter) on the field. With Gleyber Torres, Josh Donaldson, and IKF struggling at the moment, this is the perfect time to change that.\nThe Yankees still have some time to turn around their fortunes and start stringing together some wins, but they can’t expect better results if they keep shooting themselves in the foot.",

        "description": "Photo by Dustin Bradford/Getty Images\n    \n\n  He hasn’t played many games with the Rockies, but he’s already contributed to their stolen base total. In 2022, the Colorado Rockies have not been an effective base-stealing team: Their 36 stolen bases rank them 29th in MLB. (Only the Minnesota Twins have stolen fewer. For some context, the Miami Marlins have stolen the most with 105.) As a comparison, in 2021, the Rockies stole 76 bases, 15th-most in MLB. This is an area in which the team has declined significantly. \nWhen it comes to creating offensive opportunities by stealing bases, the 2022 Rockies have missed out. \nConsider how individual Rockies compare in terms of stolen bases as shown by Baseball Reference: \n  \n        \n      Baseball Reference\n      Rockies stolen bases in 2022\n  \nThat Garrett Hampson is a leader with seven stolen bases makes sense. After all, he’s one of the fastest players in baseball. That Ryan McMahon, a substantially slower player, has tied him is rather a different matter, and it speaks to the strangeness of the 2022 Rockies. (I wrote about McMahon’s approach to base stealing here.) \nBut especially interesting are the three stolen bases of Wynton Bernard, who’s only played 11 games with the Rockies. In a fraction of the games played by most of his teammates, Bernard has stolen almost half as many bases as the Rockies’ base-stealing leaders.\nIn a kind of terrific grand entry, Bernard stole a base during his MLB debut:\n\nBernard had already stolen 26 bases this year with the Isotopes, so he was picking up where he left off. (Since 2012, the beginning of his MiLB career, Bernard has stolen 220 bases.)\nIt’s a part of his game Bernard has studied carefully. \nFirst, he learned from two of the best: Kenny Lofton (622 stolen bases) and Vince Coleman (752 stolen bases). “They taught me like a lot of good stuff just like on different techniques,” he said.\nSecond, he recognizes that base stealing is complex work. \n“There’s so much goes into it,” Bernard explained, “but just trying to read the pitchers is huge, and picking good times to go — going when they don’t think you’re going, and getting the green light.”\n“Sometimes the pitchers will get in a rhythm,” he continued. “So [the] first thing I look at is a rhythm of when they’re going to get a pitch to the plate. And the second thing I’ll look at is the front leg. So, heel comes up, and I’m trying to try and take off.”\nFor Bernard, it’s all part of his attempt to be a complete player. \n“I want to be able to do everything,” he said. “I aim to be one of the best, and I think that’s what you have to do in professional sports. You just have to try to be the best. So whether it’s getting on base, stealing a base; whether it’s hitting a home run, or it’s hitting the ball in the gap; playing good defense — I just want to try to be the complete player.” \nHe realizes, too, that he’s grown as a player. \n“I know early on, like my first couple of years, [my game] was just based on speed,” Bernard said, “but I think over the past couple years, I’ve shown like I can hit the ball in the gaps and stuff and get those extra-base hits.”\nIn all parts of his game, Bernard is, as he puts it, “just trying to put myself in scoring position to help the team win.” Base stealing is a key part of Bernard’s philosophy. \nRockies fans will have to wait to see if Wynton Bernard can successful implement his philosophy at the major-league level. On Tuesday, he was sent to Albuquerque as the Rockies made room on their roster for Sean Bouchard. \nWith Bernard’s absence, the Rockies have lost a much-needed base-stealing presence.",

        "description": "Ken Blaze-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Guardians have a slim lead while the Tigers crashed and burned. As of September 2, the Cleveland Guardians have a one-game lead over the Minnesota Twins with the Chicago White Sox not too far behind.\nMeanwhile, the Royals are 16 games under .500 but are 2.5 games ahead of the Detroit Tigers, cellar dwellers who fired their GM after a misguided spending spree in the offseason yielded no gains.\nHere’s a closer look at each team as the season nears its conclusion.\nNew Name, Same Game\nIn Cleveland’s first season under the Guardians moniker, the team is surprising a ton of people leading the weakest division in baseball with just a month and change to go. The Guardians currently sit 68-61, a single game ahead of the Twins.\nNaturally, Cleveland is pulling this off with one of the smallest payrolls in the majors, ahead of only the Pirates, Athletics, and Orioles.\nLeading the way is Jose Ramirez, who signed an extension right before the season began. He’s boasting a .285/.354/.546/.900 slash line to go with a team-leading 26 home runs 106 RBIs, 39 doubles, and 72 runs scored. But the Guardians are also getting excellent production from second baseman Andres Gimenez, acquired from the Mets in the Francisco Lindor deal. In his first full season, Gimenez has been worth 5.5 WAR as he’s slashed .302/.367/.487/.854 while he’s tied for the team lead in stolen bases with 15.\nAs usual, Cleveland’s pitching has been more than stellar, this year with Shane Bieber, Triston McKenzie, and Cal Quantrill leading the way. Closer Emmanuel Clase, acquired a couple of years ago for Corey Kluber, has 30 saves already to go with a 1.15 ERA and 1.84 FIP.\nTwin City Conundrums\nThe Twins are playing...fine. They’re currently 67-62, a game back of the Guardians with a full month left in the season. That record also leaves them three games back of the third and final wild-card spot. More, that record would have the Twins fourth in the AL East, third in the AL West, fourth in the NL East, third in the NL Central, and third in the NL West.\nWhat I’m saying is, the AL Central is weak sauce.\nAnyway, the Twins can still win the Central, and I wouldn’t be surprised if they do. While Carlos Correa isn’t going to win the MVP like I predicted a long time ago*, he is performing well, as he’s third on the team in OPS (.782), home runs (15), batting average (.271) and runs scored (54) while second in hits (108). \n*I also predicted the Royals to finish 82-80. Whoops.\n  \n        \n      Thomas Shea-USA TODAY Sports\n  \nByron Buxton has had a great year, worth 4.0 WAR, but, like always, he’s battled injuries and has only appeared in 92 games. One of these years, I hope, he plays a full season, and that will be something to witness. In limited time this year, he’s bashed 28 homers and slugged .526. \nOnly two pitchers with at least 70 innings pitched have an ERA that is above league-average: Sonny Gray (3.88) and Devin Smeltzer (3.71), the latter of whom is back in the minors. Dylan Bundy, Chris Archer, and Joe Ryan have all struggled to varying degrees. \nWith Correa most likely opting out of his contract after this season, the Twins need to take advantage of the tepid Central now. Thankfully for them, they’re within striking distance.\nSomber South Side\nFirst, I hope Tony La Russa is fine, and if he’s not, that he gets well soon. The White Sox manager is currently away from the team indefinitely while undergoing further medical testing. As a lifelong Cardinals fan, I’ve always liked TLR and been a fan of his, even during his post-St. Louis forays into the front office with the Diamondbacks and Red Sox. He may now manage a rival of the Royals, my favorite team, but that doesn’t change the fact that I still root for the 77-year-old. Best wishes, Tony.\nAs for the team, it’s been a rough and disappointing season. They’re 65-66 with a minus-37 run differential. Perhaps the series win against the Royals gets them back on track; perhaps not. It will certainly be interesting to see how the Pale Hose react to playing under Miguel Cairo now that La Russa is absent.\nTim Anderson remains out, having only played in 79 games so far this season. Third baseman Yoan Moncada has appeared in just one more. Eloy Jiménez has played in only 56 games, Luis Robert in 90. That’s a lot of missed games from key members of the squad. Among batters, only José Abreu, Andrew Vaughn, and AJ Pollock have played in more than 100 games, and Pollock’s OPS is thirteen percent below league average. \n  \n        \n      Peter Aiken-USA TODAY Sports\n  \nJohnny Cueto, now 36, pitched well against the Royals recently, and is dominating the AL Central as a whole. But when the team is getting key innings from Cueto, who’s now made 19 starts, something is going right. The Dallas Keuchel experiment failed rather quickly. Dylan Cease is having a fine year, but fellow young pitchers Michael Kopech (injured) and Lucas Giolito (76 ERA+) can’t say the same.\nYouth Movement\nYou’re at this site for a reason, so you probably know all there is to know about the Kansas City Royals. It’s been a weird season—before it began, expectations were high. Then they cratered. Then veterans began getting dealt. Now a youth movement is in full effect. The team’s on pace to go 65-97. \nThat’s bad.\nBut the young guys are fun to watch. \nBobby Witt Jr. is on the verge of a 20/20 season in his rookie year; Nick Pratto’s turning a corner; MJ Melendez is getting plenty of playing time both behind the plate and in the outfield; and Vinnie Pasquantino had been raking before getting injured. Other young guys like Edward Olivares, Nate Eaton, Kyle Isbel, Michael Massey, DrewWaters, and Brent Rooker have been given a chance to show what they can do.\nBrady Singer’s been pitching incredibly well since his brief trip to Omaha. Kris Bubich and Daniel Lynch have shown flashes of effectiveness. \nThere’s a long way to go but there is a glimmer of light at the end of that long, dark tunnel.\nMotown Misery\nLast season, the Detroit Tigers finished third in the Central with a 77-85 record. That was the team’s best winning percentage since 2016. To capitalize on the improvement, GM Al Avila signed free-agent pitcher Eduardo Rodríguez and free-agent shortstop Javier Báez, The team also called up top-five prospects Spencer Torkelson and, when he became healthy, Riley Greene.\nLess than one month ago, with the Tigers taking a massive step backward, Detroit fired Avila.\nRodríguez has only pitched in 11 games after being away from the team for some time, and he’s been awful—4.17 ERA (93 ERA+) and 4.25 FIP. \nBáez hasn’t been much better as he’s posting full-season career lows in batting average (.223), on-base percentage (.266) and slugging percentage (.361). His .628 OPS is 19 percent below league-average. He’s struck out 95 more times than he’s walked. But hey, he’s signed for another five years.\nTorkelson, the No. 1 pick back in 2020 out of Arizona State, got sent back to the minors in mid-July after struggling to the tune of .197/.282/.295/.577. His time in Toledo hasn’t gone much better: .229/.348/.389/.738. \nAt least Greene has performed well. His OPS+ is 104, which leads the club, but he’s still not shown much power (.387 slugging) as he’s cracked 5 homers, 4 triples, and 12 doubles. \n  \n        \n      Kirthmon F. Dozier / USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \nOverall, a year to forget in Detroit. With the fourth-worst record in baseball, they’ll have 13.25% shot at the first overall pick in next year’s draft, and with it, the right to take either LSU stud outfielder Dylan Crews or Arizona prep outfielder Max Clark.\nWith just a handful of games remaining, losing more games to “catch” Pittsburgh and Oakland may well be worth it.",

        "description": "There was some concern that Mets top prospect Francisco Alvarez could require surgery on his ailing right ankle, but the team received relatively good news on that front, tweets Anthony DiComo of MLB.com. While Alvarez does have a loose body in his ankle, he won&#8217;t undergo surgery and will instead receive an injection to alleviate some of the discomfort he&#8217;s been experiencing. The hope is that Alvarez could resume baseball activities as soon as next week.\nAlvarez, 20, ranks among the top ten prospects in all of baseball on the majority of publications and is currently the game&#8217;s top-ranked prospect at FanGraphs and MLB.com. He tore through Double-A pitching earlier this season despite being one of the league&#8217;s youngest players, hitting .277/.368/.553 with 18 homers and 16 doubles through 296 plate appearances. However, Alvarez stumbled a bit in Triple-A, slashing just .180/.340/.378 in his first 141 plate appearances. His strikeout rate rose from 24% in Double-A to 28.4% in Triple-A. Alvarez hasn&#8217;t played in a game since Aug. 23.\nA few more notes on some of the game&#8217;s top prospects&#8230;\n\nRangers fans are (understandably) clamoring for third baseman Josh Jung to make his Major League debut, and general manager Chris Young and interim manager Tony Beasley discussed with Evan Grant of the Dallas Morning News the team&#8217;s decision to hold off on promoting him just yet. Texas is also taking a look at infield prospect Ezequiel Duran, who&#8217;s playing third base in the big leagues right now and would be displaced with a Jung promotion. &#8220;We have an opportunity to play [Duran] and we just want to take advantage of that until it’s not there,&#8221; Beasley said. From a bigger picture vantage point, Jung still has just 83 plate appearances in Triple-A after missing the first four-plus months of the season due to shoulder surgery. Grant points out that Jung still hasn&#8217;t gone a full week playing third base every day &#8212; he&#8217;s spent eight games at DH &#8212; and the Rangers will want to see him at the hot corner as much as possible in the big leagues. When Jung originally underwent surgery, the expectation was that he&#8217;d miss the majority of the season and perhaps be able to DH for a few weeks late in the year. He&#8217;s beaten both the timeline and that DH-only projection, and he&#8217;s decimated Triple-A pitching to the tune of a .299/.349/.610 batting line. It still seems Jung will debut in the near future, but Young emphasized the organization is focused on his long-term outlook rather than getting his bat into the big league lineup as soon as possible.\nWhile slugger Triston Casas wasn&#8217;t among the Red Sox&#8217; initial September call-ups, manager Alex Cora said on WEEI&#8217;s Merloni, Fauria &amp; Mego show this week that the team has discussed giving Casas his first taste of the big leagues sometime this month (Twitter link via Steve Hewitt of the Boston Herald). Casas, 22, missed two months with a high ankle sprain but has been excellent since returning to the lineup in Triple-A Worcester, hitting .300/.410/.515 with five homers, 11 doubles and a triple in 156 plate appearances. The 6&#8217;4&#8243;, 252-pound first baseman is considered one of the best bats in the minors and ranks 31st or better among all MLB prospects at The Athletic, MLB.com, Baseball America and FanGraphs. The Red Sox will have to add Casas to the 40-man roster this winter in order to protect him from the Rule 5 Draft anyhow, so there&#8217;s plenty of reason to get an earlier look at him.\nRight-hander Grayson Rodriguez made his first appearance for an Orioles affiliate in three months last night, returning from a Grade 2 lat strain that, at one point, threatened the remainder of his season. Rodriguez threw just 31 pitches in 1 1/3 innings with Class-A Aberdeen and exited after back-to-back walks in the second inning. He told reporters after the game that he&#8217;d simply hit the pitch count the organization placed upon his first appearance since June 1 (link via Steve Melewski of MASNsports.com). Considered by many to be the game&#8217;s top pitching prospect, Rodriguez overwhelmed Triple-A lineups prior to his injury, pitching to a 2.09 ERA with a 37.4% strikeout rate and a 6.5% walk rate through 56 innings. He&#8217;s not on the 40-man roster at the moment, but he&#8217;ll need to be added in the offseason or else be Rule 5-eligible, so it&#8217;s at least possible the O&#8217;s call him up for a big league debut late in the regular season if his rehab work progresses nicely.",

        "description": "Venice film festival: Timothée Chalamet and Taylor Russell dazzle in Luca Guadagnino’s blood-soaked parable of poverty and rebellion‘Take, eat, this is my body,” said Jesus at the last supper, a line I remembered while reading Piers Paul Read’s book about the survivors of the 1972 Andes plane crash, and remembered again watching Luca Guadagnino’s new film, adapted by screenwriter David Kajganich from the YA bestseller by Camille DeAngelis – although here there isn’t quite the same transformative miracle. Bones And All is a macabre horror, an emo adventure in revulsion, a tale of young and forbidden love, and a parable for that terrible secret thought, scary but also euphoric, that enters into everyone’s head in their teen years: I am different.We are at the tail-end of the Reaganite 80s, an era lacking the surveillance and DNA technology which, in the present day, might have taken a bite out of this movie’s plausibility. Taylor Russell plays Maren, a shy, smart kid who has just started at a new school, living on the edge of poverty with her careworn dad (André Holland). One of her new friends invites her to a sleepover, where the mood of humid, girlish intimacy excites Maren in ways her new friends could not have anticipated: she bites someone’s finger off and eats it.

        "description": "Allahpundit announced that he is leaving the conservative site Hot Air.\n&#8220;That’s one reason why, when I’ve been forced to choose, I preferred to be a traitor than a propagandist. Here’s another: What is the right’s &#8217;cause&#8217; at this point? What cause does the Republican Party presently serve? It has no meaningful policy agenda. It literally has no platform. The closest thing it has to a cause is justifying abuses of state power to own the libs and defending whatever Trump’s latest boorish or corrupt thought-fart happens to be. Imagine being a propagandist for a cause as impoverished as that. Many don’t need to imagine.&#8221;\n&#8220;The GOP does have a cause. The cause is consolidating power. Overturn the rigged elections, purge the disloyal bureaucrats, smash the corrupt institutions that stand in the way. Give the leader a free hand. It’s plain as day to those who are willing to see where this is going, what the highest ambitions of this personality cult are. Those who support it without insisting on reform should at least stop pretending that they’re voting for anything else.&#8221;\nAnd this is perfect: &#8220;Lastly, to those who spent the last seven years barking insults at me in the comments for not genuflecting to Trump, I’ll give you this: You’re not phonies. You believe what you say. We have that much in common. I respect honesty and paid you the respect of being honest. It would scandalize you to know how many of your heroes sound like you in public and like me in private. Audience capture has brought most of conservative media to ruin by making it predictable and shrill.&#8221;",

        "description": "WGN-TV\n    \n\n  He came thisclose. I have noted this here previously, but for this article I think it’s appropriate to mention again.\nFrom May 12, 1955 through September 1, 1972, Cubs pitchers threw five no-hitters (Sam Jones, Don Cardwell, Ken Holtzman — twice — and Burt Hooton). In addition, the Cubs had two no-hitters thrown against them in that time frame (Jim Maloney and Sandy Koufax, both in 1965).\nThat’s seven involving the Cubs in about a 17-year span. They seemed almost commonplace.\nThat leads us into the start made by Milt Pappas against the Padres at Wrigley Field September 2, 1972. The Cubs had gotten off to a terrible start that year (3-10), but slowly got back over .500, though not really close to contention. They defeated the Padres 14-3 at Wrigley Friday, September 1, but were still far out of first place, 11 games behind.\nPappas took the mound for the Saturday afternoon contest. The Padres, headed by future Cubs manager Don Zimmer, were 46-79, safely ensconced in last place in the NL West.\nThe Cubs scored a pair of runs in the first and two more in the third. Meanwhile, Pappas was mowing down Padres. He retired every Padre through eight, six by strikeout, five on fly balls, nine on ground balls and three via line drive. The Cubs plated four more in the bottom of the eighth to take an 8-0 lead.\nThree outs to go for a perfect game. At the time just seven perfect games had been thrown since the pitching mound had been moved to 60 feet, six inches from the plate in 1893.\nJohn Jeter (no relation to Derek) hit a line drive at Billy Williams in left. One out.\nFred Kendall grounded to short. Two out. One more out for immortality.\nAs was the case for any perfect game this far in progress back then, the pitcher’s spot came to the plate with two out in the ninth. Zimmer sent Larry Stahl up to pinch hit. Stahl ran the count full.\nThen this happened [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nBruce Froemming was the plate umpire. He was in his second MLB season. It was just the 72nd time he was behind the plate in the big leagues.\nBecause WGN was on the high-home shot at the time of that 3-2 pitch, whether it was actually a strike or not isn’t completely clear. \nFroemming called it ball four. \nPappas, to the day he passed away in 2016, insisted that was strike three and he should have had a perfect game (and would tell you so, often vehemently, if you met him in person). Froemming, when he’d speak about it, always said he called it properly.\nBut you know what, it’s also true that most MLB umpires in a situation like that would have given the call to Pappas. It’s not like the game result was in question — the Cubs led 8-0 at the time with two out and no one on base in the ninth and neither team was in playoff contention. Maybe Froemming didn’t feel confident enough to do that as a 33-year-old second-year umpire. Two of the other three umpires on the crew, Stan Landes and Augie Donatelli, were among the senior umpires in the National League at the time. Donatelli was in his 23rd season as an umpire. I feel certain that Landes or Donatelli would have given Pappas the call.\nIrony: Froemming, who umpired 37 MLB seasons, holds the record for most no-hitters called as a plate umpire, 11.\nThe video above shows that ball four call and how upset Pappas was with it, and also shows the following batter, Garry Jestadt (a former Cub!), who popped to Carmen Fanzone to give Pappas his no-hitter, which is obviously a fine accomplishment. But, like Armando Galarraga in 2010, Pappas should have had a perfect game.\nIt took 36 years for a Cub to throw a no-hitter again, Carlos Zambrano’s against the Astros in Milwaukee in 2008. Since then there have been four more Cubs no-nos: Jake Arrieta’s pair in 2015 and 2016, Alec Mills in 2020 and the combined no-hitter against the Dodgers in June 2021 at Dodger Stadium.\nI’m going to end this tale with a personal story. That week in 1972, my family was hosting some cousins visiting from England. We were going to take them to this game to show them what American baseball was like. But it rained all morning that day, and back then teams were much faster to postpone games. We didn’t think they’d play, so we didn’t go. I saw a no-hitter in 1984, Jack Morris’ against the White Sox, but it took me until Big Z’s in Milwaukee to see a Cub throw one.\nNo Cub has thrown a no-hitter at Wrigley Field since Pappas’ gem, which happened 50 years ago today, Saturday, September 2, 1972, witnessed by 11,144.",

        "description": "With the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. has finally put a substantial down payment toward the clean energy transition needed to address the climate crisis. But like a 30-year home mortgage, even a hefty down payment doesn’t settle the debt. Every month over the course of decades, you have to keep paying down that mortgage.\n\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act makes a hefty commitment of resources toward building clean energy, but unless we stop burning fossil fuels, our carbon debt will continue to grow. That’s why impending decisions about federal subsidies for fossil fuel-burning power plants are so important.\n\n\n\nA proposed combined-cycle gas power plant in Superior, Wisconsin, known as the Nemadji Trail Energy Center (NTEC), will be one of the first major climate decisions faced by President Biden after the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\n\n\nIf built, NTEC would emit up to 2.7 million tons of carbon dioxide equivalent every year, equal to putting over 500,000 new gas-powered cars on the road. It would be jointly owned by three utility companies: Dairyland Power Cooperative, Basin Electric Cooperative and Minnesota Power. Dairyland would own the largest piece of the plant and seeks hundreds of millions in federally subsidized loan money for its share.\n\n\n\nIn 2021, Biden ordered federal agencies to eliminate federal fossil fuel subsidies and prioritize implementation of clean energy. Nonetheless, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) Rural Utilities Service loan program is considering loaning hundreds of millions of dollars to build this new fossil fuel power plant. A flawed Trump administration analysis completely ignored its climate impacts. Fortunately, USDA has agreed that a new environmental study must address the plant’s projected climate impacts before deciding whether to greenlight the loan. Now that the results are in, it should go further and reject the federally backed loan altogether.\n\n\n\nSix years ago, when NTEC was first proposed, the industry notion that gas power plants were a necessary “bridge” to renewable energy was widespread. Since then, the cost of wind and solar power has plummeted, battery storage has become affordable and feasible, and our scientific understanding of the urgency of the climate crisis has grown. We do not have time or resources to waste on 30-year commitments to fossil fuels, especially when better and less expensive alternatives are ready to be deployed.\n\n\n\nNTEC is an unnecessary and expensive proposal that makes even less sense now than it did when it was originally proposed in 2016. Recent regulatory filings by Dairyland and Minnesota Power show that neither utility has electricity demands that justify spending $700 million to build this plant.Using the same models as the power companies, clean energy advocates have repeatedly shown that power demands can be met with solar and wind energy and battery storage while saving money for ratepayers.\n\n\n\nIn August, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) weighed in on the NTEC proposal. It found that using the “social cost of carbon” that assigns monetary costs to carbon pollution, NTEC would cause $2.15 billion in climate damage in the first 15 years of operation. Noting the international scientific consensus that “we have less than a decade to transition from fossil fuel to clean energy” in order to avoid the worst impacts of climate change, the EPA called for significant changes to the proposed power plant and additional environmental study.\n\n\n\nThe Rural Utilities Service loan program is a valuable and important function of the USDA and has funded a host of clean energy projects over the past decade. These loans should be targeted at building out a 21st-century electric grid for rural communities. It makes no sense to spend billions to clean up our energy system while continuing to fund climate-polluting projects that make the problem worse. NTEC is expensive, unnecessary and would shatter the commitments to shift from fossil fuels to clean, renewable energy made by Biden and Agricultural Secretary Tom Vilsack.\n\n\n\nAt the 2021 international climate conference, Vilsack was clear and direct. Climate change “is not a future threat; it’s here … We cannot continue on this dire trajectory.” These words echoed those of Biden, who said upon taking office, “In my view, we’ve already waited too long to deal with this climate crisis, and we can’t wait any longer. We see it with our own eyes, we feel it, we know it in our bones, and it’s time to act.”\n\n\n\nThese words are appropriately urgent. Now it’s up to Vilsack and Biden to heed them and deny a federal subsidy for the NTEC gas power plant.\n\n\n\nAaron Klemz is chief strategy fficer for the Minnesota Center for Environmental Advocacy (MCEA), a nonpartisan and nonprofit organization with offices in Duluth and St. Paul, Minnesota. MCEA has lobbied against the federal loan for NTEC and opposed NTEC at the Minnesota Utilities Commission and in state court. &nbsp;",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe proliferation of online misinformation pertaining to elections has been top of mind for some social media companies in the wake of the 2016 presidential election.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn an effort to determine what type of YouTube content is fed to those skeptical of the 2020 election outcome, researchers conducted a study on over 300 Americans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFindings showed those more skeptical of the election results were fed more election-fraud content, potentially perpetuating false beliefs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTailoring algorithms to user interests is a common practice among social media companies. But new research underscores the harms this practice can yield, especially when it comes to public perception of election legitimacy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA study conducted by researchers at New York University found YouTube was more likely to direct videos on election-fraud to those skeptical of 2020 election results compared with those less skeptical. Researchers say this practice may perpetuate existing misconceptions.\n\n\n\nThose who were most skeptical of the presidential election outcome were shown up to three times as many videos on election-fraud in their feeds, compared with those least skeptical of the outcomes. This accounted for about eight additional recommendations out of 400 in total.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Narratives of fraud and conspiracy theories proliferated over the fall of 2020, finding fertile ground across online social networks, although little is known about the extent and drivers of this spread,” authors wrote.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo better understand the association, researchers sampled over 300 Americans with YouTube accounts in November and December 2020, who were then surveyed about their level of concern regarding the legitimacy of the presidential election.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA browser extension was installed to record the amount and content of recommended videos displayed to users. Users were instructed to click on a randomly assigned “seed” video then on one recommendation following the video, according to a randomly assigned rule. This way, researchers could isolate the algorithm’s influence on users in real time. For example, some participants were assigned to always click on the second video displayed in recommendations.\n\n\n\nDespite the overall low prevalence of election-fraud videos displayed in the study, “Our findings uncover the detrimental consequences of recommendation algorithms and cast doubt on the view that online information environments are solely determined by user choice,” said co-author James Bisbee, an assistant professor at Vanderbilt University, in a statement.\n\n\n\nDisplaying election-fraud content to those most concerned about the election’s legitimacy is one way misinformation, disinformation, and conspiracy theories can reach those most likely to believe the false claims, researchers explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Many believe that automated recommendation algorithms have little influence on online ‘echo chambers’ in which users only see content that reaffirms their preexisting views,” Bisbee continued.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, results of the current study highlight “the need for further investigation into how opaque recommendation algorithms operate on an issue-by-issue basis.\"\n\n\n\nWith campaigning for the 2022 midterm elections in full swing, many social media companies are working to mitigate the spread of misinformation that plagued previous election cycles.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYouTube recently announced new policies aimed at addressing election-related misinformation that will add context to any midterm-related videos in both Spanish and English.",

Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology,” he said. “But there’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans.

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;Some autism-linked syndromes are associated with seizures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers are testing a new drug that may help reduce the frequency of convulsive and drop seizures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe experimental drug will need to go through larger clinical trials to test for efficacy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new drug candidate shows promise in reducing seizures in children with epilepsy linked to autism, according to a study published in Epilepsia.  \n\n\n\nThe drug, called soticlestat, has completed phase 2 clinical trials. It must complete phase 3 trials before being approved for use. \n\n\n\nThe drug was tested in children who have Dravet syndrome (DS) or Lennox–Gastaut syndrome (LGS), which are considered developmental and epileptic encephalopathies or brain disease. The phase 2 clinical trial was conducted as a randomized controlled trial, with half of the participants receiving a placebo.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe children in the study were aged 2 to 17 and had three or more convulsive seizures per month with DS and four or more drop seizures per month with LGS. A convulsive seizure is defined as “rhythmic convulsions that last less than 5 minutes,” and a drop seizure, also called an atonic seizure, is defined as a seizure that results in sudden loss of muscle strength.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmong the 129 participants who completed the trials, median reduction in seizures was about 30 percent. For patients with DS, the median reduction was about 50 percent. And for patients with LGS, the median reduction was about 17 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s still early days for this drug. It will need to go through larger trials with more participants to further show its effectiveness and safety. Experts are hopeful though, since the participants seemed to benefit from it and the drug was well tolerated.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is important because in these patients, new treatments often impose a large burden of adverse effects that can worsen quality of life in spite of a reduction in seizure frequency,” Emilio Perucca, a clinical professor of medicine at Austin Health at the University of Melbourne in Australia who did not participate in the study, told Spectrum. ",

White House on Friday defended the presence of U.S. Marines at President Biden’s speech in Philadelphia the previous evening, arguing their positioning during the prime-time speech was to demonstrate the president's respect for service members.\n\n\n\n“The presence of the Marines at the speech was intended to demonstrate the deep and abiding respect the president has for these service members to these ideals and the unique role our independent military plays in defending our democracy no matter which party is in power,” White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters.\n\n\n\nMarines were stationed behind the president as he spoke on Thursday, drawing scrutiny over the use of the military during a speech&nbsp;centered around blasting former President Trump and warning that the former president and Republicans aligned with him are \"a threat to this country.\" \n\n\n\n“Whatever you think of this speech, the military is supposed to be apolitical. Positioning Marines in uniform behind President Biden for a political speech flies in the face of that. It’s wrong when Democrats do it. It’s wrong when Republicans do it,” tweeted CNN anchor Brianna Keilar, whose husband is in the military.\n\n\n\nWhite House officials have pushed back against criticism that the speech was overly political in nature.\n\n\n\n“The president gave an important speech last night, a critical speech at an inflection point, and our democracy, our values, our values that our men and women who protect us every day and fight for every day believe in as well,” Jean-Pierre said Friday.\n\n\n\nThe White House spokeswoman maintained that \"it’s not abnormal\" to have military members during presidential speeches, pointing to Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush as previous presidents who also had service members on hand for speeches.\n\n\n\n“It is not abnormal, it is actually normal, for presidents from either side of the aisle to give speeches in front of members of the military,” she said. “It is not an unusual sight, it is not an unusual event to have happened.”\n\n\n\nJean-Pierre reiterated the White House's argument that Biden was simply recognizing the urgency of the issue in his remarks.\n\n\n\n“Standing up for democracy is not political,” she said Friday.",

Ricard was later told by a classmate the student’s preferred pronouns were “he/him.” According to the complaint, the student never directly asked Ricard to call the student by a name or pronouns different from the student’s enrollment records. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRicard, who had been a teacher with Geary County School District since 2005, addressed the student as “Miss (legal/enrolled last name)” in an attempt to respect the student without compromising her own religious beliefs. \n\n\n\nWhile neither the school nor the district had a formal policy on preferred names and pronouns at the time, Ricard was suspended and reprimanded under policies related to diversity and inclusion and the bullying of students by staff. \n\n\n\nThe district’s Board of Education months later approved a policy requiring staff to use students’ preferred names and pronouns and also denied Ricard’s request for a religious exception. The policy also required teachers to conceal a student’s name and pronouns preference by using only legal names when speaking with parents unless the student allowed them to do so. The district argued the policy was intended to prevent discrimination and harassment and promote inclusivity. \n\n\n\nRicard filed a federal lawsuit against the school district in March. The lawsuit claimed the district’s policy mandating Ricard to use language conflicting with the student’s biological sex, and to withhold a student’s name and pronoun preferences from parents violated her religious beliefs and First Amendment rights.\n\n\n\nA U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas in May allowed Ricard’s lawsuit to move forward after finding “she was likely to prevail on her First Amendment free exercise of religion,” according to her attorneys. The court also granted a motion to stop enforcement of the policy. After the court’s ruling, the school board voted to revoke the policy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFort Riley Middle School officials agreed to pay $95,000 in damages and attorneys’ fees to settle the case.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“No school district should ever force teachers to willfully deceive parents or engage in any speech that violates their deeply held religious beliefs,” Tyson Langhofer, Ricard’s attorney and senior counsel with Alliance Defending Freedom, said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’re pleased to settle this case favorably on behalf of Pam, and we hope that it will encourage school districts across the country to support the constitutionally protected freedom of teachers to teach and communicate honestly with both children and parents,” Longhofer added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe school district did not immediately respond to Changing America’s request for comment.&nbsp;",

The point being made in this fairly technical post is that \"your NFT should point at a thing, not point at a location.\" What that means, in practice, is that the record shouldn't point to a URL or an internet address, because these can (and often do) change. Instead, it should reference the digital hash of the resource, a content-based address produced using a cryptographic algorithm. Such resources can be uploaded and stored using a distributed network such as the interplanetary file system (IPFS). Via Boris Mann.\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

        "description": "Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The battle for last in the AL Central will be decided in September. Part of the unbalanced schedule that makes for some potentially boring Septembers is when you have a battle between the clear bottom two teams in the division three different times over the last month. This is the first of those three matchups as the Royals have 30 games left and the Tigers 31. For now, the Royals are holding off the Tigers, but this could go down to the wire for who is the worst in the division. The Tigers are definitely more disappointing. Not only did they spend real money this winter to help supplement their roster of young talent, but they’ve also not gotten what’s been expected of the young talent. Spencer Torkelson had to be sent to AAA after he couldn’t get it going and while he’s been better of late, he hasn’t even been good in the minors, though he is up now with September callups. Casey Mize is out for the year, Tarik Skubal was good but has had to be shut down. Riley Greene has been okay but more was expected than what he’s shown. It’s been a nightmare season for the Tigers that they’re just waiting for the end of to be able to turn the page. \n\n\n\n\nRoyals vs. Tigers Projected Pitching Matchups\n\nDaniel Lynch had a very nice stretch of pitching that culminated with five shutout innings against the high-powered Dodgers offense. Since then, it’s been uneven at best. He had a start against the Twins where he looked fantastic in his final couple of innings but was hit around before that. He didn’t strike out a single battera against the White Sox and, even though he was spotted four runs in the first, couldn’t get through the fifth. And then in his last start, the Padres hit him around in the second and third, but his final two innings looked like the top of the rotation starter many believed (and some still do) that he could turn into. So which Lynch do we see? It’s hard to know. He’s pitching against a struggling offense, so that probably helps him some, but Mike Matheny has mentioned multiple times that he feels like maybe Lynch is starting to tire down the stretch. The encouraging notes from his last start are that he got double digit swings and misses for the first time in four starts and he struck out six while walking just one. Since July 11, Lynch has a 7.3 percent walk rate. If he can just get more consistent with the swing and miss, there might be something there. He did mention that he fixed his slider grip before his last start, so that’s a pitch to watch in this one. \n\nCareer vs. DET: 3 GS, 14.2 IP, 1-1, 3.07 ERA\nDrew Hutchison has seen some things in his career, including in his big league debut against the team he’ll face in this one. He didn’t fare very well, but he at least provided some innings to the Blue Jays for a couple of seasons before he struggled to stay healthy. He reemerged in the big leagues with the Tigers last year and now with all of their injuries, he’s starting games for them. The results have been good. The peripherals are a bit less encouraging, but he does limit home runs at least. He has an ordinary fastball that averages 91-94 and gets hit. His slider is pretty good and even when he makes a mistake on it, it’s not in a spot that hitters can typically drive. His sinker has gotten a good number of grounders, but his changeup has been crushed, so that’s a pitch to look for. It’s probably why lefties have an OPS of more than 200 points higher against him than righties do. And he has times through the order splits that are pretty much by the book. He’s solid the first time, a little easier to hit the second time and then it’s bombs away when the lineup turns over for a third time. Keep that in mind if the Royals have no runs on one hit or something the first time through the order against him.\nCareer vs. KC: 5 G, 3 GS, 23.0 IP, 2-1, 4.70 ERA\n\nJonathan Heasley did not throw up during his last start, so that’s the first plus. He also struck out seven and walked two in five innings, which should also be considered a positive. He gave up some runs, though it was a weird game that ended with the Royals putting 15 on the board, so it was obviously a good day to hit. Still, it just feels like there should be more in there for him, but maybe that’s not right. His fastball continues to be pretty pedestrian. Unless it’s up in the zone or just above it. When he locates it right, he’s allowed a .208 average and .292 SLG. Literally anywhere else and the average is .263 with the slugging percentage at .606. It’s a small sample but it jives with everything we heard about him in the minors. And even with that tidbit, he needs to be using his slider more. It’s a legitimate weapon. \n\nCareer vs. DET: 1 GS, 5.1 IP, 0-0, 0.00 ERA\nThe Tigers are planning to activate Michael Pineda from his third IL stint of the season to make this start. It’s actually his second first start off the IL against the Royals this season, which is fun for him. Because of all the injury issues, he hasn’t given the Tigers much, but when he’s on the mound he has done a nice job of limiting walks. But that’s about all he’s done well. An issue with Pineda is that as his fastball has continued to decline, he remains steadfast in his urge to use it. He throws it about 60 percent of the time but opponents are hitting .330 with a .633 SLG on it. He can get some swings and misses with his slider and it’s been a good pitch, but his changeup has been almost as bad. I wonder if throwing the slider more might lead it to regress as well, which puts him in a position of maybe just being…done. He has been much better at home with a .728 OPS allowed compared to 1.153 on the road (no, that’s not a typo) and this game is at home for him, so he has that going for him, which is nice.\nCareer vs. KC: 15 GS, 88.2 IP, 7-8, 3.96 ERA\n\nIn a way, I’m sort of glad Brady Singer unraveled on Tuesday night against the White Sox. It was easier to swallow because the Royals offense picked him up for once, but it allows the opportunity to see how he responds. We saw him not have much against the White Sox a few weeks ago and gut it out to go six. But we haven’t had many chances to see how he responds to bad results. He struggled against Houston in June and came out the next start and was just okay. The last time he failed to go five innings, he responded with nine straight starts of six innings or more. So he’s passed the tests so far, but it’ll be nice to see how he responds to this. As much as we don’t want to see failure, it’s a great test. My one concern with Singer is that he is showing some signs of fatigue with where he’s missing on his sinker, but even so, this is a good lineup to get back on track against. Weirdly enough, he’s walked just 30 batters this year and eight of them are Tigers in two starts against them, so they seem to have the idea that patience is the answer, which has also led to him notching two of his eight highest called strike numbers in a game this year. So it goes both ways.\n\nCareer vs. DET: 9 GS, 48.1 IP, 5-0, 2.79 ERA\nBefore Mize and Skubal, there was Matt Manning. The Tigers picked him in the first round of the 2016 draft and he was pretty much good right away. But after a great season in 2019 and not pitching in 2020, Manning came back last year with some rough numbers. He struggled in both AAA and the majors, but he came back this year and has looked better. He left his second start of the year (against the Royals actually) with an injury and then had a setback during his rehab stint, but is finally back now. He pitched well in his first six starts back before hitting a bump in the road his last time out, lasting just 2.1 innings and allowing seven runs. To be honest, I’m not really sure how he can remain successful because every time I watch him pitch, I wonder how he’s not getting hit hard. His fastball location just feels very hittable, yet opponents are hitting just .231 with a .256 SLG. His slider can be nasty, but he hangs it way too often, which is why it gets hit when there’s actually contact made. He also throws a curve, sinker and occasional changeup and while you can see flashes, it just isn’t an especially visually impressive arsenal. There’s also the little matter of his numbers with RISP being unsustainable. He’s allowed a .182/.184/.182 line in those situations compared with .267/.320/.467 with nobody on. That will even out. Whether it’s in this one or not remains to be seen, but that split won’t stay the same the rest of the year. \nCareer vs. KC: 1 GS, 2.0 IP, 0-0, 4.50 ERA\nRoyals vs. Tigers Prediction\nI think the Tigers are circling the drain, but may get up for a series against a similarly bad team. I just like the pitching matchups for the Royals, though, and the chance for the Royals offense to score some runs against what the Tigers are throwing out there, so I’m going to predict the Royals take the series, but don’t sweep.",

        "link": "https://buckscountybeacon.com/2022/09/mastriano-tries-to-escape-extremist-label-while-calling-attack-on-the-capitol-distant-suing-jan-6-committee/",
        "description": "Pennsylvania’s Republican gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano believes the violent attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, “distant” and “detached from reality.” Appearing on conservative talk radio station News Talk 103.7 FM on August 10, Mastriano also denounced the House Select Committee’s investigation into the Jan. 6 insurrection and discussed his brief virtual appearance before the committee, explaining why he decided to cut the interview short.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state senator told co-hosts Michele Jansen and Pat Ryan that he refused to be interviewed by the committee unless he was allowed to record it for “transparency.” When it became clear that only the committee would be recording the interview, which the committee had already confirmed, he ended it after a mere 15 minutes and refused to cooperate any further. Now, Mastriano is suing the Jan. 6 committee for its “improper makeup,” asking for a judge to rule that the committee can’t compel him to sit for a deposition. He is also requesting that the panel pay his attorney’s fees.\n\n\n\nMastriano, who has been identified by the Jan. 6 committee as a key figure in the insurrection, was being interviewed about his own role in the planning and execution of the attack. Mastriano was spotted marching outside of the Capitol on the day of the insurrection and even breached police barricade lines, according to video footage obtained by the committee. In addition to supporting and repeating former President Donald Trump’s election lies, Mastriano spent thousands of dollars on transportation to help shuttle Trump supporters from Pennsylvania to Washington, D.C., on the day in question and was in regular communication with the former president at the time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nA Pizzagate believer. An Oath Keeper. Self-proclaimed prophets who talk to God and say Nancy Pelosi drinks baby blood. The &#39;brains&#39; behind Trump&#39;s Big LieMy guide to Doug Mastriano World &#8212; a rogue&#39;s gallery like Pennsylvania has never seen before https://t.co/TvfD2qJrtZ&mdash; Will Bunch (@Will_Bunch) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\n\nSince then, he has continued to repeat Trump’s baseless conspiracies about widespread voter fraud and announced his intention to decertify every voting machine in the state if elected governor. Mastriano also admitted that he would force every registered voter in Pennsylvania to re-register, which is not only burdensome but could also violate federal law. As a result, the House committee subpoenaed him back in February, which he promptly denied. Instead of a deposition, Mastriano agreed to a voluntary interview and produced a few documents relating to the investigation, one of which revealed that he used campaign funds to pay for the buses he used to bring people to the Capitol. Mastriano ultimately failed to complete the interview, however, which had already been put off for months.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring his guest appearance on News Talk, Mastriano went on to criticize the FBI’s search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property, which resulted in the recovery of hundreds of classified documents, saying that both the FBI and Department of Justice have “gone too far” and are now both essentially “a tool of the Democratic Party to go after their political enemies.” When asked if he’s encountered any pushback for his extremist views or if he’s been confronted by people at his rallies who have a problem with his election denialism or ties to the insurrection, Mastriano said, “That is just so — it&#8217;s so distant. It’s detached from reality.”\n\n\n\nREAD:Doug Mastriano Is A Clear And Present Danger To Democracy\n\n\n\nSeeming to agree with him, Ryan interjected, claiming that the Capitol attack is “distant in our reality, but it’s a TV show with former [Senator] Liz Cheney. She’ll be done with a gig in a couple of days now.”\n\n\n\n“It’s not part of the reality of the campaign trail,” Mastriano responded, boldly claiming that he’s had more Democrats show up to his rallies in support of him than not. He also condemned criticism from Democratic opponent Josh Shapiro that he’s “too extreme” for Pennsylvania, claiming that it is actually Shapiro who is “the extremist.” Shapiro is currently ahead in the race for governor, according to polling obtained by FiveThirtyEight.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpouting off a list of perceived grievances about his opponent, Mastriano chastised Shapiro’s support for trans kids, falsely asserted that he wants to defund the police, and repeated a misleading claim that he sued a group of nuns. “This guy’s the extremist,” Mastriano said. “The reality is we’re just on the side of freedom and on the right side of history here.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nREAD: Doug Mastriano’s Disdain For The Press Is A Threat To Democracy\n\n\n\nFollowing this theme, Mastriano also made a fuss about the Pennsylvania Department of Education’s recent inclusion of educational resources about gender identity after being asked by Jansen for his opinion on the matter. Leaving no room for interpretation, he voiced his support for parents’ rights, arguing that parents “should be in power and driving this,” not “radical” teachers who want to push “gender confusion” and have students “pick their pronouns” in class. Mastriano also took the opportunity to go after Shapiro once again, falsely claiming that both he and Gov. Tom Wolf want children to be “sexualized” in the classroom. “If you want our schools to turn into a decaying system of indoctrinating your kids, then Josh Shapiro is your man,” he said.\n\n\n\n\nMastriano Accuses Elementary School Teachers of Showing Students Porn, Pushing Them To Be Transgender | The QAnon-friendly #Pennsylvania Republican gubernatorial candidate&#39;s “vicious &amp; dangerous lies,” as the @PSEA calls them, could get a teacher killed.https://t.co/hIPzmbsztc&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) August 30, 2022\n\n\n\n\nMastriano has a long history of espousing hateful and extremist rhetoric, having recently denounced bans on anti-LGBTQ conversion therapy, defending the harmful practice and referring to queer and trans children as “confused.” In addition, a photo of Mastriano wearing a Confederate military uniform recently resurfaced, sparking public outrage. The photo, which was obtained by Reuters, shows him posing in the uniform with his fellow faculty members at the Army War College during the 2013-2014 semester. The faculty were reportedly given the option to dress as historical figures, but Mastriano is the only one wearing a Confederate uniform.\n\n\n\nMastriano has also been immersed in a number of other controversies this summer, repeating anti-semtiic conspiracies about George Soros and eliciting outcry over his ties to white Christian Nationalism and the far-right social media site Gab. While his extremism may work well among his base, however, not everyone in his party is on board. In fact, some of his latest scandals have even cost him endorsements. As a result, his campaign has taken steps to try to soften his image by having him avoid talking about abortion. Up until recently, abortion has been a key issue of his campaign, but his strict stance on the issue is not in line with public opinion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nREAD: Pastors For Doug Mastriano? Somebody Call The IRS\n\n\n\nIn fact, a recent poll from Franklin &amp; Marshall College revealed that support for abortion in Pennslylvania has reached an all-time high, with the majority of registered voters agreeing that it should be legal under most circumstances. Mastriano, on the other hand, has made it clear that he thinks abortion should be completely illegal, with no exceptions for rape, incest, or medical emergencies, and supports criminal penalties for abortion providers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n#PA &quot;People need to understand the Christian right and start organizing against it, otherwise the state (and country) may be unrecognizable in four years.&quot; https://t.co/sUiPKRB5iZ&mdash; Jenny Stephens (@JennyStephens52) July 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThat being said, Mastriano is by no means shying away from his radical roots. If anything, he’s attempting to soften his image not by changing his positions, but by rejecting his label as an “extremist” candidate and projecting it on to his rivals.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMuch like he did during his News Talk interview, Mastriano is working to escape this branding by pointing the finger at Josh Shapiro and the Democratic Party, calling them extreme for supporting abortion rights, trans rights, and COVID-19 health and safety measures, and for not entertaining Trump’s baseless election conspiraces. “I’m going to show you who the real extremist is in this race, and it’s not me and it’s not us,” Mastriano said during a recent campaign stop in Rochester.\n\n\n\nIt’s not?",

A direct accusation of rape followed, for which Hammer was investigated but not charged. Three-part documentary series House of Hammer recaps this sorry story then goes further, showing the disgraced actor to be the product of extraordinarily toxic privilege, and pitching his downfall as a battle for the ages: the corrosive influence of old money versus the untameable power of new media.

        "description": "The visual splendour of this rich, gorgeous Tolkien drama will make you gawp throughout. Watch it on the largest TV you canThe Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power (Prime Video) is likely to prove divisive, not least depending on whether you watch it on a big TV or squint at its splendour on a phone or laptop. It is so rich and gorgeous that it is easy to spend the first episode simply gawping at the landscapes, as it swoops and swooshes between the lands of elves and dwarves, humans and harfoots. This is TV that is made for big screens, although surely destined to be watched on smaller ones. It is so cinematic and grand that it makes House of the Dragon look as if it has been cobbled together on Minecraft.This makes it difficult to judge The Rings of Power as an ordinary series, because so much about it is extraordinary. It is Tolkien, which means this world is already venerated and beloved by so many, whether in the form of the books, Peter Jackson’s films or both. There is an extraordinary weight of expectation before any viewer presses play. Add to that the fact that this is reportedly the most expensive TV series ever made – $465m for eight episodes – and it is tough to view this as just another show. It is an event, a spectacle, but if it isn’t entirely perfect, does that make it a failure? Continue reading...",

        "description": "My jaw is hanging open in disbelief! For once, we are not being demonised, dehumanised or told we don’t existI’m an atheist but I’m pretty sure I just witnessed a miracle, thanks to the Palestinian-American comic Mo Amer. His new semi-autobiographical Netflix sitcom Mo is hilarious and, no matter your background, I guarantee you’ll find a lot of it relatable. If you are of Palestinian heritage, as I am, however, Mo is far more than just a laugh: it’s a groundbreaking piece of television.Palestine is not exactly a major theme in popular culture. If you do hear the P-word on TV it’s usually during the news and it’s normally nothing positive. It’s the same for Arabs in general, of course. If we are on the telly, we’re usually terrorists. And, if we’re not being demonised, we tend to be the punchline – not the people delivering the punchline. Palestinians, however, are dehumanised on a whole other level. You can’t even say the P-word without it causing problems: an anchor on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation once had to apologise for using the word Palestine (instead of “Palestinian territories”), for God’s sake. Being Palestinian means constantly being told you don’t exist or being accused by certain pro-Israel voices of being antisemitic simply because you assert that you do exist. I have written only a handful of articles about being Palestinian; every time I file one I have anxiety attacks for days because of the inevitable character assassinations and online trolling that occur after publication.

        "description": "Carell faces off against a conflicted serial killer, played by Domhnall Gleeson, in a hit-and-miss drama that tries to combine a suspense thriller and a character studyWith less commercially mandated restrictions to the length of most TV episodes thanks to the streaming swell, writers have taken full advantage, going rogue for better or worse. It’s led to seasons that expand and constrict by the episode, less pressure to streamline storylines to the most advertiser-friendly format, allowing for freedom yet also indulgence. How many hourlong Netflix seasons have felt needlessly, painfully bloated yet how many shows have benefited from putting story over Skittles ads?There were many reasons why the first season of Sam Esmail’s sleek Amazon thriller Homecoming was the finest of that year – an on-form Julia Roberts, stylish and surprising direction, that brilliantly borrowed score – but key to its success was the rare decision, for a drama, to make each episode around 30 minutes long. It was tight and unexpected at a time when so many shows were anything but, yet since then only a handful of other dramas have opted for something similar. In FX and Hulu’s 10-part thriller The Patient, The Americans’ writers Joel Fields and Joe Weisberg, keep their episodes as short as 21 minutes and, for the finale, as long as 46, a decision that works until it doesn’t, when intrigue starts morphing into frustration.

Selling Sunset was – still is, in fact, as it’s now in its fifth Netflix season and has been renewed for a sixth and seventh – a reality TV show set in the glitzy LA offices of high end real estate brokerage firm the Oppenheim Group, owned and run by twins Brett and Jason who have the looks and vibes that suggest worryingly close genetic ties to Voldemort.

        "description": "This gripping series follows Reynolds and Rob McElhenney’s takeover of Wales’ oldest club, but the real stars of its zippy episodes are the localsWelcome to Wrexham (Disney+) tells the story of how Ryan Reynolds and Rob McElhenney, internet friends and Hollywood stars with seemingly little knowledge of football – but a clear enthusiasm for sport in general – bought Wrexham AFC in early 2021. With their goal of getting Wrexham – the oldest club in Wales and the third-oldest continually operating professional team in the world – promoted from the fifth tier of English football, the series has the hallmarks of a fish-out-of-water documentary, a Ted Lasso in real life, but it turns out to be a more soulful series than that, once it gets over its bumpy landing.Based on the opener of the 18 zippy episodes (five of which were available for preview), I had low hopes. It places much of its early focus on McElhenney and his English colleague Humphrey Ker, a comedian, screenwriter and actor turned “Rob and Ryan’s guy” at the club. There is only a smattering of Reynolds, who is more camera-shy than might be expected. McElhenney, who admits he needed “superhero-movie-star money” to buy the club, appears to be the driving force behind the deal. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Moonlight’s Trevante Rhodes is the best thing about a patchy new series that attempts to dissect a difficult figureHulu’s new eight-part biographical drama Mike does not shy away from the uglier aspects of the Mike Tyson story. That has to be one reason why the heavyweight champion, American icon, and convicted sex offender has so loudly denounced the project: in covering 40 years of triumphs in the ring and transgressions committed outside of it, this flashy mini-series avoids the flattering hagiography that often characterizes officially authorized accounts. What it doesn’t avoid, however, is Hollywood’s prevailing weakness for conforming eventful, messy lives to a dramatic blueprint. Even at twice the length of the average big-screen biopic, Mike falls into the common trap of playing connect the bullet points of its subject’s Wikipedia page – of reducing a complicated life story to an alternating series of hills and valleys.For as much as Tyson may object to someone else telling his story without his input, Mike leans heavily on his first-hand reflections. The framing device of the series, after all, is his one-man Broadway show, the dubiously titled Undisputed Truth, re-enacted here through scenes of a fortysomething Tyson (Trevante Rhodes) wandering a stage, snippets of his monologue triggering flashbacks. It’s all rather “Dewey Cox has to think about his entire life before he plays”. Continue reading...",

For an hour, it rattles through everything that made its predecessor, Game of Thrones, such a titan of the small screen, especially when it was in its prime. It is a greatest hits playlist of Westeros at its meatiest. Family members make promises they cannot keep as they connive and betray each other, in secret and in plain sight. There is jousting, romping and fighting. There are dragons, of course. There is a drunken orgy, an axe to the face, a caesarean without anaesthetic, seeping wounds, severed limbs and severed organs, too. George RR Martin’s world struts its way back on to our screens with utter confidence and brio.It is as captivating as it is gruesome. A prequel to Game of Thrones, it begins 172 years before the birth of Daenerys Targaryen, and it chronicles the fall of the Targaryen dynasty, though after watching the first six episodes of squabbling and scheming, the real question is how it can possibly take two centuries to collapse. It opens with the Lear-esque prospect of a failing king choosing his heir, and though the people shift slightly over the course of the series, succession is the thread that keeps it all together.

They talk about quitting banking themselves – and spilling the beansThe 10 best TV dramas coming this autumnIn the first lockdown, the nation was seemingly united in its obsession with the BBC’s adaptation of Sally Rooney’s novel Normal People. But in the second, things were a bit more fuzzy, culturally speaking, unless, that is, you were one of those who watched Industry, in which case the dark November of 2020 was punctuated by some pretty indelible television. OK, so its characters were all monsters, cruel and lewd and venal; its acronym-strewn dialogue was frequently impenetrable, its sex scenes invariably on the wrong side of #MeToo and its plot enigmatic (set on the trading floor of a City investment bank, much of the so-called action involved people staring dully for minutes at a time at the blue light of their screens). And yet, those of us who loved it could hardly wait for each episode to begin. Unaccountably thrilling and utterly addictive, it was, I thought at the time, the bastard child of This Life and early Neil LaBute – and what’s not to like about that?Konrad Kay, who co-wrote Industry with his old friend, Mickey Down, laughs (we’re in a studio in deepest north London, where both men are visibly relieved the agony of posing for a photographer is now over). “Yeah,” he says. “Someone else called it Tory Skins, which is good, too.” But in the end, comparisons, however flattering or neat, may be redundant. Not only does Industry stand at an unlikely angle to almost everything else on TV right now, which may be one reason why it remains, in his words, “a bit cultish”, but the long-awaited second series, which will be screened in the UK next month, comes with a lot more… texture than the first.

        "description": "As The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power comes to TV, its young cast talk about replacing Cate Blanchett, being the saga’s first Black main character, and going to the pub in prostheticsIf there’s one thing we know about The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, it’s that this eight-part series is big. Filmed in New Zealand and on a rumoured budget of $1bn for seasons one and two, the show sports massive battle sequences, hordes of marauding monsters and special effects that will make Peter Jackson’s films of JRR Tolkien’s trilogy look like DIY fringe theatre.But for all its monumental scale, Rings of Power is still a story about characters: from haughty elves to ale-swilling men, from thatch-bearded dwarves to a new race of eco-friendly proto-Hobbits called Harfoots. The cast that showrunners JD Payne and Patrick McKay have assembled is remarkable: a lineup that is short on bankable names (unless you count Lenny Henry) but huge on talent and promise, from indie movie mavens to theatrical darlings, from dashing former child actors to (at least) one alumnus of that other fantasy franchise, Game of Thrones.

He talks the reality of seeking US citizenship, his father’s death – and growing up near Beyoncé‘Just pretend you and I are in a barbershop”, says the Palestinian American comedian Mo Amer. We’re talking on a video call, amid the sound of intricate scissor work and the occasional buzz of clippers, as he has his hair and beard trimmed in preparation for press interviews for his new film, Black Adam. He’s in the US, while I’m in Amsterdam. “You’re in one of my favourite cities in the world!” he says, before launching into tales of his standup adventures in the city.This is what it’s like to speak to Amer. He is best known for two Netflix standup specials in which he delivers sharp routines on the intricacies of hummus preparation, the perils of travelling with refugee papers and the intensity of Arabic swear words. In person, there is a charming authenticity to him, a desire to turn every conversational twist into a way to establish a genuine connection. His persona as a performer makes this less than surprising – particularly when you see his new Netflix sitcom Mo. Its approach to honesty and connection doesn’t exactly see Amer maintaining a standoff-ish distance from his audience. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Music is the messenger of the soul. It creates the soundtrack of our lives, reminding us of those signal moments — a first kiss, a wedding dance, a memory of a loved one — that make life so rich and complete. And it is the performers who create music who speak to us most deeply, healing our hurt at vulnerable times and inspiring us to greater heights when we face formidable obstacles. As we pay tribute to the contributions of our nation’s workers this Labor Day, including its musicians, it’s time to also ensure they receive the basic, fair compensation they are due.\n\n\n\nPaying our workers for their labor is a bedrock American principle. Few would argue that the performers whose art so influences our daily lives shouldn’t be compensated for their hard work to create that art — but that is exactly what happens every day on AM/FM radio. An antiquated loophole allows radio stations to play music while only compensating the songwriter, but not the artists who perform the songs. This injustice has prevented artists from taking home the compensation they deserve for decades.\n\n\n\nEven stranger, terrestrial radio are the only ones who get away with not paying for their product. Increasingly popular streaming services like Spotify and Pandora and digital platforms like YouTube and TikTok all compensate artists when their music is played. Meanwhile, AM/FM radio stations collect more than $10 billion a year from selling advertisements — but refuse to share a single dime of those profits with the artists whose work is the reason that listeners tune in to radio to begin with.\n\n\n\nThe American Music Fairness Act — which is currently progressing through the House of Representatives, with a companion bill poised for introduction in the Senate — would finally right this wrong. The AMFA would create a fair market for music performance royalties by closing the loophole and requiring big corporate broadcasters to pay artists when their songs are played on AM/FM stations.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, this legislation compensates artists while also protecting small, local broadcasters. It allows local stations generating less than $1.5 million in annual revenue, with parent companies generating less than $10 million in annual receipts, to play unlimited music for only $500 per year — less than $2 per day. Qualified public, college, and other noncommercial stations would pay only $100 a year, and the smallest stations — those with less than $100,000 in annual revenues — would pay just $10 a year.\n\n\n\nSo who would be required to pay full freight? Those who can definitely afford to pay: the more than 2,000 radio stations that are owned by the six largest corporate broadcasters, such as iHeartRadio and Cumulus. These companies are collectively reaping billions in profit on the backs of working-class musicians and performers — and that’s just wrong.\n\n\n\nThe American people agree. A&nbsp;recent national survey&nbsp;showed that most Americans are not currently aware that artists aren’t paid when their songs are played on traditional radio. But when they are made aware of this fact, they overwhelmingly say that it is unfair — by a 3-to-1 margin. The public needs to understand how traditional, giant radio stations continue to profit off music creators without paying for it. We can’t let them continue to get away with this injustice.\n\n\n\nAs the Grammy-award winning singer and songwriter Gloria Estefan wisely pointed out during a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee earlier this year: “This corporate radio loophole makes broadcast radio the only industry in America that can use another’s intellectual property without permission or compensation. Every industrialized country except the United States provides a performance right. Moreover, when American-made music is played overseas, other countries collect royalties for American artists and producers but never pay those royalties because we don't reciprocate. This inequity costs the American economy and artists more than $200 million each year.”\n\n\n\nSAG-AFTRA and our partners in the musicFIRST Coalition are not alone in this fight. Further support for music fairness has poured in from other union groups, collectively representing tens of thousands of musicians across the country, including the AFL-CIO and the American Federation of Musicians. We’re also joined by the U.S. Copyright Office, the consumer advocacy organization Public Knowledge, the Alliance for Community Media and the National Federation of Community Broadcasters, to name a few. And it’s no surprise why these organizations are speaking out. As the economist Barry M. Massarsky testified, “There is no reasonable economic basis for broadcast radio to continue to enjoy its exemption from the sound recording terrestrial performance right.”\n\n\n\nIn our polarized times, it’s rare to find an issue that has support on both sides of the aisle — but the American Music Fairness Act has found strong support in both parties. A bipartisan group of legislators supports the bill, including its original sponsors, Reps. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.) and Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), as well as dozens of their colleagues. And soon, we’re expecting senators from both parties to step forward to put their support behind the people who create the music that makes us love, laugh, cry and reflect upon the most important moments of our lives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPaying our workers fairly for their hard work is the American way. It always has been, and we at SAG-AFTRA believe strongly that it always should be. The power of labor is designed to ensure that huge corporations do not freely reap huge benefits on the backs of others. That’s why Congress should pass the American Music Fairness Act now. Our musicians deserve better.\n\n\n\nFran Drescher is the president of SAG-AFTRA, a New York Times best-selling author and an award-winning actor.",

Biden's prime-time speech on Thursday evening is being met with scorn by some pundits on cable news over its tone and the staging that accompanied it. \n\n\n\nThe speech, during which Biden framed the wing of the Republican Party loyal to former President Trump as a threat to democracy, served as a scathing rebuke of the ongoing political influence of his predecessor, which Democrats hope will energize voters ahead of this fall's midterm elections. \n\n\n\nMade against a dark-red backdrop in Philadelphia with a pair of Marines standing behind the president as he spoke, the speech also portrayed Republicans who are loyal to Trump over the GOP establishment as aiming to take the country “backward.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Not every Republican, not even a majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology,” Biden said during his remarks. “But there’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.”\n\n\n\nImmediately after the speech and during the day Friday, cable news and Twitter was buzzing with critics hammering the president for what they said was the political tone of his remarks and the staging used in Philadelphia. \n\n\n\n\"This was an inappropriate speech,\" said Ari Fleischer, a former aide to President George W. Bush and now a Fox News contributor. \"This was a campaign speech, and the U.S. Marine Corps has some explaining to do. How did they get used? Why were two Marines used in the background of that shot?\" \n\n\n\nOn CNN's morning program, \"New Day,\" host Brianna Keilar spoke with veteran Allison Jaslow, who argued Democrats politicized two Marines staged in the background of Biden's televised address. \n\n\n\n\"Somebody made the decision to put those Marines in the shot,\" Jaslow said. \"And the reality is those Marines didn't have a choice.\" \n\n\n\nOn Friday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended the administration's decision to use the Marines in the shot. \n\n\n\n\"The presence of the Marines at the speech was intended to demonstrate the deep and abiding respect the president has for these service members to these ideals and the unique role our independent military plays in defending our democracy no matter which party is in power. Again, no matter which party is in power,” Jean-Pierre said. \n\n\n\nIn terms of the substance of the speech, some on the political left felt Biden's speech did not go far enough in calling out Republicans who have backed Trump's false claims of election fraud and other statements and policies on race, immigration and other cultural issues. \n\n\n\n“I don’t know who the ‘It’s not all Republicans, just MAGA Republicans’ [is] for,” said liberal pundit Elie Mystal during an appearance Thursday night on MSNBC. “I’m sure there are some white supremacists who will vote with white supremacists, who don’t think they are white supremacists who are happy Biden didn't call them a white supremacist.\" \n\n\n\nBiden attempted to clarify his comments about Republicans more generally again on Friday. \n\n\n\n“I don't consider any Trump supporter to be a threat to the country,” Biden said. “I do think anyone who calls for the use of violence, fails to condemn violence when it's used, refuses to acknowledge an election has been won, insists upon changing the way in which we rule and count votes, that is a threat to democracy.”",

        "description": "Photo by Brett Davis/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Atlanta is seeking its third straight win, but will face a tough task in Alcantara.  After securing a series win Thursday, the Atlanta Braves will continue their homestand Friday when they begin a three-game series against the Miami Marlins. Atlanta moved back to 30 games over .500 with Thursday’s win at 81-51 and kept pace with the Mets in the NL East standings whom they trail by 3.0 games. Friday’s series opener will feature a marquee pitching matchup between Atlanta’s Charlie Morton and Miami’s Sandy Alcantara. \nIt has been an up and down season for Morton who has pitched better since June, but is coming off of an outing where he allowed three walks and a pair of two-run home runs in five innings against the Cardinals. Morton has logged at least six innings in seven of his last 10 starts. His four strikeouts against St. Louis was his lowest total since May 25. Morton faced the Marlins back in mid-May and allowed seven hits and three runs in 5 1/3 innings. \nAlcantara comes into Friday’s opener as one of the front runners to take home the Cy Young award for the National League. The Braves have seen just how good he is up close. Alcantara allowed three unearned runs in a complete game back on May 22. He came back six days later and allowed four hits, one run and struck out 14 in eight innings against Atlanta. He is coming off of another complete game performance in his last outing where he held the Dodgers to six hits and one run while striking out 10. \nAfter missing three straight games due to knee soreness, Ronald Acuña Jr. was at DH for the final two games against the Rockies. He admitted after Wednesday’s game that the knee is still a problem, but that he will just have to play through it for the remainder of the season. \nAustin Riley homered for the second straight game and has tied last season’s career-high with 33. After a sluggish August, Riley is 9-for-20 with two doubles and two home runs in his last five games. \nFriday’s game will be broadcast exclusively online at Apple TV+. The service is still free  for September and you just need to download the Apple TV app. First pitch is scheduled for 7:20 p.m. ET. \nGame Info\nGame Date/Time: Friday, September 2, 7:20 p.m. ET\nLocation: Truist Park, Atlanta, Georgia\nStreaming: APPLE TV+\nRadio: 680 AM / 93.7 FM The Fan",

Through this, they hoped to convince people to spend hundreds of dollars on Helium hotspots, which earn an average of 0.07 HNT ($0.37) a day (2.1 HNT/$11.24 a month) for supplying connectivity to internet of things devices.Now, Helium is ditching its custom Helium chain in favor of a Solana-based token, and scrapping the blockchain entirely for the portions of its service that actually used the blockchain for anything beyond handling rewards.Helium seems to have realized, finally, that blockchains tend to be slow as hell. In a blog post about the change, they wrote that \"specific transactions, including Proof-of-Coverage and Data Transfer Accounting, are processed on-chain unnecessarily. This data bottleneck can cause efficiency issues such as device join delays and problems with data packet communications, which bloats the Network and causes slow processing times.\" They outline their plans to move these portions of the project to a \"more traditional large data pipeline\"—that is, infrastructure that's actually well-suited to that kind of processing.\n        \n            \n              \n                \"HIP 70: Helium Core Team Proposes to Migrate to Solana\"\n               , Helium Foundation\n            \n            \n              \n                Helium Tracker",

I don’t believe in\nbet-the-company bets. That’s when you’re desperate. That’s the\nlast thing you can do.\n\n\nIs Facebook’s AR/VR play really a bet-the-company bet? To me it feels like it. They changed the name of the whole company and supposedly have over 10,000 employees working on it. What else are they betting on for the future, other than hamfistedly trying to turn Instagram into a Frankensteinian amalgam of TikTok and QVC.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "title": "Early look at Chromebook ‘Glanceable’ widgets clarifies their purpose a bit",
        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebook-glanceable-widgets-welcome-screen/",
        "description": "While I love new features coming to Chromebooks, I&#8217;ll have to go on record as being a tad bit bummed out by what this particular one is turning out to be.  I&#8217;m not saying it won&#8217;t be a solid addition to ChromeOS or that many users won&#8217;t find it incredibly helpful: it&#8217;s just not what I was hoping it was going to be.  The feature in question is of course the &#8216;Glanceable&#8217; widgets we&#8217;ve talked about a few times up to this point, and the letdown is the fact that they aren&#8217;t exactly desktop widgets the way we&#8217;ve come to know them in Android.\n\n\n\nSay hello to the new &#8216;Welcome Screen&#8217;\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, the new widgets we&#8217;ve been seeing referenced in the Chromium Repositories are widgets and they do what we thought, but they won&#8217;t be living where we expected them to.  Instead, they will be part of a new &#8216;Welcome Screen&#8217; that should show up in the next few versions of ChromeOS.  You can enable the flag in the Canary Channel if you are so inclined, but with the pace of development on this one, I&#8217;d advise you to just wait a bit longer for it to arrive in Stable.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis welcome screen will greet users for the beginning of a new session or can be toggled on and off via a button up top in the overview screen as well.  All the widgets we&#8217;ve been talking about are there, including an agenda that pulls from your calendar, a weather icon, a welcome message, and a screenshot of your last session that can be restored with just a single click.\n\n\n\nAll of it works right now (we mocked up the screenshot of your last session for the featured image up top) and it feels a bit crazy that this new feature has come this far this quickly.  Generally speaking, the whole thing is only about a month old.  The option for restoration of your last session dates back a few months to another feature we&#8217;ve been following called &#8216;Floating Workspaces.&#8217;  That feature is meant to allow you to restore your sessions between Chromebooks, and it may be that this new welcome screen is where Google chose to leverage it.\n\n\n\nAs a person who generally leaves my Chromebook on and simply closes the lid when I&#8217;m finished, I&#8217;m unsure at this point how often I&#8217;ll be greeted with this new &#8216;Welcome Screen,&#8217; but I see the appeal.  While I wouldn&#8217;t want this popping up every time I walk away and re-approach my Chromebook, I like the idea of being met with it first thing in the morning to see the weather, my schedule, and have the opportunity to restore where I was when I last left my Chromebook.\n\n\n\noverview mode with new &#8216;Up Next&#8217; button\n\n\n\nFor those of you like me that would want more frequent access to this, however, there will be the button in the overview bar as well that allows for the new &#8216;Welcome Screen&#8217; to be brought back into view.  As more useful stuff finds itself in this new space, I could see myself utilizing it more and more.  Perhaps at some point we&#8217;ll have some options of widgets to include as I could see something like a simple Google News or Google Discover feed being great to have in this form.\n\n\n\nFor now, however, what you see is what you get, and I think for many users this &#8216;Welcome Screen&#8217; could prove quite useful.  I imagine students and employees who snag a Chromebook from a cart being able to log in, orient themselves for the day, and find a lot of value in this feature.  We&#8217;re likely far from done with the &#8216;Welcome Screen&#8217;, so more functionality could arrive before it launches, and we&#8217;ll be keeping an eye on it until it does.\n\n\n\nVIA: 9to5 Google\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Jeff Bezos, back in 2014 in an interview with Henry Blodget:\n\n\n  What really matters is, companies that don’t continue to\nexperiment, companies that don’t embrace failure, they eventually\nget in a desperate position where the only thing they can do is a\nHail Mary bet at the very end of their corporate existence.\nWhereas companies that are making bets all along, even big bets,\nbut not bet-the-company bets, prevail. I don’t believe in\nbet-the-company bets. That’s when you’re desperate. That’s the\nlast thing you can do.\n\n\nIs Facebook’s AR/VR play really a bet-the-company bet? To me it feels like it. They changed the name of the whole company and supposedly have over 10,000 employees working on it. What else are they betting on for the future, other than hamfistedly trying to turn Instagram into a Frankensteinian amalgam of TikTok and QVC.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "description": "Former Attorney General William Barr suggested the Department of Justice (DOJ) likely has a strong case that former President Trump improperly took classified documents from the White House when he left office amid an ongoing investigation into the matter. \n\n\n\n\"Is there any legitimate reason for those materials to be in the former president’s possession?\" Barr was asked by Fox News anchor John Roberts during an appearance on the network Friday. \n\n\n\n\"No. I can’t think of a legitimate reason why they should have been taken out of the government, away from the government, if they are classified,\" Barr said. \n\n\n\nBarr, who served under Trump, said he was \"skeptical\" of the former president's recent claims that he had declassified all of the material in question. \n\n\n\n\"Because frankly I think it's highly improbable,\" Barr said. \"And if in fact he sort of stood over scores of boxes, not knowing really what was in them, and said I hereby declassify everything in here, that would be such an abuse and show such recklessness that it's almost worse than taking them.\" \n\n\n\nThe DOJ on Friday unsealed new documents revealing more details about how much classified material Trump kept in his personal office at Mar-a-Lago, which was searched last month in connection with the federal investigation. \n\n\n\nThe Hill reported FBI agents found 43 empty folders with classified banners in Trump’s personal office as well as another 28 empty folders that were labeled “return to staff secretary/military aide,” according to the inventory.\n\n\n\nOf the search at Mar-a-Lago, which sent shockwaves across the political landscape and infuriated Trump and his supporters, Barr said \"people say this was unprecedented. Well, it’s also unprecedented for a president to take all this classified information and put them in a country club.\" \n\n\n\nSince leaving Trump's administration, Barr has emerged as a critic of his former boss, throwing cold water on Trump's repeated and false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election and penning a book about his time as attorney general during Trump's final months in office. \n\n\n\nFor the DOJ to have gone this far in its inquiry, Barr said on Friday, \"they probably have pretty good evidence.\" \n\n\n\n\"But that's speculation,\" he continued. \"And until we see that, it's hard to say.\"",

        "description": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) and other House Republicans on Friday called for Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray to appear before the House Judiciary Committee to discuss the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nMcCarthy was joined by Reps. Mike Turner, Jim Jordan and James Comer — who serve as the leading Republicans on the House Intelligence, Judiciary and Oversight committees, respectievely — in calling for public hearings and the release of documents related to the search.\n\n\n\n“In these extraordinary circumstances, the DOJ is proceeding in a manner that is eroding public trust and confidence,” McCarthy said in a letter to Garland.\n\n\n\nMcCarthy accused Garland and the Justice Department of being insincere in their public claims that the department would speak through “its court filings and its work” and release information in an “appropriate” manner.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInstead, the House minority leader suggested that the Justice Department was leaking information to the media to “create a one-sided narrative.”\n\n\n\n“The appropriate time is now, and the appropriate way is to publicly appear before and answer important questions to the congressional committees of jurisdiction that oversee your department,” McCarthy said.\n\n\n\nThe group of House Republicans also requested that Garland and Wray turn over materials related to the search “immediately without redactions or withholdings.” While several documents have been unsealed in the litigation that has followed the raid, many contained redactions.\n\n\n\nThe FBI carried out a search warrant at former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home on Aug. 8, recovering more than 100 classified documents. Agents conducted the search after evidence suggested that Trump had “likely concealed and removed” documents in the face of a grand jury subpoena.",

        "description": "The Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) on Friday said that it will provide access to abortions to pregnant veterans in limited circumstances.\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the department said it submitted an interim final rule in the federal register to allow it to provide access to abortion counseling, as well as the procedure itself for people who became pregnant as a result of rape or incest, or if carrying a pregnancy to term endangers the life of the mother.\n\n\n\nThe department said the services would be authorized immediately after the final rule is published, and it will be made available for public comment for 30 days following publication.\n\n\n\nVA Secretary Denis McDonough called the move a “patient safety decision.”\n\n\n\n“Pregnant Veterans and VA beneficiaries deserve to have access to world-class reproductive care when they need it most. That’s what our nation owes them, and that’s what we at VA will deliver,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe move comes as trigger bans on abortion take effect weeks after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade — the 1973 ruling that guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion.\n\n\n\nIn its interim final rule, the VA notes that current regulations don’t allow the agency’s Civilian Health and Medical Program (CHAMPVA) program to cover the procedure unless the life of the pregnant person is endangered.\n\n\n\nCoverage for abortions for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest is also excluded from CHAMPV, as is abortion counseling.  \n\n\n\nFor comparison, TRICARE, the military’s health care program, covers abortions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest, or if it endangers the life of the mother.\n\n\n\nThe move would cover veterans and benefits under CHAMPVA program, the VA said. The department added that its employees may provide the service regardless of state restrictions as long as they are working within the scope of federal employment.\n\n\n\nThe determination of whether a pregnancy endangers a pregnant veteran would be made on a \"case-by-case\" basis after consultation between VA health care providers and the veteran.\n\n\n\nIn the case of a veteran who became pregnant after rape or incest, self-reporting the incident from veterans or a VA beneficiary will be enough evidence that an act of rape or incest occurred.",

        "description": "Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Forgetting club lines and enjoying the spectacle of the MVP race for three nights in Anaheim. Yes, the Yankees are playing some uninspired baseball and no, it’s not particularly enjoyable watching them do so. But for a few moments, I’d like to forget about losing streaks and division races and club lines. Today, I’d like to share my appreciation of the privilege of getting to watch the two best players in MLB ply their craft.\nThese last three games have provided a spectacle the likes of which we may not see in quite awhile — the two frontrunners in the AL MVP race almost singlehandedly willing their respective teams to victory in a head-to-head showdown. On one side, you have the most dominant offensive force in a single season since Barry Bonds in Aaron Judge. On the other, you have a literal unicorn who every day redefines what’s possible on a baseball field in Shohei Ohtani. \nJudge, assembling the most impressive performance in a walk year perhaps of all-time, chasing down the 61-year-old AL home run record set by a legend from the past of his own team. Ohtani, a top-10 hitter and pitcher in the league on pace to become the first player since Jim Devlin of the 1876 Louisville Grays to lead his team in both plate appearances and innings pitched. Both delivered the goods in a manner befitting an MVP.\nAs teams began to realize that Judge is the only consistent threat in the Yankees lineup, they’ve given him less and less to hit. In other words, he is being given the Bonds treatment.  It’s hard to impose one’s will on a game when the opponent is treating you like this:\n\n\nThe last 15 times Aaron Judge has come up with a runner (or two) in scoring position and first base open:Hit By PitchHome RunHome RunWalkWalkGroundoutIntentional WalkIntentional WalkWalkGroundoutHit By PitchFlyoutIntentional WalkIntentional WalkIntentional Walk https://t.co/V8kXtBSv4O— Codify (@CodifyBaseball) August 30, 2022\n\n\n\nOne of the things that distinguishes an MVP-caliber player from the rest of the pack is the ability to seize the opportunity when it presents itself, however infrequent that may be. You may only get one pitch to hit all game, but when it comes, you better make the most of it.\nWell, that’s what Judge did in this series against the Angels. The only pitch in series opener remotely close to the hitting zone was sent into the seats for an absurd 50 home runs before September, but also to reduce the deficit to just a run. He finished the night with the home run and two intentional walks — about as Bondsian a batting line as you could ask for.\n  \n        \n  \n\nThe next night featured an even more heroic act from the literal larger than life figure. Again, he got nothing to hit all game, and yet somehow still collected a pair of singles on a pair of pitcher’s pitches. Even when no decent opportunity arose, he grabbed the game by the horns and forced a result out.\nAgainst Mike Mayers’ best fastball of the night, Judge blasted a three-run shot to the opposite field that would prove decisive by the time the final out was converted. It wasn’t even a mistake pitch, and yet Judge punished Mayers to the fullest for coming even near the zone with a heater and runners on. \n  \n        \n  \n\nFor the near-supernatural ability shown by Judge in the series, Ohtani matched him stride-for-stride, and maybe even surpassed him. His two-run home run in the fifth inning of the series opener gave the Angels a lead that they would not surrender, and against this pitch no less:\n\nFrankie Montas has had a tough time in pinstripes, but Ohtani is one of if not the only hitter in baseball who can put that kind of swing on a pitch and still drive it 400 feet out of the yard. Oh, not to mention it gave us probably the coolest photo we’ll see all season.\n\n\nTwo forlorn angels embrace the fiery damnation of Hades for just one earthly win pic.twitter.com/vnlN9nhjpm— oscar hotel romeo (@OldHossRadbourn) August 30, 2022\n\n\n\nAs if that wasn’t enough, Ohtani flashed his speed while legging out an infield single in the eighth on what should’ve been a routine groundout. You know, to remind everyone that on top of being one of the best pitchers and best hitters in baseball, he’s also one of the fastest dudes in the league. I’m not even sure Lucas Luetge did all that much wrong on the play; Ohtani is just that fast.\n\nThe real MVP moment came in the series finale. I talked about MVPs taking over games and punishing the one mistake made against them. That’s precisely what Ohtani did against Gerrit Cole, who had been pitching a shutout until that fateful sixth inning. The mistakes came in the form of a pair of errors by Josh Donaldson and Isiah Kiner-Falefa, allowing Ohtani to come to the plate with a pair on down two.\nCole had pitched Ohtani well all game, but at the third time of asking made his lone mistake on a center-cut fastball, and boy Ohtani did not miss. He sent it 427 feet to center to account for all three Angels’ runs — all of which they would need in the series-clinching 3-2 victory.\n\nIt’s not often you get to see the two clear MVP frontrunners go head-to-head in a series. It’s even more rare that they take over the games in a fashion like Judge and Ohtani did, lending greater credence to the concept of MVP. For a three-game stretch, we got to see the two best players in the sport at the peak of their powers, and it’s a memory I won’t soon forget.",

        "description": "The St. Louis County Attorney&#x27;s Office has declined to file charges against three Iron Range law enforcement officers who were involved in the fatal shooting of a man in Chisholm, Minn. in April. St. Louis County Attorney Kimberly Maki said county sheriff’s deputy Cody Dillinger and Virginia, Minn. police officer Nicholas Grivna were justified in killing Michael David Johnson, 38, who they were trying to arrest on a felony stalking charge filed in Morrison County. A third officer was also involved. Deputy Gavin Nichols struck Johnson with two less lethal rounds before he was shot and killed. According to the county attorney’s office, officers located Johnson early in the morning of April 20 at a home in Chisholm, where he allegedly refused to open the door and “said he wasn’t going to go back to jail.” After officers forced their way into the house, Johnson allegedly came down the stairs with a knife in one hand and a gas tank in the other hand. Nichols fired two less lethal rounds, but according to the attorney’s office, that failed to slow his advance. Johnson then allegedly threw the tank at an officer, revealing a second knife. After Johnson refused several commands to drop the knives, Dillinger and Grivna shot him six times on the front porch. They were unable to revive him. St. Louis County Attorney Kimberly Maki determined the officers&#x27; actions were reasonable based on evidence —  including body camera and dash camera footage — that she said showed the officers were reasonable to believe they faced a deadly threat. “We extend our condolences to Michael Johnson’s family and friends for the loss of their loved one,” Maki said. “While we mourn the loss of life,” Maki continued, “we have concluded that the actions taken by law enforcement in this incident were in accordance with the ‘reasonable officer’ standard set forth in Minnesota law.”The Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigated the incident. All three officers had been placed on administrative leave. In 2018, Officer Grivna shot and killed a man holding a person at knifepoint in Virginia. The following year, then-St. Louis County Attorney Mark Rubin ruled Grivna’s action was justified, saying he likely saved a man’s life by shooting Scot Widmark, 41, in the head.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/royals-designate-daniel-mengden-for-assignment.html",
        "description": "The Royals announced Friday that they&#8217;ve recalled right-hander Wyatt Mills from Triple-A Omaha and designated fellow righty Daniel Mengden for assignment in order to create roster space. Mengden was selected to the big league roster just yesterday and started last night&#8217;s game for Kansas City, but it appears that&#8217;ll go down as a spot start.\nMengden, 29, tossed just 2 2/3 innings in last night&#8217;s start against the White Sox, yielding three runs on five hits and a walk with a pair of strikeouts. It was his second stint with the Royals this year, as he&#8217;d previously made four bullpen appearances back in June. Overall, Mengden has pitched seven innings with the Royals and allowed four earned runs on ten hits and a walk with eight punchouts.\nA fourth-round pick of the A&#8217;s back in 2014, Mengden was a regular on the Oakland pitching staff from 2016-20, working primarily as a starter but never quite securing a long-term spot in the rotation. The mustachioed righty appeared in 60 games with Oakland &#8212; 48 of them starts &#8212; and totaled 302 2/3 innings with a 4.64 ERA, a 17.3% strikeout rate, a solid 7.8% walk rate and 39% ground-ball rate.\nMengden then spent the 2021 season with the Korea Baseball Organization&#8217;s Kia Tigers, for whom he notched a 3.60 ERA over the life of 21 starts. He&#8217;s spent the bulk of the current season with the Royals&#8217; Triple-A club in Omaha, pitching to a 4.55 ERA in 91 innings. He&#8217;s ineligible to be traded because he&#8217;s been on a big league roster this year and the trade deadline has passed, so Mengden will hit outright waivers or release waivers within the next seven days. All 29 other clubs will have the opportunity to claim him.\nMills, 27, came to the Royals by way of the June trade that sent Carlos Santana to Seattle. He&#8217;s appeared in 18 games out of the Kansas City bullpen already this year but struggled to a 5.30 ERA with a 17-to-10 K/BB ratio in 18 2/3 innings. He&#8217;s been sharp in Triple-A for the second straight season, however, and now carries a career 2.53 ERA, a 36.7% strikeout rate and an 8.1% walk rate at that level.",

But with millions of hectares infested, some fear control efforts are too latePete Peeti flicks off the headlights, cuts the ignition and lets his truck roll quietly down a bush track, deep in the heart of New Zealand’s North Island. Twilight is slipping into night and rain is falling in thick drapes. “Close your door quietly when you get out,” Peeti says. He slings his gun over his shoulder and scans the track with high-tech thermal vision goggles. “The hardier ones will brave the rain,” he says quietly.The goggles render the landscape ghostly – skeletal trees and blotted shadows. Barely a minute passes before a splash of bright light moves into frame 30 metres away. It grazes for a moment, and then with the unmistakeable bounce of a wallaby, hops toward a new patch of grass. Peeti drops flat against the wet earth and readies his shot. But for the rain, the night stills with anticipation. His gun cracks. “Got it,” he says disappearing into the darkness to retrieve the animal. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Written by Marcy Goldstein-Gelb and Jessica E. Martinez\n\n\n\nThis Labor Day, we’re thinking about the people who make our picnics possible. People like Marielena, who works in a poultry plant in North Carolina. More than two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, the workers “do not have sufficient time to even disinfect our hands,”&nbsp;says Marielena.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat’s just one of the preventable hazards faced by workers processing the meats we’ll be sizzling on our grills this weekend. Several of her co-workers, Marielena reports, “hurt themselves lifting because the floors were wet. There were chemicals; they have cuts and the velocity [of the line] is so fast [but] the supervisor comes and yells at us to move faster.”\n\n\n\nMarielena tells her story at&nbsp;WorkedUp, a new platform hosted by the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health, where we are co-executive directors. WorkedUp highlights testimony from workers standing up for better work conditions. But she prefers not to use her real name due to the very real threat of employer retaliation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nREAD: What Can Unions Do Now To Defend Abortion Rights? \n\n\n\nJoining together to make things better, from a bake sale to a barn-raising, is a longstanding and heartwarming American tradition. But when workers get together, watch out: Employers routinely violate federal law,&nbsp;reports the Economic Policy Institute, by harassing or firing workers involved in union organizing campaigns.\n\n\n\nThat’s what happened to Alyssa Sanchez, a Starbucks barista in Phoenix, Ariz., who was fired after she helped organize her workplace. “They’re just trying to get rid of all the people who want to unionize,”&nbsp;Sanchez says, adding that “we just want to make work a better place.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployers like Starbucks have used illegal discipline measures,&nbsp;firings&nbsp;and even&nbsp;store closingsfor decades to dissuade workers from organizing. But this bullying behavior doesn’t work so well when&nbsp;workers are fed up&nbsp;with crappy jobs that put them at risk but don’t pay the rent. Starbucks workers&nbsp;have won&nbsp;more than 200 union elections nationwide while losing only a handful.\n\n\n\nWe’re inspired by Starbucks workers and those at Apple, Amazon, Trader Joe’s, REI and other corporate retail giants who are transforming the U.S. labor movement. As safety advocates, we know how important a union can be. More unionized workers results in fewer traumatic injuries and fewer deaths in high-risk industries like&nbsp;mining&nbsp;and&nbsp;construction.\n\n\n\nRight now, however,&nbsp;only 6 percent&nbsp;of private-sector workers in the United States have union representation. Let’s say the current surge in organizing is successful and unions recruit twice as many members as they have now. That would still leave 88 percent of private sector workers—more than 97&nbsp; million people—without the protections that go along with a union contract.\n\n\n\nUnion or non-union, all workers deserve fair pay and decent working conditions. That’s why we need public protections that apply to all workers, like the&nbsp;safety standards on extreme heat&nbsp;now in effect in California, Oregon, Washington and Minnesota. Local committees on occupational safety and health, known as COSH groups, are crucial to winning these policy victories.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOur organization provides training and resources to win safety improvements for all workers, regardless of union status. Nonprofit worker centers, which&nbsp;provide&nbsp;legal and advocacy support, are also an important resource, especially for immigrant and undocumented workers who are uniquely vulnerable to employer retaliation.\n\n\n\nYou can also make a difference as a citizen and as a consumer. You can sign a pledge at tinyurl.com/nocontractnocoffee&nbsp;to support Starbucks workers, or one at&nbsp;WorkedUp.us&nbsp;to support workers at Refresco, a bottling company in New Jersey where workers won two union elections and are now fighting for their first contract.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBusiness groups are never shy about contacting elected officials, and this is a time for all of us regular folks to be bold as well. Signing a petition, joining a rally or sending a tweet are small acts that, if done collectively, can make a big change.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe learned during the pandemic just how much all of us rely on frontline workers. It’s great to honor them on Labor Day — and even better to join their campaigns for fair pay and safer working conditions all year long.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis column was produced by Progressive Perspectives, which is run by The Progressive magazine and distributed by Tribune News Service.\n\n\n\nMarcy Goldstein-Gelb is a co-executive director of the National Council for Occupational Safety and Health (National COSH).

You can read more about the Cardinals from Josey Curtis, manager of our SB Nation Cardinals site Viva el Birdos, in the series preview for that set.\nFun fact\nSaturday’s game will be the 323rd with Adam Wainwright and Yadier Molina as the starting battery for the Cardinals. The MLB record for such things is 324, set by Mickey Lolich and Bill Freehan of the Tigers from 1963-75. Wainwright and Molina are expected to tie that record September 7, when the Cards face the Nationals in St. Louis.\nProbable pitching matchups \nFriday: Adrian Sampson, RHP (1-4, 3.97 ERA, 1.340 WHIP, 3.81 FIP) vs. Jordan Montgomery, LHP (7-3, 3.28 ERA, 1.039 WHIP, 3.56 FIP overall, 4-0, 1.76 ERA, 0.815 WHIP, 2.21 FIP in five starts with Cardinals)\nSaturday: Drew Smyly, LHP (5-7, 3.24 ERA, 1.202 WHIP, 4.05 FIP) vs. Adam Wainwright, RHP (9-9, 3.09 ERA, 1.172 WHIP, 3.55 FIP)\nSunday: Marcus Stroman, RHP (3-6, 3.98 ERA, 1.210 WHIP, 3.87 FIP) vs. Miles Mikolas, RHP (10-10, 3.48 ERA, 1.040 WHIP, 3.91 FIP)\nTimes &amp; TV channels\nFriday: 7:15 p.m. CT, Marquee Sports Network\nSaturday: 6:15 p.m. CT, Marquee Sports Network\nSunday: 1:15 p.m. CT, Marquee Sports Network \nPrediction\nWell, I honestly have no idea. The Cubs have just a 2-4 record on this road trip, got swept last month by the Cardinals in St. Louis and are 6-10 against them so far this year.\nOn the other hand, the Cubs did win two of three from the Cardinals in St. Louis back in June, and these pitching matchups are at least... not bad?\nI’d love to see another two of three, but I’ll settle for not getting swept again.\nUp next\nThe Cubs have Monday (Labor Day) off, then return to Wrigley Field to play a three-game series against the Cincinnati Reds beginning Tuesday evening.\nGet used to seeing a lot of the Reds coming up.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3625976-the-mystery-of-indias-new-solar-tariffs/",
        "description": "On April 1, India slapped tariffs on solar cells and modules. This wouldn’t be newsworthy except that India made these tariffs out of whole cloth. This is as audacious as protectionism gets.\n\n\n\nTariff hikes in India are not uncommon. Over the last eight years, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has increased 3,000 tariffs, hitting 70 percent of the country’s imports. Tariffs are front and center in Modi’s drive to make India more economically “self-sufficient.” They also add central budget revenue. But even against this backdrop, the new solar tariffs are striking.\n\n\n\nLike many countries, India is keen on renewables. Modi hopes to produce half the nation’s electricity from renewables by 2030, mostly wind and solar. More impressive still, India wants to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. To reach these goals, India has lavished protectionism on its domestic producers. Antidumping duties and safeguards have given these producers some much-needed breathing room, particularly against cheap imports from China. But these temporary tariffs have expired. No one doubted the government would fill in with new tariffs. But not like this.\n\n\n\nHere's the mystery.\n\n\n\nThe solar cells fall under tariff code 85414011, and the modules under 85414012. Look at India’s World Trade Organization (WTO) obligations and you’ll see that both tariffs are bound at zero. In other words, India has no tariffs to increase on solar cells or on modules. Quite simply, India’s 25 percent tariff on cells, and 40 percent tariff on modules, are pure fiction.\n\n\n\nIndia calls tariffs basic customs duties, not trade remedies. There’s no evidence that India conducted an antidumping or a safeguard investigation that could have triggered temporary tariffs. So again, where did India’s solar tariffs come from?\n\n\n\nIndia also has non-tariff barriers on solar. Most famously, it’s Approved List of Models and Manufacturers favors domestic over foreign solar. Given these non-tariff barriers, it’s not obvious India needed two new tariffs to backfill for its recently expired safeguard.\n\n\n\nConversely, if India was intent on defying its WTO obligations, why not go bigger than 25 percent and 40 percent? The answer is that the tariffs, on top of COVID-19-related price spikes, will hurt solar sales. Import duties make solar panels more expensive, but domestic companies find it difficult to compete without protectionism.\n\n\n\nThere was no need for India to make these solar tariffs out of whole cloth. An antidumping duty would have done the trick. India is the world’s most prolific user of antidumping duties, and China the world’s number-one target. Yet another antidumping duty wouldn’t have been noticed.\n\n\n\nBut the global economy should notice this. India’s new solar tariffs are a big deal because they are as obvious an infraction as could be. What will other countries infer from this? That India is rewriting its WTO tariff obligations? That all is fair game in competing over renewables? Or just when China is the source of cheap imports?\n\n\n\nFor whatever India intended to signal by making solar tariffs out of whole cloth, the move was too clever by half.\n\n\n\nMarc L.

        "description": "Miriam Adelson, the widow of the late GOP mega-donor Sheldon Adelson, has given less in donations to the Republican Party since her husband’s death last year, according to Federal Elections Commission (FEC) data. \n\n\n\nSheldon Adelson spent much of his fortune promoting Republican candidates and pro-Israel conservative causes before he died in January 2021 at age 87. He gave more than $420 million to conservative candidates and groups during the 2020 election cycle, and he and his wife spent more than $520 million on federal races between 2009 and last year, according to an analysis from a nonprofit working to reduce the role of money in politics. \n\n\n\nBut FEC data shows that Miriam Adelson has only made two donations during the current cycle since her husband’s death. She donated $5 million in July to the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC that works to elect Republicans to the House, and $5,000 in June 2021 to the Stand for America PAC, which former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley (R) established to support conservative causes. \n\n\n\nTwo people familiar with Miriam Adelson’s activity told Bloomberg that she has mostly avoided attending large events with politicians that usually lead to large donations. Bloomberg reported that her wealth has also dropped throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. \n\n\n\nHer $5 million contribution is only one-sixth of what she and her husband gave to the Congressional Leadership Fund at this point of the 2018 midterm election cycle, according to Bloomberg.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne person familiar with Adelson’s thinking told Bloomberg that she is passionate about Israel but is less vocal and interested in U.S. politics.\n\n\n\nAdelson did not immediately return a request from The Hill for comment through her family foundation.",

        "description": "James Coddington was put to death in Oklahoma on Aug. 25 for the 1997 murder of his friend and coworker, Albert Hale. His was the first of the state’s planned 25 executions in the next could of years.\n\n\n\nWitnesses accounts of his execution gave the impression that there was nothing much to see, since all seemed to go according to plan. Yet the accounts of what they saw — and what they didn’t see — offered a reminder of the long history of witnessing executions and the problems associated with that act.\n\n\n\nThe tradition of having witnesses at an execution is almost as old as execution itself. And while people no longer are put to death in public, state law in Oklahoma and elsewhere allows some people to see them. In the past, some states have even recruited witnesses.\n\n\n\nSome people, especially the victim’s family, may feel compelled to see for themselves that a convicted person has been put to death. They seek closure and consolation.\n\n\n\nOthers, like the condemned inmate’s lawyer, may be present as a comfort to their client or to provide any last minute legal representation. Still others witness out of a sense of duty or because it is their job to do so.\n\n\n\nMedia witnesses may be there as the public’s eyes and ears. As the late ABC News reporter Ted Koppel said of his own decision to witness the 1995 Texas execution of Mario Marquez, \"If we are going to live with capital punishment we have to see it and know what it is about.\"\n\n\n\nToday, witnessing executions occurs within a framework of state laws and regulations that create a hierarchy among witnesses, privileging some and burdening others.\n\n\n\nSome, usually family members of the victim, have a right to attend. Others, including family members of the condemned and media witnesses, require permission and are subject to various background checks and rules of decorum.\n\n\n\nRegulations also differentiate those who must witness from those who may be present. Included in the first category in Oklahoma are the “Agency director or designee and H Unit Section chief shall be present.” H Unit is the name of Oklahoma’s death row. Others who “may” be present include an odd array of state officials, some of whom were involved in the case of the condemned, including: the Cabinet Secretary of Public Safety or designee; the judge who presided during the trial; the chief of police of the municipality in which the crime occurred; the district attorney or designee of the county of conviction and other law enforcement officials.\n\n\n\nThe regulations say that the condemned may have five witnesses “as selected by the inmate and approved by the director (of the DOC).”\n\n\n\nBecause of a heightened concern for security when outsiders are allowed into the prison where Oklahoma’s executions are carried out, family members of both the victim and the offender are subject to a “criminal records check.”\n\n\n\nIn Oklahoma, each media witness must agree “to immediately report to the non-witnessing members of the assembled news media” their account of the execution as they witnessed it “immediately following the execution” and prior to filing their story. The repeated reference to “immediately” suggests some suspicion that delay might introduce inaccuracies or that advocacy groups would exert undue influence on media witnesses once they are outside of DOC control.\n\n\n\nWitnesses at Coddington’s execution included his victim’s son, Mitch Hale, and other family members, five media witnesses, two lawyers from the Federal Public Defender’s Office and the Oklahoma’s Cabinet Secretary for Public Safety.\n\n\n\nThey had very different reactions to what they saw.\n\n\n\nEmma Rolls, one of Coddington’s lawyers, cried quietly in the witness room during his execution.\n\n\n\nAfter it was over, Mitch Hale told the press that he had taken no “joy” in witnessing the execution, but wanted to be present to “represent” his father. He claimed that seeing Coddington die would allow him and his family to “move on after years of legal proceedings” — even though he was convinced, because Coddington did not use his final words to apologize to the Hale family, that he had never been truly remorseful.\n\n\n\nThe four media witnesses who attended the execution each offered chilling minute by minute accounts of what they had seen.\n\n\n\nOne of them, Reporter Chris Polansky of KWGS in Tulsa, later told a National Public Radio interviewer that “everyone was watching to see if there would be any problems,” as there have been during past Oklahoma executions. “There were no visible convulsions,” he said, “or any other signs that I could see, as a witness, that anything went wrong.” \n\n\n\nWhat Polansky and the other media witnesses said after Coddington’s death might reassure us that we can know, as Koppel said, what capital punishment “is about.” But the few minutes of an execution that witnesses are allowed to see cannot give them — or us — an adequate understanding of the capital punishment process and its meaning.\n\n\n\nLawyers who represent the condemned and those who have gone through the death penalty journey may have that understanding. But for others seeing an execution, as the well-known death penalty defense lawyer David Bruck once noted, may “give a false and misleading picture of the damage and suffering which is necessarily part of the capital punishment process… It doesn't show the effect of this process on anyone else…(and) it creates the illusion the viewer is seeing the truth.”\n\n\n\nNo deeper truth about capital punishment or about the condemned person’s experience can be found in witnessing a person being put to death. I am convinced, as the cultural critic Wendy Lesser says, that doing so can be “nothing short of ghoulish.”\n\n\n\nAustin Sarat (@ljstprof) is the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Jurisprudence and Political Science at Amherst College.

        "description": "As advocates and service providers working on the frontlines of the overdose crisis, we’ve seen firsthand the devastating toll and growth of the overdose epidemic. All around us, people are dying. Families and communities are struggling. Everyday we hear stories of loss and of loved ones and residents trying to find life-saving assistance.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe scale of this public health crisis is staggering – Americans are now more likely to die of an overdose than in a car accident. Throughout the past decade, over 1 million people lost their lives, with 2021 taking more than 107,000 Americans in just 12 months. Existing racial inequities are being compounded, as Black Americans now suffer from higher opioid death rates than white Americans. These numbers will continue to grow with each passing year unless we change the way we deal with substance use, which is why we must focus on public health solutions. That means ending the stigma around substance use and instituting harm-reduction policies that are proven to save lives.\n\n\n\nHow does a crisis causing the deaths of so many people go unaddressed? In part, it’s because of the stigma our country places on people who use drugs. Rather than focusing on the human cost of overdose and on public health solutions, policies dealing with substance use often center on criminalization and punishment, perpetuating racial injustice by design. Because of targeted policing, Black people make up 24 percent of drug arrests, almost double their demographic percentage, and are three times more likely to be arrested for drugs than white people, despite using and selling drugs at the same rates. Additionally, legislators continue to push new laws that disproportionately harm Black, Latinx and Indigenous people by sending them to prison, reducing access to life-saving support.\n\n\n\nHarm reduction is an evidence-based approach that prioritizes keeping people alive. From the distribution of life-saving medicines like naloxone, to syringe service programs that provide education while reducing the spread of infectious diseases, this strategy prevents deaths, protects those who use substances and provides them with options when they are ready to seek treatment.\n\n\n\nHarm reduction is compassionate, recognizing the dignity and humanity of people who use drugs. But it is also grounded in evidence. Hundreds of studies over more than three decades show that syringe service programs reduce overdose deaths and infectious disease transmission rates. States that have expanded access to naloxone, a drug that reverses opiate overdoses, saw double-digit reductions in overdose deaths. For instance, Connecticut Harm Reduction Alliance engaged approximately 3,500 participants, distributed 4,200 Narcan doses, and reversed over 300 drug overdoses in 2021.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn fact, new recipients of syringe service programs are five times more likely to enter drug treatment than those who don’t use the programs. They also save taxpayers millions of dollars in medical treatment costs. However, while the U.S. has increased funding for drug prevention and treatment, there has been little money directed toward evidence-based programs that work with — and save the lives of — people who use drugs.\n\n\n\nCongress and the Biden administration need to do more to keep people alive by increasing access to effective, lifesaving interventions, such as harm reduction services.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTraditionally, federal support has focused on access to drug prevention and treatment services. To expand support for harm reduction and related interventions, Congress and the administration should provide resources for syringe services programs and related harm reduction programs nationwide to help prevent drug overdose and provide access to critical health and support services. They should make naloxone readily available to the people who use drugs, their friends and family and to people in the communities most affected by the overdose crisis. They should communicate often with directly impacted people and their families, harm reduction providers, and community leaders in order to rapidly respond and implement the solutions required to turn the corner on this deadly crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToday, we are at a major inflection point. Most overdose deaths are preventable. But for too long, we have let fear stand in the way of evidence, compassion and common sense. Too many of our children, sisters, brothers, parents, neighbors and friends have been lost.\n\n\n\nWe can either resign ourselves to this incredible loss, or we can take action. Congress and the administration must come together, take a public-health approach to this crisis, and fund effective harm reduction programs.\n\n\n\nMark Jenkins is founder and executive director of the Connecticut Harm Reduction Alliance.\n\n\n\nKassandra Frederique is executive director of the Drug Policy Alliance.",

        "description": "Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n    \n\n  An Atlanta Braves player will be NL Rookie of the Year in 2022. Spencer Strider nearly claimed the award himself last night. Do you know how much fun it is to either go to the ballpark or turn on the TV on any given night this season and wonder which 21-or-23-year-old is going to do something absolutely amazing? That’s been the case for the Braves this season, as the rookie trio of Michael Harris II, Vaughn Grissom and Spencer Strider have taken baseball by storm and hit the ground running at the major league level. It’s to the point now where Harris and Strider have turned the NL Rookie of the Year conversation into an Atlanta-only affair, as there’s no possible way that this particular award will be going to anybody outside of the Braves rookie class. \nLast night was a prime example of what I’m talking about. Before we get into fawning over Spencer Strider, let’s take a little time to talk about Michael Harris. Last night, Harris smashed his 14th homer of the season and left absolutely no doubt about it from the second that his bat connected with the ball. He finished the night with a batting slash line of .298/.344/.523 with an Isolated Power number of .225 and a 138 wRC+. He’s also getting it done with the glove as well — he’s been responsible for 5 DRS and 5 OAA, with his OAA ranking him in the 90th percentile of all outfielders according to Statcast. All of that combined has resulted in Harris putting up 3.7 WAR so far according to Fangraphs, which is absolutely absurd when you consider that he’s doing this after completely skipping Triple-A.\n\nNormally a performance like this would make you a lock for Rookie of the Year, but this is not a normal season and apparently Spencer Strider is not a normal pitcher. Seamlessly transitioning from a bullpen role to a prominent role in the starting rotation isn’t normal. It’s also not normal to not only succeed in that starting rotation role but also to thrive and become one of the top pitchers in all of baseball. It’s also not particularly normal to talk spicy after getting dinked-and-dunked by a divisional rival and then proceed to back up what you were saying the next time you ran into said divisional rival. Spencer Strider is not normal and his performance last night was a clear example of it.\nYou’ve no doubt either seen or heard about what Strider accomplished last night. He made like a buzzsaw and absolutely tore through Colorado’s lineup, striking out an Atlanta-record 16 batters over eight innings while only giving up only two hits. That’s it and that’s all. He didn’t give up any runs and he didn’t walk anybody, either. I feel pretty confident in saying that we may have seen Spencer Strider throw one of the best starts in this franchise’s history in Atlanta, which is saying a lot when you consider who’s been pitching here since the Braves moved down south. The fact that Strider was able to break a strikeout record that was held by John Smoltz is incredible on its own — the fact that he was able to do it as a rookie is simply astonishing. \n\nSpencer Strider’s outing last night brought him to a point where he’s currently sporting a 2.67 ERA and a miniscule 1.84 FIP. He’s striking out just over 13-and-a-half batters per nine innings for a 38.1 percent strikeout rate and yet he’s doing it while only walking nearly three batters per nine innings for a walk rate of 8.3 percent. If we’re being completely honest, it’s not a huge shock to see pitchers come up to the bigs and throw 100 mph heat. \nStrider is not only doing that but he’s proven that he has good command of what he’s throwing on the mound. It’s still not the best walk rate in the world, but you at least have the feeling that Spencer Strider knows exactly where he’s planning on putting a pitch when he throws it. If he can cut his walk rate down even further while keeping the velocity where it’s at, then he could be something special going forward. \nWhile Strider could still have much better to offer in the future, I still think it’s important to appreciate what he’s doing right now because it’s absolutely crazy. Even though I like using WAR as a “cherry on top”-type of stat, I’m not the type to just constantly keep tabs on it. That’s why it was honestly pretty shocking to take a look at those leaderboards in order to see just how good Strider has been when compared to the rest of baseball. Following his start last night, Strider is now at 4.2 fWAR for the season. \n\nThat sounds pretty awesome and it sounds even better when you consider that he’s currently 0.2 fWAR ahead of Max Scherzer and Shohei Ohtani and the first person that Strider is looking up at in the FanGraphs WAR leaderboard is none other than Max Fried. There’s a very good chance that had Spencer Strider started the season in the rotation, he could have potentially been in the conversation for the Cy Young. He probably still might get some votes, which is crazy to think about!\n\n\nThat moment when you find out you just broke a team record   pic.twitter.com/tJgVtUXQeQ— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nAgain, I implore everybody to appreciate what they’re seeing from Spencer Strider right now. For all of the many times that the Braves have had a top pitching prospect come up only to eventually flame out, we as fans should know to appreciate when one of these guys comes up and not only hits but hits big as well. Again, there’s no guarantees about where Strider goes from here when it comes to his further development as a pitcher. Hopefully we continue to see him develop into a potential superstar and hopefully he avoids walking the same path that we’ve seen other star rookie pitchers go down — ones who dominated upon arrival only to either fall to the wayside due to injuries or bad luck or anything else. \nWhile anything’s possible in the future, it’s still a future that figures to be very exciting for both this new crop of Braves players and the fans in general. The fact that we already know that a Braves player will be named Rookie of he Year is exciting and the fact that it’s going to be a choice between a dynamic outfielder and a flame-throwing pitcher makes it even more exciting. As long as guys like Spencer Strider and Michael Harris II are in town, the Braves are in good and capable hands as far as the future is concerned. Long may the reigns of the rookies continue.",

        "link": "https://www.zylstra.org/blog/2022/09/10-thoughts-after-100-annotations-in-hypothes-is/",
        "description": "I&#8217;ve now added over 100 annotations using Hypothes.is (h.), almost all within the last month. This includes a few non-public ones. Two weeks ago I wrote down some early impressions, to which I&#8217;m now adding some additional observations.\n\n100 annotations (in a month) don&#8217;t seem like a lot to me, if h. is a regular tool in one&#8217;s browsing habit. H. says they have 1 million users, that have made 40 million annotations to over 2 million articles (their API returns 2.187.262 results as I write this). H. has been in existence for a decade. These numbers average out to 20 annotations to 2 articles per user. This to me suggests that the mode is 1 annotation to 1 article by a user and then silence. My 100 annotations spread out over 30 articles, accumulated over a handful of weeks is then already well above average, even though I am a new and beginning user. My introduction to h. was through Chris Aldrich, whose stream of annotations I follow daily with interest. He recently passed 10.000 annotations! That&#8217;s 100 times as many as mine, and apparently also an outlier to the h. team itself: they sent him a congratulatory package. H.&#8217;s marketing director has 1348 public annotations over almost 6 years, its founder 1200 in a decade. Remi Kalir, co-author of the (readworthy!) Annotation book, has 800 in six years. That does not seem that much from what I would expect to be power users. My blogging friend Heinz has some 750 annotations in three years. Fellow IndieWeb netizen Maya some 1800 in a year and a half. Those last two numbers, even if they differ by a factor 5 or so in average annotations/month, feel like what I&#8217;d expect as a regular range for routine users. \nThe book Annotation I mentioned makes a lot of social annotation, where distributed conversations result beyond the core interaction of an annotator with an author through an original text. Such social annotation requires sharing. H. provides that sharing functionality and positions itself explicitly as a social tool (&quot;Annotate the web, with anyone, anywhere&quot; &quot;Engage your students with social annotation&quot;). The numbers above show that such social interaction around an annotated text within h. will be very rare in the public facing part of h., in the closed (safer) surroundings of classroom use interaction might be much more prominent. Users like me, or Heinz, Maya and Chris whom I named/linked above, will then be motivated by something else than the social aspects of h. If and when such interaction does happen (as it tends to do if you mutually follow eachothers annotations) it is a pleasant addition, not h.&#8217;s central benefit.\nWhat is odd to me is that when you do indeed engage into social interaction on h., that interaction cannot be found through the web interface of my annotations. Once I comment, it disappears out of sight, unless I remember what I reacted to and go back to that annotation by another user directly, to find my comment underneath. It does show up in the RSS feed of my annotations, and my Hypothes.is-to-Obsidian plugin also captures them through the API. Just not in the web interface.\nDespite the social nature of h., discovery is very difficult. Purposefully &#8216;finding the others&#8217; is mostly impossible. This is both an effect of the web-interface functionality, as well as I suspect because of the relatively sparse network of users (see observation 1). There&#8217;s no direct way of connecting or searching for users. The social object is the annotation, and you need to find others only through annotations you encounter. I&#8217;ve searched for tags and terms I am interested in, but those do not surface regular users easily. I&#8217;ve collated a list of a dozen currently active or somewhat active annotators, and half a dozen who used to be or are sporadically active. I also added annotations of my own blogposts to my blog, and I actively follow (through an RSS feed) any new annotation of my blogposts. If you use h., I&#8217;d be interested to hear about it.\nAnnotations are the first step of getting useful insights into my notes. This makes it a prerequisite to be able to capture annotations in my note making tool Obsidian, otherwise Hypothes.is is just another silo you&#8217;re wasting time on. Luckily h. isn&#8217;t meant as a silo and has an API. Using the API and the Hypothes.is-to-Obsidian plugin all my annotations are available to me locally. However, what I do locally with those notes does not get reflected back to h., meaning that you can&#8217;t really work through annotations locally until you&#8217;ve annotated an entire article or paper in the browser, otherwise sync issues may occur. I also find that having the individual annotations (including the annotated text, in one file), not the full text (the stuff I didn&#8217;t annotate), feels impractical at times as it cuts away a lot of context. It&#8217;s easily retrievable by visiting the url now, but maybe not over time (so I save web archive links too as an annotation). I have a tendency to also grab a local markdown copy of full articles if they are of higher interest to me. Using h. in the browser creates another inbox in this regard (having to return to a thing to finish annotation or for context), and I can obviously don&#8217;t need more inboxes to keep track of. \nIn response to not saving entire articles in my notes environment, I have started marking online articles I haven&#8217;t annotated yet at least with a note that contains the motivation and first associations I normally save with a full article. This is in the same spot as where I add a web archive link, as page note. I&#8217;ve tried that in recent days and that seems to work well. That way I do have a general note in my local system that contains the motivation for looking in more detail at an article.\nThe API also supports sending annotations and updates to h. from e.g. my local system. Would this be potentially better for my workflow? Firefox and the h. add-on don&#8217;t always work flawlessly, not all docs can be opened, or the form stops working until I restart Firefox. This too points in the direction of annotating locally and sending annotations to h. for sharing through the API. Is there anyone already doing this? Built their own client, or using h. &#8216;headless&#8217;? Is there anyone who runs their own h. instance locally? If I could send things through the API, that might also include the Kindle highlights I pull in to my local system. \nIn the same category of integrating h. into my pkm workflows, falls the interaction between h. and Zotero, especially now that Zotero has its own storage of annotations of PDFs in my library.  It might be of interest to be able to share those annotations, for a more complete overview of what I&#8217;m annotating. Either directly from Zotero, or by way of my notes in Obsidian (Zotero annotatins end up there in the end)\nThese first 100 annotations I made in the browser, using an add-on. Annotating in the browser takes some getting used to, as I try to get myself out of my browser more usually. I don&#8217;t always fully realise I can return to an article for later annotation. Any time the sense I have to finish annotating an article surfaces, that is friction I can do without. Apart from that, it is a pleasant experience to annotate like this. And that pleasure is key to keep annotating. Being able to better integrate my h. use with Obsidian and Zotero would likely increase the pleasure of doing it.\nAnother path of integration to think about is sharing annotated links from h. to my blog or the other way around. I blog links with a general annotation at times (example). These  bloggable links I could grab from h. where I bookmark things in similar ways (example), usually to annotate further later on. I notice myself thinking I should do both, but unless I could do that simultaneously  I won&#8217;t do such a thing twice.",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/pixel-assistant-quick-phrase-silence",
        "description": "Quick phrases have been part of Google Assistant for some time now. For those not familiar, Quick phrases are a way to respond and send commands to the Assistant without invoking the &#8220;Hey, Google&#8221; wake phrase. These commands became extremely helpful when it came to Assistant speakers, like being able to simply say &#8220;Stop&#8221; to stop a timer on a Google Nest Hub.\n\n\n\nIn late 2021, with the rollout of the next-gen Google Assistant, Google expanded Quick phrases to the Pixel 6. For example, the phrases available on the phone could &#8220;Stop&#8221; or &#8220;Snooze&#8221; alarms and timers, as well as &#8220;Answer&#8221; or &#8220;Decline&#8221; calls. However, it looks like this feature&#8217;s helpfulness will not end there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrent &#8220;Quick phrases&#8221; available on the Pixel 6\n\n\n\nAccording to an APK teardown done by the team at 9to5Google, support for the quick phrase &#8220;Silence&#8221; was spotted in version 13.34 of the Google app. This should silence the ringing but leave the call unanswered, giving you time to decide. It&#8217;s definitely easier than pressing the volume rocker, especially if your phone is not at arm&#8217;s reach.\n\n\n\nThe new phrase is not yet active but could hopefully debut with the Pixel 7 next month. Armed with the next-gen Tensor chip, I don&#8217;t see why Google wouldn&#8217;t add this to the phone at launch or even during one of the Pixel Feature Drops. Regardless, I hope this also makes it to the Pixel 6 and 6a, as they are both very capable devices that can already handle the existing quick phrases.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

His start went for not, as Paul Fry and J.B. Bukauskas couldn’t hold a 4-2 lead in the 8th inning. Dominic Fletcher singled home Dominic Canzone in the 3rd, following by a 3-run 6th inning that gave Reno a 4-1 lead. Sean Poppen allowed the Manfred Man to score in the 10th, with Reno unable to answer.\nAA: Amarillo Sod Poodles 7, Frisco RoughRiders 4\nBox Score \nJamison Hill turned in a decent outing for Amarillo, holding Frisco to just 1 run in 4 innings, allowing 2 hits, walking 2, and striking out 1. Amarillo took a lead on Blaze Alexander’s home run off the batter’s eye in the 2nd as part of a 2 hit, 2 RBI game. Leandro Cedeño and Andy Yerzy joined the home run parade in the 7th. That built enough of a lead to withstand a late rally by Frisco.\nHigh-A: Hillsboro Hops 2, Tri-City Dust Devils 4\nBox Score\nAJ Vukovich’s first inning home run was the only offensive highlight of the game, setting a Hillsboro club record with his 15th of the year. Hillsboro pitchers allowed a run in each of the first 4 innings, with Avery Short allowing 3 runs (2 earned) in the first 3 innings. \nLow-A: Visalia Rawhide 5, Lake Elsinore Storm 8\nBox Score\nThe big inning doomed Visalia, as Lake Elsinore scored 6 runs off Emmanuel Acosta. Acosta failed to retire all six batters he faced, with three of them scoring after leaving the game. That spoiled a good start from Yu-Min Lin, who held the Storm to 1 run in 5 innings on 5 hits, 3 walks, and 5 strikeouts. David Martin had a pair of doubles and a walk in his Visalia debut, driving home 2 runs.",

        "description": "Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Answering this week’s questions for the weekly mailbag Happy Friday, everyone, and welcome to this week's edition of the Brew Crew Ball mailbag!\nThis edition will be a bit longer than most because you had some great questions. I wanted to get to as many of them as possible. Let's dive in!\nleche10 asks:\nAfter a month, what’s your grade on the Trade Deadline? Rogers and Bush have both regressed since arriving in Milwaukee. Rosenthal was a complete waste. Offense is still sputtering and hyper-dependent on the long ball. I know it helps that Hader has completely imploded and Rogers (4.50 ERA) is considerably better right now, but did we do enough to make our team better? What seems to be Stearns’ issue with making a bigger impact at the deadline?\nI've had a more optimistic take on the trade deadline than most, particularly from a pure transaction standpoint.\nIt became much more difficult to argue that the Hader trade improved the current big-league roster (or even maintained the status quo) once Dinelson Lamet turned out to be a salary-swap piece and was promptly cut. However, after Hader's collapse in San Diego and Rogers' steady performance since the four-run outburst in St. Louis, one could argue that the Brewers' bullpen has been better off since the swap than the Padres' relief unit.\nRobert Gasser looked from the start like an intriguing project for Milwaukee's pitching development system, and the early returns are highly encouraging. After four excellent starts in Double-A, the Brewers aggressively promoted Gasser to Triple-A earlier this week. He now looks like an option to make a notable impact on next year's big-league staff. Meanwhile, Esteury Ruiz was promoted yesterday when rosters expanded.\nI liked the Bush trade quite a bit and still do. It may have cost a prospect with promising stuff in left-hander Antoine Kelly, but Bush has arguably the best raw stuff of any reliever who was on the trading block and is controlled through the 2024 season. Unfortunately, he has demonstrated inconsistency with his new team. Bush has looked untouchable in most of his outings, but poor control has plagued him on a handful of occasions.\nThe Brewers knew they were assuming some risk with the Rosenthal deal, but I didn't mind it as an upside move. The metrics on his fastball in bullpen sessions were comparable to those from his dominant 2020 season. Had he returned to health as expected, Rosenthal could have added a valuable high-leverage arm to the bullpen for September and the postseason. Tristan Peters seemed like a steep price for two months at best of Rosenthal, but he was unlikely to make much of an impact in a system deep with outfielders and has struggled since the Giants promoted him to Double-A.\nOn paper, the Brewers set themselves up to lose Hader while still being just as well off, if not better, due to their subsequent bullpen moves. Unfortunately, Bush's inconsistency and Rosenthal's new injury derailed that plan.\nDavid Stearns drew plenty of criticism for saying there was \"no glaring need\" in the lineup, but I don't have any issues with how they handled the deadline from an offensive standpoint. The Brewers could do better at just about every position on the diamond, and Stearns did not rule out any acquisitions. However, they also could do much worse. At the time of the deadline, Omar Narvaez and Tyrone Taylor were the only semi-regular position players with below-average slash lines, and even they were closer to average than genuinely awful.\n  \n        \n  \nThe Brewers effectively had an average-ish offense, and this year's trade market was mainly a seller's market that consisted of average-ish bats. There were a few standouts like Juan Soto and Josh Bell, but fewer premium options meant more teams contending for the same players, driving the prices up for those premium players. This also meant that the price tags for those average-ish hitters exceeded the Brewers' comfort level.\nIn past seasons, the Brewers added rental bats like Mike Moustakas and Eduardo Escobar to supplement their lineup, but they did so at the cost of \"AAAA\" players like Brett Phillips, Jorge Lopez, and Cooper Hummel. These players were unlikely to make an impact in Milwaukee. In this year's market, the Brewers may have had to part with a more highly-regarded prospect to add the same kind of hitter.\nThe front office evidently decided it wasn't worth it, and I agree with them. David Stearns and Matt Arnold have a strong track record of flipping prospects who don't pan out and retaining the ones who do, so I trust their judgment. I think they pivoted to bullpen help because of the limited offensive market. They did a fine job from a transaction standpoint, but the risks they took haven't panned out as well as they had reason to believe.\nThe area in which the Brewers truly deserve criticism is the leadership department. Eric Lauer's comments on the Hader trade pointed toward poor communication with the players about the team's direction, which represents a failure by management. Communication was going to be key after an unorthodox trade of a popular player, and it appears the Brewers dropped the ball there.\nIf you're looking for an overall letter grade, I'll give them a C+. It was not a great deadline, but I do not believe it was nearly as poor as many believe.\nnullacct asks:\nMitchell had a couple of heroic moments, yay!And after yesterday he is now hitting .222 with a .856 OPS and a 44% K rateSo, he’s basically Hiura except he’s valuable defensively?What does the future hold for this man\nI was happy for Mitchell when he got the call, and I was at the stadium when he hit a game-tying blast on Monday for his first career home run. It was an awesome moment. However, he wasn't my first choice for a promotion.\nMitchell has the best raw athleticism of any prospect in Milwaukee's system, possessing an intriguing combination of power and speed. However, his current offensive profile does not enable him to take advantage of those raw abilities. Mitchell cut his strikeout rate down a bit in 20 games in Triple-A, but he punched out at an alarming 27.7% rate in 335 Double-A plate appearances across 2021 and 2022.\nMitchell hits the ball hard but pounds it into the ground far too often. His ground ball rate has been above 60% at every level except Triple-A, where it was still 57.4%. Mitchell doesn't put enough balls in play to maximize his speed on the bases. When he does put it in play, he doesn't elevate enough to take advantage of his raw power. That's not a combination that bodes well for big-league success.\nThe silver lining is that Mitchell is still relatively inexperienced in professional baseball, and his development is not finished. However, I don't expect him to find much big-league success from the outset.\nLerch&amp;Brouhard asks:\nYuni or Sogard? If you had to sign one!\nSogard could at least play solid defense at second base, so I would (begrudgingly) choose him.\nSANDYTOLAN asks:\nCurious if you see anything promising in Lucas Erceg. The one-time college slugger who switched to relief pitching last year, overcame a big alcohol addiction, really seemed like a guy to root for. Earlier this year he looked like he just wasn’t gonna cut it. But in his last 10 appearances at Nashville, he has given up 1ER in 14IP, with 7H, 5BB 20K.He seems to really be under the radar. But with numbers like this, maybe he could really help the Brewers next year. What do you think?\nErceg has made remarkable progress on the mound and has hit his stride in Triple-A Nashville. He has allowed just one run in his last 14 innings, striking out 15 against five walks. He's been sitting in the upper-90s with some sink on his fastball all season, topping out at 100 mph.\n\n\nLucas Erceg with a season-high 6 Ks in 3 innings on Saturday, his longest outing of 2022.He sat 97 mph, topping at 99.5   #ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/v7ZucmFOzT— Brewers Player Development (@BrewersPD) August 15, 2022\n\n\n\nI think the stuff is good enough to play at the big-league level, but I don't expect him to get that opportunity with the Brewers. This year is Erceg's sixth full minor-league season since being drafted in 2016, making him eligible for minor-league free agency this winter. Erceg has technically played five full seasons in the minor leagues, but the canceled minor-league season in 2020 still counted toward this clock.\nMaybe Erceg sticks around on a new contract, but it seems more likely that he joins a rebuilding organization that gives him an immediate opportunity on their big-league roster in 2023.\nlohausfan asks:\nIf you were The Chicken (CC), how would you set your rotation for a three-game playoff series? Bearing in mind that you potentially have another series ahead after it ends. Same question for five (which in a vacuum would probably be similar to three) and seven games.\nIn the postseason, winning the game in front of you becomes even more critical, so you can't think too far ahead. Burnes, Woodruff, and Peralta are the obvious choices for the first three games of a series. Aaron Ashby would be my fourth starter. Eric Lauer would be my fifth starter if needed, but I much prefer to have him in relief. His peripherals have been very shaky since June, and I think he could dominate with his fastball playing up even more in shorter bursts.\nkozlow22 asks:\nWhile Sal Frelick has hit really well at AAA, what level of concern should there be over is complete lack of power? Or maybe better put, what level of power does he need to show before he can play in the MLB. While he is young and started the season in A ball and some power will likely come with development, he still has has 0 homeruns in AAA in over 100 PAs. My concern level is low but I also dont think it would be extremely hard to be an impact bat in the MLB with no power. Obviously there are other ways to be productive but hitting homeruns helps a lot. The same could be said for Ruiz but he did hit 4 in san diegos AAA so I figured the question was better suited for Frelick.\nFrelick has very little home run power, but he has gone deep seven times in about 450 plate appearances this season. The power hasn't shown up yet in Triple-A, but I think he can settle in around 10 home runs each year by the time his development is complete. Regardless, I don't think the Brewers are counting on him to be a major run-producer. His approach is best suited for the leadoff spot and would provide a change of pace in a lineup of largely similar hitters.\nGorilla Bean asks:\nHow do you think the DH has affected the Brewers? Has it hurt them?\nSeveral people asked this question in a few different ways. Prior to the addition of the designated hitter in the National League, the pitcher usually hit in the ninth spot in the order. Later in games, pinch hitters or players who entered via a double switch often filled that spot.\nThe question is if Craig Counsell's use of these substitutions gave the Brewers a greater offensive advantage over the rest of the league than the designated hitter has given them this year. While an imperfect analysis, the easiest way to get a general idea is to compare Milwaukee's past league-adjusted production out of the ninth spot to their current output from the DH spot.\nIn 2021, the Brewers' received a collective .439 OPS from the final spot in the order, which translates to a 56 OPS+ for that particular split. OPS+ splits include both leagues, so all National League teams ranked below average. Milwaukee was still near the bottom, though, with their OPS from the nine spot ranking second-to-last in the Senior Circuit.\nIf we go back to 2018 and 2019, the Brewers had a clear advantage over many of their National League contemporaries, ranking fourth with a .543 OPS from the final spot in the order. Those seasons also featured rosters that forced Craig Counsell to be the most creative and hands-on with his managing style. That's probably not a coincidence.\nThis season, the Brewers rank eighth in DH OPS at .710, putting them squarely in the middle of the pack. It appears they have lost somewhat of an edge since the new collective bargaining agreement permanently instituted the universal DH. However, they did themselves no favors by settling for a league-average bat in Andrew McCutchen (97 wRC+) to fill that role most of the time.\nThanks for your questions! I'll be back for another round next week.",

Its brilliant cast don’t put a foot wrongBad Sisters (Apple TV+) is an adaptation of The Out-Laws – the Belgian series by Malin-Sarah Gozin, which was described by this here very organ as “the blackest comedy ever”. To know that it has been retooled by, and stars, Sharon Horgan is to be reassured that nothing will be lost in translation. This well-founded hope is confirmed within the first few minutes, which see widow Grace (Anne-Marie Duff) pressing down hard on her dead husband’s genitals to try to rid him of the erection she has just noticed he is maintaining in his coffin. “Post-mortem priapism,” explains her sister Ursula (Eva Birthistle). “It’s not uncommon. Especially after a violent death.”The stage, in so many ways, is set. There are five Garvey sisters – Eva (Horgan) is the oldest and took on the maternal role after their parents died. Ursula is a nurse, a mother of three and sensible, except for the affair she is having with her photography teacher. Bibi (Sarah Greene) is fiercely uncompromising, Becka (Eve Hewson) is the slightly aimless baby of the family, and Grace is the only one even slightly mourning the death of her spouse John Paul (Claes Bang).

        "description": "Every performance is quietly brilliant in this series, set in a New Orleans medical centre in the days following the 2005 tragedy – where medics do their best in unrelentingly terrible conditionsRyan Murphy tried for years to make a series of his American Crime Story anthology series out of Sheri Fink’s bestselling and meticulous book, Five Days at Memorial, about how the terrible aftermath of Hurricane Katrina played out in one New Orleans medical centre. You can see why it defeated him. The story of how a manmade disaster overlaid the natural one, compounding the suffering of innumerable people – and almost certainly leading to the deaths of at least 45 of them – is simply too bleak for his sensibility.John Ridley (the writer of 12 Years a Slave) and Lost showrunner Carlton Cuse took it on instead, for Apple TV+, and have ended up creating something extraordinary. Set almost wholly within the increasingly fetid and hopeless confines of Memorial hospital – with each of the first five episodes devoted to a single one of the five fateful days in 2005 that unfolded after Hurricane Katrina made landfall – it is utterly brutal and utterly compelling. This is at a slight cost to character delineation and development. Every performance (especially Vera Farmiga as Dr Anna Pou, Julie Ann Emery as nurse Diane Robichaux and Raven Dauda as the daughter eventually forced to abandon her dying mother) is quietly brilliant, but their situations are so unrelentingly terrible that they inevitably become slightly emblematic rather than individualised figures.

By his accounts, 357 scripted shows were launched in the first six months of 2022 alone, up 16% from a year ago. This, obviously, is more television than any one person can possibly watch. The good news is that with Netflix faltering and HBO Max intent on cratering before our very eyes, a contraction is due any minute now.The bad news is that there are now more TV shows than ideas. It has become easier than ever to find premises and plots that have been unknowingly shared between different series, as you will see if you’re diligent enough at following the thread along one of this year’s hottest trends: the stressed-out chef show.

        "description": "In the US, streaming viewers are starting to take over the number for cable while new data suggests the average broadcast viewer is older than expectedFounded in 2006, the CW turns 16 years old this year, which feels right considering it has always branded itself as the younger, hipper brother to the bigger networks. The buzziest series on the CW are centered on teenagers: Riverdale, a modern, supernatural update on the Archie comics, and All American, about a Black high school football player recruited to play for a school in Beverly Hills. They also have two superhero shows, Superman &amp; Lois and The Flash, which also theoretically appeal to younger audiences. Youthful content, however, does not necessarily equal youthful viewers, which we learned this week when it was revealed that the average age of a CW viewer is 58.In a twist worthy of Riverdale itself, which recently featured a time travel storyline, the hip, young viewers of the CW have suddenly turned middle-aged. Or maybe not. The data cited by Nexstar, a media group that has just bought a controlling interest in the network, tracks only initial viewership and some DVR viewing. It says nothing of viewing on streaming services, where younger viewers increasingly get their television. For that, the youth has options. The CW has its own streaming site where shows can be viewed for free, but they also have a licensing deal with Netflix. In other words, while it’s possible Riverdale and All American are being watched by gray-haired viewers, most of its fans are still watching it on Netflix while keeping one eye on TikTok.

        "description": "Showrunners for the Netflix series Wednesday have followed in the footsteps of many others by calling their show a movie but it’s a trend that needs to stopThere’s a curious mutation spreading around the entertainment industry, altering form and tampering with time. TV series, it seems, keep turning into movies. They’re probably not patient zero, but the showrunners of Game of Thrones are undoubtedly superspreaders for this current wave, having ignited controversy by describing their show as “a 73-hour movie” back in 2017. Soon, the TV landscape was swarming with series rebranded as films of varying yet uniformly hefty length. The idiom was repurposed frequently enough to reach “bane of all existence” status for TV critics, and to inspire a Shouts and Murmurs piece in the New Yorker. Now, to quote a show that ignited a powder keg of debate over the difference between cinema and television not so long ago, “It is happening again.”Miles Millar and Alfred Gough, co-creators of the upcoming Addams Family reboot Wednesday for Netflix, uttered the magic words in an interview with Vanity Fair earlier this week, stating that “the ambition of the show was to make it an eight-hour Tim Burton movie.” (Burton is on board as executive producer and director for four of the eight episodes.) They’ve dusted off the old soundbite during a period of increased critique for it, with The Boys head honcho Eric Kripke having recently thrown down the gauntlet on the matter. Of TV directors who claim to have conceived their series as a manner of movie, he said: “Fuck you! No you’re not! Make a TV show. You’re in the entertainment business.” In Olivier Assayas’s new miniseries reimagining his 1996 showbiz satire Irma Vep, the director of the show within the show invokes the “eight-hour movie” adage in an interview as if to poke fun at the phrase’s inescapability. Speaking with me at Cannes earlier this year, he confirmed that he doesn’t share the mindset, and that this line shares the soupçon of caricature accenting the rest of the series.

People have too many streaming options and not enough money, and if Lord of the Rings fails to bring in a decent number of subscribers, it might spell curtains for Amazon Prime Video.Luckily, though, the world’s greatest authority when it comes to adapting JRR Tolkien texts to screen is still around. Peter Jackson has not only made six Tolkien movies at this point – winning 17 Oscars and taking almost $6bn at the box office in the process – he also stands at the cutting edge of visual effects and entertainment-based AI.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3625949-mark-kelly-votes-like-a-california-liberal-not-an-arizonan/",
        "description": "Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly (Ariz.) likes to pretend he’s a moderate everyman in a black t-shirt who aligns with Arizona voters. But his partisan record tells a different story. Since he was elected, Kelly has voted with Joe Biden&nbsp;94 percent&nbsp;of the time — and Arizonans have paid the price.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVoters in the Grand Canyon State see through Kelly’s masquerade. On Election Day, they’ll reject his radical agenda.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nArizona has some of the&nbsp;worst inflation in the country, with prices skyrocketing for everything from kitchen staples to back-to-school supplies. Residents are&nbsp;on track to pay nearly $10,000 more in added costs annually.&nbsp;That’s over $800 per month. In fact, Maricopa and Pinal Counties have had the&nbsp;worst inflation&nbsp;of any tracked metro area in the continental U.S., with prices spiking&nbsp;12 percent. It’s no wonder voters say inflation and the economy are their top issues going into the election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Kelly has only made matters worse. He&nbsp;cast the deciding vote&nbsp;for Biden’s wasteful spending spree that fueled inflation. He helped Biden&nbsp;spend nearly $1 billion in taxpayer money&nbsp;sending stimulus checks to criminals in prison — including the&nbsp;Boston Marathon Bomber. He voted for Biden’s&nbsp;so-called Inflation Reduction Act, which will only raise taxes on families during a recession and&nbsp;hire 87,000 new IRS agents, increasing audits on the middle class. All of this heaps additional pressure on hardworking Arizonans.\n\n\n\nVoters are getting sticker shock at the gas pump too, thanks to Kelly rubber-stamping Biden’s war on American energy production. Kelly voted to&nbsp;shut down the Keystone XL pipeline four times. He supported a&nbsp;ban on fracking three times. He&nbsp;blocked&nbsp;new energy production on federal lands. And he opposed an effort to stop Biden’s irresponsible&nbsp;scheme&nbsp;to ship oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to foreign countries, including&nbsp;China. As a result,&nbsp;gas prices in Arizona are roughly $4.00&nbsp;per gallon. Basic tasks like driving to work now cost a small fortune.\n\n\n\nArizonans are also less safe thanks to the Biden-Kelly&nbsp;border crisis. Democrats’ open-borders agenda has made the situation the&nbsp;worst in modern history. Fentanyl&nbsp;seizures&nbsp;doubled last year, meaning even more drugs are making it through undetected. Smugglers now appear to be targeting children with&nbsp;candy-like fentanyl pills&nbsp;— weeks before Halloween.&nbsp;At least 53 murderers,&nbsp;66 terrorism suspects&nbsp;and&nbsp;283 sex offenders&nbsp;have entered the country through gaps in our border since October. Meanwhile, Arizona families in border towns are dealing with the “worst criminal activity” they’ve ever seen.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Kelly refuses to do the bare minimum. He voted to&nbsp;defund border wall construction three times. He refused to renew&nbsp;Title 42, the last bastion of President Trump’s border policy that immediately deported illegal immigrants. He declined to hire&nbsp;additional Border Patrol agents&nbsp;despite&nbsp;funding “sanctuary cities\"&nbsp;and&nbsp;giving illegal immigrants with social security numbers taxpayer-paid stimulus checks. And he&nbsp;broke his promise&nbsp;to make the Biden administration pay for the Arizona National Guard troops Governor Ducey deployed to the border.\n\n\n\nAs the 50th vote in a split Senate, Kelly could have shielded Arizona from Biden’s destructive wish list. Instead, he’s ratified almost every Biden policy that’s come his way. That might resonate in deep blue California. But in Arizona, it simply exposes just how out-of-touch Kelly really is.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVoters want a senator who is truly an independent voice, and they’re finding it in Republican Blake Masters. As a successful businessman, political outsider, and father of three, Masters is running to ensure that families from Tuba City to Sierra Vista can thrive. Not only will he stand up to the radical Left’s destructive policies, but he’ll also go on offense to fix the economy, bring down costs, secure the border, reverse failing schools and stop rising crime. These are the issues that will win the day.\n\n\n\nMark Kelly loves to talk about his&nbsp;time with NASA. But the only space analogies Arizonans care about are the skyrocketing prices they’re paying at the grocery store and the astronomical surge of illegal immigrants pouring over our southern border. Kelly is a blue-state senator trapped in a battleground state. This November, Arizona voters will hold him accountable.\n\n\n\nRonna McDaniel is chairwoman of the Republican National Committee.&nbsp;",

        "description": "World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that the recent decline in monkeypox cases that has been observed in North America and Europe is evidence that the current outbreak can be stopped or eliminated outright.\n\n\n\nTedros made note of how monkeypox has quickly grown in prominence from being a little-known virus that was often only discussed within the context of countries where it is endemic.\n\n\n\nWith over 50,000 cases and 16 deaths due to monkeypox confirmed this year, Tedros said the number of cases has already exceeded the number of reported infections in the years since monkeypox was first identified in 1958.\n\n\n\n\"It’s encouraging to see that in some countries in Europe and North America we now see a sustained decline in cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of public health interventions and community engagement to track infections and prevent transmission,\" said Tedros.\n\n\n\nAccording to information from the European Union, reported monkeypox cases have seen a continued decline since peaking in mid-July. The current number of reported cases in EU countries now reflects the levels that were observed in the early parts of the outbreak.\n\n\n\nThroughout the monkeypox outbreak, the U.S. has tended to follow the epidemiological trends observed in Europe. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has indicated a slight decline in reported cases in recent weeks. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said last week that she was \"cautiously optimistic,\" though the rate of decrease is uneven across the country.\n\n\n\n\"These signs confirm what we have said consistently since the beginning: that with the right measures, this is an outbreak that can be stopped,\" Tedros said. \"And in regions that do not have animal-to-human transmission, this is a virus that can be eliminated.\"\n\n\n\nHealth officials in the U.S. have attributed this recent decline to a combination of early vaccination efforts as well as a change in behavior among men who have sex with men (MSM), the demographic most affected by the current outbreak. A CDC survey found that about half of men who have sex with men have reduced their number of sexual encounters and partners due to the outbreak.\n\n\n\nTedros commented on Friday that the MSM community is \"highly resilient,\" as evidenced by its decades-long collaboration with the WHO to fight the spread of HIV.\n\n\n\n\"These communities are highly resilient, and are often health literate, well-organized and proactive in managing sexual health,\" he said. \"We learn from working with you.\"",

The project used Google Tag Manager to allow code to be injected into the project frontend (often for analytics, ads, or marketing purposes), which was used by the attacker to insert malicious code into the project UI that specifically targeted whale accounts—that is, those with large balances.Kyber identified and remedied the issue after two hours of investigating it, and only two wallets were affected. Kyber promised to compensate the users who lost funds, and also tried to tempt the hacker into returning funds by allowing them to keep 15% of the stolen money as a \"bounty\" (~$40,000).\n        \n            \n              \n                \"Notice of Exploit of KyberSwap Frontend — All funds will be reimbursed\"\n               , Kyber Network",

Wallabies eat the native shrubs, hindering native plants and wildlife from flourishing. ‘Here in Aotearoa, we love Aussies visiting us', Peeti said.

        "description": "Sam Navarro-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Sandy Alcantara and Charlie Morton will start Friday’s Marlins vs. Braves game at Truist Park. Full lineups and game notes in here. Welcome to Friday’s Marlins (55-75, -78 RD) vs. Braves (81-51, +141 RD) game thread. Rain passed through the Atlanta area earlier in the day, but that shouldn’t impact the game. The Braves are one head-to-head win away from clinching the season series between these teams.\nIt’s the opening game of a new series, which means we’ve got free prop bets and an hour-long livestream with the Fish Stripes staff and special guests.\n\n\nUse this Fish Picks link prior to every Marlins series to submit your predictions. The eighth inning of the contest has just begun and it runs through September 15. \n\nMarlins Game Notes\n\n\nMarlins Starting Lineup\n\n3B Joey Wendle (84 wRC+ this season, 59 wRC+ over last 30 days)\nRF Brian Anderson (102, 80)\nDH Garrett Cooper (109, 37)\nCF JJ Bleday (97, 113) \n2B Charles Leblanc (125, 99) \nC Jacob Stallings (66, 105)\n1B Lewin Díaz (43, 38) \nLF Jerar Encarnación (71, 72) \nSS Miguel Rojas (71, 33) \n\nRHP Sandy Alcantara (190 ERA+ this season, career 134 ERA+) \n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n      Alcantara’s 2022 pitch distribution and Statcast percentile rankings\n  \n\nLineup Changes from Previous Game: Encarnación and Rojas in, Jon Berti and Peyton Burdick out; Wendle switches from SS to 3B\nPregame Roster Moves: RHP Jeff Brigham and OF Bryan De La Cruz recalled from Triple-A Jacksonville\nAdditional Notes: Berti’s availability off the bench is unclear after exiting on Wednesday with right hip soreness...Rare off day for Burdick who had started 23 out of 25 games since being called up...Rojas (.526 OPS in 19 PA) has the most head-to-head history with Morton among active Marlins players...De La Cruz was outstanding during his stint in Jacksonville. Of course, this season has reinforced how weak the correlation is between Triple-A and MLB stats...Roster expansion gives the Marlins a nine-man bullpen. They won’t be asked to do much tonight with Alcantara on the mound.\n\nBraves Starting Lineup\n\nDH Ronald Acuña Jr. (118, 137) \nSS Dansby Swanson (118, 74) \n3B Austin Riley (152, 117) \n1B Matt Olson (124, 106)\nC Travis d’Arnaud (113, 168)\nCF Michael Harris II (138, 179)\n2B Vaughn Grissom (128, 128)\nLF Marcell Ozuna (78, -20) \nRF Robbie Grossman (77, 73)\n\nRHP Charlie Morton (101 ERA+ this season, career 101 ERA+) \n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n      Morton’s 2022 pitch distribution and Statcast percentile rankings\n  \n\nNotes: The Braves have only been shut out three times all season...Acuña (.935 OPS in 26 PA) has the most head-to-head history with Sandy Alcantara among players on the Braves active roster.\n\nHow to Watch/Listen/Follow\nFirst pitch is scheduled for 7:20 p.m. ET. Watch exclusively on Apple TV+ or listen to the radio broadcast on Fox Sports 940 Miami. Out-of-market fans can not stream the game on MLB.TV in this case.\nI will handle the game recap article.\nAll Marlins minor league affiliates are also in action.

        "description": "Venice film festival: A staggeringly good opening set piece is the high point of Romain Gavras’s gritty thriller about police racismRomain Gavras’s new drama-thriller is about racism, violence and injustice in the Paris banlieues – broadly in the tradition of Mathieu Kassovitz’s La Haine and Ladj Ly’s Les Misérables. It’s spectacular and immersive, with a sensational opening. But it gets bogged down in its own one-note, one-tempo uproar and open-ended parkour camerawork – impressive though that is – and suffers from a number of sneaky false-flag get-out clauses that feel like a cop-out.It tells the story of four brothers of Algerian origin in the same tough Athena housing estate. Idir has just been killed by a bunch of cops – or guys in cop uniforms – for daring to talk back, an atrocity captured on a viral video. Abdel (Dali Benssalah) is a decorated army hero, Moktar (Ouassini Embarek) is a coke-dealing gangster and Karim (Sami Slimane) is a local guy seething with rage at his brother’s racist murder.

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/guardians-zach-plesac-aaron-civale-injured-list.html",
        "description": "3:22pm: Manager Terry Francona tells reporters that the team believes Plesac suffered the fracture in his last start, when he punched the ground in frustration after surrendering a home run to Jake Lamb (Twitter link via Mandy Bell of MLB.com).\nThat&#8217;s the second time in his career that Plesac has sustained an injury while expressing frustration. He broke his right thumb last May when &#8220;aggressively&#8221; tearing off his shirt following a poor outing against the Twins. Plesac was also disciplined by the team in 2020 after violating the club&#8217;s Covid-19 protocols and subsequently voicing his frustration in a since-deleted Instagram video.\n2:54pm: Plesac has a fractured fifth metacarpal (pinkie finger) in his right hand, the team announced.\n2:47pm: The Guardians have placed right-handers Zach Plesac and Aaron Civale on the injured list &#8212; Plesac due to a fractured right hand and Civale due to forearm inflammation. Right-hander Cody Morris, just reinstated from the 60-day injured list yesterday when rosters expanded to 28 players, will make his Major League debut and start tonight&#8217;s game in place of Plesac. Cleveland has recalled right-hander Xzavion Curry and lefty Kirk McCarty from Triple-A Columbus to take the spots of Plesac and Civale on the active roster.\nPlesac, 27, is fourth on the Guardians in games started (23) and innings pitched (127). He&#8217;s worked to a 4.39 ERA with an 18.1% strikeout rate, 6.8% walk rate and 40.7% grounder rate. ERA alternatives like FIP (4.50) and SIERA (4.40) generally agree with that assessment of his work so far in 2022. It&#8217;s not in line with the form that Plesac displayed in his first two seasons, when he logged a 3.32 ERA through his first 29 big league starts, but he&#8217;s settled in as a viable back-of-the-rotation option in Cleveland over the past couple seasons.\nCivale, also 27, is making his third trip to the injured list this season. He&#8217;s missed time with a glute injury and a sprained right wrist, but this is his first forearm-related issue on the season. While Civale&#8217;s overall 5.40 ERA is an obvious eyesore, he&#8217;s pitched quite well of late. Since returning from that wrist injury in late June, he&#8217;s taken the ball on nine occasions and worked to a 3.68 ERA while striking out exactly a quarter of his opponents and issuing walks at a tidy 6.1% clip.\nIt&#8217;s a poorly timed pair of injuries for the Guardians &#8212; not that there&#8217;s a &#8220;good&#8221; time to place 40% of a rotation on the injured list &#8212; as they&#8217;ve already dropped back-to-back games and seen the Twins climb back to within one game of the AL Central lead. The White Sox, meanwhile, have picked up back-to-back wins and trimmed their own deficit to a manageable four games. The AL Central, at this point, is the only division in Major League Baseball with three teams legitimately vying for the division crown.\nWith two vacancies in the rotation, the Guardians can turn to Morris and Curry as alternatives in the short-term. The 25-year-old Morris could potentially have been in the rotation right now had he not suffered a strained teres major back in Spring Training &#8212; an injury that shelved him until early August. He was selected to the 40-man roster in November after posting a dominant 1.62 ERA and 93-to-20 K/BB ratio in 61 minor league innings last year, and he&#8217;s been outstanding on his minor league rehab stint thus far. Between the 2021-22 seasons, Morris has 52 innings of Triple-A ball under his belt, during which he&#8217;s posted a 1.90 ERA with a huge 40.6% strikeout rate against an 8.9% walk rate.\n\nCurry, meanwhile, made his MLB debut earlier this season, allowing three runs in a five-inning spot start against the visiting Tigers. The 24-year-old is generally ranked between Cleveland&#8217;s No. 10 and No. 20 prospect on various evaluations of the system. He&#8217;s been hit pretty hard in two Triple-A starts since being sent back to the minors, but his overall numbers between Double-A and Triple-A this season remain solid: 4.00 ERA, 25.9% strikeout rate, 8.3% walk rate in 108 innings.",

        "description": "Sitting out this one. | Brace Hemmelgarn/Minnesota Twins/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Think the series win for the White Sox starts to set things right? Not exactly We’ve been told all season long that the White Sox have an easy second-half schedule (they do) and will play better against lesser competition. \nBut we can’t get ahead of ourselves. The White Sox have played all season as if the division was handed to them in March, so we won’t make the same mistake here.\nThe following is an attempt to examine how the schedule will likely play out, updated as each series finishes up, every few days. \nI have tried to be evenhanded with these series matchups. The logic of Chicago getting swept in San Diego is that it’s a long second leg of a trip, after a demoralizing series loss in Minnesota, with the bolstered Padres fighting to host a playoff series. The White Sox also ran out of gas by season’s end in 2020 and 2021.\nWill Cleveland win five of six to end 2022? That’s tough to do, but the Royals will have much earlier cashed in their season, and the Guardians get nine games at home overall to end the year.\nThere are very few sweeps all told, so this presumes that the AL Central clubs, as bad as they are, never get too hot or too cold — until Cleveland at the end, the White Sox enjoy the hottest stretch, predicted to shoot from three games over at the end of August to 11 up heading into the home stretch.\nSo ... do the White Sox end up with the division title? \n\nHeading into the second halfTwins 50-44Guardians 46-44White Sox 46-46\n(all series are three games unless otherwise specified)\n\nTwelve series into the second half, Cleveland finally lost ground to its competition Well, actually, to just one team chasing it.\nHow’s that? Well, it’s true that rather than winning a home set vs. the Orioles, the Guardians dropped it. So they fall to just a + 2 1⁄2 pace vs. predictions. That means Minnesota, who did as predicted by winning its series vs. the Red Sox, gained a game by just keeping pace.\nThe White Sox, by merely winning their series vs. sweeping, fall one more game off their predicted pace and almost hopelessly behind the harder-charging ALC leaders. Chicago was supposed to take five of six in these past two series, but instead won just two.\nAlso note: Now that the rainout from August between the Sox and Guardians has a mid-month makeup date, those half-games marking the projection below will soon be rounded whole again.\nGuardians 87-74 (+ 2 1⁄2 vs. prediction)Twins 85-77 (+ 1)White Sox 81-80 (- 3 1⁄2 )\n\nJuly 22-24 predicted results

        "description": "As Amy Klobuchar makes her way around the Minnesota State Fair, it’s quickly clear the senator is well known and, well-liked by many.“I just want to thank you for everything you do,” says one fairgoer. Some people who approached Klobuchar last week urged her to shoot again for the White House.“I just told her she should run for president,” said Eugene Sublett. “I think she would make a great candidate, a good president.”It’s something Klobuchar hears a lot amid growing calls for Joe Biden not to seek a second term. Sublett said he thinks Klobuchar would likely be a better second-time presidential candidate following her initial effort in the 2020 race. “She’s got the experience particularly as senator and the committees that she’s on,” Sublett said. “I think she’s done a good job.”Asked about her political aspirations, Klobuchar offers a stock answer and quickly deflects to a group of friendly State Fair day drinkers. “I’m here right here at the Minnesota State Fair because I love Minnesota and I love the people that drink beer before noon,” Klobuchar says with mock solemnity. On issues, Klobuchar said she’s surprised how many people are bringing up the Supreme Court decision striking down federal abortion protections. The right to legalized abortion, she says, is playing large among voters. “They just think it went too far,” she said. At State Fair Walz, Jensen try to make campaigns stickCounty attorney raceCandidates have similar goals, different ways to achieve themAfter primary winsWave of young, diverse Minnesota politicians see path to power And looking ahead to November, Klobuchar said she believes Democrats are in much better shape than many had thought not long ago. In addition to the abortion issues, Klobuchar said she is convinced most Americans are tired of former President Donald Trump’s brand of politics and dysfunctional government. She said she also thinks voters will reward Democrats for pushing through major legislation, including the infrastructure and inflation reduction bills. Former fellow presidential candidates Sen. Amy Klobuchar (left) and U.S. Transportation Secretary Peter Buttigieg stroll through the fairgrounds with Rep. Ilhan Omar and Sen. Tina Smith on Aug. 25.Mark Zdechlik | MPR News“They have Donald Trump out there still trying to disrupt our democracy, spreading lies,” Klobuchar said. “They rejected him once, and he keeps at it. And he doesn’t stop, and there are a whole lot of moderate Republicans and independents in Minnesota and across the country that don’t want to have that chaos again. And that’s putting it mildly.”Klobuchar said she thinks her party is on track to hold the Senate and maybe even buck the trend that typically leaves the party that holds the White House on the losing side of congressional midterm elections. Despite bitter political divides in the country, Klobuchar said it’s rare for anyone to heckle her at the State Fair.“Not that much,” she said. “It’s more silent.”But one man did plow in front of the line of well-wishers at Klobuchar’s fair booth, shouting Russian propaganda about the invasion of Ukraine. “Why doesn’t she stop sending money to Nazis in Ukraine?” he shouted. Just a few days after that scene Klobuchar was in Ukraine meeting with the country’s president and arguing that U.S. funding for the war effort is crucial. The trip certainly added to the impression that Klobuchar may have ambitions beyond Minnesota. University of New Hampshire political scientist Dante Scala said the 2024 presidential race will begin the day after the midterms in early primary states like his — at least for Republicans — provided Trump does not launch a campaign before then. For Democrats, he said all eyes are on Biden and whether he decides to seek a second term. If the president’s decision is not to run, Democratic candidates will quickly emerge, Scala said. In 2020, Klobuchar surprised many with a third place finish in New Hampshire. But Klobuchar dropped out early in the nomination process, struggling to attract support in southern states with large populations of people of color. Scala said that remains a major obstacle for her national ambitions.“If she were to make another run at the presidency, there&#x27;s still that question of how would she appeal to the multiethnic, multiracial electorate of the Democratic Party,&quot; Scala said.",

        "description": "Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A new rookie is welcomed to the fold. Jonathan India and Tyler Stephenson have, by all accounts, had lost seasons due to injuries wrecking their would-be routines. Nick Senzel has been healthy (!!), but he’s performed about as poorly as one could hope given that he’s finally been able to suit up every day.\nJose Barrero struck out while typing this, while each of Hunter Greene and Graham Ashcraft are stuck on the injured list, too. Joey Votto, meanwhile, just had his entire body stitched back together.\nTo say this already transitional year for the Cincinnati Reds has been an abject disaster might be discounting things, really. They’ve managed to flip pieces and re-stock the farm, yes, but along the way they have learned next to nothing concrete about what the next wave of Reds and would-be Reds can accomplish at the big league level despite this entire season being mostly devoted on-paper for just that. \nEnter Spencer Steer, perhaps the top piece pried from the Minnesota Twins at the deadline in the deal that sent Tyler Mahle to the north. The versatile infielder and former 3rd round pick bashed his way up the prospect lists for the Twins, mashed his way into the All-Star Futures Game, and kept right on bonking balls all over the yard when assigned to AAA Louisville post-trade. With the roster expansion given to teams as the calendar turned to September, Steer has earned his call-up with the Reds, and will officially get the chance to play the role of ‘at least he looks like he can mash for the next few years as the Reds get outta this rebuild’ for the remainder of the 2022 season.\nSteer will hit 7th tonight in his big league debut, doing so as the 3B despite having the ability to play just about everywhere on the diamond. The Reds welcome lefty Kyle Freeland and the Colorado Rockies to town to open a weekend series, and will send reliever-turned-rescue-starter Luis Cessa to the bump to open it. First pitch tonight is set for 6:40 PM ET.\nWelcome, Spencer. No pressure.\nReds Lineup\n\n\nSpencer Steer debuts tonight at GABP❗️Powered by @PNCBank pic.twitter.com/8KIo8YtUWi— Cincinnati Reds (@Reds) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nRockies Lineup\n\n\n#Rockies lineup card tonight vs #Reds.

        "description": "Photo by Mitchell Layton/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The mailbag hits on all the main concerns with this roster in the moment and going forward. Good afternoon everyone, it’s time for another edition of the mailbag. Remember to send in your questions for our weekly call by e-mail to pinstripealleyblog [at] gmail [dot] com.\nMSP Giant asks: A postseason pitching opinion please. You only need 3/4 SPs in playoffs. Coles and Montes are a given. Thoughts on (health of) Cortes and Sev? In the bullpen Holmes and Loáisiga are key. Think they will pitch like Holmes early 2022 and Loáisiga 2021? Without superior performance from those four IMO Yanks are toast.\nI don’t have many concerns with Nestor Cortes, given that his IL stint seems to be a true 15-day minor issue. This may in a roundabout way be a boon for him, as it gives him the bit of rest many were expecting given that Cortes is pushing well past his career innings mark already and should allow him to be fresh for the stretch run and postseason.\nLuis Severino, on the other hand, finds himself once again looking to ramp up late in the year after a lengthy time on the shelf. This latest injury isn’t as severe as his previous ones, and since he has gotten to play a decent amount this year it’s not like he’s shaking off a year’s worth of rust again, but there will always be some concern in the back of my mind with that. The Yankees need him to be a starter this time around though, so hopefully he can get locked in with a few weeks to go. (He’ll make his first rehab appearance tonight in Low-A Tampa.)\nAs for Clay Holmes and Jonathan Loáisiga, I am much more confident than I was a few weeks ago about these two. Our own Andrés Chávez dove into how Loáisiga has rounded into form recently, and it seems like he’s pulled himself completely out of the tailspin he was in earlier in the year. Holmes has had promising outings since returning from the IL, and even though his injury doesn’t completely overlap with his collapse from the closer’s role earlier in the year, it appears as though he is back in command following the time off. That’s relative confidence for three of the four players outlined, so if Severino is able to impress there should be a strong boost to the pitching staff arriving again.\nYankeeinmass asks: Looking to the future, Oswaldo Cabrera looks like the real deal, and with Oswald Peraza and Anthony Volpe also looking almost ready for prime time, A) do you see them displacing certain underperforming players like IKF, Torres, and Donaldson next season and if so, B) who plays where? (The rumor is that Volpe’s arm is better suited to second base than shortstop.)\nThe original plan was supposedly to have Isiah Kiner-Falefa hold down the spot until these guys were ready, so metrics or not I believe that Peraza and eventually Volpe (now in Triple-A) will supplant him in the starting lineup. Josh Donaldson and Gleyber Torres are both players I could see getting moved in the offseason, since Donaldson’s final year of his contract seems to be more of a weight than a benefit to hold onto and Torres was already getting shopped at the deadline, so it’s only a matter of when we see the infield shaken up.\nI can see Cabrera and Peraza both starting often for the remainder of this year, but going forward, once Volpe is in the majors I’m not sure if all three will be starters. Cabrera lacks the pedigree of the other two, though he made it to the majors first and has acquainted himself well so far. I could see him taking over Marwin Gonzalez’s role for next year and actually get decent production there, and if he’s with the organization for a while. he could slide into the super utility role that DJ LeMahieu has provided this year in the future, while Peraza and Volpe hold down the middle of the infield. LeMahieu isn’t going anywhere any time soon, so he could slide over to third base to accommodate all of this.\nGrampa Fuzzball asks: Is Frankie Montas Sonny Gray?\nI get the immediate jump to compare Montas to the last pitcher the Yankees swung a big deal for from Oakland. The parallels are immediately in place, but I want to hold off on this indictment for now. Montas has definitely not impressed in his first month in pinstripes, but the image most fans have of Sonny Gray in pinstripes is from 2018, where he was truly dreadful. During the 2017 season when they traded for him, despite the underlying stats (4.87 FIP) showing that he wasn’t looking as good as he was in Oakland, Gray actually held up his end of the bargain still.\nThe immediate area of concern, and a place where both of these pitchers struggled after swapping teams, is the home run rate. Gray’s skyrocketed from 0.74 HR/9 to 1.54 with New York that year, and Montas has elevated his from 1.03 to 1.75. Montas has a month left to get his under control, but if he can’t prevent the long ball from appearing in every start of his then he’s going to struggle regardless of what happens in the rest of his outings.\nErick S. asks: Can Judge get to 62 if he keeps getting the Barry Bonds treatment?\nIt’s certainly frustrating to see pitchers not even give him the chance in many at-bats (though it’s also certainly understandable for them to do so), but at his current pace, he can still reach the record. The thing with Barry Bonds was that even if you took away half of his at-bats with intentional or semi-intentional walks, he’d make them pay for just giving him one good look. The way that Judge has played this year, I’d argue he’s in that same mode right now — the Angels pitched him more carefully than anyone in recent memory, and he still got two blasts off of their staff in three games. When he’s on he’s undeniable at the plate, and it should be thrilling to watch him take his shot at Roger Maris’ mark.",

It’s spectacular and immersive, with a sensational opening. But it gets bogged down in its own one-note, one-tempo uproar and open-ended parkour camerawork – impressive though that is – and suffers from a number of sneaky false-flag get-out clauses that feel like a cop-out.It tells the story of four brothers of Algerian origin in the same tough Athena housing estate. Idir has just been killed by a bunch of cops – or guys in cop uniforms – for daring to talk back, an atrocity captured on a viral video. Abdel (Dali Benssalah) is a decorated army hero, Moktar (Ouassini Embarek) is a coke-dealing gangster and Karim (Sami Slimane) is a local guy seething with rage at his brother’s racist murder.

        "description": "President Biden on Friday announced plans to nominate environmental law expert Richard Revesz to lead the small but powerful White House office in charge of overseeing federal regulations. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which sits within the White House Office of Management and Budget, has been without a permanent occupant since Biden took office. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House said Friday that Biden intends to nominate Revesz, the dean emeritus of New York University’s law school, to serve as administrator of the OIRA, capping months of speculation about who the president would tap to serve in the role.  \n\n\n\nRevesz has extensive experience in environmental law and policy, having written several books on the topic. He served as dean of the NYU School of Law between 2002 and 2013 and also founded the Institute for Policy Integrity at NYU.  \n\n\n\nThe office, which&nbsp;reviews proposed and final executive branch regulations,&nbsp;is currently being headed by a career OIRA official,&nbsp;Dominic Mancini. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRevesz must be confirmed by the Senate, where all Democrats will need to vote in favor of his nomination if Republicans are uniformly opposed to him.  \n\n\n\nIf confirmed, Revesz will be a critical figure in advancing the president’s policies — particularly those in the environmental space.  \n\n\n\nThe position will take on added importance if Democrats lose control of either the House or Senate in the November midterm elections, because in that case Biden will likely lean more heavily on regulations rather than legislation to accomplish his agenda in the next Congress.",

        "description": "Tigers outfielder Austin Meadows took to Twitter this afternoon to announce that he&#8217;s been away from the playing field attending to a mental health concern. Manager A.J. Hinch told reporters (including Evan Woodbery of MLive.com) that Meadows won&#8217;t return to the field this year.\n&#8220;What I have told very few people is that I have been  &#8230; struggling with my mental health in a way that has extended my time away from the game that I love so much,&#8221; Meadows wrote in his statement. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been dealing with this privately with a great team of professionals, but I need to continue to put in the hard work off the field towards feeling mentally healthy.\nWhile I&#8217;ve been back in the clubhouse the past few weeks, and plan to remain with the club through the end of the season, I am still not ready to return to the field. I am so grateful for my family, my teammates, and the Tigers organization for supporting me through this. I can&#8217;t do this alone, and I hope in sharing my experience I can touch at least one person who might be going through their own struggles and encourage them to reach out to someone for help.&#8221;\nMeadows has played in 36 MLB games this year, his first in Detroit after an early April trade from the Rays. He spent some time on the injured list in mid-May battling vertigo-like symptoms. He returned in June but quickly went back on the IL due to COVID-19. While attempting to recover from that illness, Meadows suffered strains of both his Achilles tendons. He was sent on a rehab assignment on August 10 but pulled off a few days later, with the team not disclosing details about his shutdown at the time.\nHinch praised Meadows for going public with news of his battle, saying it was the outfielder&#8217;s decision. &#8220;Austin has chosen the path to be proactive and help others while helping himself,&#8221; the manager said (via Cody Stavenhagen of the Athletic), adding his hope that today&#8217;s announcement will help others dealing with similar struggles. MLBTR sends our best wishes to Meadows.",

        "description": "Photo by Adam Hagy/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Michael Harris II was 10th in fWAR among position players in August Another month, another in-season award for a Braves rookie:\n\n\nHe did it again   Congratulations, @MoneyyyMikeee! pic.twitter.com/c8OMYeCiFm— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nFor those of you keeping score at home, that is now three months in a row that an Atlanta Braves rookie has notched this particular honor. Michael Harris II won the award in June and has received it again in August; Spencer Strider grabbed it in July. The two are really the only frontrunners for the NL’s end-of-season Rookie of the Year award as well.\nHarris finished 10th in MLB (not just among rookies, nor just the NL!) in fWAR in August, with 1.6. He hit .337/.400/.589, a 173 wRC+, with four homers, and continued to provide a bunch of defensive value in center field. His 1.46 WPA for the month was tied for third in MLB. On the season, the 21-year-old, youngest player in MLB, has 3.7 fWAR in 323 PAs, combining nearly best-in-class center field defense with a batting line that is well above average, even on an inputs basis. He’s been the Braves’ third-most productive position player this season despite not being called up until late May, and fifth-most productive player overall. \nAmusingly, the last time an NL team won the Rookie of the Month award thrice in a row, it was also the Braves. Back in 2011, Craig Kimbrel won it in June and August, while Freddie Freeman was the guy in July. (Yordan Alvarez won it three times in a row for the Astros in 2019, as did Aaron Judge for the Yankees in 2017. Mike Trout won it four months in a row in 2012.)\nHarris wasn’t really just the NL Rookie of the Month — he was also pretty much the team’s MVP for the month, as I covered in the August recap. Will one of him and Strider win it in September, too? Stay tuned.",

        "description": "The Southwest Corridor light rail project between Minneapolis and the southwestern suburbs has been wracked by delays and cost overruns that have led to a shortfall of more than half a billion dollars, according to a report released Friday by the state Office of the Legislative Auditor. Since 2011, the cost to build the 14.5 mile extension of the Metro Green Line has more than doubled to $2.74 billion. The legislative auditor found that about $225 million of the additional costs were approved by the Metropolitan Council in April and include a previously deferred station in Eden Prairie, a longer concrete barrier between freight rail and light rail lines and problems with construction of the tunnel through Minneapolis’ Kenilworth Corridor.The federal government is currently funding $969 million of the project and Hennepin County has committed $772 million, with an additional $200 million from the Hennepin County Regional Railroad Authority. The rest of the funding is being supplied by cities and the state of Minnesota. That leaves an estimated $535 million that’s unfunded.  The auditor determined the delays and increases in building costs are due to uncertainty about whether freight rail lines would be relocated. In 2014, the Metropolitan Council decided that plan wouldn’t work, and decided to build the light rail lines next to the freight rail. The legislative auditor’s report also found that the delays themselves have ballooned the budget due to higher costs for materials and the expense of employing consultants and construction contractors for longer time periods.  In a response letter attached to the report, Metropolitan Council Chair Charles Zelle praised the work of the legislative auditor, saying it “carefully documented the main drivers of change on the project’s budget and timeline.”  The legislative auditor did not look at whether the project’s increased costs and delays were justified. Another report released early next year will look at other parts of the project. The findings of the report have led people from across the political spectrum to criticize the Met Council and the project itself.State Sen. Scott Dibble, DFL-Minneapolis, who serves on the state Senate Transportation Finance and Policy Committee, said the Met Council seemed to turn a blind eye to anticipated costs that should have been publicly vetted.“We have an agency that needs a lot more oversight, transparency and accountability,” he said. “The only real remedy to that is to make sure that the people who are in charge of running all of the services and all of the infrastructure for which they’re responsible have to be elected. We can’t simply have a bureaucracy that has no real measure of accountability to the public it serves.”Dibble said he’ll introduce a bill next session to make the Metropolitan Council elected by voters. The members of the council are currently appointed by the governor and confirmed by the state Senate. Dibble said there’s a growing consensus that an organization like the Metropolitan Council that spends billions of taxpayer dollars needs to be transparent to the public and accountable to voters.Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Jensen said the light rail line is “arguably horse crap,” but that it might not be possible to stop the project at this point.“This is going to be dollars taken away from kids, dollars taken away from the hungry, dollars taken away from the homeless,” Jensen said. “There’s a certain pie we have in terms of dollars, and if we’re taking this chunk out to maintain a broken misguided initiative like Southwest light rail, then we’re hurting other people.”An email statement from a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Council said no report can detail all 40 years of a project’s history, but that “this independent report confirms the Met Council has been transparent about the costs and timeline every step of the way.”Planning for the Southwest light rail transit line started in the 1980s. The Hennepin County Regional Railroad Authority purchased land in the Kenilworth Corridor in 1984, when the organization also started to study the possibility of light rail transit in the county.  The light rail line, which will connect downtown Minneapolis to Eden Prairie, Hopkins, Minnetonka and St. Louis Park, has been repeatedly delayed over the years. The Metropolitan Council estimated in 2011 that the line would open by 2018, but has now pushed that estimated date back to 2027.",

I tweeted that iPad, introduced in 2010, was the last such name. A few followers chimed in that iCloud, introduced at WWDC 2011, came later.\n\niCloud was the last new Apple product or service introduced by Steve Jobs. To my knowledge, no one at, or formerly at, Apple has ever come out and said it, but it seems pretty clear that those iNames were a Steve Jobs thing. I would expect future Apple products and services to be named like Apple Watch — “Apple” followed by a simple descriptive word.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/2tb-google-one-free-nest-hub-offer-2022",
        "description": "Google is running its Nest Hub promotion again, and if you missed out last time on grabbing a smart display at &#8220;no cost&#8221;, then now is your chance to atone for your sins. Just kidding, smart displays aren&#8217;t for everyone, and I get that, but ever since my son broke mine on accident, I&#8217;ve been without, trying to no avail to make my Lenovo Chromebook duet take its place for smart home controls and other media. Unfortunately, the fact that I need to lock it defeats the purpose, so I have a new Hub on the way!\n\n\n\nToday, I noticed that the company is promoting its Google One 2TB subscription upgrade hand-in-hand with the Nest Hub smart display as a sort of &#8220;gift&#8221; for your decision to upgrade. I said before that it came at &#8220;no cost&#8221;, but that&#8217;s in quotation marks for a reason. The stipulation is that you&#8217;re already spending $99 USD today to become a One member with a crap ton of storage, but really that device is $99 USD itself off the shelf.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you look at it this way, you&#8217;re technically paying for the hardware out of pocket and getting free storage for a year. Clever psychology, I know. If you&#8217;re upgrading from a 200GB storage tier as I did, you&#8217;re already paying $36 USD per year, so the difference between that and the Hub means you&#8217;re paying about $63 USD for it instead of the full $99. I know this is a funny way of looking at it, but I tend to think in those terms, not the marketing trickery that companies apply to your pockets.\n\n\n\nI don&#8217;t even know what I&#8217;ll do with 2TB of storage in the cloud as I still haven&#8217;t filled what I&#8217;ve had for years, but there is no cancelation fee or contract with Google One, so you could upgrade to get the device, enjoy larger storage limits for the rest of the year, and then downgrade so that you&#8217;re not unnecessarily paying a hundred bucks a year instead of a third of that.\n\n\n\nNo doubt some people will forget to downgrade (put it on the calendar!), but Google is banking on people doing so or simply enjoying the extra space and realizing that they actually do need it after all. Some folks simply haven&#8217;t even tried Google One, so it&#8217;s a nice little perk to entice those who have been using only free Google Accounts with no strings attached until now.\n\n\n\nYou can check out the offer if you&#8217;d like and upgrade if you feel compelled. Should you do so, you will receive an email regarding your &#8220;free&#8221; Nest Hub a bit later so that you can go ahead and claim it through the Google Store via a promotional code which will take off 100% of the cost since the company covers the shipping cost too.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Last week on Twitter, in a thread speculating on what Apple might name its widely-rumored upcoming VR headset, I mentioned that I don’t expect it to be named with an “i” prefix. I tweeted that iPad, introduced in 2010, was the last such name. A few followers chimed in that iCloud, introduced at WWDC 2011, came later.\n\niCloud was the last new Apple product or service introduced by Steve Jobs. To my knowledge, no one at, or formerly at, Apple has ever come out and said it, but it seems pretty clear that those iNames were a Steve Jobs thing. I would expect future Apple products and services to be named like Apple Watch — “Apple” followed by a simple descriptive word.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "description": "The White Sox announced they&#8217;ve selected outfielder Mark Payton onto the MLB roster in advance of tonight&#8217;s game with the Twins. He&#8217;ll take the roster spot of center fielder Luis Robert, who&#8217;s going on paternity leave. To create a 40-man roster spot, reliever Aaron Bummer has been transferred from the 15-day to the 60-day injured list.\nPayton, 30, signed a minor league contract with Chicago in Spring Training. He&#8217;s spent the year at Triple-A Charlotte, putting up an impressive .289/.365/.522 line with 20 home runs and 11 stolen bases over 465 plate appearances. He&#8217;s made a strong impact from a power perspective, walked at a quality 9.7% clip and is striking out in fewer than 15% of his trips to the dish. It&#8217;s the latest in a long line of excellent Triple-A showings for the University of Texas product, who now carries a .295/.369/.509 line over parts of six seasons at the minors highest level.\nA Chicago native, Payton will now add some outfield insurance to the bench for acting manager Miguel Cairo. He&#8217;s covered all three outfield positions in the minors, although he only worked in the corners during a 32-game MLB cameo with the 2020-21 Reds (his only big league experience to date). It could be a brief stint, with Robert expected back imminently.\nPlayers on the paternity list are permitted to miss between one and three games. Regardless of how long he remains on the active roster, Payton&#8217;s call-up marks a deserved recognition of his strong Triple-A production. He does still have a minor league option year remaining, so the White Sox could move him back to Charlotte without taking him off the 40-man roster upon Robert&#8217;s return if they&#8217;re so inclined.\nBummer&#8217;s transfer is no more than a formality. He&#8217;s ruled out for 60 days from the time of his initial IL placement on June 9, meaning he&#8217;s eligible for reinstatement whenever he&#8217;s ready to return. Bummer began a rehab assignment in Charlotte on Wednesday and figures to make it back to Guaranteed Rate Field within the next couple weeks.",

        "description": "I love having a structured day, and using my favourite apps, OmniFocus and Agenda, coupled with Shortcuts, I have been able to establish that structure in a way that I&#8217;m excited to share.\n\n\n\nThese Shortcuts serve to enable a digital Bullet Journal system, where ideas, information, and tasks can be easily captured and put together, with an aim to making future task management easy by using OmniFocus&#8217; powerful organization and integration with Agenda to surface tasks of importance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAuthor&#8217;s note: This post will serve as the definitive home for this set of Shortcuts, and will be updated as versions change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda Daily Journal Builder\n\n\n\nThis Shortcut, for use with the Agenda app, creates a new note titled as EEEE MMMM d, yyyy (i.e. Saturday September 3, 2022) in the project of your choosing (as named with a text action, filled out as an import question for this Shortcut).\n\n\n\nThe note contains a list of all-day events from your calendar under the heading Today, as well as a list of timed calendar events under the heading of Events.\n\n\n\nNext to each event is an arrow which, when clicked, creates a new note (as named with a text action and also filled out as an import question for this Shortcut) linked to that calendar event and pre-populated with that event’s name, location, organizer, and attendees (taken from the calendar). This makes it easy to generate relevant notes for the day. All calendar items in the note are preceded by a designated emoji.\n\n\n\nNext, under the heading of Tasks is a checkmark list of tasks from OmniFocus that are either due today or overdue (designated by the emoji ) or flagged (designated by ). Each item is is followed by links to view or complete the OmniFocus task (using OmniAutomation). The latter requires security settings in OmniFocus to allow external scripts, which you can get help with on the Omni Automation site.\n\n\n\nLastly, a horizontal rule is added with a heading of Rapid log, where logging of notes for the day can be added as they occur (which is supported by the Rapid log Shortcut below).\n\n\n\n\nDownload Agenda Daily Journal Shortcut\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\n\n\n\n1.0: Initial version.1.1: Added fixes for URL encoding and link quality.1.2: Changed OmniFocus task presentation: now title of task is no longer linked, but is followed by links to view in OF or complete the OF task (using OmniAutomation). Renamed Shortcut.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda Rapid Log\n\n\n\nThis Shortcut, for use with the Agenda Daily Journal Builder Shortcut above, appends provided input to the note titled with today&#8217;s date EEEE MMMM d, yyyy (i.e. Saturday September 3, 2022), working in cooperation with OmniFocus for task capture.\n\n\n\nThe Shortcut asks for input, and multiple lines of input can be provided. Lines of text are each added as bullet list items to the Agenda Daily Journal, each with a timestamp to represent when they were entered.\n\n\n\nIf a line of inputted text begins with two spaces, it will be treated as a subbullet to the line above it, and so will be indented and will not include the timestamp.\n\n\n\nIf a line of inputted text begins with a dash and a space - , it is given special treatment and treated as a task. in this case:\n\n\n\nIt will be created as an OmniFocus Task (in the Inbox, unless otherwise specified, more below)It will be shown as a checklist item in the Agenda note instead of a bullet list itemThe Agenda checklist item’s text will be followed by links to view or complete the OmniFocus task\n\n\n\nAdditionally, for these task items, text can be entered inline to add treatment to the task created:\n\n\n\nAdding @flagged in this line will flag the task created in OmniFocus, and indicate the checklist item in Agenda with an orange diamond emoji (the actual @flagged text will not be included in either the Agenda text or OmniFocus task title)Adding tags inline as #tag1 #tag2 (no spaces) will add those tags to the OmniFocus task created (this text will not be reflected in Agenda)Adding a project name as +(project name) will add the task to the first matched project name in OmniFocusAdding  // (space slash slash space) as a delimiter, followed by content, will place the content following the slashes in the notes of the generated OmniFocus task (and omit them from the Agenda text)\n\n\n\nIn fact, all supported Taskpaper format parameters can be added to a task&#8217;s line.\n\n\n\nRead about TaskPaper notation you can include →\n\n\n\nTo make this easiest to use for journaling through the day and capture, I recommend setting it to a hotkey on Mac and to be triggered by Back Tap on an iPhone.\n\n\n\n\nDownload Agenda Rapid Log Shortcut\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\n\n\n\n1.0: Initial version1.1: Added comments for OF task with //1.11: Fix for undesired repeated use of task comments1.2: Added subbulleting1.3: Changed tag identification to require preceding space for hash mark (so that Agenda tags can be added with \\#), maintaining only the OmniFocus version (no longer building for Reminders)1.4: Added OmniAutomation links for viewing/completing OmniFocus tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda Email Clipper\n\n\n\nThis Mac-only Shortcut (because of the need for AppleScript and iOS&#8217; lack of Shortcuts support for Mail), for use with the Agenda app and my Agenda Daily Journal Builder Shortcut, appends provided input to the note titled with today&#8217;s date EEEE MMMM d, yyyy (i.e. Saturday September 3, 2022), along with the currently selected email.\n\n\n\nThis Shortcut works very much like my Agenda Rapid Log Shortcut, except that it captures the currently selected email. That email will then be appended to anything entered in the Rapid Log, referred to by a reference that is asked for following the entry of Rapid Log content, linked back to the actual email itself.\n\n\n\nThe Shortcut will then (optionally) archive the selected email (using the sending of keystroke ^ + ⌘ + a), and then allow choice as to which app to return to (Mail, Agenda, or OmniFocus).\n\n\n\nThe use case here is fast inbox processing, and this Shortcut is best used when invoked by a keyboard shortcut. Note that this Shortcut here offers all the same syntax support as the Agenda Rapid Log, meaning that tasks can be generated in OmniFocus (which also contain the link to the referenced email), tagged and noted accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nDownload Agenda Email Clipper Shortcut\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\n\n\n\n1.0: Initial version1.1: Handled error for running on non-Mac devices, added email subject capture, added choice for app to return to at end1.2: Added OmniAutomation links for viewing/completing OmniFocus tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAgenda Safari Clipper\n\n\n\nThis Shortcut, for use with the Agenda app and my Agenda Daily Journal Builder Shortcut, appends provided input to the note titled with today&#8217;s date EEEE MMMM d, yyyy (i.e. Saturday September 3, 2022), along with the currently selected email.\n\n\n\nThis Shortcut works very much like my Agenda Email Clipper Shortcut, except that it captures the currently selected Safari tab (Mac only) or the Safari page shared to it via the Share Sheet (all platforms). That page will then be appended and linked to alongside anything entered in the Rapid Log.\n\n\n\nNote that this Shortcut here offers all the same syntax support as the Rapid Log, meaning that tasks can be generated in OmniFocus (which also contain the link to the referenced email), tagged and noted accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nDownload Agenda Safari Clipper Shortcut\n\n\n\n\nChangelog\n\n\n\n1.0: Initial version1.1: Added Rapid Log updates, OmniAutomation links for viewing/completing OmniFocus tasks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport HeyScottyJ&#8217;s work\n\n\n\nI love doing this work to try and help you be more productive by sharing ideas that have made me more productive. If what I&#8217;ve shared here has help put some time back in your day, I&#8217;d love your support to keep me making things. Thank you!",

        "description": "The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention approved a new COVID-19 booster shot yesterday that targets the recently circulating BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. The new Pfizer-BioNTech booster is available for anyone age 12 or older, while Moderna’s new version is for anyone age 18 or older.  National Public Radio’s Rob Stein reports that “a person is only eligible for a booster if it has been at least two months since their last COVID vaccine. Some vaccine experts say that it would be better for people to wait until four months after their last COVID shot or infection for maximum efficacy.” Indeed, on MPR yesterday, U of M epidemiologist Dr. Michael Osterholm stated, “with the new vaccine you can get it as early as two months after the last dose. I think waiting a little bit longer is better.” Osterholm also commented that “we have a significant amount of [COVID] activity right now in Minnesota.” He went on to say that another fall surge is highly uncertain, stating “anybody that predicts what&#x27;s happening with COVID, more than three to five weeks out, probably also has a bridge to sell, so be careful.”  Thus, as we will discuss at the end of this week’s round-up, the return to school that is now upon Minnesota may or may not coincide with a fall uptick in cases and hospitalizations that suggested a seasonal pattern to the virus in both 2020 and 2021. Cases and hospitalizations have ticked down, unfortunately deaths have not Officially reported cases of COVID-19 are down in all regions of the state. It’s hard to say if this is the beginning of a slide down our long-standing plateau, but the fact that cases are down in all regions is a hopeful sign.  Cases are down across the state this week.David MontgomeryAfter a jump in intensive care unit admissions the last couple of weeks, ICU admissions are down, as are non-ICU admissions.  Both ICU and non-ICU admissions have declined in the past week. David MontgomeryDeaths due to COVID-19 have increased some after a lower point at the beginning of August, but at this point do not seem to be on track for the peak numbers seen in mid-July. Deaths have increased some after a brief dip in early August.David MontgomeryWastewater shows declining levels of COVID in the Twin Cities, northern and southwestern Minnesota After last week’s reported four percent increase, this week the Metropolitan Council and the University of Minnesota’s Genomic Center are again reporting a decline in COVID-19 levels detected in samples from the state’s single largest wastewater treatment plant. Their summary this week: “The total viral RNA load entering the Metro Plant decreased by 19 percent last week compared to a week earlier” (comparing the weeks ending Aug. 22 and Aug. 29).  The Metropolitan Council confirmed that the state fairgrounds are serviced by the Metro Plant, but had no comment about how this might impact their COVID analysis. They may have more to say next week, given that only the first day of the fair is included in this week’s report. COVID levels are declining in wastewater, according to the latest report from the Metropolitan Council and the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Genomic Center.David H. Montgomery | MPR NewsThe slight increases in COVID levels that showed up in last week’s report from the Metropolitan Council are now showing up in the latest data out of the University of Minnesota’s Wastewater SARS-CoV2 Surveillance Study. In fact, the latter study’s broader look at the Twin Cities Metro region, involving 13 wastewater treatment plants, is now reporting a 13 percent increase for the week ending Aug. 21.  The Surveillance Study is also reporting weekly increases in the state’s South Central, Central and South East regions, with the latter two particularly concerning since those regions also saw rising COVID levels over the previous four weeks. Wastewater from study’s North West and North East regions is showing weekly decreases in COVID levels, as it is in the South West region—which also shows a small decrease over the previous four week period.  Minnesota is greener this week, and not just due to recent rain In the CDC’s latest weekly “Community Level” COVID-19 risk assessment map, issued yesterday afternoon, more than twice as many Minnesota counties appear in low-risk green than was the case just one week ago. Notably this includes the entire Twin Cities metro region, which has been in the medium-risk category for the previous two weeks. The CDC’s analysis puts six Minnesota counties in the high-risk category this week. Based on this assessment, residents of Big Stone, Brown, Freeborn, Lincoln, Roseau and Traverse counties are advised to wear masks to protect themselves and one another from COVID transmission when in indoor public places. The CDC’s “Community Level” map takes into account both COVID-19 case rates and hospitalizations. Looking only at the latest weekly case rates, 74 of Minnesota’s 87 counties meet the CDC’s threshold for high transmission (100+ weekly cases per 100,000 residents). Mahnomen County has the state’s highest rate, with over 500 officially reported cases per 100,000 for the week ending Aug. 31. Weekly case rates in Lac qui Parle County exceed 300, and they exceed 200 per 100,000 in ten other counties. Back to school = increase in COVID? As students return to schools and colleges across the state, you may be wondering if we are in for an increase in COVID cases. We took a look at COVID indictors for three cities that have already had children back to school for a month – Atlanta, Honolulu and Indianapolis. On balance, it seems to be good news. First, a look at officially reported cases per capita. As we’ve said for the Minnesota data, prevalence of at-home testing makes this metric somewhat suspect, but it’s probably still indicative of general recent trends. In Atlanta and Honolulu, cases have been going down consistently since August 1. In Indianapolis, cases rose the week after school started but have since been on the decline. (Given that different cities may have different testing behaviors, we do not suggest drawing too many conclusions from comparing the number of cases in the cities to each other.)  Cases per capita are down in Atlanta, Honolulu and Indianapolis since the start of school.Elisabeth Gawthrop | APM Research LabThe most recent COVID-19 hospital admission and bed utilization rates are lower than they were in all three cities when school started a month ago. While these metrics would expect lag of a couple of weeks behind increased COVID-19 transmission, the lack of any uptick combined with the declining cases provide some hope that the start of the school year won’t lead to major new outbreaks. Hospitalizations are down in Atlanta, Honolulu and Indianapolis since the start of school.Elisabeth Gawthrop | APM Research LabBed utilization is down in Atlanta, Honolulu and Indianapolis since the start of school.Elisabeth Gawthrop | APM Research LabOnly time will tell if these same patterns will hold for Minnesota, but these trends at least show that an immediate uptick in cases following the first day of school is far less than inevitable.  ",

        "description": "The Astros Rookie Shortstop’s Last Two Months Have Hurt His Chances to Rank in the Top 3 for Rookie of the Year \n  \n        \n      Photo by Tim Heitman/Getty Images\n      Jeremy Pena Throws to First Base\n  \nIn May, Jeremy Pena looked like a leading contender for AL Rookie of the Year.  At the least he appeared to be a good bet to end up in the top three for that award.  Fast forward to today, and he probably isn’t a favorite to receive top three recognition in the award voting.  Good performances by other AL rookies only partly explains the decline in Pena’s chances at the award.  The main reason is Jeremy’s poor offensive output in July and August.\nJeremy Pena wRC+ by Month\nMar/Apr 117   May 148  June 103  July 85  Aug 46\n  However, a little more than a month remains in the season.  If Pena can post good offensive stats in September, I think his chances in the ROY Award voting will improve significantly.\nIn my view, WAR is probably the best metric for ROY because it includes both offensive and defensive value.  Yes, I know some ROY voters won’t consult WAR stats in making their selection.  But it’s probably the best measure we have to consider the players’ overall contribution.  Fortunately, Pena’s excellent defensive contribution has allowed him to maintain a reasonable WAR value despite the plummeting offensive stats over the last two months.  Let’s look at the WAR values as measured by Fangraphs (f-WAR) and Baseball Reference (b-WAR).\nAL Rookie of the Year Candidates\nf-WAR\nJ. Rodriguez  3.6\nA. Rutschman 3.5\nS. Kwan  2.9\nJ. Pena  2.3\nB. Witt Jr.  1.9\nb-WAR\nJ. Rodriguez 4.5\nS. Kwan 3.8\nA. Rutschman 3.7\nJ. Pena 3.7\nB. Witt Jr. 0.7\nDespite his offensive struggles this month, Pena falls just outside of the top 3 in f-WAR among AL rookies. Pena is tied for the No. 3 spot based on b-WAR.  And, by the way,  finishing in the top 3 for ROY would give the team a supplemental draft pick.  Based on the WAR comparisons, Jeremy finishing among the top 3 for AL ROY is quite possible.  \nOf course, any kind of projection would also depend on how the four other rookie candidates perform in September.  Fangraphs’ ROS (rest of season) projections for Pena suggest that he is likely to add 0.4 - 0.5  WAR during September.  If WAR is used as the metric, whether that is sufficient to put Pena in the top 3 for ROY would partly depend on whether one prefers f-WAR or b-WAR.  (The latter is more favorable to Pena.)\nIf Pena could finish September with excellent offense, it’s possible that he could add 1 win or more of WAR during the month.  That would go a long way toward catapulting Pena into contention for the 1 or 2 slot in the ROY.    That would likely require Pena to post a monthly offense of 115 - 120 in wRC+.  Given his August stats, that may seem unlikely.  But Jeremy achieved that level of offense during the first half of the season (117 wRC+).  All he has to do is find the right adjustments to achieve his previous offensive output.\nBeyond the implication for future awards, if Pena can finish September with an offensive flourish, it would put the Astros in a better position going into the playoffs.  During the first half of the season, Pena was an important part of the Astros’ offense, and he needs to return to that form in time for the playoffs.",

        "description": "Hillary Clinton says she has “no regrets” about choosing to stay in her marriage to former President Bill Clinton.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 42nd president’s affair with then-White House intern Monica Lewinsky in the 1990s ignited a media firestorm and launched the already heavily scrutinized Clinton marriage back into the spotlight.\n\n\n\nAsked about previous comments she’s made that choosing to stay wedded to her husband was the “gutsiest” thing she’s ever done, Clinton told CBS News’s Norah O’Donnell the decision rocked her personal life.\n\n\n\n“I guess I was surprised that you said that staying in your marriage was gutsier than running for president,” O’Donnell, the anchor of “CBS Evening News,” said to Clinton in a preview clip from an interview airing Friday and obtained exclusively by ITK.\n\n\n\n“Well, it was, in terms of my private life, it was really hard. And as you know, everybody had an opinion about it. People who I never met had very strong opinions about it,” the former secretary of State replied.\n\n\n\nThe ex-first lady, who tied the knot with her husband in 1975, sat down with O’Donnell and daughter Chelsea Clinton to promote the pair’s forthcoming Apple TV+ docuseries, “Gutsy.”\n\n\n\n“And it took a lot of, honestly, prayer, and thoughtfulness, and talking to people I totally trusted, to really think through — because it was all being done in public,” Clinton, 74, said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“So it made it even more painful and difficult,” Clinton continued.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“But I have no regrets,” she said.\n\n\n\nMore of the interview with Clinton is poised to air Friday on “CBS Evening News,” as well as on “CBS Sunday Morning” and on O’Donnell’s new streaming show, “Person to Person,” on Tuesday.",

        "description": "The Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) announced that it will provide access to abortions for certain veterans and beneficiaries \"regardless of state restrictions.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe’ll share the details of that decision, plus we’ll pull back the curtain on the Ukrainian military commanders holding the front line in the country’s south and the east. Also, we'll examine the new information about the volume of documents former President Trump stored in his personal office at Mar-a-Lago, then we'll look at how the U.S. military is responding to the deadly floods in Pakistan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is Defense &amp; National Security, your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond.

Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVA will provide abortions in limited circumstances\n\n\n\nThe Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) on Friday said that it will provide access to abortions to pregnant veterans in limited circumstances.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the department said it submitted an interim final rule in the federal register to allow it to provide access to abortion counseling, as well as the procedure itself for people who became pregnant as a result of rape or incest, or if carrying a pregnancy to term endangers the life of the mother.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen will it happen?: The department said the services would be authorized immediately after the final rule is published, and it will be made available for public comment for 30 days following publication.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe VA’s reasoning: VA Secretary&nbsp;Denis McDonough&nbsp;called the move a “patient safety decision.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Pregnant Veterans and VA beneficiaries deserve to have access to world-class reproductive care when they need it most. That’s what our nation owes them, and that’s what we at VA will deliver,” he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBackground: The move comes as trigger bans on abortion take effect across the country weeks after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade — the 1973 ruling that guaranteed a constitutional right to abortion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe changes: In its&nbsp;interim final rule, the VA notes that current regulations don’t allow the agency’s Civilian Health and Medical Program (CHAMPVA) program to cover the procedure unless the life of the pregnant person is endangered.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCoverage for abortions for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest is also excluded from CHAMPV, as is abortion counseling. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe move would cover veterans and benefits under CHAMPVA program, the VA said. The department added that its employees may provide the service regardless of state restrictions as long as they are working within the scope of federal employment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the full story here \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWAR IN UKRAINE\n\n\n\nThree nights with volunteers supplying the frontlines \n\n\n\nDispatch from The Hill's Laura Kelly: \n\n\n\nIt’s nearly 9 p.m. when the Ukrainian commander who calls himself “The Greek” brings our group to a makeshift workshop in the east of Ukraine, where soldiers are tinkering with improvised explosive devices.  \n\n\n\nThe apparent head of the workshop, an engineer in his life before the war, welcomes us into a room that’s been repurposed from its original, civilian use — its exact description withheld for security purposes — but it looks distinctly like an arts and crafts center of death.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMaterials for mixing explosives and their components, grenades and fuses with English-language descriptions, are all neatly organized on bookshelves and in see-through plastic containers that one would find in a kitchen or classroom.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHolding the line:&nbsp;The engineer is keen to talk to Jonas Öhman, the founder of the Blue/Yellow nongovernmental organization that, since 2014, has provided nonlethal support to Ukraine’s front-line troops —&nbsp;part of a volunteer force that has mushroomed since Russia’s invasion in February to keep Ukrainian forces fed, clothed, supplied and sane.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI traveled with Öhman, along with his colleague and driver, Gabrielius Merzinskis, over the course of three days — between Aug. 19 and 21 — visiting with Ukrainian military commanders holding the front line in the south and the east.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the full story here&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlso from The Hill:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy the world is worried&nbsp;about a nuclear disaster in Ukraine&nbsp;White House&nbsp;asks Congress for $13.7B&nbsp;in Ukraine-related funding&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnsealed inventory details Mar-a-Lago recovery\n\n\n\nJustice Department records unsealed on Friday offer new details about the volume of documents former President&nbsp;Trump&nbsp;stored in his personal office at Mar-a-Lago, as well as other items seized during the search of his Florida home.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe filing&nbsp;underscores just how many presidential records Trump was storing at his home and offers a breakdown of the more than 100 classified documents the Department of Justice (DOJ) says it recovered from Mar-a-Lago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat was found: FBI agents found 43 empty folders with classified banners in Trump’s personal office as well as another 28 empty folders that were labeled “return to staff secretary/military aide,” according to the inventory.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe records were unsealed Friday by order of a federal judge who is reviewing a request from Trump to appoint a third-party special master to review the evidence seized, including a motion to block the FBI’s investigation during that review.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat we know now: The inventory offers few new details about the classified materials themselves stored at Mar-a-Lago, but it does shed light on the extent classified materials were intermixed with Trump’s personal belongings.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA brief filed by the government just before midnight Tuesday&nbsp;indicated they found three classified records within Trump’s very own desk.But the Friday inventory details in broad strokes the others that were found within his office: three documents marked confidential, 17 documents marked secret and seven documents marked top-secret.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTheir location in Trump’s office could be significant to the Justice Department’s investigation, particularly after it alleged earlier this week that items were “likely concealed and removed.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead that story here \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS sending team to Pakistan amid deadly floods \n\n\n\nThe U.S. military is sending a team to Pakistan to figure out what support the Pentagon could&nbsp;provide amid deadly floods that have covered more than one-third of the country, the Defense Department announced Friday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. Central Command will send the team to Islamabad to determine how the Pentagon can help the U.S.&nbsp;Agency for International Development&nbsp;as part of Washington’s response to the crisis, the command’s top spokesperson, Col. Joe Buccino, said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDevastation: Floods that began in mid-June have ravaged Pakistan, and satellite images this week showed more than one-third of the country under water.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe flooding has killed more than 1,100 people — at least 400 of them children — affected more than 33 million people and destroyed millions of acres of crops and hundreds of thousands of livestock, setting the country up for a major food shortage and humanitarian crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPakistani Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif has called the floods “the worst in the country’s history,” estimating that the disaster has caused more than $10 billion in damages.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead that story here \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nWhite House defends presence of Marines at Biden speech READ: Full inventory of documents seized in Trump search Biden to host summit with Pacific island nations this month Barr defends DOJ in Trump investigation: ‘They probably have pretty good evidence’ UN report finds possible ‘crimes against humanity’ in China’s Xinjiang \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for today!

I realize, and it’s painful, that I am privileged in this,” Fonda said.\n\n\n\n“Almost every family in America has had to deal with cancer at one time or another and far too many don’t have access to the quality health care I am receiving and this is not right,” the performer said.\n\n\n\nFonda said her chemotherapy would continue for six months while telling fans she is “handling the treatments quite well and, believe me, I will not let any of this interfere with my climate activism.”\n\n\n\nFonda launched her eponymous climate-focused PAC earlier this year. She was arrested multiple times while leading her “Fire Drill Fridays” climate change protests in Washington in 2019.\n\n\n\n“We’re living through the most consequential time in human history because what we do or don’t do right now will determine what kind of future there will be and I will not allow cancer to keep me from doing all I can, using every tool in my toolbox,” Fonda said in her Instagram post.\n\n\n\n“The midterms are looming,” Fonda said of the November elections, “and they are beyond consequential so you can count on me to be right there together with you as we grow our army of climate champions.”",

        "description": "Here we are, at the end of the summer season. Kids are back in school, and long summer evenings grow short. On such a weekend, the answer I’m choosing is to go down the shore for the last of the beach days of the year. If you’re like me, and plan to go to the New Jersey beaches, I’m including some fun things to do, besides soaking in the sun and the sound of the ocean. If you’re staying in Bucks this weekend, I am also including some things to do in and around Bucks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFriday, September 2: In Bucks tonight, head out to the Great Barn Taphouse for live music from Paradise Rose, a Guns ‘N Roses tribute band. They go on at 8 p.m., but John Brennan Duo starts playing blues at 4 p.m., for a more low-key vibe early in the evening. Great Barn Taphouse is located at 1500 Main St. in Warrington.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDown the Shore, head to Long Beach for Fire Pit Friday Concert from 7 p.m. to 9 p.m. The band tonight is called Sneak Attack and they play covers from Taylor Swift to Weezer. The music seems like a good way to get pumped up for the long weekend. The concert is free, and is located at 6805 Long Beach Blvd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday, September 3: In Bucks County, head out to the 56th Annual Polish-American Family Festival. The festival runs this weekend and next in Doylestown at the The National Shrine of Our Lady of Czestochowa (654 Ferry Road). It’s the region’s largest Polish festival, attracting over 25,000 guests a year. While you’re there, enjoy amusement rides and a “Little Circus,” along with live entertainment on two stages. Entertainment includes polka and disco polo dancing, along with polish folk dancing. Of course, beyond all the entertainment, clearly go for the Polish food. They will be serving favorites like kielbasa, perogi, placki (potato pancakes), gołąbki (stuffed cabbage rolls), pastries and polish beer. There is also a Polish vodka tasting, if you so desire. Tickets are $12 per person. There is also a festival sweepstakes with a $10,000 grand prize. Tickets to enter are $5.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re at the shore, why not head out for an air show at Naval Airstation Wildwood Aviation Museum. Their 26th annual Airfest is going on all weekend. There will be plenty to see and do there &#8211; lectures, helicopters, F-14’s, food trucks, a beer garden, live music and more. The Airfest is located at 500 Forrestal Road, Cape May Airport.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday, September 4: In Bucks, the last Sunday Stroll of the season is happening Bristol Borough from 12 p.m. to 4 p.m. There will be 8 food trucks, live entertainment and lots of vendors. While you’re there, you can also stop in to any of the local shops or restaurants on Mill Street.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf you’re in New Jersey, head to Wildwood for their annual End of Summer Block party. The event goes from 1 p.m. to 10 p.m. in Fox Park. There will be live music from multiple bands, food vendors, craft vendors, a bounce house and more. Admission is free.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nThe Wildwoods knows how to send the summer off in style! Join the fun at the End of Summer Block Party Sunday September 4. pic.twitter.com/VGeF5m3Iun&mdash; Wildwoods New Jersey (@Wildwoods_NJ) August 19, 2022\n\n\n\n\nMonday, September 5: Enjoy the fruits of your labor and relax. Have a barbeque. While nothing says backyard barbeque like hot dogs, hamburgers, and BBQ chicken, perhaps try something a little different on the grill. Last weekend, I made Caprese Baked Brie on the grill. It was a winner, and it looks really impressive if you’re having guests over. It’s also a great appetizer while you’re prepping the rest of the food. Also, try out some grilled mini peppers. You can stuff them, or just grill them on a stick, and top with tzatziki. Here is a recipe. But what about dessert? If you’ve never grilled fruit, you’re missing out. Grilling fruit brings out all the sugar and sweetens up the fruit. Eat it like that, or top with ice cream, and you’re in for a treat. You can grill watermelon, peaches, pineapple, or even bananas. Get creative and enjoy the unofficial end of summer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHappy Labor Day!",

Here’s another: What is the right’s &#8217;cause&#8217; at this point? What cause does the Republican Party presently serve? It has no meaningful policy agenda. It literally has no platform. The closest thing it has to a cause is justifying abuses of state power to own the libs and defending whatever Trump’s latest boorish or corrupt thought-fart happens to be. Imagine being a propagandist for a cause as impoverished as that. Many don’t need to imagine.&#8221;\n&#8220;The GOP does have a cause. The cause is consolidating power. Overturn the rigged elections, purge the disloyal bureaucrats, smash the corrupt institutions that stand in the way. Give the leader a free hand. It’s plain as day to those who are willing to see where this is going, what the highest ambitions of this personality cult are. Those who support it without insisting on reform should at least stop pretending that they’re voting for anything else.&#8221;\nAnd this is perfect: &#8220;Lastly, to those who spent the last seven years barking insults at me in the comments for not genuflecting to Trump, I’ll give you this: You’re not phonies. You believe what you say. We have that much in common. I respect honesty and paid you the respect of being honest. It would scandalize you to know how many of your heroes sound like you in public and like me in private. Audience capture has brought most of conservative media to ruin by making it predictable and shrill.&#8221;",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Rockies will face the Reds in hopes of adding some wins on the road.  The Colorado Rockies will start a three-game series in Cincinnati tonight. After losing the series in Atlanta, they will look to try and find success in Ohio. The Reds currently have a record worse than the Rockies, so they may be in for an even matchup. \nThe Rockies will send lefty Kyle Freeland (7-9, 4.88 ERA) to the mound. Freeland’s last outing resulted in a loss against the Mets giving up two earned runs on four hits. His two performances prior to that against the Giants and St. Louis resulted in a no-decision. \nOpposite Freeland will be Luis Cessa (3-2, 5.36 ERA) for the Reds. Typically Cessa is a bullpen arm that very rarely goes more than two complete innings. His last performance was against the Nationals and it was his longest this season. Cessa pitched four complete innings giving up one earned run (a home run) on four hits. He is being called on now to provide some length that is not typically a requirement for him in light of some starting rotation injuries for the Reds. He has pitched 43 2⁄3 innings the entirety of the 2022 season which is quite low compared to Freeland who has pitched 142 innings. \nIf Freeland can bring his best, the Rockies have a chance to take tonight’s game. I’d be interested to see how Bouchard and Toglia do in a new ballpark. \nFirst Pitch: 4:40 p.m. MDT\nTV: AT&amp;T Sports Net Rocky Mountain (COL), Bally Sports South (ATL); MLB.TV\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM; KNRV 1150 (Spanish)\nLineups:\n\n\nLineups: pic.twitter.com/s5Bgh2tUMq— Purple Row (@PurpleRow) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nSpencer Steer debuts tonight at GABP❗️Powered by @PNCBank pic.twitter.com/8KIo8YtUWi— Cincinnati Reds (@Reds) September 2, 2022",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/3626347-its-time-to-permanently-ban-fentanyl-analogs/",
        "description": "For the third year in a row, Milwaukee County in Wisconsin is on pace to set a record for drug overdose deaths. About 80 percent of the 613 fatal overdoses last year in Milwaukee County involved fentanyl. In Wisconsin alone, fentanyl overdose deaths grew by 97 percent from 2019 to 2021.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is not just a local or state issue. Last year, there were over 100,000 overdose deaths nationwide (a nearly 30 percent increase from the previous year), the large majority attributable to illicit fentanyl. The lethal dose of fentanyl is 2 mg (equivalent to 5 grains of sand), meaning that one teaspoon is enough to kill 2,000 people. As those of us working on the front lines know, all it takes is one pill to kill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBad actors in China and Mexican drug cartels exploited loopholes in U.S. law. By tweaking just one element of fentanyl’s chemical structure, they created deadly new fentanyls that were then legal. We were forced to play a lethal game of scheduling whack-a-mole, unable to react and make them illegal until hundreds of our kids died.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nArchie Badura was an alter server at church with my daughters. I also happened to be his doctor in the emergency room for his second to last overdose. Tragically, his next fentanyl-laced overdose ended young Archie’s life in 2014. His mother, my friend Lauri, founded Saving Others For Archie shortly after. The organization works with families who are desperately trying to help their loved ones with this scourge of addiction.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThrough my years serving as an emergency physician in Waukesha County and while on the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board and Controlled Substances Board, I saw this crisis develop and then multiply. I realized that some of this unimaginably tragic loss of life could be stopped by enacting simple, common-sense legislation.\n\n\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) has led the country and the world in this area, working with Lauri Badura and me to introduce the&nbsp;Stopping Overdoses of Fentanyl Analogs (SOFA) Act in 2017. It proactively schedules all likely bioactive fentanyls as a class before they are created, thereby removing the incentive for illicit chemists to develop new fentanyl variants, effectively stopping them from existing. It is the most basic form of harm reduction and prevention — you can’t die from ingesting something that was never created.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) saw the wisdom in the idea and implemented the SOFA language nationally in 2018 in a temporary order. The SOFA fentanyl class language is now recognized as model legislation and is being implemented around the globe. In 2019, the Chinese copied the SOFA language, effectively unplugging the entire fentanyl variant machine and shutting down illicit development and production of new deadly fentanyls worldwide. This is clearly not a partisan issue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut despite the already proven success of the SOFA language and the overwhelming support expressed by all 50 U.S. state attorneys general in both 2018 and 2019, along with large numbers of members of both parties in Congress, SOFA is still not permanent law.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nProgressive interest groups and members of Congress are standing in the way, blocking the SOFA language from passing. Sens. Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), among others, are blocking progress by pushing fig leaf arguments related to scientific research and criminal justice. But the data and research are not on their side. And if they succeed with their grandstanding and political pandering, countless lives could be endangered.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe SOFA Act language used so effectively by Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) needs to be reenacted by the end of this year. Lauri Badura and many other advocates are raising the profile of the issue, including appearing on national television and putting billboards in Times Square around the recent Fentanyl Awareness and Prevention Day and coining the phrase “Fentanyl is America’s new F word.”\n\n\n\nI have told more than enough families that their loved ones won’t be coming home because of this scourge. Fentanyl doesn’t care about party lines, so why should Congress?&nbsp;Congress must close the deadly loophole, making this common-sense, lifesaving legislation permanent.\n\n\n\nDr. Tim Westlake, MD, FFSMB, FACEP, is a full-time emergency physician, immediate past chairman of the Wisconsin Medical Examining Board, a former member of the Wisconsin Controlled Substances Board and a former member of the Governor’s Task Force on Opioid Abuse.",

        "description": "The social media platform Parler is available again for users to download from the Google Play Store a year and a half after the app was removed, the company said Friday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nParler, which boasts its limited content moderation measures, was banned from the app store since January 2021 over a lack of moderation on posts that were deemed to incite violence around the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“While away from Google Play, we have worked diligently to build a more feature-rich and dynamic user experience. Now is a perfect time to join Parler and rediscover the non-partisan platform where we enable people to speak freely,” Parler’s chief technology officer Sam Lipoff said in a tweeted statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGoogle’s decision to allow Parler back into its store comes after the app reportedly made changes that allow users to block and report others and to actively monitor content for issues like violent speech, Axios reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"As we’ve long stated, apps are able to appear on Google Play provided they comply with Play’s developer policies,” a Google spokesperson told Axios.\n\n\n\n\"As we’ve long stated, apps are able to appear on Google Play provided they comply with Play’s developer policies,” a Google spokesperson told The Hill in a statement.\n\n\n\nParler grew in popularity after the 2020 election, attracting a right-wing audience that griped about content moderation measures on mainstream sites like Twitter and Facebook.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nApple let Parler back in its app store last May.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer President Trump's alternative social media platform Truth Social is facing a similar issue with access to the Google Play store.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Truth Social app is not available in the store. A Google spokesperson told The Hill earlier this week that the platform lacks the “effective” content moderation needed to meet the store’s terms of service.",

        "description": "Today’s earlier item about iPhone usage share overtaking Android in the U.S. led to an interesting thread on Twitter regarding the seemingly curious large differences in iPhone/Android share between different countries. The iPhone is particularly popular in the U.S. and Japan, and in English-speaking countries (Canada, United Kingdom, Australia) in general. Android, for obvious reasons, is overwhelmingly popular in poorer countries. But there are wealthy countries like Germany and France where Android is more popular by roughly 3 to 1 margins. I suspect there is no simple answer to this, and that it comes down to nuanced but significant nation-by-nation cultural differences.\n\nIf any readers in Germany, France, or Japan (or from anywhere, for that matter) have ideas about this, I’m all ears.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "description": "Today’s earlier item about iPhone usage share overtaking Android in the U.S. led to an interesting thread on Twitter regarding the seemingly curious large differences in iPhone/Android share between different countries. The iPhone is particularly popular in the U.S. and Japan, and in English-speaking countries (Canada, United Kingdom, Australia) in general. Android, for obvious reasons, is overwhelmingly popular in poorer countries. But there are wealthy countries like Germany and France where Android is more popular by roughly 3 to 1 margins. I suspect there is no simple answer to this, and that it comes down to nuanced but significant nation-by-nation cultural differences.\n\nIf any readers in Germany, France, or Japan (or from anywhere, for that matter) have ideas about this, I’m all ears.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "description": "Photo by Norm Hall/Getty Images\n    \n\n  You expected, perhaps, someone different?  Starting pitcher Zac Gallen of the Arizona Diamondbacks has been voted the National League Pitcher of the Month for August. Gallen earned his first career NL Pitcher of the Month Award and is Arizona’s second consecutive recpient, following his rotation-mate Merrill Kelly. This marks the first time that Arizona has consecutive Pitcher of the Month Awards since Hall of Famer Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling in April-May 2002.\n\nAcross six starts for Arizona, Zac compiled a perfect 5-0 record with a 0.68 ERA. He notched 44 strikeouts while allowing 10 walks and 20 hits over 40.0 innings pitched. \nGallen recorded three consecutive starts from August 8th-18th in which he tossed at least seven scoreless innings, becoming the first Major League pitcher to do so since Jacob deGrom in 2019. \nZac has pitched at least six scoreless frames without allowing more than four hits, in each of his last five outings dating back to August 8th. It is the second-longest such streak in MLB history behind only Zack Greinke’s six-game run in 2015. \nThe 27-year-old finished his award-winning month on a 34.1-inning scoreless streak dating back to August 8th, which is the second-longest in franchise history behind Brandon Webb’s 42.0-inning streak in 2007. \nHe has posted five consecutive outings with a Game Score of 69 or better. The only better run was Randy Johnson’s six-game one in 1999, over which time he had an ERA of 0.92... and went 1-4 in those games, naturally.\nBeyond August, Gallen has now had eight consecutive starts without allowing a home-run. It’s the longest such streak by a Diamondback since Patrick Corbin set the franchise record of eleven in a row, in June-August of 2018. \n\nHere are the logs of Zac’s six outings this month:\n  \n        \n  \nIt has been as impressive a run as I’ve seen from an Arizona pitcher in a long time, and the award is fully deserved. We’ll see if he can continue the run, when he pitches against the Milwaukee Brewers, in the series final on Sunday.",

        "description": "Michael Gerson: \n\nWhen we are caked with the mud of political struggle, and tired of Pyrrhic victories that seed new hatreds, and frightened by our own capacity for contempt, the way of life set out by Jesus comes like a clear bell that rings above our strife. It defies cynicism, apathy, despair and all ideologies that dream of dominance. It promises that every day, if we choose, can be the first day of a new and noble manner of living. Its most difficult duties can feel much like purpose and joy. And even our halting, halfhearted attempts at faithfulness are counted by God as victories. \nGod&#8217;s call to us while not simplifying our existence does ennoble it. It is the invitation to a life marked by meaning. And even when, as mortality dictates, we walk the path we had feared to tread, it can be a pilgrimage, in which all is lost, and all is found. \nBefore such a consummation, Christians seeking social influence should do so not by joining interest groups that fight for their narrow rights and certainly not those animated by hatred, fear, phobias, vengeance or violence. Rather, they should seek to be ambassadors of a kingdom of hope, mercy, justice and grace. This is a high calling and a test that most of us (myself included) are always finding new ways to fail. But it is the revolutionary ideal set by Jesus of Nazareth, who still speaks across the sea of years.",

        "description": "It’s a September call-ups edition of Big Hype Prospects. MLBTR’s Steve Adams and Anthony Franco already highlighted each club’s initial promotions. We’ll use that list to focus in on the most interesting inclusions and snubs.\nFive Big Hype Prospects\nGunnar Henderson, 21, SS/3B, BAL (MLB)\n8 PA, 1 HR, 1 SB, .375/.375/.750\nTwo games into his Major League debut, Henderson has already supplied a bevy of highlights in the field, at the plate, and on the basepaths. The legend will only grow. The Orioles second number one overall prospect to be promoted this season, Henderson’s arrival could help spur the club to a postseason berth. Of all the players promoted by contenders, he has the most impactful potential. While most playoff-bound clubs feature relatively complete rosters, Baltimore has regularly started Rougned Odor (406 PA, 0.1 fWAR). Additionally, third baseman Ramon Urias (2.0 fWAR) hasn’t hit much since late-July. Working Henderson into the infield mix should prove a net-positive in September even if he has some growing pains along the way. He’s started one game at third and shortstop.\nHunter Brown, 24, SP, HOU (MLB)\n(AAA) 106 IP, 11.38 K/9, 3.82 BB/9, 2.55 ERA\nDepending on the seriousness of Justin Verlander’s calf strain, Brown might draw a start or three down the stretch this season. Initially, he’ll be employed out of the bullpen with Cristian Javier rejoining the rotation in Verlander’s spot.\nThis season, Brown successfully built upon a decent 2021 campaign in which longstanding command issues led to muted results. Regardless of his future role, the stuff should play. The right-hander features premium fastball velocity and a pair of potent breaking balls. The curve pairs particularly well with his heater. A pitcher scouting report is never complete without a comment about a “still-developing” changeup. The success of players like Spencer Strider suggests a changeup or even a third offering of any kind shouldn’t be viewed as a requirement. If Brown ultimately stuggles as a starter, it’ll be more due to his lack of command than his repertoire.\nOne odd little wrinkle: Brown posted a 54.2 percent ground ball rate this season. That’s roughly in-line with past performances. What makes it odd is the way his fastball and curve tunnel together lend themselves to a fly ball profile. I’ll be watching closely to gain a better understanding of how he uses his repertoire.\nOswald Peraza, 22, SS, NYY (MLB)\n(AAA) 429 PA, 19 HR, 33 SB, .259/.329/.448\nAs expected, the Yankees opted to grant Peraza his first taste of the Majors. Many Yankees fans were clamoring for Anthony Volpe to leapfrog Peraza straight from Double-A. Peraza profiles as a fairly classic shortstop prospect. Defensively, he’s smooth and athletic. In an era riddled with oversized shortstops who post positive defensive metrics mostly due to positioning, Peraza should comfortably stand out as a quality defender.\nHis hitting remains a work in progress. The fantasy-oriented among you will surely note the excellent combination of power and speed. Yet, there’s potentially a deeper issue with his triple-slash line. His plate discipline and feel for contact haven’t been as effective as many hoped. He remains quite young and could certainly continue to make gains in those areas. Early in his career, expect Major League pitchers to prey upon his willingness to expand the strike zone.\nSpencer Steer, 24, 2B/3B, CIN (MLB)\n(AA/AAA) 492 PA, 23 HR, 4 SB, .274/.364/.515\nA gamer the Reds picked up at the trade deadline from the Twins, Steer is poised to fill an everyday utility role in Cincinnati for the next half decade or more. He profiles as an excellent fit for Great American Ballpark. While he’s hit perhaps too many grounders since joining the Reds org, he’s historically skewed towards fly ball contact. His raw power is a tad fringy for his pulled, fly ball contact profile, but GABP is often the gift that keeps on giving to fly ball hitters. No matter how his batted ball profile eventually shakes out, he has sufficient discipline and contact ability to stick in the Majors. He might not ever be an All-Star, but he looks like somebody who should carve out a tidy career.\nJonathan Aranda, 24, 1B/2B, TBR (MLB)\n(AAA) 465 PA, 18 HR, 4 SB, .318/.394/.521\nAranda isn’t truly considered a top prospect due to physical attributes scouts have a hard time accepting. However, he has advanced feel for barreling the ball. He’s no better than league average from a raw power perspective, possibly even minus, but he makes up for it via a lofty, contact-driven BABIP and a healthy HR/FB ratio. He’s not a conventional prospect as he’s a tad undersized for first base and isn’t really sufficiently fleet-footed for a utility role. However, the bat should play, and the Rays are absolutely the right org for figuring out how to squeeze him into the lineup without any detrimental effects. With Brandon Lowe once again on the injured list, Aranda could bounce between second base and designated hitter. He also has minimal experience in left field.\nFive More\nKen Waldichuk, OAK (24): Waldichuk made his debut on Thursday. His command woes were on full display even while Nationals hitters were clearly uncomfortable. The Washington offense is best considered a Quad-A unit. We’ll see how Waldichuk fairs against true Major League caliber opponents later this month.\nSpencer Torkelson, DET (23): No longer technically a prospect because he made 298 plate appearances earlier in the season, Torkelson is nonetheless still a development piece. If one is hunting for positives, Torkelson hit particularly well at Triple-A in 58 plate appearances since mid-August. On the whole, he posted a modest 100 wRC+ in 155 Triple-A plate appearances – hardly inspiring output for a former Top 10 prospect. He rejoined the big league lineup tonight.\nJosh Jung, TEX (24): Perhaps the most-notable snub, Jung has thrashed Triple-A pitching in 83 plate appearances. The Rangers are using guarded language when talking about when they’ll promote their top prospect. I’m now inclined to believe they intend to hold off on promoting him until next season. While it’s certainly plausible that they want another year of club control over Jung, he’s not exactly… young. It’s equally plausible the Rangers legitimately believe remaining in Triple-A will be better for Jung’s health and development.\nEsteury Ruiz, MIL (23): Following the Josh Hader trade, many (myself included) thought Ruiz would immediately join the Brewers outfield mix. Then, when they consistently passed him over even as the Major League club floundered in the NL Central, it became clear they didn’t believe he could improve upon the work of Tyrone Taylor, Jonathan Davis, Garrett Mitchell, and others of questionable utility. It’s possible he’s mostly on hand to serve as a pinch runner and defensive replacement. Notably, Ruiz has not homered since June 15, though he continues to run with aplomb.\nTriston Casas, BOS, (22): Another roster expansion snub, Casas has hit .300/.410/.515 since rejoining Triple-A on July 22. He has 11 doubles, a triple, and five home runs over the same span. While he appears to be both big league ready and an obvious upgrade over the Red Sox current mix of first basemen, the Red Sox appear to be undecided about how to handle Casas. They could be jockeying for the extra season of club control, or they might merely be delaying a decision.",

        "description": "Photo by Joe Sargent/Getty Images\n    \n\n  News and notes prior to Friday’s first pitch against the Marlins. Major League Baseball announced Friday that Atlanta Braves outfielder Michael Harris was named Rookie of the Month for his performance in August. Harris also took home Rookie of the Month honors in June and follows Spencer Strider who won in July. Manager Brian Snitker said that Harris was deserving and he wouldn’t be surprised if he won again next month. \n“Yeah I just heard too. Very well deserving I think,” Snitker said. “What he’s done and continues to do. It won’t surprise me if he wins the next months either. It speaks volumes to the work that he’s doing and how he’s handled this whole thing.”\nIt is no coincidence that the Braves season turned around about the same time that Harris arrived. While there were no questions about his defensively ability in the outfield, he has impressed with his contributions at the plate and is setting up quite a finish in the Rookie of the Year chase with Strider. \n“Just how he’s gone about it, how he doesn’t get too excited about anything,” Snitker said of what has impressed him the most about Harris. “I mean, he’s very calm, and he’s very consistent. It’s the whole thing. He can beat you a lot of different ways. With his glove, with his arm, with his legs, with his bat. That’s pretty good qualities to have in a player that can do so much to impact the game.”\nOzzie Albies update\nSnitker said that Ozzie Albies came through his first rehab game at Gwinnett feeling good and that he will DH again Friday night. He could play in the field as soon as this weekend.\n“Felt good,” Snitker said of Albies. “It was just good to get him out there running around. He’s going to DH again tonight. As long as he’s feeling good, and getting the at-bats, getting his timing, all that. I heard he felt great. So that’s always a good thing.”\nVaughn Grissom and William Contreras getting outfield work\nWith Albies nearing a return, Vaughn Grissom has been seen getting pregame work in the outfield during the homestand. He was joined Friday by William Contreras who made one start in left field earlier this season. Snitker said that if both continue to hit, then they have to find somewhere for them to play and are just exploring their options. \n“If their bat is going to play, then we got to find somewhere for them to play,” Snitker said of Contreras and Grissom. “William played some right field in 2020 when we had the second camp when we were playing the intersquads. He’s a young athletic kid. So we’re going to work him out there to try and have as many options as we can. Because if they’re going to hit, we’re going to find some work for them to play.”\nMarcell Ozuna back in the lineup for the first time since August 14\nMarcell Ozuna is back in left field for Friday’s series opener. It is just his second appearance since his DUI arrest. He started on August 14 and went 0-for-2 at the plate with two strikeouts before being replaced by a pinch-hitter. \n“He’s been working really hard,” Snitker said of the decision to start Ozuna. “I think it’s just time. He’s part of this club. It’s time to get him out there and hopefully he can get going and be who he has in the past. He’s been working hard. He’s had a great attitude and been very positive and you know, he’s part of the club.”\nSnitker also said that Eddie Rosario, who is out of the lineup Friday, is fine but that his hamstring is still not 100 percent.",

        "description": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.We’re all parsing The Speech, Joe Biden’s “Soul of the Nation” address about the growing anti-constitutionalism of Republican extremism. But we should first consider how hard it is to evaluate a speech that no president should have to give.Before we turn to Biden, here are three new stories from The Atlantic.\r\n\tDon’t believe the generals.\r\n\tWhat if Joan of Arc wasn’t a woman?\r\n\tAbortion could define California’s elections.\r\nA Sad DutyJoe Biden told us last night that American democracy is under attack. He did so in plain language and left no doubt about either the dire nature, or the source, of the threat. Most important, he named names—including, finally, Donald Trump. The president took a political risk and spoke the hard truth: that a significant number of citizens of the United States of America, concentrated in the rotted-out shell of the Republican Party, have become extremists who are engaged in anti-constitutional opposition to our system of government.Whenever a president gives a speech, pundits, analysts, and citizens all jump to grade the exercise. Was it a great speech or just a good speech? Did it hit the right marks? Did it serve the right constituency? Did it help or hurt his party?This speech, however, defies such analysis. (I have some serious complaints about the optics and staging. I’ll get to those.) Instead, we should be deeply troubled that Joe Biden had to give this speech at all.And make no mistake: He had to give it. His duty demanded it. As Biden rightly said, the American democracy faces an “ongoing attack” from what he termed “MAGA Republicans” who do not respect the Constitution, the rule of law, the will of the people, or the results of free elections. No president could remain silent under such circumstances.Indeed, I’m not sure it was strong enough. I bristled a bit when the president spoke of the reasonable Republicans with whom he could work. (“Joe Manchin?” I wondered.) Who are these Republicans? Where are they? If you’re going to give a speech about how millions of people now live, as Biden said, in the “shadow of lies,” and you think there are also reasonable people among them, you should encourage them to come into the open and fight alongside you.As someone who once wrote speeches for a few politicians, I would also take points off here and there for a loss of focus. I’m sure it was important to some staffers to get in digs about prescription drugs, guns, and clean energy, but whoever took the final pass on the draft should have gotten out the red pen. This wasn’t the time.Mostly what I felt watching the president was both sympathy and a kind of horror that he was having to say any of this at all. And so I simply cannot judge it as anything but a sad duty, the same kind of speech a president must give in the face of a national tragedy. These are not speeches anyone wants to write or give. Nonetheless, if I had to pick out a line that will resonate in history, I think—or I hope—that it will be Biden’s reminder that democracy requires sensible, tolerant, and mature human beings in order to work:\r\nDemocracy cannot survive when one side believes there are only two outcomes to an election: Either they win or they were cheated … You can’t love your country only when you win.\r\nIt really is that simple.Substance aside, if there’s one place this speech was a bungle, it was in the staging. Optics matter; bathing the president in red so that he looked like His Infernal Eminence, Joseph Biden, Lord of the Underworld, was a bad idea. The podium looked like it was set up for a reading from the Necronomicon. Biden, using light as a metaphor, should have been standing in actual light.I have also taken a galactic amount of steam on social media for being among those who objected to the placement of two Marines in semidarkness behind Biden. People on Twitter flooded me with pictures of presidents and military people, proving only that no one understood the problem. Yes, presidents routinely use military people as backdrops, something I rarely like seeing. It is almost always, however, at the White House, or on military bases, in front of military audiences, at military-themed events, and so on. Giving a speech about democracy in downtown Philadelphia and bringing your own Marines is not something I recall ever seeing. Frankly, staging Marines as if they are the president’s praetorian guards is the sort of thing Trump would love.In any case, Biden did what he had to do. We have reached a watershed in American politics. The president of the United States has told us directly that our system of government is under attack. What happens next is, in every way, up to us.Related:\r\n\tThe justification for Joe Biden’s speech\r\n\tBiden gambles that “we the people” still exist\r\nToday’s News\r\n\tU.S. job growth slowed in August but remained generally strong, according to the latest jobs report from the Labor Department.\r\n\tRussia is postponing the reopening of the Nord Stream 1 pipeline—one of Europe’s main gas-supply pathways.

It could be as recent as breakfast or as distant as your first day of kindergarten. What matters is that you can really visualize it. Hold the image in your mind.\r\n\r\nNow consider: Do you see the scene through your own eyes, as you did at the time? Or do you see yourself in it, as if you’re watching a character in a movie? Do you see it, in other words, from a first-person or a third-person perspective? Usually, we associate this kind of distinction with storytelling and fiction-writing. But like a story, every visual memory has its own implicit vantage point. All seeing is seeing from somewhere. And sometimes, in memories, that somewhere is not where you actually were at the time.\r\nRead the full article.More From The Atlantic\r\n\tWhat babies hear when you sing to them\r\n\tPhotos of the week, from La Tomatina to a steam fair\r\nCulture Break\r\n(Obie Oberholzer / Redux)\r\nRead.

Unfortunately, I can no longer get MeTV—rest assured, I’m working on it—so I thought I’d offer two offbeat movie recommendations for those of you who are insomniacs like me. Both of them are 1980s gems that take place in the middle of the night: Into the Night, directed by John Landis, and After Hours, a Martin Scorsese picture. I drove a taxi in graduate school, and what I love about both movies is how they capture the way a city, after the bars close, has a different personality. And they’re both fun. Both of them were flops when they were released within months of each other in 1985 but have since found their cult audiences over the years.Their plots, oddly enough, are similar: Young men (Jeff Goldblum in Los Angeles, Griffin Dunne in New York), restless late at night, venture into the city, stray too far from home, and get mixed up with beautiful but possibly unstable women (Michelle Pfeiffer and Rosanna Arquette, respectively). Dark comedy, violence, and general paranoia ensue. To say more would be to give away too much, but watch for a cameo by David Bowie in L.A. and a kooky turn by Verna Bloom in New York.The Daily is off for Labor Day, but I’ll be back with you on Tuesday.

Friday notes...\n\n\nTHE LONG AND WINDING ROAD: The Cubs have played 15 consecutive games against teams with winning records. They’re 7-8 in those games.\n\nTHE FRANIMAL: In 22 games as a Cub, Franmil Reyes is batting .276/.304/.517 (24-for-87) with five doubles, two triples and four home runs. He’s reached base safely in 18 of the 22 games.\n\nGOOD AGAINST THE CARDS: Rafael Ortega vs. St. Louis this year: 400/.442/.600 (16-for-40) with five doubles and a home run in 13 games. Nico Hoerner vs. St. Louis this year: .346/.393/.423 (18-for-52) with four doubles, a home run and eight runs scored in 14 games.\n\nTHE NEW GUYS: The Cubs have had 14 players make their big league debuts this year: Javier Assad, Narciso Crook, Anderson Espinoza, Jeremiah Estrada, Brandon Hughes, Caleb Kilian, Brendon Little, Christopher Morel, Nicholas Padilla, Ethan Roberts, Seiya Suzuki, Matt Swarmer, Erich Uelmen and Nelson Velázquez. Last year, they had 15 such players: Cory Abbott, Erick Castillo, Greg Deichmann, Scott Effross, Trent Giambrone, Taylor Gushue, P.J. Higgins, Trevor Megill, Tommy Nance, Tyler Payne, Alfonso Rivas, Manuel Rodriguez, Michael Rucker, Justin Steele and Keegan Thompson.\n\nHere are today’s particulars.\nCubs lineup:\n\n\nHere is tonight's #Cubs starting lineup in St. Louis. pic.twitter.com/3igGjW9Fsz— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nCardinals lineup: \n\n\nOur last series against the Cubs begins tonight! pic.twitter.com/UkSrAYNxXk— St. Louis Cardinals (@Cardinals) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nAlso of interest for tonight and this series (time listed is ET):\n\n\nUmpires for #Cubs (56-75) at #STLCards (76-55):Mark Wegner, John Tumpane, Ryan Blakney, Adrian Johnson (base assignments not confirmed until first pitch)First Pitch: 8:15 pmVenue: Busch Stadium— Umpire Crew (@UmpCrew) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nAdrian Sampson, RHP vs. Jordan Montgomery, LHP\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\nAdrian Sampson pitched last Sunday against the Brewers and... well, you all know what happened there, no sense belaboring it.\nHis previous start was against the Cardinals August 23 at Wrigley Field (second game of the doubleheader) and that did not go well, he served up a couple of home runs and was gone before the fourth inning ended.\nHopefully, this one goes better.\nJordan Montgomery threw a one-hit complete game shutout against the Cubs August 22 at Wrigley Field, the only hit a third-inning double by Christopher Morel.\nHe also threw seven shutout innings (five hits allowed) against the Cubs June 11, when he was still with the Yankees. He’s been pretty much lights-out since being traded to the Cardinals.\nClearly, we are doomed.\n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \nToday’s game is on Marquee Sports Network.

        "description": "Temperatures passed a scorching 105 degrees Fahrenheit at Black Rock City, the psychedelic impromptu settlement put up every Labor Day weekend by revelers in the Nevada desert as part of the Burning Man festival. \n\n\n\n\"Set the oven to 300 degrees, open the oven, stand in front of it ... and that might be what it's going to feel like out there,\" Mark Deutschendorf, a meteorologist with the weather service office in Reno, told San Francisco alt-weekly SFGate.\n\n\n\nDeutschendorf was addressing conditions this weekend as the festival — a pop-up tech-world mecca canceled for two years due to coronavirus — roared back this year despite the heat.  \n\n\n\nThis year, elaborately decorated cars crisscrossed the dusty dried-out lake beds, volunteer pizzamakers churned out pies in the heat and the 80,000 temporary residents wandered among surreal art installations, as shown in this photo essay in the Daily Mail. \n\n\n\nAs temperatures touch 110 degrees across the Great Basin and Colorado River Valley, some in tourist communities like Lake Havasu City, a center of boating alongside a reservoir in the Arizona desert, are staying home.\n\n\n\nIn California, residents are advised to stay inside during the heat of the day, the Los Angeles Times reported — with one Bay Area city taking the extreme step of closing parks to dissuade people from hiking outside, SFGate reported. \n\n\n\nDespite the heat, Californians in general are taking to the air and highways in droves this holiday weekend, which the Times reported would see 10.8 million Americans flying domestically and another 1.8 million internationally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Equilibrium, a newsletter that tracks the growing global battle over the future of sustainability. I'm Saul Elbein. Send us tips and feedback. A friend forward this newsletter to you? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\nIn today's issue...Two reads to carry you into the long weekend: An embattled American Indian community in the mountains of New Mexico grapples with life after a fire, plus we'll look at the impact of the electric vehicle boom on the environment\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen fires pass, the real work begins \n\n\n\nThe heat wave this week has fueled wildfires that are burning across the West — closing highways and threatening neighborhoods from southern California to inland Oregon.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn addition to the strain on firefighters and the populations they are risking their lives to protect, evidence from New Mexico suggests the fires may be preparing the ground for more disaster later.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFighting flames in record heat:&nbsp;Thousands of firefighters fought blazes across California&nbsp;fueled by the stifling weather, which may break records this weekend, The Guardian reported.\n\n\n\nAside from its role boosting fires, the heat makes putting them out even tougher than usual, firefighters said.&nbsp;“Wearing heavy firefighting gear, carrying packs, dragging hose, swinging tools, the folks out there are just taking a beating,” LA County fire chief Thomas Ewald said.\n\n\n\nClosing roads:&nbsp;Fires closed West Coast interstates leading into one of America’s busiest travel weekends.\n\n\n\nEvacuation orders stand for parts of Los Angeles County,&nbsp;where parts of the key Interstate 5 artery was closed, according to the county fire department&nbsp;Another fire&nbsp;near Baker City, Ore., has closed Interstate 84, according to Oregon Public Broadcasting.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEW MEXICO PUEBLO PROVIDES A VISION OF POST-FIRE FUTURE  \n\n\n\nEven once the fires are out, though,&nbsp;a great deal of work will remain, as Curtis Segarra reported for our Nexstar partners at KRQE Albuquerque.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf what happened to New Mexico’s Santa Clara Pueblo is any indication, recovery will be long and painful, Segarra reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSanta Clara is an indigenous community whose watershed was devastated by a massive wildfire a decade ago in the Jemez Mountains.&nbsp;“When the fire happened, it turned the landscape back to [like] the moon,” Tribal Governor Michael J. Chavarria said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe baking heat ruined the ability of the land to absorb water, so “when the rains came, it was basically like a concrete-lined ditch,” Chavarria added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClosing a generation gap:&nbsp;A particularly poignant loss was the fire’s destruction of the sacred, once-lovely Santa Clara Canyon — which became a massive torrent as rain ran off impermeable soils, destroying what trees remained.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The first thing I remember thinking to myself is: ‘How are we gonna clean this up? How are we gonna fix it?’ And in my mind, it was almost like it was impossible,” Santa Clara Pueblo director of forestry Daniel Denipah told KRQE.&nbsp;“The road was washed out. There was a lot of barriers, big logs, big rocks, everything that was just washed-in the area,” Denipah added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBringing in the youth:&nbsp;The effort to rehabilitate that canyon — which is only now being reopened to the community — has become a symbol of tribal renewal and resilience, government members told Segarra.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDenipah, the forestry director, said that restoring the canyon with the help of local youth would do double duty in repairing damage to the culture.\n\n\n\n“From that 10 years of the canyon being closed, we lost that cultural connection to our younger generation, the future of tomorrow,” he said.&nbsp;“They need to understand where they come from. They need to understand how they survive off the land,” he added, saying it was important “not to lose them to the computer age.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA lifelong process:&nbsp;Denipah offered a sober warning for other fire-devastated landscapes across the fragile West — suggesting that recovery for damaged landscapes would be a generational project.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I don’t think it’s ever gonna end,” he said. “It’s probably gonna keep going long after I’m gone.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBattery alternatives could preserve deep ocean\n\n\n\nThe passage of hundreds of billions of dollars in federal clean energy subsidies — and several states’ decision&nbsp;to ban gas cars in a little over a decade&nbsp;— are already leading to big moves by the auto industry toward new electric vehicle (EV) supply chains.\n\n\n\nGeneral Motors&nbsp;began turning out its standardized Ultium car chassis&nbsp;on Thursday at its new facility in Ohio, the company reported.&nbsp;The modular “skateboard” is a key part of the company’s attempt to outproduce rivals like Tesla.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA vital question:&nbsp;These new production chains come with an urgent problem — how to get the necessary minerals without devastating huge swaths of the environment.\n\n\n\nOne controversial mine in the upper Midwest would produce nickel — potentially at the risk of pollution to local lakes, streams and the wild rice beds of the Ojibwe people, The New York Times reported.\n\n\n\nNickel is&nbsp;a necessary component of EV batteries, where it helps boost the capacity of the cathode — which sucks up electrons from the anode, producing an electrical current, as CNBC reported.&nbsp;The mining company, “will come and go — greatly enriched by their mining operation. But we, and the remnants of the Tamarack mine, will be here forever,” Kelly Applegate of the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe told the Times.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOcean is no substitute: Attempts to avoid human rights by mining the deep ocean may be even worse than land-based mining, oceanographers told the Vancouver Sun.\n\n\n\nA proposal by a Vancouver-based mining outfit to mine polymetallic nodules by dredging the seafloor nearly 4 miles below the surface could unleash irreparable damage, the Sun found. \n\n\n\n“I don’t think it’s obvious that deepsea mining is a much better way to do it, in terms of the environment,” said oceanographer Craig Smith.&nbsp;Smith noted that the deep sea plain is one of the most biodiverse and sensitive ocean environments on earth.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There are a lot of unknowns, and once we do it, we can’t go back. There’s no way to fix this deepsea ecosystem,” he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHERE ARE THREE OTHER ALTERNATIVES \n\n\n\nThere are other options that may wreak less havoc here on earth — from batteries made from biomaterials, from better recycling or even from looking to space.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBatteries from crabs:&nbsp;A team at the University of Maryland&nbsp;fabricated a battery from a combination of zinc and chitosan&nbsp;— a variant of a chemical found in the bodies of crabs, lobsters and many fungi — according to a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;published on Thursday in Matter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe battery is made from just chitosan and zinc — leaving out scarce, toxic and potentially flammable lithium.&nbsp;Two-thirds of the battery can biodegrade within five months — leaving behind just inert, recyclable zinc.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The design of new batteries that are respectful of the environment, cheap and producing high discharge capacity,&nbsp;is one of the more important items that must be developed in the coming years,” one battery expert — not involved in the study — told the Guardian.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWait for scraps:&nbsp;Many auto-supply giants are pouring money into battery recycling facilities,&nbsp;which will let them pull scarce materials from old cars, Bloomberg reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut those facilities may stand largely idle until more EVs reach the end of their lives, according to Bloomberg.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe first wave of junked early-adoption EVs won’t start hitting junkyards till 2025.&nbsp;While recycling investment is picking up in the U.S. and Europe, China is world leader — in large part because the country’s massive electric vehicle adoption means it will be the source of “the first big wave of scrap,” as Bloomberg put it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut even as recycling picks up, we’re going to need new raw materials, one mining expert told Bloomberg. “Recycling isn’t going to be able to plug that gap any time soon.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLooking up:&nbsp;One possible solution that could be far easier and less ecologically destructive than deepsea mining&nbsp;is turning to the moon, Lewis Pinault of aerospace venture capitalist firm Airbus Ventures told Nautilus Magazine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI think there is room for a movement, if you will, to say, “Look, we have a responsibility to life on the planet and to the diversity of the planet,” Pinaul said.&nbsp;“And we have this gift of our geological twin, the moon, to provide us with mineral and energy wealth.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Once we’ve done the hard work of knowing where to mine [on the moon] the next steps are solvable,” Pinault said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFriday Follow-ups\n\n\n\nReturning to stories we’ve covered throughout the week&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCalifornia solar fights to supply off-grid community&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe wrote about the growing pains facing solar supply chains in the U.S. Southeast. Now a California solar company is fighting to become a “micro-utility” for a new off-grid development of solar-supplied homes — a business that would be illegal across most of the United States, The New York Times reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCalifornia asks electric vehicle drivers to hold off on charging&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe covered California’s bold legislative push around clean energy, as well as the possible power shortages that it faces in his weekend of record heat. Leading up to Labor Day the managers of the state power grid asked electric vehicle (EV) drivers to limit when they charged their vehicles to before 4 p.m. or after 9 p.m. to help smooth out the grid, the Times reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFoul play suspected in death of Texas spring &nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe wrote about the long-term water supply concerns facing the State of Texas, and the water conflicts arising from it. A spring-fed pool in the sweltering Rio Grande Valley town of Brackettville has dried up — and local advocates says local commercial agriculture is at fault, Texas Monthly reported. “This is not a place to grow crops. This is going to be a tourist location. But . . . the only way we’re going to get there is if we have water,” one local activist said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🦩 Lighter click: The Hill's photos of the week\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProgramming note: Sustainability will not publish on Monday in observance of Labor Day.\n\n\n\nPlease visit The Hill’s Sustainability section online for the web version of this newsletter and more stories.

        "title": "We’re all aging. This Labor Day, let’s remember: without workers, there is no care.",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3626406-were-all-aging-this-labor-day-lets-remember-without-workers-there-is-no-care/",
        "description": "Labor Day is a unique celebration, a holiday conceived nearly 130 years ago by the very people it is intended to celebrate: workers. The holiday’s history speaks to me this year, in particular, as Congress reconvenes after the August passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While a landmark piece of legislation in many ways, the IRA sadly does not address the needs of a critical part of the country’s workforce: the direct caregiving professionals who serve America’s rapidly expanding older adult population.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo years ago, these caregivers were heralded as&nbsp;heroes who deserved protection. And the older adults in their care were the&nbsp;focus of well-deserved concern. Now? COVID-19 has ravaged the aging services workforce. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 229,000 professional caregivers have left the aging services sector since February 2020. As a result, older adults and families are struggling to get the care they need as&nbsp;nursing homes close and reduce admissions&nbsp;and home health providers decline service requests. Though N-95s are no longer in short supply today, other resources are, including adequate funding for fair wages, support for workforce training and development, and policymakers’ attention on legislative fixes that will, for instance, help to build a pipeline of domestic and international workers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCongress’ failure to act on issues related to older adults is not new: ignoring and underfunding the critical services older adults need to age with dignity has been the norm since my first days on the Hill, working for Sen. Tom Eagleton (D-Mo.). We’ve seen some progress in fits and starts, to address the concerns of adults 65+ — with a lot of effort. The IRA, which gives Medicare the ability to negotiate prices on some prescription drugs, is a clear win for older adults&nbsp;by helping them save millions on out of pocket drug costs&nbsp;that represents, in the words of Johns Hopkins University professor Jeremy Greene, “20 years of work by advocates who have labored to close a loophole in the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut here’s the thing: our country cannot wait another 20 years for Congress to provide the support for the workforce to help older adults with bathing, dressing, toileting, medication management, and feeding so they can live with dignity and independence. In fact we can’t wait another minute. America is aging rapidly:&nbsp;about 16.9 percent of the American population was 65 years old or over&nbsp;in 2020 and is expected to reach 22 percent by 2050. The nation will&nbsp;need to fill 8.2 million direct care jobs in the long-term care sector between 2018 and 2028&nbsp;as existing workers leave the field or exit the labor force altogether, per researchers at PHI. Action is needed now.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne leader of a nonprofit provider serving home health care to people in their 80s or 90s explains the situation well: “Demand for care has grown tremendously and continues to as we navigate the pandemic and as our population ages. Labor shortages make it more difficult to hire the people we need to provide the care that’s necessary. We are struggling to piece together care for home care cases because of fierce competition for staff. Wages for home care professionals — aides, physical therapists, social workers, nurses — are tied to reimbursement rates. … The outcome is simple: no staffing, no services — and that will surely lead to a crisis in caring for our nation’s aging population.” From another: “We’ve been making hard decisions for months; we turn away 250 admissions a week because we do not have enough staff.”\n\n\n\nSome elected officials understand the urgency. The June debut of the bipartisan 21st Century Long-Term Care Caucus, created to focus on issues related to older adults and aging, is heartening. We urge their House colleagues to join caucus’ founders, Reps. Ann Kuster (D-N.H.) and Bryan Steil (R-Wis.), and lead on proposals that will support our long-term care workforce to make jobs serving older adults respected, sustainable, and desirable. \n\n\n\nThis Labor Day, it's time for all of us — Congress as well as the voting public — to consider how we want all of us to age in this country. Changes to prescription drug pricing are welcome, but not enough.&nbsp;Policymakers&nbsp;can&nbsp;help older adults and families access the care and services they need: just remember the people providing the services. Without them, there is no care.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKatie Smith Sloan is president and CEO of Washington D.C.-based&nbsp;LeadingAge, the association of nonprofit providers of aging services.",

        "description": "Former President Trump on Saturday will hold his first rally since the FBI searched his home in Florida.\n\n\n\nTrump is ostensibly heading to Pennsylvania to help boost support for the teetering campaigns of Senate candidate Mehmet Oz and gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, both of whom he backed in their Republican primary races.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Trump is expected to unleash on President Biden, the Department of Justice and the FBI in a speech that will take place two days after Biden described Trump and his movement as an urgent threat to democracy.\n\n\n\nHere are five things to watch:\n\n\n\nHow Trump addresses the FBI search\n\n\n\nSaturday’s event in Wilkes-Barre will be Trump’s first political rally since FBI agents searched his Mar-a-Lago estate on Aug. 8.\n\n\n\nThe former president has addressed the search at length on Truth Social, his fledgling social media platform, but he has yet to speak about it in front of throngs of energized supporters, where Trump tends to use his most bombastic and incendiary rhetoric.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) in filings has laid out how it spent months unsuccessfully trying to get sensitive government documents back from Trump after he left office, culminating in the August search. A redacted affidavit indicated that the government received 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago with dozens of documents marked “secret” or “top secret,” raising concerns that additional highly sensitive materials were still at the residence and prompting the search.\n\n\n\nThe legal battle over Trump’s retention of government materials is still playing out in court as his team seeks to draw out the government’s investigation.\n\n\n\nBut Trump on Saturday is likely to whip his supporters into a frenzy, railing against the politicization of the FBI and DOJ and arguing he is the victim of a political witch hunt intended to discourage him from running for president in 2024.\n\n\n\nHow Trump responds to Biden warning he’s a threat to democracy\n\n\n\nTrump will travel to a city just outside Biden’s hometown of Scranton two days after the president spoke in Philadelphia and described the former president’s political movement as a grave threat to American democracy.\n\n\n\n“Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,” Biden said in Philadelphia on Thursday, clarifying on Friday that he was not saying all Trump voters posed a threat to the country.\n\n\n\nBiden highlighted Trump’s proclivity for casting doubt on election results, elevating conspiracy theories and attacking law enforcement, most recently over the search of his Mar-a-Lago estate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump is likely to hit back at Biden when he takes the stage on Saturday night, according to one official close to the former president, framing the president’s remarks as a divisive attack on millions of Trump voters.\n\n\n\n“Someone should explain to Joe Biden, slowly but passionately, that MAGA means, as powerfully as mere words can get, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!” Trump posted on Truth Social after Biden’s speech. “If he doesn’t want to Make America Great Again, which through words, action, and thought, he doesn’t, then he certainly should not be representing the United States of America!”\n\n\n\nThe expected back-and-forth between Biden and Trump underscores the degree to which the White House is trying to make the midterms a referendum on the former president as he backs candidates like Oz and Mastriano, the latter of whom has repeatedly cast doubt on the 2020 election results.\n\n\n\nIt also serves as a preview of a potential 2024 presidential race as Trump mulls another bid and Biden indicates he will seek reelection.\n\n\n\nA Wall Street Journal poll released Thursday found Biden leading Trump by 6 percentage points in a hypothetical rematch of the 2020 election.\n\n\n\nTrump looks to boost Oz and Mastriano\n\n\n\nThe primary purpose of Saturday’s rally is for Trump to boost the candidacies of Oz and Mastriano, as polls show both trailing their Democratic rivals.\n\n\n\nOz in particular has struggled to gain traction since Trump’s endorsement helped propel him to victory in a competitive primary over David McCormick, who had the support of other Trump administration officials.\n\n\n\nA FiveThirtyEight average of polls showed Democrat Lt. Gov. John Fetterman leading Oz by 8 points, 48 to 40, and the nonpartisan Cook Political Report last week moved the race from “toss-up” to “lean Democrat.”\n\n\n\nFetterman has spent limited time on the campaign trail in recent weeks as he recovers from a stroke he suffered just before the primary, something the Oz campaign has seized on. But Oz has struggled to win over voters given his loose ties to Pennsylvania, and a boost from Trump could be critical to help close the gap.\n\n\n\nMastriano, meanwhile, has fully embraced Trump’s rhetoric about the 2020 election and other policies backed by the former president. Trump’s appearance on Saturday is certain to further solidify support for Mastriano among the base, but it remains to be seen if he can win over enough moderate voters to defeat Democratic rival Josh Shapiro.\n\n\n\nA poll last week from Emerson College Polling shows Shapiro, the state's attorney general, with a 47-44 lead over Mastriano, with 6 percent of respondents undecided.\n\n\n\nTrump kicks off his general election push\n\n\n\nTrump was active in the primaries, endorsing candidates and joining them in person before primary days, but Saturday will mark the former president’s first general election rally of the 2022 midterm cycle.\n\n\n\nSources in Trump’s orbit indicated he is likely to travel to battleground states in the two months remaining before Election Day, and particularly states with races involving his endorsed candidates that are likely to be competitive, like North Carolina, Michigan and Georgia.\n\n\n\nSenate races in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania, in particular, could help determine control of the Senate for the next two years, and each features candidates endorsed by Trump.\n\n\n\nThe former president remains very popular among Republicans, and GOP leaders will rely on him to help boost turnout.\n\n\n\nOne potential issue, however, is that Republicans have tended to underperform in elections where Trump himself is not on the ballot, such as the 2018 midterms and recent special House elections won by Democrats. Republicans hope that an active Trump in the next two months will lead to high turnout.\n\n\n\nOne former Trump campaign adviser also noted that how the former president’s preferred candidates fare could be a major factor in how easily Trump is able to clear the GOP field ahead of a 2024 primary. If several of his candidates lose and his influence appears to be diminished, it could embolden other Republicans interested in seeking the presidency, the official reasoned.\n\n\n\nRally underscores Pennsylvania’s importance\n\n\n\nThe presence of both Trump and Biden in Pennsylvania within days of each other reinforces the political importance of the Keystone State.\n\n\n\nTrump’s rally on Saturday is being sandwiched by two visits from Biden. The president was in Philadelphia on Thursday for his speech about democracy, and he will travel Monday to Pittsburgh to mark Labor Day. Trump may also return to the state for another rally for Oz and Mastriano before November’s elections.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania was pivotal in deciding the presidency in 2016 and 2020, it will be a potential turning point in control of the Senate in 2022 and it will likely be a fierce battleground in 2024.\n\n\n\nBiden carried Pennsylvania by roughly 80,000 votes, but the state was a major target of attacks from Trump and his allies after it took days to finish counting votes and determine the winner.\n\n\n\nGiven the state’s rules about when it starts counting mail ballots and other forms of early voting, a close race could provide another opening for Trump and his supporters to levy baseless claims of fraud should his preferred candidates lose.",

Some countries, including the U.S., have already said they will not import Russian oil, but other countries including China and India have continued to provide a market for this oil.&nbsp;The refusal to ship Russian oil not sold below a price cap attempts to cut into these continued profits, Treasury officials said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCountries like India and China, which have friendlier positions toward Russia than the West and have declined to condemn the country’s invasion of Ukraine in venues like the United Nations Security Council, could still purchase oil at or above the price set by the cap.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut a senior Treasury official said the cap, which is enforced through restrictions on shipping-related industries like marine insurance, is being designed in a way that will still make it more expensive for Russia to sell energy outside of the coalition of participating countries.&nbsp;“If they choose to sell outside of the price cap coalition, it’s going to cost them more to sell because the services will be more expensive, and the countries they’re selling to will know that there’s a lower price out there that they can potentially get,” the official said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnalysts are skeptical: Energy market analysts doubt whether the price cap will have a significant effect on global energy prices since Russia has been able to continue selling its oil and gas despite waves of sanctions from the U.S. and Europe. \n\n\n\n“The truth is that Russia is already selling their oil despite all these sanctions,” Phil Flynn, energy analyst with the Price Futures Group, said in an interview with The Hill. “[The price cap] is actually raising the risk to Europe that Russia will cut off their supply, especially when they’re going to be most vulnerable.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the cap here, from Rachel and The Hill’s Tobias Burns. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShelling around nuclear plant sparks concerns\n\n\n\nThe world’s nuclear watchdog is visiting the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine this week amid concerns sparked by shelling around the plant.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRafael Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), warned last month that military action around the plant raised “very real risk of nuclear disaster.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts say the effects of such a disaster could lead to radiation leakage that affects the local communities but would most likely not lead to a global catastrophe.&nbsp; &nbsp;“The kind of shelling we’re seeing should not be a significant impact on the reactors. In the way that it’s being done now, which is, you know, occasional shelling,” said Jonathan Cobb, senior communication manager at the World Nuclear Association.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant&nbsp;— the largest nuclear plant in Europe — is directly on the front lines of the fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe IAEA’s visit comes days after Ukraine warned of “renewed shelling.” In a statement released Aug. 28, the IAEA said the shelling hit the area of the plant’s “two special buildings” which house facilities like water treatment plants, equipment repair shops and waste management facilities.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAll clear for now: All measurements of radioactivity at the site were within normal range, and there was “no indication of any hydrogen leakage.”&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere have only been two major accidents related to nuclear reactors in history. The first was Chernobyl in 1986, when a reactor when out of control during a test, leading it to explode.&nbsp; &nbsp;More recently, in March 2011, Japan was hit by a major earthquake followed by a tsunami that led to power loss at the Fukushima Daiichi plant. The power led to the cooling systems failing in three reactors, causing the core to overheat.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFukushima, not Chernobyl. Experts say the worst-case scenario at Zaporizhzhia would look more like what happened in Fukushima rather than what happened in Chernobyl.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFighting between the Russians and Ukrainians could disrupt the cooling mechanism of the reactors, which could cause the core to overheat, leading it to melt — often referred to as a nuclear meltdown.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut getting to a nuclear meltdown would take a major event, experts say, because the reactors themselves have six-feet-thick concrete containment vessels protecting them.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“At least in theory, if even if there was a direct hit, there would be at least some protection,” said Mitchel Wallerstein, a nonresident senior fellow at The Chicago Council.&nbsp; &nbsp;The greatest concern in such a scenario is for the local population that lives around the area.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainian government has reportedly begun distributing potassium iodide pills, which help prevent inhaled or swallowed radioactive iodine from being absorbed by the thyroid — a gland located in the neck that makes hormones to help to regulate the many functions of the body, such as its metabolic rate. Exposure to radiation can increase the risk of developing thyroid cancer.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here from The Hill’s Jordan Williams. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nON TAP NEXT WEEK\n\n\n\nWednesday \n\n\n\nThe Senate Environment and Public Works Committee will hold a hearing on bills related to preventing new regulations for livestock and motor sports, and that would create a grant program for mitigating impacts of wildfire smoke The Senate EPW Committee will also hold a confirmation hearing on nominees for the Tennessee Valley Authority board of directors \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nTexas’ heat index could reach 125 degrees over the next 30 years, study finds (The Texas Tribune) What makes this California heat wave exceptional (SFGate) Scientists detect second 'vast' methane leak at Pemex oil field in Mexico (Reuters) Tire Pollution Will Get Worse As Heavy EVs Hit the Road (Jalopnik) Hurricane-free August was extremely rare.

        "description": "Now that the pumpkin-spiced latté has returned, you can take your love of fall even further with these&nbsp;pumpkin-shaped Dutch ovens&nbsp;that Twitter has fallen in love with.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToday in health, we'll look at the White House requesting billions in new funding to respond to both the coronavirus and monkeypox, with “difficult decisions” looming if more resources aren’t available.\n\n\n\nWelcome to Overnight Health Care, where we’re following the latest moves on policy and news affecting your health. For The Hill, we’re Peter Sullivan, Nathaniel Weixel and Joseph Choi. Subscribe here.\n\n\n\nA note from the authors: It is Peter’s last day on this newsletter. He says thanks for reading and Nate and Joseph will carry on well!\n\n\n\nBiden asks for billions in COVID, monkeypox funding\n\n\n\nThere’s a new twist in the ongoing fight for COVID-19 funding. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House is set to request $22.4 billion in funding for the COVID-19 response effort and $3.9 billion for the monkeypox response effort in the form of emergency funding from Congress, senior administration officials announced on Friday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe updated request for COVID-19 funding is to meet immediate short-term domestic needs, including testing, research and development of next-generation vaccines and therapeutics, according to the White House. It also would support the global response to COVID-19 and help to prepare for future variants.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Without additional funding, we will have to make more difficult decisions,” a senior administration official said on Friday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConsequences already: &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe federal government on Friday suspended the program for free COVID-19 tests to be sent to Americans. Officials argued that a lack of funding has prevented them from adequately replenishing national stockpiles of at-home tests.Officials said on Friday that while there are some tests available in the stockpile, there is not enough funding to get through a surge in the fall.Vaccines will be free into 2023, but the timeline for commercialization of vaccines going forward has had to be accelerated without funding.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe request to fight monkeypox is to help ensure ready access to vaccinations, testing, treatment and operational support. It also includes $600 million to help combat the spread globally.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\nVA to offer abortion access in limited circumstances\n\n\n\nThe Department of Veterans’ Affairs (VA) on Friday said that it will provide access to abortions to pregnant veterans in limited circumstances.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the department said it submitted an interim final rule in the federal register to allow it to provide access to abortion counseling, as well as the procedure itself for people who became pregnant as a result of rape or incest, or if carrying a pregnancy to term endangers the life of the mother.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVA Secretary Denis McDonough called the move a “patient safety decision.”&nbsp;“Pregnant Veterans and VA beneficiaries deserve to have access to world-class reproductive care when they need it most. That’s what our nation owes them, and that’s what we at VA will deliver,” he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA departure from current rules:&nbsp;In its&nbsp;interim final rule, the VA notes that current regulations don’t allow the agency’s Civilian Health and Medical Program (CHAMPVA) program to cover the procedure unless the life of the pregnant person is endangered.\n\n\n\nCoverage for abortions for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest is also excluded from CHAMPV, as is abortion counseling. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe move would cover veterans and benefits under CHAMPVA program, the VA said. The department added that its employees may provide the service regardless of state restrictions as long as they are working within the scope of federal employment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nWHAT TO KNOW ABOUT POLIO AS IT RESURFACES \n\n\n\nThis year,&nbsp;polio cases&nbsp;have been detected in New York state, London and Jerusalem.\n\n\n\nSpread mostly through contact with an infected person’s feces, vaccination is protective against illness, paralysis and death from the polio virus.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn July, the case in Rockland County in New York was in an otherwise healthy young adult who was unvaccinated but had a confirmed case of poliomyelitis resulting in paralysis in the leg. The county also found the virus in wastewater samples from June.\n\n\n\nSymptoms: Most people who are infected will not have visible symptoms, according to the&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&nbsp;(CDC). One out of four people may have flu-like symptoms, like sore throat, fever and fatigue. An even smaller number of people may have neurological symptoms because the virus can travel into the spinal cord, including meningitis (infection of covering of spinal cord and/or brain) or paralysis.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nImportance of vaccines: “The best way to keep adults and children polio-free is through safe and effective immunization – New Yorkers’ greatest protection against the worst outcomes of polio, including permanent paralysis and even death,” says New York State Health Commissioner Mary T. Bassett. In New York City, there are some pockets where vaccination coverage is under 70 percent in children ages 6 months to 5 years old.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\nDRIED MUSHROOMS RECALLED IN 15 STATES OVER SALMONELLA\n\n\n\nAn Asian food importer based in Maryland is recalling some of its dried mushrooms due to a potential salmonella contamination.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThai Phat Wholesalers is&nbsp;stopping the sale&nbsp;of four types of its “Three Coins Dried Mushrooms” in 15 states: Virginia, New York, New Jersey, North Carolina, Maryland, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, South Carolina and Tennessee.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe specialty retailer issued a recall for the mushrooms on Friday after a routine test from the Maryland Department of Health detected bacteria in some packages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo far, no one has gotten sick from eating any of the “Three Coins Dried Mushrooms” but Thai Phat is urging people to not purchase the product or return them for a full refund.Most people who become infected with salmonella will suffer from stomach cramps, fever, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting and recover within a week, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nWHO: Monkeypox drop proves outbreak can be stopped\n\n\n\nWorld Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said on Friday that the recent decline in monkeypox cases that has been observed in North America and Europe is evidence that the current outbreak can be stopped or eliminated outright.\n\n\n\nTedros made note of how monkeypox has quickly gone from being a little-known virus that was often only discussed within the context of&nbsp;countries where it is endemic.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHistoric numbers:&nbsp;With over 50,000 cases and 16 deaths due to monkeypox confirmed this year, Tedros said the number of cases has already exceeded the number of reported infections in the years since monkeypox was first identified in 1958.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s encouraging to see that in some countries in Europe and North America we now see a sustained decline in cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of public health interventions and community engagement to track infections and prevent transmission,” said Tedros.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to information from the European Union, reported monkeypox cases have seen a continued decline since peaking in mid-July. The current number of reported cases in EU countries now reflect the levels that were observed in the early parts of the outbreak.Throughout the monkeypox outbreak, the U.S. has tended to follow the epidemiological trends observed in Europe. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has indicated a slight decline in reported cases in recent weeks. CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said last week that she was “cautiously optimistic,” though the rate of increase is uneven across the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These signs confirm what we have said consistently since the beginning: that with the right measures, this is an outbreak that can be stopped,” Tedros said. “And in regions that do not have animal-to-human transmission, this is a virus that can be eliminated.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nStudy raises concerns about the effectiveness of the monkeypox vaccine (Stat) There's no bad time to get a new COVID booster if you're eligible, CDC director says (NPR) Biden administration is preparing for the end of free COVID-19 vaccines as funds run dry (CBS News) \n\n\n\nSTATE BY STATE\n\n\n\n2 residents of California assisted living facilities die after separate accidental poisoning incidents (NBC News) Pa.'s Health Department is distributing free potassium iodide tablets to residents (WFMZ-TV) New Mexico to build $10 million abortion clinic near Texas border (Midland Reporter-Telegram) \n\n\n\nOP-ED IN THE HILL\n\n\n\nAs overdose crisis rages, we must prioritize saving lives with harm reduction  \n\n\n\nThat's it for today, thanks for reading.

The reason the Red Sox felt comfortable trading their starting catcher has hit .288/.359/.507 in Triple A this season. With Wong, Hernandez, and Story the Sox are a Casas callup or Hosmer return from their ideal lineup at this point in 2022. \nNick Pivetta has been up and down the last few months. After three rough starts to begin July, Pivetta made six starts for 34.1 innings striking out 35, walking 12, and good for a 3.41 ERA/3.74 FIP. He took a little step back last time out against the Tampa Bay Rays. Pivetta hasn’t been giving up lots of homers, which is a strength of the Rangers, so maybe that will be his path to success tonight.\nThe Rangers counter with Dallas Keuchel who has put up an 8.84 ERA against a 5.78 FIP (that’s a yikes). He’s allowed at least 6 runs six times this season. Including a 1.0 inning 10 run performance in Aprial and back to back 7 earned run outings his last two starts. With any luck this game is a laugh and over in the first three innings.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/brandon-belt-to-undergo-knee-surgery.html",
        "description": "Giants first baseman Brandon Belt will undergo season-ending surgery on his right knee tomorrow, he tells Alex Pavlovic of NBC Sports Bay Area. The club informed reporters earlier in the week that surgery had been recommended, and the 34-year-old indeed decided to go under the knife after taking a couple days to deliberate.\nBelt has been on the injured list a few times this season due to inflammation in that knee. This is far from the first year in which the joint has proven bothersome, as Belt has twice previously undergone surgery and had it drained on multiple occasions. In a forthright chat with Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle last week, the 12-year MLB veteran acknowledged the knee could be problematic for the rest of his career.\nDuring his interview with the Chronicle, Belt seemed to imply he could retire entirely if the knee injury were especially damaging. Speaking with Pavlovic today, however, he stated he intends to continue playing if he&#8217;s able. &#8220;It&#8217;s just going to depend. I&#8217;m going to play next year if I can get my knee healthy and strong again,&#8221; Belt said. &#8220;Last time I had this surgery (in 2015), I responded really well to it. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m anticipating &#8230; If I can get it strong like I did (in 2015) then I&#8217;ll play, but if not then I&#8217;m not going to go out there and be substandard all the time. We&#8217;ll just have to see.&#8221;\nBelt’s production has taken a huge hit this season, one of the reasons for the Giants inability to replicate last year’s 107-win campaign. Through 298 plate appearances, he hit only .213/.326/.350 with eight home runs. Belt’s just a season removed from blasting 29 longballs, but his hard contact rate has fallen more than six percentage points from last year’s 44.8% mark. It’s hard to imagine the persistent knee issues weren’t playing some role in those struggles, considering he mashed at a .285/.393/.595 clip between 2020-21.\nIt’s nevertheless tough to know what one can expect from Belt moving forward given his age and injury history. The career-long Giant is headed for free agency this offseason. Belt is making $18.4MM this year after accepting a qualifying offer last November, but he’ll certainly be facing a paycut during this trip to the open market.",

        "description": "Vanessa Slivken tries to get the children in her autism services center the time they need, but persistently short staffing has forced them to ask every family to deal with a rotating schedule.Slivken says it’s the fairest way to go.“When we don&#x27;t have staff that can provide the service for you we are gonna have to ask that your child does not come to day treatment that day,” Slivken, the senior director of autism and day treatment services at St. David’s Center for Child and Family Development said.In a trend that is more acute in the last two years, centers for autistic people in Minnesota have been struggling to find enough staff members — and the money to pay them.People who work in the field say the longer those staffing problems continue, the greater the consequences for children and families.The state Department of Human Services notes that the Minnesota Autism Developmental Disabilities Monitoring Network found that in Hennepin and Ramsey counties around one in 44, or 2.3 percent of 4-year-olds were identified with autism spectrum disorder in 2018.“We are now hitting a crisis. We do not have enough people who are willing to work in these professions,” said Julie Sjordal, CEO of St. David’s Center.“You can go work at Uber Eats and drive for the same price you could work as a practitioner providing services,” Sjordal said. “This is really hard, intense emotional work that we&#x27;re in. So, we need to pay at a level that really shows our community values the people who are stepping into these roles and into these fields.”The main entrance welcoming families, visitors and children to St. David&#x27;s Center for child and family development in Minnetonka, Minn.Linton Ritchie Jr. | MPR NewsThere’s a shortage of behavioral therapists, paraprofessionals and mental health practitioners — all vital to providing the best care for people with sensory sensitivities and other issues that can affect learning and navigating society, autism treatment center executives say.One root of the staffing problem is the financial hit that treatment centers took during the pandemic.Dr. Eric Larsson, president of the Association for Science in Autism Treatment said during the pandemic the financial problems temporarily were eased by federal aid, but now those programs have ended.“We&#x27;re owing several hundred thousand dollars to the bank and not able to make up that deficit,” Larsson said.In a May 2022 letter pleading for help from state budget negotiators, Larsson’s organization, which represents a number of autism treatment centers including St. David’s, noted they are only able to charge a fee for service. When Medical Assistance reimbursements decline, the centers have a hard time paying staff, leading to lower levels of services for children.The long term answer, Larsson and others said, is more funding from the state of Minnesota and the federal government. For its part the state seems to agree. The Department of Human Services said on its website that providers of services for these children and others “are also challenged to recruit and train a sufficient number of staff to serve the number of people who need treatment. Staff retention is also affected by reimbursement rates, lack of training to meet the demands of the position.”Children&#x27;s behavior therapy classroom at St. David&#x27;s Center in Minnetonka, Minn.Linton Ritchie Jr. | MPR NewsNot having enough workers can create tough work environments. Jeff Nichols, CEO at the Minnesota Autism Center said “it just invariably shifts some of that intangible burden in a day to other staff.”Without regular care Larsson said, “the overall testing data shows that children with autism are losing a year to two years of education.”Nichols said his center remains open as much as possible.“We&#x27;re still trying to serve as many or more kids at least give them something, but it is not always full time, every day, five days a week.”",

        "description": "Photo by Julio Aguilar/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Yankees aim to get September started on the right foot  because they cannot afford another month like August. Are we OK with calling this the beginning of the Oswald Peraza Era? I don’t think putting excessive pressure on the rookie is a good idea, but also I’m focused on turning the page from an awful August by the Yankees. I guess we’ll just need another name for it. How about September? (Thank you, blessed Gregorian calendar.)\nAlas, the Yankees are apparently not actually believers the Oswald Peraza Era because the Top-100 prospect isn’t even starting tonight. Neither is fellow rookie Oswaldo Cabrera, who hasn’t started since Tuesday. We are in the middle of a very stupid time to be a Yankees fan.\nMatt and Andrés have already set the table for how important this series now is for the Yankees, so I’d encourage you to read their previews (maybe Brian Cashman and Aaron Boone missed the memo). The SparkNotes version is that the 15-game lead that New York held over Tampa back on August 2nd has shrunk to just six, and with a bad series at Tropicana Field — which, let’s face it, has happened a lot to this team over the past decade — could cut it down to three. It’s time to push back after an awful month and affirm that this can be a team that not only wins the division but goes on a long playoff run, too.\nDomingo Germán takes the hill after the longest and one of the most successful starts of his five-year career. Although the Yankees’ offense inexplicably floundered in Oakland, the right-hander did his part with 7.2 innings of three-hit shutout ball. The A’s are not a good team, so take that with a grain of salt, but Germán has also recently turned in commendable efforts against a couple future NL playoff teams in the Mets and Cardinals.\nThe Rays did better at Yankee Stadium on August 17th though, when Germán didn’t make it out of the fifth, surrendering three runs on five hits and a walk. Overall, he’s exceeded expectations, but he’ll need to do better than that since there won’t be a Josh Donaldson walk-off slam to bail him out this time.\nIf it feels like the Yankees have seen an oddly high amount of Jeffrey Springs starts this season, you wouldn’t be wrong. This will mark his third start against them out of 19 on the year. Springs has fared well since entering the rotation full-time in mid-May. In 15 starts between May 15th and August 22nd, he pitched to a 2.54 ERA, 3.37 FIP, and over a strikeout per inning. Springs may be tiring though, as the former reliever is now over 100 innings for the first time since 2017, when he was a 24-year-old in High-A, and he got crushed by the Red Sox during his last time out.\nSolo homers from Gleyber Torres and Matt Carpenter doomed an otherwise-good start from Springs against New York on May 27th, but he got a solid enough revenge on August 16th with five innings of two-hit, one-run ball at Yankee Stadium. Who will win Round 3?\nAs previously noted, Peraza and Cabrera aren’t starting tonight because the Yankees hate you. Instead we get all of the Struggle City Crew: Isiah Kiner-Falefa, Aaron Hicks, Gleyber Torres, and Josh Donaldson. Anthony Rizzo had an epidural to address his back injury and will not play until Tuesday, and DJ LeMahieu (battling through injury) is playing first. Andrew Benintendi bats third and he’s not bad or anything, but man do I feel uninspired.\nWhatever. I just want to see some Aaron Judge dingers at this point. So let’s get on with it.\nHow to watch\nLocation: Tropicana Field — St. Petersburg, FL\nFirst pitch: 7:10 pm ET\nTV broadcast: YES Network, Bally Sports Sun, MLB Network (out-of-market only)\nRadio broadcast: WFAN 660/101.9, WADO 1380, SN590\nOnline stream: MLB.tv\nFor updates, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, and like us on Facebook.\n\n\nFriday Night at the Trop. #RepBXPresented by @Hilton pic.twitter.com/aGCxblvpKL— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n#Rays lineup vs. #Yankees, with Choi at 1B pic.twitter.com/MEdE6y2dY1— Marc Topkin (@TBTimes_Rays) September 2, 2022",

But the August jobs report showed the economy moving toward ample job growth and lower inflation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome economists and policymakers have been concerned that the national labor shortage could be fueling high inflation by forcing businesses to boost wages and prices quickly.&nbsp;&nbsp;As the size of the workforce increases, businesses may have an easier time finding workers without having to raise wages at rapid rates. That could also help businesses keep their prices stable and sap momentum from inflation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The best news in this jobs report is that the unemployment rate went up. It did so for all the right reasons: people are coming back to the labor force. And so despite stiff headwinds—inflation, rising interest rates, a strong dollar—employers are finding it a little bit easier to hire,” wrote Julia Pollak, chief economist at ZipRecruiter, in a Friday analysis.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSylvan has more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\n\n\nWhite House asks Congress for $13.7B in Ukraine-related funding&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House on Friday asked Congress to approve $13.7 billion to address Russia’s continued military invasion of Ukraine as part of a short-term funding bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration is requesting that Congress authorize $11.7 billion in additional security and economic assistance for Ukraine and $2 billion to help shore up domestic energy supplies to offset impacts of the war on the global energy market.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House says that the funds are needed to sustain the pace of aid to Ukraine for the first three months of fiscal 2023, which begins at the start of October. The administration official said roughly three-fourths of the funds Congress has already approved for Ukraine have been spent or obligated.&nbsp;Congress on a bipartisan basis has approved over $53 billion in security, economic and humanitarian assistance to address Russia’s invasion of Ukraine this year. Biden signed the last package, totaling $40 billion, into law in May. At the time, the White House said it expected those funds to last through the end of the fiscal year.&nbsp;In addition to more funding for Ukraine, the White House is also asking Congress to authorize billions more in funding for the federal government’s COVID-19 pandemic response, monkeypox response and disaster reliefefforts as part of a continuing resolution. The emergency funding request totals $47.1 billion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Morgan Chalfant breaks it down here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRUSSIAN OIL\n\n\n\nG-7 agrees to price cap on Russian oil&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe G7 agreed to a price cap on Russian oil Friday as Russia shut a major gas pipeline to Europe, citing maintenance issues, amid the already fraught European energy situation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe countries agreed that they would prohibit “services which enable maritime transportation,” like shipping, of oil from Russia if it’s sold at a price higher than the price cap — an attempt to curb Russian profits from the sale of the fuel.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Kremlin official said in response to plans of the price cap on Friday that Russia would not sell to any countries that participated in the price cap, rejecting any non-market principles associated with the sale of its energy products, Reuters reported.&nbsp;Russia is the third-largest oil producer in the world. Some countries, including the U.S., have already said they will not import Russian oil, but other countries including China and India have continued to provide a market for this oil.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Tobias Burns and Rachel Frazin have the details here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCAN I GET A WITNESS?\n\n\n\nThe witnesses missing from tax hearings: average taxpayers&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs Congress raced to pass long-stalled health, climate and tax legislation this summer, Democrats advanced the country’s latest update to U.S. tax laws, giving the IRS $15 million to design a free “e-file” tax return system.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, over the course of several months working on the legislation, on no occasions were working Americans asked in hearings before the main tax writing and tax collection oversight committees in Congress to describe or comment on the personal administrative work of filing their yearly taxes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInstead of hearing from working taxpayers who file their own forms, the congressional panels heard from certified public accountants (CPAs), a business executive, a watchdog agency member and a “taxpayer experience” officer, among other specialists.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTobias has more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood to Know\n\n\n\nPresident Biden on Friday announced plans to nominate environmental law expert Richard Revesz to lead the small but powerful White House office in charge of overseeing federal regulations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA), which sits within the White House Office of Management and Budget, has been without a permanent occupant since Biden took office.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere’s what else have our eye on:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe \"cheapest time\" to book flight is a myth, Google Flights says.

Enjoy the holiday weekend! \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLabor board rules in favor of Amazon union \n\n\n\nThe National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) on Thursday recommended that tech giant Amazon’s objections to votes by the Amazon Labor Union (ALU) be blocked.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I conclude that the Employer’s objections be overruled in their entirety,” wrote the NLRB hearing officer, according to documents posted by ALU President Christian Smalls. \n\n\n\nThe report continues: “The Employer has not met its burden of establishing that Region 29, the Petitioner, or any third parties have engaged in objectionable conduct affecting the results of the election.” \n\n\n\nRegion 29 of the NLRB initially held the election to decide whether the ALU would officially represent fulfillment center employees working at Amazon’s JFK8 building. The company’s dispute was transferred to Region 28 of the board after Amazon claimed that Region 29 displayed questionable conduct in the election.&nbsp;The election, which took place in March, found that employees voted to be represented by the ALU by a margin of 10.8 points.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParler returns to Google app store  \n\n\n\nThe social media platform Parler is available again for users&nbsp;to download from the Google Play store a year and a half after the app was removed, the company said Friday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nParler, which boasts its limited content moderation measures, was banned from the app store since January 2021 over a lack of moderation on posts that were deemed to incite violence around the Jan. 6 riot at the Capitol.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“While away from Google Play, we have worked diligently to build a more feature-rich and dynamic user experience. Now is a perfect time to join Parler and rediscover the non-partisan platform where we enable people to speak freely,” Parler’s chief technology officer Sam Lipoff said in a tweeted statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGoogle’s decision to allow Parler back into its store comes after the app reportedly made changes that allow users to block and report others and to actively monitor content for issues like violent speech, Axios reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As we’ve long stated, apps are able to appear on Google Play provided they comply with Play’s developer policies,”&nbsp;a Google spokesperson told Axios.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(MORE) ALGORITHM CONCERNS AHEAD OF MIDTERMS \n\n\n\nTailoring algorithms to user interests is a common practice among social media companies. But new research underscores the harms this practice can yield, especially when it comes to public perception of election legitimacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA&nbsp;study&nbsp;conducted by researchers at New York University found YouTube was more likely to direct videos on election-fraud to those skeptical of 2020 election results compared with those less skeptical. Researchers say this practice may perpetuate existing misconceptions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThose who were most skeptical of the presidential election outcome were shown up to three times as many videos on election-fraud in their feeds, compared with those least skeptical of the outcomes. This accounted for about eight additional recommendations out of 400 in total.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Narratives of fraud and conspiracy theories proliferated over the fall of 2020, finding fertile ground across online social networks, although little is known about the extent and drivers of this spread,” authors wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 2022 approach: With campaigning for the 2022 midterm elections in full swing, many social media companies are working to&nbsp;mitigate the spread of misinformation&nbsp;that plagued previous election cycles.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYouTube recently announced new policies aimed at addressing election-related misinformation that will add context to any midterm-related videos in both Spanish and English. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBITS &amp; PIECES\n\n\n\nAn op-ed to chew on:&nbsp;Technology alone can’t solve the cybersecurity problem; we need better information sharing&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNotable links from around the web:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe used AI to win a fine-arts competition.

        "description": "Dean Kremer will look to carve up the AL West’s worst after conquering the AL West’s best last time out.  | Photo by Bob Levey/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The O’s look to continue their winning ways as they kick off a 10-game homestand against the AL-worst Athletics.  The Orioles kick off their homestand tonight against Oakland after coming off a very successful road trip. They won their series against the Astros, they won their series against the Guardians and enter tonight 1.5 games back of a Wild Card spot. However, when it comes to this matchup with Oakland, Camden Chat’s very own Stacey said it best in her series preview: \nThe only thing you really need to know about this weekend’s series between the Athletics and the Orioles is that the Orioles really need to win most, if not all, of these games.—Stacey\nWinning all of the games means starting with a W in the first game tonight. We’ll see Dean Kremer lead the Orioles against JP Sears and the rest of the lowly A’s (it’s ok A’s fans, Birdland knows your pain all too well). The only other series against Oakland this year was a four-game set during April in Oakland Coliseum. The O’s only won one of those games, but this is a completely different Baltimore ball club. After all, that team had no Adley Rutschman. There was no GUNNAR HENDERSON sparkling on defense while waiting to launch his next bomb. \nAs for the pitching matchup: Kremer will be making his first-ever start against the A’s. In his last time out against the Astros—the AL’s best team—he showed his best stuff all year. Kremer’s 7.2 innings in Houston were a season high, and any time you can limit Houston to four hits and one run, that’s something to write home about. A strong start against a weak Oakland lineup will also keep Kremer on track to be the first Orioles starter with an ERA under 3.50 (with at least 100 IP) since Wei-Yin Chen in 2015. \nOakland starter JP Sears was one of the key players the A’s got when they traded Frankie Montas and Lou Trivino to the Yankees. The soft-throwing lefty did face the Orioles twice while still on the Yankees, going five scoreless innings with five strikeouts his last time against the O’s in May. He will offer the new-look Orioles—with GUNNAR and Jesus Aguilar—a chance to improve on their struggles against left-handed pitching in 2022. \nIn addition to GUNNAR making his Orioles Park at Camden Yards debut tonight, tonight will also mark the Baltimore debut for DL Hall (should he enter the game). After a less-than-stellar major league debut in St. Petersburg on August 13, Hall is back on the big league roster in a bullpen role. The strikeout artist currently known as DL would have a prime opportunity to improve on his MLB numbers against an Oakland lineup that features three lefties in their top five hitters. \nOrioles Lineup \n\nRyan McKenna (R) CF\nAnthony Santander (S) RF\nRyan Mountcastle (R) DH\nRamón Urías (R) 3B\nJesús Aguilar (R) 1B\nAustin Hays (R) LF\nJorge Mateo (R) SS\nGUNNAR HENDERSON (L) 2B\nRobinson Chirinos (R) C\n\nAthletics Lineup\n\nTony Kemp (L) LF\nSean Murphy (R) C\nSeth Brown (L) RF\nShea Langeliers (R) DH\nVimael Machín (L) 3B\nDermis García (R) 1B\nJonah Bride (R) 2B\nNick Allen (R) SS\nCal Stevenson (L) CF",

        "description": "Photo by Robert Beck/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Jake Reed was designated for assignment Blake Treinen was activated off the 60-day injured list by the Dodgers before Friday’s series opener against the Padres at Dodger Stadium, after the right-hander missed 4½ months with shoulder inflammation. He adds another high-leverage arm to a bullpen that’s been without him since April.\nThe final five weeks of the season will determine exactly what the Dodgers are getting back, but in 2020-21 Treinen was the anchor of the bullpen, with a 2.48 ERA and 2.95 FIP with 107 strikeouts in 98 innings. Pitching nearly 80 percent of his innings in the seventh and eighth gave Treinen the second-highest average leverage in each of the last two seasons, behind only closer Kenley Jansen.\nTreinen led the Dodgers in 2020 and 2021 in both games on zero days rest and multi-inning appearances. This year, which included four months without pitching, he’s pitched on back-to-back days twice — once in April while active, and again this last week while with Triple-A Oklahoma City.\nThe entire point of minor league rehab assignment is to get ready for the majors, but if you’re into results, Treinen struck out nine with no intentional walks in six innings in his seven games with Oklahoma City, allowing five runs (three earned).\nWhile on rehab, Treinen threw his sinker 39 times, per Statcast, averaging 95.5 mph, maxing out in the 97s in three of his seven starts. For comparison, he averaged 97.4 mph on the pitch in 2021.\nTreinen returns to a bullpen that has done quite well in his absence, ranking third in the majors in ERA (3.10), second in FIP (3.29), and topping MLB in strikeout-minus-walk ratio (18.7 percent). But it also comes on the day Brusdar Graterol got an MRI exam on his right elbow, with his availability for this season very much in doubt.\nThe last month of the season will be about getting ready for October, which for the Dodgers means figuring out which of the injured relievers are healthy and effective enough to pitch in October. The injured list currently includes Yency Almonte, Victor González, Tommy Kahnle, and Danny Duffy, the last three currently on rehab in Triple-A.\nThere’s room to add them in a bullpen that currently includes Heath Hembree and Phil Bickford. Jake Reed was the roster casualty to make room for Treinen, getting designated for assignment which cleared space on both the active and 40-man rosters, the latter required since Treinen was on the 60-day injured list.\nReed was called up Tuesday and pitched in first of three games in New York, earning his first career save with a scoreless inning.",

        "description": "GABY VELASQUEZ/ EL PASO TIMES / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  Beginning on May 2, a player can only be optioned 5 times during the season As part of the new collective bargaining agreement ratified in March, Major League Baseball can only option a player to the minors up to five times during the season. We’re going to keep track of all options used by the Dodgers during the 2022 season.\nBecause of the extended lockout and truncated spring, there was a slight wrinkle to the start of this season. Active rosters were expanded to 28 players through May 1, and any players optioned during that time would not have that minor league assignment counted toward the five-option limit.\nZach McKinstry, for instance, was optioned twice in April, but those do not count against his five-option limit. His getting optioned to Triple-A on May 2 did count, however.\nBut starting May 2, all options count, so we’ll chronicle every one of them here, so you can see how many times a player can be optioned for the remainder of 2022. For players who have been optioned five times, teams must place them on outright waivers to send them to the minors.\nYou can click on the dates in the table below to get more information on each specific transaction. We also track every transaction for players on the Dodgers’ 40-man roster all season in a separate post.\nNote: if you are on a mobile device, this table will show up best in landscape mode.",

But at the time, the clarity of those words was bracing.”\n\n\n\n“Now, 21 years later, President Biden has done something similar in response to today’s threat. He has properly framed the great political challenge of our time, not just for the 2022 and 2024 elections but through at least the middle part of the 21st Century, when Donald Trump’s cult followers will still be roaming the land.”\n\n\n\n“Biden was basically saying, You are either with the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution that were written just behind me—that’s ‘us’—or you are with the political terrorists who use fear and threats of violence to get their way. There’s no middle ground.”",

        "description": "The Dodgers announced they&#8217;ve designated reliever Jake Reed for assignment. The move clears an active and 40-man roster spot for Blake Treinen, who has been reinstated for the 60-day injured list and will be in the bullpen for tonight&#8217;s game against the Padres.\nReed is no stranger to DFA limbo, as he&#8217;s frequently been a victim of churn at the back of the 40-man roster over the past couple years. The low-slot righty has attracted plenty of interest on the waiver wire, though, bouncing from the Dodgers to the Rays to the Mets and back to Los Angeles dating back to last July. He never appeared in the big leagues with Tampa Bay, but Reed has been called upon out of the bullpen a combined 20 times as a Dodger and Met over the past two seasons.\nThrough 21 innings, he owns a 5.57 ERA with pedestrian strikeout and ground-ball marks (19.4% and 39.1%, respectively). Reed&#8217;s latest run has been solid, as he&#8217;d worked four scoreless appearances prior to his DFA, including locking down his first career save against his former team in Queens on Tuesday. The former fifth-round pick also has a solid track record in the minors, notching a 3.84 ERA with an above-average 25.6% strikeout rate over parts of six Triple-A campaigns.\nThe Dodgers will have no choice but to place Reed on waivers over the next few days. He&#8217;s drawn interest on waivers on multiple occasions, and he still has a minor league option remaining beyond this season. It&#8217;s not out of the question another team could take a shot on him to add some bullpen depth with a decent track record in the upper minors.\nTreinen, meanwhile, has been out of action for more than four months. The right-hander has battled shoulder discomfort for much of the season, but that didn&#8217;t stop the Dodgers from signing him to a contract extension in May. Treinen is coming off a brilliant 2021 campaign in which he worked to a 1.99 ERA through 72 1/3 innings. If he can recapture that form now that his shoulder is back healthy, he&#8217;ll be a key late-game weapon for skipper Dave Roberts heading into the playoffs.",

        "description": "SEPTEMBER 2: Alvarez indeed underwent Tommy John surgery this week, the Giants announced.\nAUGUST 25: Giants left-hander Jose Alvarez&#8217;s 2022 season is over due to a setback in his injury rehab, Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle reports.  Alvarez hasn&#8217;t pitched since mid-June due to a pair of injured-list stints, first for a back strain and then elbow inflammation that Slusser reports was later diagnosed as a UCL strain.  The problem is serious enough that Tommy John surgery is likely necessary, though Alvarez will probably seek out a second opinion before making his final choice about surgery.\nDue to the usual 12-15 month recovery timeframe for TJ surgery, Alvarez seems likely to miss the entire 2023 season.  On the off chance that Alvarez does find a favorable second opinion, it would still seem like he&#8217;d be facing a lengthy absence that might make him questionable for the start of the 2023 campaign, and there&#8217;s no guarantee that he wouldn&#8217;t eventually end up getting a Tommy John surgery anyway in the event of another setback.\nIt&#8217;s a tough outcome for the 33-year-old, who will end his 10th Major League season with just 15 1/3 innings pitched and a 5.28 ERA.  Alvarez signed a free agent with San Francisco prior to the 2021 season that ultimately paid him $2.55MM over the 2021-22 seasons, after the Giants exercised a club option on his services for 2022.\nAs such, the left-hander will now head into free agency with a lot of health uncertainty hanging over his market.  It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that Alvarez won&#8217;t be able to find a new deal this winter, as several pitchers in similar TJ situations have signed two-year contracts, with only a minimum salary for the first year of the contract in the understanding that the pitcher will miss most or all of the year rehabbing.\nAlvarez had a solid track record of success as a member of the Angels and Phillies bullpens from 2015-19, posting a 3.36 ERA/3.80 SIERA over 295 innings in those seasons.  Alvarez wasn&#8217;t just a left-handed specialist, as he delivered good numbers against right-handed batters in addition to dominating left-handed batters.  His solid run was interrupted by an injury-plagued 2020 season, as he tossed only 6 1/3 innings for Philadelphia due to a groin injury.\nIt made for an ill-timed platform season as Alvarez was eligible for free agency for the first time, and the Giants ended up with a nice bargain for their modest $2.55MM investment.  Despite a 4.42 SIERA in 2021 and one of the lowest (15.8%) strikeout rates of any pitcher in baseball, Alvarez outperformed his peripherals to post a 2.37 ERA over 64 2/3 frames last season, benefiting from a 50.5% grounder rate, lots of soft contact, and a .251 BABIP.\nThis performance made it a pretty easy call for the Giants to exercise their club option, but Alvarez unfortunately again finds himself heading into free agency as a big injury question mark.  It wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see the Giants re-sign Alvarez to another low-cost two-year deal, even if there&#8217;s naturally more risk attached to an older pitcher coming off Tommy John surgery.",

        "description": "The Securities and Exchange Commission on Friday sued a former CHS trader over allegations that he fabricated hundreds of transportation contracts and inflated the agribusiness cooperative&#x27;s income by $124 million over five years.Among other things, CHS, based in Inver Grove Heights, markets grain, sells fertilizer and fuel, and provides financial services to farmers and ranchers. As part of its grain-trading operations, CHS buys and sells contracts with railroads to haul corn, wheat, soybeans and other commodities. In a civil lawsuit against David Pope, 55, of Lakeville, the SEC alleges that he “falsely manipulated the valuations” of transportation contracts while overseeing the rail freight desk as a senior trader. Pope, who could not be reached for comment by MPR News, is not facing criminal charges in the case. Regulators also allege that from 2014 to 2018, Pope, &quot;fabricated hundreds of fictitious rail car contracts,&quot; and received pay bonuses “that were higher than he would have received, but for his misconduct.” The SEC says in August 2018, a company executive reviewed one of Pope’s bid sheets and found the values to be “grossly incorrect.” The next month, Pope allegedly told his managers that he based the valuations on his personal opinions about freight prices, “while ignoring the current, substantially-lower market prices,” according to the federal lawsuit. Investigators also contend that Pope “doctored” emails from a railroad and forwarded them to an external auditor in an effort to keep the auditor from confirming details of a contract. Regulators say that Pope’s work was “not substantively reviewed by other CHS employees,” and his actions forced the company to revise five years’ worth of public financial statements. For 2017 in particular, CHS’s net income was overstated by 43 percent. In its lawsuit, the SEC is asking a judge to fine Pope and order him to “disgorge ill-gotten gains.” The suit comes on the same day that CHS reached a settlement with the agency and pledged to improve internal controls.The agreement does not require CHS to pay a fine. In a statement to MPR News, the company said that it’s pleased to have resolved the matter and that it has “taken the necessary actions to remediate the issues that led to the investigation and we feel confident that we have effective internal controls and oversight in place.”The SEC’s agreement notes that CHS initiated an internal investigation upon learning of the problems and notified regulators. The agency also commended the company for “promptly” firing Pope, later firing or disciplining other employees who were supposed to be reviewing his work, and clawing back bonuses from 26 current or former officers and directors. Pope asserted his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and chose not to testify in the SEC’s investigation, the agency said.",

        "description": "In which the umpire is saying, “that’s close enough, A.J.” | Photo by Chuck Rydlewski/Getty Images\n    \n\n  It’ll be Sonny Gray, Minnesota’s best starter, in this “maybe we can catch Cleveland” contest. Start time: 7:10 Central\nWeather: Partly cloudy, mild wind gusts, first pitch 72°\nOpponent’s SB site (with cool article photo layout): South Side Sox\n\nTV: BSN. Radio: I wanna bite the hand that feeds me, I wanna bite that hand so badly\n\nRookie starter Davis Martin (which sounds like a Rat Pack act) had fairly mediocre minor-league numbers... until he hit AA, and started striking out everybody. Unimpressive in AAA, he made his debut in May as the “extra guy” for a doubleheader and has been sporadically up/down since. Digits:\n  \n        \n      Martin throws a 94-ish fastball and the standard offspeed stuff. His slider, which he uses often, is his best pitch.\n  \nThere’s been a very interesting development in the Ongoing Saga Of Crappily-Paid Minor Leaguers recently. Mike Axisa of CBS Sports has the rundown here.\nBasically, the MLBPA is offering union representation to minor league players, if they want it. On Sunday, MLBPA sent every affiliated minor leaguer an “authorization form,” and if 30% of players return it saying “yes, let’s vote on forming a union,” then all the minor leaguers would vote on whether to unionize or not.\nThis is the way you form a union under current labor law. If you skip one of these steps, you can’t form a union. Also, companies aren’t supposed to interfere via pressuring or threatening employees thinking about forming a union. (Except, they do, all the time, and this is illegal, and they almost always get away with it.)\nAccording to MLBPA executive director Tony Clark, the current authorization steps have been long in the making, saying that “the experiences from the last couple of years obviously had guys asking questions and offering commentary.” Meaning, probably, MLB’s recent decisions to eliminate several minor league teams and turn others into amateur “wooden bat” leagues.\nThere is no knowing what minor league players will decide, but Clark says there’s already been tremendous response returning authorization forms. And the nonprofit group Advocates For Minor Leaguers has now been absorbed by the MLBPA. They probably wouldn’t have agreed to do that if they didn’t think minor leaguers have a good shot at certifying their union.\nWhat’s unclear is how, exactly, the minor league union would operate. The best I can tell, it would make its own negotiating decisions yet have access to MLBPA legal/financial support. That’s always been an obstacle to them forming a union. MLB can afford very expensive lawyers, like Rob Manfred. While minor leaguers have had to rely on sympathetic lawyers, like the ex-player Garrett Broshius, bringing suit about things like violations of minimum-wage laws.\nAnother obstacle has been that minor leaguers, as MLBPA’s Gene Orza put it in this 2012 Slate article, “don’t want to tick off [the club] by being the person who forms the union.” In that same article, Marvin Miller (the original legal organizer of the MLBPA back in the 1960s), said that while he’d considered including minor leaguers in the players’ union, it was too much of a challenge to convince them that they weren’t all going to get rich pretty soon on their own.\nI’m assuming you all already know how lousily minor leaguers are paid (they only recently got a housing allowance, for Pete’s sakes). And if you’re fine with it, because “that’s how the free market is supposed to work,” you A) are a jerk and B) don’t understand the words you’re using. As Pat Garofalo writes here, not only did the 2018 “Save America’s Pastime Act” exempt minor leaguers from federal employment laws, but some bought-and-paid-for politicians have taken steps to exempt them from state laws, as well. (State minimum wages are often higher than the national minimum wage.) This is not a free labor market. (And some of these players have families, you know!)\nThat CBS Sports article by Axisa has some numbers which might open your eyes, too. NBA minor leaguers are paid $38,000 a season. NHL minor leaguers, $51,000. Baseball minor leaguers, between $1600 and $2800 a month, based on level. (This is more than it was a few years ago.) And they’re only paid during the season – not even during spring training. That’s five months, so, $8000 to $14,000 annually.\nNBA minor leaguers are usually competing for “last guy on the bench” roles on NBA teams, with only rare exceptions ever receiving major playing time. Future NBA stars play right away in the NBA. NHL minor leaguers are more like baseball ones, in that even the future stars need some time in the minors.\nAnd MLB makes way, way more money than the NHL. They could pay their minor leaguers as much, if not more.\nOf course, the “bonus babies” – those highly-regarded draft picks expected to become future stars – don’t have to worry about money, at least not at first. Yet sometimes tomorrow’s stars are today’s unheralded minor league “depth signings” (Luis Arraez was never considered a hot prospect.) And even players with almost zero chance at making the majors are important as teammates and competitive opponents. Prospects can’t improve just by taking batting practice against a pitching machine.\nI have one more question: why is the MLBPA supporting a minor league union now?\nAs recently as 2018, this NPR article was unable to get an official statement from Clark or the MLBPA on minor league pay issues, besides vague language about being “empathetic.” And the wonderful Craig Calcaterra, a lawyer before he was a writer, thought that the “Save America’s Pastime Act” had pretty much doomed legal efforts to improve minor league pay.\nRecently, however, a suit brought by the aforementioned Broshius (among others) got MLB to settle for $185 million in penalties for violating labor law (at least, as the law stood before the “Save America’s Pastime Act” was passed). The suit spent eight years in court, and will amount to around $5250 in back pay per player, so it’s not a big win. But it’s still a win, though.\nAnd the MLBPA, which got absolutely steamrolled in the last CBA negotiations, might be interested in boosting their oomph by pairing up with some workers who can actually get a win against MLB.\nHmm, I wonder... are there any other sports-related corporations which have been relying on free or nearly-free labor for years? That have recently been cutting back on team affiliates?\nThinking...\nThinking...\nNope, none come to mind.\nAnd finally, a sequel of sorts to the news we brought you last Friday about a couple Getting Nasty at an A’s game. Guess what, sex is catching on! Now it’s happened at a Blue Jays game. And while that one was rather simple, if flagrant, this one involved full face-to-face romance, as it were.\nTo which I can only say, ah, the wonders of youth. Such a position is beyond my ability at this juncture. Also, the dumbness of youth — some things are what God invented fingers for.\nOver at his Field Of Schemes website, Neil deMause provided us with this helpful link describing some other occasions in which people have gotten Inappropriately Randy at Blue Jays games. Those ones involved the hotel rooms with full patio-sized windows up in center field. Each of the perpetrators (peepetrators?) thought that the patio windows were one-way glass, and weren’t charged with committing an indecent act. Because, they said, they didn’t know anyone could see them.\nSure, folks. Suuuuuuuure.\n\n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nTWINS\nWHITE SOX\n\n\n\n\nLuis Arraez - 1B\nElvis Andrus - SS\n\n\nCarlos Correa - SS\nAndrew Vaughn - 1B\n\n\nMax Kepler - RF\nJose Abreu - DH\n\n\nJose Miranda - DH\nGavin Sheets - RF\n\n\nNick Gordon - 2B\nYasmani Grandal - C\n\n\nGio Urshela - 3B\nAJ Pollock - CF\n\n\nJake Cave - LF\nLeury Garcia - LF\n\n\nGary Sanchez - C\nJosh Harrison - 3B\n\n\nGilberto Celestino - CF\nRomy Gonzalez - 2B\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSonny Gray - RHP\nDavis Martin - RHP",

        "description": "The State Fair comes to an end Monday and so, too, must our Infrequently Asked Questions series. All week, we&#x27;ve been challenging our reporters to answer obscure questions about the fair. It all started with some friendly competition: MPR fair extraordinaire Tim Nelson seemed to have covered it all over the years and we wanted to stump him.  We didn&#x27;t succeed. But we did want to dive a bit deeper into a question he answered for us off the air: What happens to all that used cooking oil? More Infrequently Asked QuestionsWhat happens to the DNR fishafter the State Fair is over?What happens at the Minnesota State Fairovernight?What happens to all the manureat the Minnesota State Fair?What happens to all the moneyat the State Fair?Where do the 4-H kids sleep?The answer might surprise youThis was one of the first questions you came up with for this project. What did Tim find out about it? We love Tim and love that he played along with this series. But to be honest, he kind of dismissed this one. He said the answer wouldn&#x27;t be all that interesting, and he followed up with a photo of a container behind a Tiny Tim Donut stand. Apparently vendors have these vats — they’re about waist-high, maybe the size of a couple barrels — and the employees just dump the oil into them. That&#x27;s it. Question answered. But we were looking at this photo during our team meeting this morning and noticed a name printed on the vat: Sanimax. And that&#x27;s when we decided to dig a little deeper. Fair food vendors dump their used cooking oil into vats like this one behind Tiny Tim Donuts at the Minnesota State Fair on Sept. 2. The photo, taken and edited by MPR News reporter Tim Nelson, inspired the All Things Consider team to dig into where the grease goes, after the vat.Tim Nelson | MPR NewsAnd what did you find out about Sanimax? It&#x27;s a Canadian company that collects used cooking oil, but also animal byproducts — the stuff that doesn&#x27;t make it onto our plates — from thousands of businesses across North America. Our local Sanimax facility is in South St. Paul, down by the river where the stockyards used to be. They collect 125,000 to 150,000 pounds of cooking oil from fair vendors each year, and then clean and purify it to make new products.What does the used cooking oil become?The cooking oil becomes something the industry calls “yellow grease,” and that is then used in a variety of ways. I spoke with someone at the South St. Paul Sanimax facility today, and he said the majority of our local cooking oil goes into biodiesel. The rest goes into household goods like soaps and into animal feed. From what I can tell, it&#x27;s basically adding calories and can act as a binder for pet food or chicken feed. So, this is dark, but one could assume next year’s fair chickens may have eaten some of the very grease their kind were fried in this year.  Appetites:Live at the State FairSo all of that fair waste is being recycled into something useful again? Yes. Sanimax likes to amp of the sustainability factor. On its website, it says that from an emissions standpoint, rendering process is one of the more environmentally friendly ways of breaking down animal byproduct. And the research generally supports that. But it&#x27;s a smelly business. Sanimax and other rendering plants are often the subject of complaints and zoning battles. Two South St. Paul residents sued the local Sanimax facility back in 2018 for the noxious smells wafting into their homes. A couple years later, the company paid out 750 thousand dollars to settle a class-action lawsuit tied to its Wisconsin and Minnesota plants. And then there are people who are worried about using yellow grease in animal feed. They say it&#x27;s just not healthy for animals. You say it&#x27;s a smelly business. There must be some money in it to deal with all the downsides. Absolutely. In fact, it&#x27;s so profitable that vendors aren&#x27;t paying Sanimax to pick up their grease, like you and I might pay for garbage collection. Sanimax is paying them. With so many applications, there&#x27;s a huge market for yellow grease, and it’s only getting bigger. With restaurants closing during the pandemic, there&#x27;s been a supply pinch. That means higher prices for this stuff. And yellow grease market tracks with things like corn prices. If more corn is going toward ethanol, for example, less of it may be going into animal feed, which can amp up demand for yellow grease as a substitute. The latest USDA data shows that as of last week, this stuff is going for 63 cents a pound, up 13 cents from last year. It&#x27;s such a hot commodity that companies like Sanimax actually design anti-theft features into restaurant disposal containers.",

        "description": "The Biden administration is requesting approval from Congress for more than $1 billion in arms sales to Taiwan amid increased tensions with China over the island’s status.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe State Department announced on Friday that it approved three separate proposed military sales for Taiwan, and Congress has been notified of them. If approved by Congress, the three sales will send contractor logistics support for Taiwan’s Surveillance Radar Program, up to 60 AGM-84L-1 Harpoon Block II missiles and related equipment and up to 100 AIM-9X Block II Sidewinder Tactical Missiles and equipment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA State Department spokesperson said the United States being able to quickly provide defense weaponry and sustainment to Taiwan is essential to the island’s security. \n\n\n\n“These proposed sales are routine cases to support Taiwan’s continuing efforts to modernize its armed forces and to maintain a credible defensive capability,” the spokesperson said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey said the actions are consistent with the Taiwan Relations Act, a 1979 law under which the U.S. pledges to provide support to help Taiwan defend itself but does not commit to direct involvement in an armed conflict.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson said the executive branch of the federal government has notified Congress of more than $35 billion in arms sales to Taiwan since 2010.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe proposal comes one month after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) became the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit Taiwan in 25 years. China carried out military exercises around the island in the immediate aftermath of her visit and has promised to continue to monitor and patrol the Taiwan Strait and be prepared for a conflict. \n\n\n\nChina considers Taiwan to be part of its territory awaiting reunification. The U.S. government follows the “One China” policy, recognizing Beijing as the sole government of China while considering Taiwan’s status to be unsettled.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe State Department spokesperson said the department urges China to discontinue its military, diplomatic and economic pressure against Taiwan and engage in “meaningful dialogue” with the island.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The United States will continue to support a peaceful resolution of cross-Strait issues, consistent with the wishes and best interests of the people on Taiwan,” they said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. and Taiwan agreed last month to start discussions on establishing a trade deal early this fall. ",

        "description": "One of these guys is starting the game on the mound tonight. | Ed Zurga/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Is a three-game winning streak a true possibility? The White Sox went into the first day of September with a little bit of momentum, after a players-only meeting prior to the game. But they still sit a game below .500 and nowhere near where they thought they would be at the beginning of the season. The team right now is barely hanging by a thread of hope to even still make the playoffs. \nThe Sox, in a somewhat odd, head-scratching move, send veteran Joe Kelly to the mound for Friday’s opener instead of possible Cy Young winner, Dylan Cease. As they look to get back to .500, nothing could go wrong by sending Kelly to the mound in what amounts to one of the team’s biggest games of the season, right?\nMeanwhile the Twins, who come into Chicago hot having won five of their last six will send Sonny Gray with his 7-4 record and 3.04 ERA to the mound.\nThe Sox will field virtually the same lineup they have as of late except for Eloy Jiménez, who suffered a minor injury and is only available to pinch-hit. With veteran José Abreu DH’ing and Andrew Vaughn at first instead of left field, that makes veteran Leury García switch to left instead of third and after a day off yesterday, veteran Josh Harrison back at third.\nThe Twins lineup is virtually the same as it always is. Plus you know there is always the possibility of fireworks and flares when Kelly faces off against former Houston All-Star shortstop, Carlos Correa.\nThat said here is tonight’s starting lineup for what is sure to be a very interesting series between two longtime rivals: \n\n\nTonight's #WhiteSox starters at Guaranteed Rate Field.⏰: 7:10 p.m. CT : @NBCSChicago (+ for Spanish) : @ESPN1000  : @FDSportsbook  : O/U 3.5 CWS Total Runs pic.twitter.com/Ft7Ilw0nuX— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom the Red Sox to the White Sox. Here’s how we line up.#MNTwins pic.twitter.com/qZcHIqgmbS— Minnesota Twins (@Twins) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nThe first pitch is scheduled to happen at 7:10 p.m. Central. As usual, NBC Sports Chicago will televise the game, and WMVP 1000 AM will have the radio coverage. Now can the Sox actually keep the momentum by winning a third straight tonight?",

        "description": "Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images\n    \n\n  What has powered the D-backs resurgence this season? \n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nBREWERS\nDIAMONDBACKS\n\n\n\n\nKolten Wong - 2B\nCarson Kelly - C\n\n\nWilly Adames - SS\nJosh Rojas - 3B\n\n\nRowdy Tellez - 1B\nKetel Marte - 2B\n\n\nHunter Renfroe - RF\nChristian Walker - 1B\n\n\nAndrew McCutchen - LF\nEmmanuel Rivera - DH\n\n\nJace Peterson - 3B\nJake McCarthy - CF\n\n\nKeston Hiura - DH\nStone Garrett - LF\n\n\nOmar Narvaez - C\nCorbin Carroll - RF\n\n\nGarrett Mitchell - CF\nWilmer Difo - SS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEric Lauer - LHP\nZach Davies - RHP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe D-backs come into tonight’s game on pace for 77 wins, a 25-game improvement over where they finished last season, in 52-110. Whether they will get there or not, depends on their play over the final month. The schedule is not easy, but the way they’ve played over the last week, going 6-1 against teams with (more or less meaningful) post-season aspirations. is certainly reason for hope. It’s especially remarkable, since there weren’t very many acquisitions over the winter. Zach Davies was likely the best external piece to arrive: Ian Kennedy and, especially, Mark Melancon, have not apparently moved the needle up very much. So how did we get here? There are a few factors.\nBeing better in one-run games\nThe D-backs have been no great shakes in one-run games, going 16-22. But that’s still a huge improvement on last year’s mark of 10-31. If Arizona had reproduced that winning percentage this season, it would equate to a record of 9-29, so that’s seven games the team has improved there already - that extrapolates to close to nine wins over the full schedule. This was a big factor in why the 2021 D-backs’ Pythagorean mark was a whopping nine games better. In terms of runs scored and allowed, this was “only” a 101-loss team, rather than 110. This year’s version is much closer, just one win below the expected mark of 63-67. \nSlightly better pitching\nLast year, the D-backs were 9.1 wins below the National League average for their pitching staff. That number has improved a little, though we are still on pace to be 5.4 wins below average. The improvement is slightly more due to the starting pitching, which has gone from -0.6 to a pace of +1.7. This is hugely front-loaded, due to the efforts of Zac Gallen and Merrill Kelly. Combined, they have been worth 8.7 bWAR so far: every other pitcher on the roster combined is 2.1 wins below replacement [By themselves, Melancon and Dallas Keuchel together are -2.0] The bullpen is projecting to be somewhat less sucky - going from atrocious to poor if you prefer - ticking up from -9.1 to -7.1.\nFar better defense\nAlmost regardless of the metric, the Diamondbacks have improved massively with the glove this season. Using Fangraph’s “Def” metric, for example, they have gone from -12.5 runs last year, to be on pace for +35.3 runs this year. That’s close to a five-win improvement. DRS has an even larger gain for Arizona, from -37 to an expected figure by the end of the season of +40. Interestingly, this doesn’t show up quite as well in pure errors. While the D-backs are better there too, they will still likely end up with a tally in the nineties, after committing a round hundred in 2021. This tends to suggest the improvement is a result of better range, i.e. the defense simply getting to more balls.\nBetter hitting... at some positions\nAll told, the D-backs are six points up on last year’s OPS, going from .692 to .698, so less than a one percent increase in that figure (and that’s with the DH replacing the pitcher’s spot in the batting order). However, this conceals some wide variations around the diamond. Here is a breakdown by position, with the OPS at each, and the point difference in brackets afterward.\n\nC: .730 vs. .632 (-98)\n1B: .697 vs. .808 (+111)\n2B: .756 vs. .727 (-29)\nSS: .626 vs. .588 (-38)\n3B: .706 vs. .714 (+8)\nLF: .701 vs. .791 (+90)\nCF: .731 vs. .721 (-10)\nRF: .737 vs. .634 (-103)\n\nYou can see that 1B and LF have improved most, while C and RF have dropped by the largest amounts. The catcher’s spot seems to be taking care of itself, with Carson Kelly’s rebound. I was surprised about RF being such a big loser in 2022, but it was severely buoyed last year by Josh Rojas’s OPS over a thousand in 35 games there.",

Of the team&#8217;s 2021 starters, only Logan Webb was under club control.\nGranted, much of that was the front office&#8217;s own doing. A generally risk-averse unit, at least insofar as signing free agents to lucrative multi-year commitments, the Giants inked each of Gausman, Wood and DeSclafani to one-year contracts prior to the 2021 season. The continued with a generally risk-averse approach this past offseason, replenishing their rotation for a combined $125MM paid out to Carlos Rodon (two  years, $44MM), DeSclafani (three years, $36MM), Wood (two years, $25MM) and Alex Cobb (two years, $20MM).\nObviously, a $125MM investment is hardly a no-risk proposition, but spreading that number out across four pitchers without committing more than three years in length isn&#8217;t exactly working without a net for a team that averaged a $179MM payroll from 2015-19, topped out at $200.5MM in 2018, and has averaged a $152.5MM payroll over the past two seasons.\nThe quintet of Webb, Rodon, DeSclafani, Wood and Cobb had plenty of potential to be a strong group. It also had plenty of potential to be an injury-plagued unit that created ample headaches for the front office. Each of Rodon, DeSclafani, Wood and Cobb came with lengthy injury histories. Depth beyond that group was needed, and the Giants lacked it in the upper minors.\nWhat followed was a series of sensible additions. Matthew Boyd inked a one-year deal worth $5.2MM, as the Giants hoped the longtime Tigers southpaw would be back from flexor surgery by mid-June. Former Royals righty Jakob Junis put pen to paper on a one-year, $1.75MM contract after being non-tendered by Kansas City. Carlos Martinez, a former All-Star with the Cardinals, signed a minor league contract.\nOf all the names in that group, Junis was likely the most anonymous. A 29-year-old righty and former 29th-round pick, he looked the part of a player-development success story for the Royals during his first two seasons before flaming out in his final three years with Kansas City. From 2017-18, Junis gave the Royals 275 1/3 innings of 4.35 ERA ball with a strikeout rate just below the league average, a strong walk rate and slightly below-average ground-ball tendencies. It wasn&#8217;t a star-caliber profile by any means, but ask any scout in the world and they&#8217;d be thrilled at the notion of unearthing a viable fourth or fifth starter in the 29th round of the draft.\nThe 2019-21 seasons, however, didn&#8217;t pan out as either Junis or the Royals hoped. Although he made what&#8217;s still a career-high 31 starts in 2019, his ERA spiked to 5.24 as his walk rate ticked upward and he began to allow increasing amounts of hard contact. Things got even worse in 2020, and by June of 2021, Junis found himself optioned to Triple-A for the first time since 2017. Between that and the 5.36 ERA Junis posted from 2019-21, it wasn&#8217;t a surprise that the Royals opted not to tender him a contract, instead setting him out into the free-agent market.\nJunis&#8217; one-year deal with the Giants looked like a sensible depth pickup of an experienced arm with one minor league option year remaining, but it&#8217;s proven to be far more than that. In 17 games for San Francisco, 14 of them starts, Junis carries a 4.04 ERA with a 20.9% strikeout rate and a superb 4.7% walk rate. Fielding-independent metrics like FIP (3.83), SIERA (3.72) and xERA (3.85) all feel he&#8217;s been a fair bit better than that. For much of the year, he&#8217;s sported an ERA in the mid- or low-3.00s, though a recent pair of six-run clunkers have inflated his ERA a bit.\nEven with his recent scuffles, though, Junis has been far more than a simple stopgap in the rotation. He&#8217;s only averaging about five innings per start &#8212; more or less in line with the league average at this point &#8212; and has held opponents to three or fewer runs in 13 of his appearances on the season.\nThe Giants have altered Junis&#8217; pitch selection and done so to good effect; he&#8217;s throwing his slider a career-high 51.9% of the time and has yielded only a .210/.255/.359 in the 192 plate appearances that have ended with that pitch. He&#8217;s also effectively scrapped his four-seamer and his cutter in favor of a sinker he&#8217;s throwing at a 30.6% clip, and while the pitch has still been hit hard, opponents are doing far less damage against the pitch than either of the previous two fastball iterations that Junis was using at a far higher clip.\nJunis will probably end up giving the Giants anywhere from a win to two wins above replacement this year &#8212; he&#8217;s at 1.6 bWAR and 0.9 fWAR at the moment &#8212; which is a solid return on their minimal investment in and of itself. But the Giants will also retain Junis&#8217; rights into the 2023 season, as he&#8217;s still arbitration-eligible and will finish out the year with five-plus years of service. He&#8217;ll be due a raise on this year&#8217;s salary, but jumping into the $3MM range for a serviceable fourth starter is nonetheless a bargain.\nThe Giants already have four starters under contract in 2023 &#8212; Webb, Wood, Cobb and DeSclafani &#8212; but could very well lose Carlos Rodon to free agency if he turns down his player option (which is a lock, so long as he remains healthy). They&#8217;re not going to simply replace Rodon with Junis and call it a day, so the likelihood is that they&#8217;ll add an impact starter and enter 2023 with Junis as the sixth or perhaps even seventh starter. That&#8217;d land him in the bullpen at the start of the season, likely in a long relief role, but given the injury histories of DeSclafani, Wood and Cobb, there ought to be innings available to him next year.\nThe Junis pickup obviously isn&#8217;t a masterstroke that&#8217;s going to alter the course of the franchise for years to come, but he&#8217;s quietly been quite valuable for a Giants club that has had its share of pitching injuries &#8212; and he&#8217;ll continue paying dividends on their investment into the 2023 season. Not a ton has gone right for the Giants this year, but their ability to rehab and, in some cases, reinvent pitchers remains quite strong.",

        "description": "The group Rug Pull Finder aims to combat fraud, scams, and hacks in the NFT space, often investigating crypto rug pulls and offering audits for projects and smart contracts. They decided to launch their own NFT project, \"Bad Guys\", which is themed around a group of baddies who steal NFTs.Ironically, a flaw in the project's smart contract allowed individual wallets to mint many NFTs at once, rather than one per wallet, allowing two people to game the system and snap up more than 450 NFTs rather than the one they were allowed. Rug Pull Finder wrote that \"An exploit was shared with us 30 minutes before mint went live. After reviewing it with 3 different dev teams, we did not believe the credibility of the information sent to us... We were clearly wrong, and we are truly truly sorry\".Rug Pull Finder announced that they had reached an agreement with the people who gamed the mint, and would buy back the 366 NFTs the duo still held for 2.5 ETH (~$4,000).Crypto security researcher OKHotshot wrote, \"I think its concerning when security minded projects like RugPullFinder get their discord breached and their code exploited yet they're offering those exact services to customers.\"\n        \n            \n              \n                Tweet thread by Rug Pull Finder\n               \n            \n            \n              \n                Tweet by OKHotshot\n               \n            \n            \n              \n                Tweet by OKHotshot",

There’s no middle ground.”",

        "description": "A federal judge sided with the Biden administration in a case related to its oil and gas leasing pause in Wyoming.\n\n\n\nHowever, because of another case, the government still appears to be barred from continuing its leasing pause in several other states.\n\n\n\nAt the start of his tenure, President Biden temporarily paused new oil and gas leasing on federal lands and waters. This pause prevented new rights to drill for the fuels on federal lands from being auctioned off.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Scott Skavdahl, an Obama appointee, ruled Friday that the Biden administration was within its rights to postpone lease sales in Wyoming during the first quarter of 2021. \n\n\n\nHe wrote that there was “substantial evidence” to support the Interior Department’s move to put off lease sales that had been slated for March 2021 over concerns about the adequacy of their underlying environmental reviews.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWyoming filed its suit after the March lease sales were postponed, but before other postponements. Skavdahl also ruled that Wyoming did not have the right to challenge any postponements that occurred after its suit was filed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut, in most states, the Biden administration still appears to be barred from pausing new oil and gas leasing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast month, Trump appointee District Judge Terry Doughty ruled in favor of 13 states that had challenged the oil and gas leasing pause. \n\n\n\nHe determined that the law requires the government to sell oil and gas leases, and therefore, the Biden administration must auction more acres for drilling.&nbsp;",

        "description": "The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) unintentionally posted some private individuals’ tax information on its website last week before taking it down, officials said in a letter to Congress on Friday that was obtained by The Wall Street Journal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnna Canfield Roth, the acting assistant secretary for management in the Treasury Department, said in the letter to Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), the chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security, that the IRS determined that some machine-readable Form 990-T data was made available for bulk download last Friday, Aug. 26.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Journal, which first reported the news, stated that the letter also went to other key members of Congress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe IRS did not immediately return a request from The Hill for comment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTax-exempt businesses use the Form 990-T to report and pay income tax on income from certain investments or income that is unrelated to their exempt purpose.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe letter states that the IRS took immediate action to address the issue once it was noticed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe agency said it has removed the files from the website and will replace them with updated files in the coming weeks. It will also work with groups that routinely use the files to remove the erroneous files and replace them with correct versions as they become available.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe IRS plans to contact all filers who were impacted in the coming weeks. \n\n\n\nThe agency determined that “limited”&nbsp;information for about 120,000 people was posted, but the data did not include Social Security numbers, individual income information, detailed financial account data or other “sensitive” information that could impact their credit.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe data did include some individual names or business contact information in some cases.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe letter states that the agency is&nbsp;continuing to review the situation, and the Treasury Department directed the IRS to conduct a “prompt review” of its practices to ensure necessary guards are in place to prevent future unauthorized disclosures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOfficials will provide additional information, including summaries of the detection, response and remediation activities within 30 days, according to the letter.",

        "description": "The Angels informed reporters that first baseman Jared Walsh underwent surgery to correct thoracic outlet syndrome yesterday (via Jeff Fletcher of the Orange County Register). The club still anticipates he&#8217;ll be ready for Spring Training 2023.\nIt&#8217;s an unsurprising development, as the Halos announced last week that Walsh would be shut down for the year with TOS. It wasn&#8217;t clear whether that&#8217;d necessitate surgical repair, but he unfortunately had to go under the knife. Thoracic outlet syndrome, a condition in which nerves or blood vessels compress in the rib area, has become a more common injury around the league in recent seasons. It&#8217;s more frequently an issue for pitchers, but Walsh joins Rays catcher Mike Zunino as notable position players who&#8217;ve undergone TOS surgery in 2022.\nThe diagnosis perhaps comes as some explanation for Walsh&#8217;s dismal season. A breakout performer late in 2020, the lefty-swinging Walsh doubled down with a 29-homer campaign last year. He earned an All-Star nod amidst a .277/.340/.509 showing, looking as if he&#8217;d join Mike Trout and Shohei Ohtani (and potentially Anthony Rendon, when healthy) as fixtures in the middle of the lineup.\nWalsh remained an everyday player this season, but his results plummeted. He finished the year with a .215/.269/.374 line through 454 trips to the plate. His strikeout rate spiked to an unacceptable 30.4% clip, while his walks dipped to a meager 5.9% rate. Walsh&#8217;s average exit velocity and hard contact rate didn&#8217;t much change relative to last year, but his rate of homers per fly ball and general power production fell off.\nAssuming he&#8217;s indeed healthy by the start of next season, Walsh figures to get another opportunity to cement himself as the primary first baseman. Since he went down, the club has leaned on journeyman Mike Ford at the position. Ford is off to a nice start through seven games, but it&#8217;s unlikely he&#8217;d leapfrog Walsh on the depth chart barring an otherworldly showing in September. Walsh will reach arbitration for the first time this offseason; he&#8217;s controllable through 2025.",

        "link": "https://www.themarginalian.org/2022/09/02/monetaria-moneta/",
        "description": "How humanity turned another species into its first specie.\n\nMoney began as a language for expressing gratitude and became the lever of the extraction economy &#8212; the currency of aggregate human entitlement. In the golden dawn of modern capitalism, Henry Miller &#8212; passionate, idealistic, and broke &#8212; sang the thrush song of warning: “The dilemma in which we find ourselves today is that no matter how much we increase the purchasing power of the wage-earner he never has enough.” A century hence, the dilemma has swelled to a carbon cloud of doom &#8212; and yet money keeps washing through this pale blue dot no longer capable of regarding itself as a world without its circulating medium. \nHow did we get here?\nIt turns out we came on the back of a small marine gastropod mollusk, in the lap of a fierce Maldivian queen. \nMoney cowries\nKnown as the money cowry, Monetaria moneta is the world&#8217;s least impressive cowry &#8212; so plain it was entirely omitted from the most lavish illustrated encyclopedia of seashells &#8212; and its first global currency. Its remarkable story, laced with all the imaginative strengths and moral follies that make us human, comes alive in The Sound of the Sea (public library) &#8212; Cynthia Barnett&#8217;s wondrous evolutionary-cultural history of seashells. She writes:\nIn the fourteenth century, a queen known as Rehendi Khadijah ruled the islands of the Maldives with epic command. One of the earliest women leaders of an Islamic nation, she derived power from both the sultanate and Islam, even as she declined to cover her head &#8212; not to mention other parts. She led the kingdom for a third of the century despite two attempts, both by husbands, to depose her. Neither man survived the effort. \nAll the more remarkable was the Maldivian queen’s role in the dawn of international trade. The chain of atolls, coral reefs, and lowlying islands 600 miles off the tip of India was the center of production for the first global money.\n[&#8230;]\nThe Maldivian tender packed up perfectly and made for excellent ship ballast. It was neither paper nor metal, though it jingled in the pocket and shined up bright as a fresh-minted coin. The first global specie was a species.\nShips arrived from all over the world, riding the southwestern summer monsoons, and filled their hulls with the Sultana&#8217;s currency, the production of which she oversaw herself. The tenth-century Arab historian and geographer al-Mas‘udi described the process, at once inventive and cruel:\n[The Sultana] orders her islanders to cut coco-branches with their leaves, and to throw them upon the surface of the water. To these the creatures attach themselves, and are then collected and spread upon the sandy beach, where the sun rots them, and leaves only the empty shells, which are then carried to the Treasury.\n16th-century Portuguese painting of Maldivian workers.\nCowry-filled ships then sailed back to their respective corners of the globe on the eastern winter monsoons. But more than perfect ballast, the Maldivian cowries made for perfect currency:\nThe Money Cowrie &#8212; named by Linnaeus Cypraea moneta, now classified as Monetaria moneta &#8212; makes a glistening shell in the shape of a small shield, with the cowries’ characteristic domed top and flat underside cleaved by a serrated slit. Vaguely toothy, the little ivories range in color from off-white to yellowish. They are enameled, pearly, solid, satisfyingly weighty. Irresistible to pick up and worry, or clack together like dice or coins. The small, durable shells made for ideal currency: Easy to transport and to recognize. Impossible to forge. Perfect for counting &#8212; one by one, or by bag or ballast-full. Uniform in shape and size, they yielded a precise value when weighed.\nThe notion of imbuing a strange ocean shell with value had begun much earlier, with the twin forces of human vanity: superstition and personal aesthetics. As early as the Stone Age, cowries were used as jewelry, amulets, and healing objects. Strings of them &#8212; both real shells and gold-cast replicas &#8212; were found in Egyptian tombs, believed to bring fertility, protect against the Evil Eye, and bring good fortune in the afterlife. \nSo accustomed to seeing immaterial worth in these material objects, these vacant homes of tiny lives, people then readily harnessed their practical conveniences &#8212; small, light, portable, easy to see, hard to fake &#8212; for the perfect fusion of myth and merchandize. (Money, it bears remembering, has always been and will always remain a consensual reality &#8212; a handshake of beliefs with no inherent value and no direct equivalence to objects in the material world.) \nBefore the Romans and their first coins had even arrived onto the scene, Maldivian cowries had reached Europe and China. Cowries were found amid the rubble of Pompeii. By the fourth century, they were a primary coin in India, traveling from there on to the Persian Gulf and the Red Sea, then to Thailand and Myanmar, and into Southeast Asia, where in some remote regions they remained the primary currency for a thousand years. Soon Arab traders were packing and hauling them across the Sahara dessert. They remained a currency in parts of Africa into the twentieth century. \nLate 16th-century Dutch map of the Maldives. (Available as a print, benefitting The Nature Conservancy.)\nIn the first millennium, the cowries drew a Buddhist high culture to the Maldives themselves &#8212; that ravishing coral rosary of 1,200 islands, curving northward from the equator for 600 miles, named after the Sanskrit for “garland of islands,” maladvipa, and with an etymological nod to the ancient queens in the word mahiladvipa: “island of women.” Shining cowries are strewn throughout the Buddhist ruins across the islands to this day. \nBut like every technology of thought, money too began as a salve to human life &#8212; something to add ease, convenience and, in consequence, contentment &#8212; and then, under the deformist pressures of scale, mutated into a tool of exploitation and manipulation. \nBy the nineteenth century, money cowries had grown so popular in West Africa that they were used to purchase a third of the human being enslaved and abducted to the Americas. \n1917 map of the global distribution of cowries as currency.\nBarnett considers the paradoxical legacy of M. moneta both in its global impact and in its local origin:\nLong before Queen Khadijah’s reign and long after, gleaming shell money from her part of the world turned up in striking human spaces—from fourth-century graves north of the Arctic Circle to the slave-house subfloor at Thomas Jefferson’s Monticello. \nThe Maldives controlled shell money for centuries. Yet today, the islands’ ancient cowrie history remains buried deep in coral rock and sand. That’s owing to its idolatrous beginnings, frowned upon in the Muslim-governed nation where nothing “contrary to the tenets of Islam” is allowed.\nBuried with the cowries, too, is the memory of a tenacious queen.\nBut for all of their conflicted inheritance in human affairs, the true majesty of these humble creatures dwells in their own reality, unsullied by human intent or interpretation. Barnett captures the subtle splendor of these creatures who live and die with no notion of their shells&#8217; fate in human hands:\nOnce amassed in bags of money, for shell-lovers, cowries are the sea’s coveted bag of marbles. High-polished globes of spun gold, a fawn’s coat, gaseous rings, creamy maps, copper fishnet, cuts of amethyst, oiled mahogany, sundry dots and stripes &#8212; colors and markings on just a few of the 250 species known living today &#8212; no two look exactly alike. They are rounded on top and flat underneath where the aperture cuts jaggedly across. Depending on the species, the slit at the bottom can be gaping or exceedingly narrow. The teeth might form a harmless, stubby grin like the Money Cowrie, or a fierce-combed trap that looks like it could take a bite of you; the White-toothed Cowrie has such a maw.\n[&#8230;]\nSpreading its glossy matrix over its shell rather than at the opening, the cowrie creates a hump over its spire, each new layer a thicker glaze that hides the last in rich hues that range from creamy to golden to dark chocolate. The animals also evolved striking mantle colors, wildly different from their shells. The soft flesh can be deep purple or pitch black. Some of the animals are camouflaged with the same bright red or orange as the sponges they colonize. Others are colored like a sea cucumber distasteful to fishes. In some species, the mantle flaps are smooth. More often, they are covered with wiggling fingers called papillae that vary in shape and pattern among species. Some wag like separate tentacles. Some grow in tufts. \nThe mantle patterns of M. moneta resemble black-inked fingerprints reaching up their small white humps. Surely no other shell has been as touched by human hands.\nCouple this fragment of the wholly fantastic The Sound of the Sea with the story of how the bit &#8212; that other vital unit of the modern world &#8212; was born, then revisit the poetic Victorian marine biologist and naturalist Philip Henry Gosse on the wonder of the sea&#8217;s most overlooked creatures.\ndonating = lovingFor a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

The Dodgers dropped two straight games to the New York Mets at Citi Field. The Padres are fresh off a sweep of the San Francisco Giants plus an off day. \nOld friend Yu Darvish (11-7, 3.41 ERA, 5.25 K/BB) takes on fellow right-hander Dustin May (1-1, 1.64 ERA, 13 K) in the series opener. May’s making his third start for the Dodgers since returning from Tommy John surgery. Last time out against the Miami Marlins, May went six innings and allowed two runs on five hits with four strikeouts and a walk (86 pitches.) \nJake Cronenworth and old friend Manny Machado have both hit home runs against May in the past. \nConversely, nearly everyone in the Dodgers’ lineup has hit at least one home run off Darvish.  Austin Barnes, Cody Bellinger, Mookie Betts, Freddie Freeman (2), Will Smith, Justin Turner, and Trea Turner have all taken Darvish deep. \nOverall, in his career, Darvish is 2-5 with a 2.78 ERA in nine career starts against the Dodgers. At Dodger Stadium, he’s had some bumpy starts and has allowed 10 home runs in nine starts against his former team. \nTrea Turner is out of the lineup for the first time in 130 games for a long coming scheduled day off. The Dodgers had Gavin Lux slated to play at shortstop, but revised the lineup with Hanser Alberto at short instead. Lux is still dealing with some back issues. Freddie Freeman moves up to second in Dave Roberts’ lineup. Will Smith hits third with Max Muncy in the cleanup spot. \n\nBlake Treinen returns after missing over four months with shoulder inflammation. Jake Reed was designated for assignment.\n\n\nThe Dodgers activated RHP Blake Treinen from the 60-day injured list and designated Jake Reed for assignment.— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Dodgers are 8-2 against the Padres this season. \nGame info\n\nTeams: Dodgers (90-40) vs. Padres (73-59)\nLocation: Dodger Stadium\nFirst pitch: 7:10 p.m. PT\nTV: SportsNet LA",

        "description": "A federal judge on Friday rejected Steve Bannon’s request for a new trial following his conviction on contempt of Congress charges, allowing his sentencing to remain on schedule for next month. \n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Carl Nichols said in his ruling that a new trial is only warranted when a “serious miscarriage of justice” might have occurred, but Bannon’s arguments do not demonstrate that.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBannon’s argument mostly focused on alleged issues in instructions given to the jury, including that his theory of defense was not included in the instructions and that the court defined the meaning of the criminal statute he was accused of violating in the jury instructions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Nichols said Bannon did not cite any authority that demonstrates not including the defense theory was an error, and that defining the criminal statute is \"precisely\" the court’s role. \n\n\n\nNichols also rejected a motion from Bannon to dismiss the case entirely. Bannon argued that not being able to compel certain members of the House to testify violated his constitutional rights.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNichols said Bannon did not show that any potential testimony from House members would be material to the case.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBannon was convicted in July on two counts of contempt for refusing to testify before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection and refusing to turn related documents over to the committee. He is set to be sentenced on Oct. 21. \n\n\n\nBannon did not immediately return a request from The Hill for comment through his attorney.",

        "description": "David Kohl-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Sean Bouchard’s first big league home run was not enough to give the Rockies a win.  Unfortunately, Sean Bouchard’s first big league home run was not enough to win this game. The Colorado Rockies and Cincinnati Reds game was tied until the bottom of the ninth when the Reds were able to walk off the Rockies without going into extra innings. Tonight’s game was filled with firsts for players on both teams. \nI see you, Sean Bouchard\nAfter a scoreless first two innings, Sean Bouchard blasted a home run. It was his first MLB home run and it scored two. I won’t lie, it was fun to watch. With that homer, the Rockies were the first on the board, giving them a 2-0 lead.\n\n\nSEAN BOUCHARD'S FIRST MLB HOME RUN! pic.twitter.com/oYZ9aRGW76— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nFollowing Bouchard’s home run, the Rockies offense remained silent for the remainder of the game unable to plate anymore runs which resulted in the loss.\nHave a debut, Spencer Steer\nYou have to give credit where it’s due, even if it’s for the opposing team. In the bottom of the fifth inning Spencer Steer, who was making his MLB debut tonight with the Reds tonight, blasted a ball to center and gave the Reds one run. Steer went 2-2 with two walks and was the man who plated the final run after Jonathan India hit a ball to the infield in the bottom of the ninth. \nThe Reds second run prior to their walk off was a home run from Jake Fraley in the bottom of the seventh inning. \nSome highlights amidst a loss\nMichael Toglia is fun to watch. It’s great to see the two fresh faces (Toglia and Bouchard) making an impact on the field. I hope to see more of it. \n\n\nMichael Toglia makes a nice sliding grab pic.twitter.com/Q5DARusT19— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nUp next\nThe Rockies will face the Red in game two of this series tomorrow at 4:40pm MDT. Germán Márquez (7-10, 4.97 ERA) will pitch for the Rockies and the Reds will call on Nick Lodolo (3-5, 4.30 ERA.) We’ll see you then.",

        "description": "Give the Rockies points for creativity. They keep finding ways to lose baseball games on the road.\nJonathan India hit an infielder chopper for a walk-off single to score Spencer Steer from third base and lift Cincinnati to a 3-2 victory Friday night at Great American Ballpark.\nLost in the loss was a strong start by Rockies left-hander Kyle Freeland.\nSteer &#8212; making a stellar major-league debut &#8212; was instrumental in the Reds&#8217; victory. He hit a solo homer in the fifth and led off the ninth with a double into the right-field corner off right-hander Alex Colome. Steer advanced to third on Colome&#8217;s wild pitch and scored on Indian&#8217;s infield hit against a five-man infield.\nColorado is now 20-45 away from Coors Field, a .308 winning percentage that is last in the majors and ranks as the third-lowest road winning percentage in franchise history.\nEarly on, there was a spec of good news. Rookie left fielder Sean Bouchard hit a keepsake home run in the second inning to give the Rockies a 2-0. After Elias Diaz reached on a one-out single, Bouchard hit a homer to deep left off right-hander Luis Cessa for the first homer of his career.\nRyan McMahon followed up Bouchard&#8217;s homer with a single and advanced to third on Charlie Blackmon&#8217;s double. But C.J. Cron struck out and Colorado&#8217;s chance for a big inning fizzled.\nFrom the fourth through the ninth, Colorado managed just one hit off Cessa and four Cincinnati relievers, that being a harmless leadoff single by Jose Iglesias in the seventh.\nBouchard drew a walk to lead off the eighth but then made a costly error. He misread Brendan Rodgers&#8217; line drive to right field, thinking it would fall for extra bases. But Arstrides Aquino ran down the ball for the catch and doubled Bouchard off first for an inning-ending double play.\nFreeland was mostly on-point for his first four innings. But leading off the fifth, Steer, a third baseman, debut, crushed Freeland&#8217;s 2-1 sinker to center field, cutting Colorado&#8217;s lead to 2-1.\nFreeland ran into traffic in the sixth, yielding a one-out single to Donovan Solano and a bunt single to Stuart Fairchild. He got the second out before giving way to right-hander Justin Lawrence, who pitched around Steer to load the bases but struck out Jose Barrero to preserve the lead.\nFreeland, gritty as ever, allowed eight hits over his 5 2/3 innings but just one run. Over his last five road starts, he&#8217;s 2-1 with a 2.46 ERA.\nCincinnati tied the game, 2-2, in the seventh on pinch hitter Jake Fraley&#8217;s leadoff homer off reliever Dinelson Lamet.",

        "description": "Photo by Todd Kirkland/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Travis d’Arnaud went deep twice while Austin Riley set a new career-high with his 34th home run. Travis d’Arnaud hit two of the Atlanta Braves’ five home runs on the evening to help them to a third straight win with an 8-1 victory over the Miami Marlins. \nCharlie Morton retired the side in order in the first although there were a couple of noisy outs. Brian Anderson’s barreled ball sent Michael Harris II to the wall in center for the second out and Garrett Cooper just missed a home run down the left field line that curved foul. Morton then struck out Cooper to end the inning. \nMorton found himself in trouble again in the second as Charles LeBlanc split the gap in right center for a double with one out. He moved to third on a wild pitch. The Braves pulled the infield in and it paid off as Jacob Stallings grounded out to Vaughn Grissom for the second out. Lewin Diaz then sent a slow roller to Austin Riley at third who made a barehanded pickup and threw to first in time to end the inning. \nMiami jumped on the board first in third as Jerar Encarnacion muscled the first pitch of the inning to the opposite field out to right for a 1-0 lead. Morton struck out Miguel Rojas for the first out, but then allowed a single to Joey Wendle. However, he escaped with no further damage as Brian Anderson grounded into a 6-4-3 double play, with a slick stop and turn by Dansby Swanson, to end the inning. \nSandy Alcantara retired the first seven hitters he faced before Marcell Ozuna reached on a swinging bunt in his first plate appearance since August 14. The Braves were unable to move him around, as Robbie Grossman lined out to J.J. Bleday before Ronald Acuña Jr. grounded into a force play to end the inning. \nThe Braves took control of the game in the fourth. Dansby Swanson led off the inning with a single and then stole second base. Alcantara struck out Riley for the first out and then got Matt Olson to pop out into foul territory. d’Arnaud made sure the situation wouldn’t go to waste as he connected for a two-run shot to left center to put Atlanta in front 2-1. \n\n\nd'inger!@SUBWAY | #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/sd60GeN4bt— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Braves weren’t finished. Harris lined a single the other way and then came around to score another two-run shot, this time by Vaughn Grissom, to extend the lead to 4-1. \n\n\nThe Troublemakers  #HyundaiHighlight | #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/u9hGboR5nF— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nNow with the lead, Morton retired the side in order in the fifth. He allowed another single to Wendle to start the sixth and then struck out Anderson and Cooper. He then walked Bleday to put runners at first and second. Brian Snitker went to his bullpen and summoned Collin McHugh, who got LeBlanc to line out to Harris in center for the final out. \nMorton pitched well and allowed four hits, two walks and a run in 5 2/3 innings. He struck out seven while throwing 91 pitches. \nThe Braves added on in the sixth. Alcantara hit d’Arnaud with a pitch to begin the inning and then gave up a monster home run to Harris to extend the lead to 6-1. \n\n\nSawry Not Sawry  @MoneyyyMikeee | #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/ixdMCHXRJ7— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nThat ended Alcantara’s night. He entered the game as the Cy Young favorite and had been dominant in two earlier starts against Atlanta, but the Braves got to him in this one for seven hits and six runs in five-plus innings. He allowed as many home runs (three) as he had strikeouts. It was pretty much the worst start of his season, with the only competition being his first start of 2022, where he walked five, only struck out four, and allowed a homer to boot.\nHuascar Brazoban took over on the mound for the Marlins and immediately walked Grissom. With Ozuna at the plate, Grissom stole second and was ruled safe initially but the play was overturned on replay for the first out. Ozuna went down on strikes for the second out but Grossman worked another walk. Acuna followed with a single to put runners at the corners for Swanson who struck out to end the inning. \nMcHugh stayed in and worked a scoreless seventh and the Braves added to their lead in the home half of the inning. Riley took Cole Sulser deep for his 34th home run of the season to set a new career-high and push Atlanta’s lead to 7-1.\n\n\nNumber 3️⃣4️⃣ for @austinriley1308!@PapaJohns | #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/ZalFBMg8V5— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nd’Arnaud followed with a drive into the Braves’ bullpen in right center for his second home run of the game to make it 8-1. \n\n\nMake that two d'ingers tonight for Travis!#ForTheA pic.twitter.com/Vvbj4TJBjw— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nJesse Chavez made his first appearance since being reacquired by the Braves and worked a scoreless inning in the eighth. Raisel Iglesias closed things out in the ninth to seal the win. \nWith the win, Atlanta improves to 82-51 on the season and extends its winning streak to three straight games. The series will continue Saturday with Jake Odorizzi matching up against Edward Cabrera.",

        "description": "Photo by Duane Burleson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Not to mention catcher injuries.  Hey hey, time to kick off a weekend series against another team trapped in the sub-basement of the AL Central. You would think if there was a divisional rival the Tigers might be able to get a few games up on in a series it would be the Royals, but I supposed we’ll see how these games pan out. This one, however, was a good start, even though it was close throughout. \nHutchison started off well for the Tigres with a clean 1-2-3 first, but while Greene continues to be an offensive delight, hitting a leadoff single, three straight flyouts ended the first scoreles.\nHaase left the game early with, um “lower abdominal contusion” which is a very polite way to say he bruised his—\n\n\nTucker Barnhart enters to catch in second inning after Eric Haase took a foul tip in an acutely painful spot in the first.— Jason Beck (@beckjason) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nIn the second two quick strikeouts looked good for the Tigers and then Massey bunted to reach, Dozier singled, and finally an Isbel singled brought both Massey and Dozier home with bonus help from a Greene error. Guess he can’t be perfect all the time out there. \nFor anyone who wants a true play-by-play for the middle innings, you can find it here, but I’m just going to tell you that not very much happened until the bottom of the fifth when Willi Castro hit a solo home run then back-to-back walks for Kreidler and Greene. Then both baserunners advanced on a balk. Reyes hit a sac fly to score Kreidler and suddenly it was a tie game. A Baez home run then brought two more runs in and what’s this... a lead?\n\n\nMago Muscle   pic.twitter.com/VL8fnppU98— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nHutchison will not be beloved by Royals fans after tonight as he hit Salvador Perez in the wrist with a pitch, causing the catcher to leave the game. Back game for catchers. Hutchison’s day was done, with a final line of 5.2 IP, 6 H, 4 R, 3 ER, 1 BB, 5 K, 1 HR on 85 pitches. The injury either shook Hutchison or emboldened the Royals, because Rivero took the base for Perez and then Taylor homered to score two and tie the game. Massey drew a walk. Into the bottom of the inning and the sole baserunner was Torkelson after being hit by a pitch. \nSeventh saw Chafin send the Royals down 1-2-3. Kreidler walked to start off the bottom of the inning. Reyes then singled. A pinch-hitting Harold Castro came in for Cabrera and singled to score Kreidler, advance Reyes to third, and end up on second himself. Not too shabby, leaving the Tigers up 5-4.\nVest came on in the top of the eighth and allowed a leadoff single for O’Hearn, who was then erased on the double play and a flyout ended the inning. In the bottom half Carpenter was hit by a pitch and I choose to believe these HBPs are all accidental. Baddoo came in to run for Carpenter, then Willi Castro reached on a single. Two more outs and the inning ended scoreless on both sides. \nSoto was on to hopefully maintain the lead and end things with a Tigers win. Rooker got a two-out single, but ultimately Soto got the final out and the Tigers took the win.\nFinal: Tigers 5, Royals 4",

        "description": "NEW YORK (AP) — Serena Williams lost what is expected to be the last match of her transcendent tennis career Friday night, eliminated from the U.S. Open in the third round by Ajla Tomljanovic 7-5, 6-7 (4), 6-1 before an electric crowd at Arthur Ashe Stadium.\n\n\n\nUnwilling to go quietly, Williams staved off five match points to prolong the three-hours-plus proceedings, as some spectators stood to watch, camera phones at the ready. No one — save, of course, Tomljanovic — wanted this to end.\n\n\n\nIt did on Tomljanovic's sixth chance, when Williams netted a shot.\n\n\n\nWilliams turns 41 this month and recently told the world that she is ready to start “evolving” away from her playing days — she expressed distaste for the word “retirement” — and while she has remained purposely vague about whether this appearance at Flushing Meadows definitely would represent her final tournament, everyone assumes it will be.\n\n\n\nIf this was, indeed, the last hurrah, she took her fans on a thrill-a-minute throwback ride at the hard-court tournament that was the site of a half-dozen of her 23 Grand Slam championships. The first came in 1999 in New York, when Williams was just 17.\n\n\n\nBut she faltered against Tomljanovic, a 29-year-old Australian who is ranked 46th. Williams gave away leads in each set, including the last, in which she was up 1-0 before dropping the final six games.",

        "description": "Photo by Dustin Satloff/Getty Images\n    \n\n  It wasn’t always pretty but the Mets found a way. The Mets did not play their best baseball to open the series against the Nationals but they managed to rally in the sixth to take down Washington by a score of 7-3 to stay three games ahead of the Braves in the standings.\nDavid Peterson got the start and was a bit shaky and a bit unlucky. He exited the game with one out in the sixth after giving up a game-tying double to Ildlemaro Vargas. He limited the damage to three runs while giving up eight hits. He struck out six and had to do some heavy lifting when Tomás Nido had a brain cramp and threw to third base on a dropped strike three call. The ball went into the outfield since Eduardo Escobar was not expecting a throw which lead to Washington’s first run. The batter also reached first but while looking a bit rattled Peterson worked out of trouble that inning. Overall it was a mixed bag for the lefty but ultimately he gave his team a chance to win.\nEduardo Escobar and Pete Alonso both went deep to help power the offense against local kid Josiah Gray who got the start for Washington. Alonso’s came at a crucial moment right after the Nationals had tied to game which jumpstarted a four-run rally. Nido and Brandon Nimmo also had big hits in the inning to build the Mets lead.\nNimmo, Jeff McNeil, and Mark Canha all had productive days at the plate which was a positive given how the offense has been struggling lately. Eduardo Escobar has also looked much better since his return from the injured list and he drove in three of the Mets seven runs.\nOnce Peterson left the game it was up to the bullpen to hold Washington and first up was Mychal Givens who had one of his better outings as a Met. He didn’t allow a run in 1.2 innings of work and kept the game tied in the sixth when he relieved Peterson.\nSeth Lugo followed and had to work around a couple of runners but he ended the game with a flourish with a decisive strikeout. The Mets did what they had to do against a weaker opponent to keep their lead in this final month in the season.\nBox scores\nMLBESPN\nSB Nation GameThreads\nAmazin’ AvenueFederal Baseball\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs.com\n  \nBig Mets winner: Pete Alonso, +18.6% WPABig Mets loser: David Peterson, -16.9% WPAMets pitchers: -1.2% WPAMets hitters: +51.2% WPATeh aw3s0mest play: Eduardo Escobar home run in secondTeh sux0rest play: Ildemaro Vargas double in sixth",

        "description": "Adley’s bases loaded walk in the 8th proved the defining moment in a chaotic Orioles’ win.  | Photo by Greg Fiume/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Adley Rutschman came off the bench to walk in the winning run, while GUNNAR HENDERSON shined in his Camden Yards debut.  The Orioles mantra coming into Friday night’s game against the A’s was “Bring the Chaos.” The Birds certainly did that and more, as an eighth-inning rally helped them come away with a 5-2 win over Oakland. \nThe game played out like a great drama—three acts with different heroes and villains in all of them. Dean Kremer starred early on. Tony Kemp and some poor hitting with RISP spoiled the second act. Then Adley Rutschman cashed in on the opportunity to play the role of hero late. Oh, and GUNNAR HENDERSON was awesome throughout—as we have all come to expect. \nThe Orioles got on the board first in the third inning. GUNNAR led off the inning with his first Camden Yards AB—rocketing a ball down the first base line for a double. GUNNAR’S bullet was followed by a bloop double from Robinson Chirinos, bringing home the star rookie for his first Camden Yards run. Ryan Mountcastle would cap the rally with a single to right, scoring Chirinos and giving the O’s a 2-0 lead. \n\n\nFeeling right at home   pic.twitter.com/J9eumn2nab— Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) September 2, 2022\n\n\n\nThrough the first four innings, Kremer was the same dominant pitcher that Birdland saw against Houston. He set the first six batters down in order, striking out four of them. Even when the A’s started off the third with two soft singles, Kremer remained calm. The righty got out of that jam by getting nine hitter Cal Stevenson to line out softly to him, doubling off the runner at first—before ending the inning on an easy fly ball to center. Early on, Kremer’s whole arsenal was working, as he consistently went to his fastball, his cutter and his changeup to get outs. \nThen the fifth inning hit and Kremer’s confidence and composure were tested. Vimael Machin led off the inning with a single, and Dermis Garcia then laced one down the third base line to put runners at second and third with no outs. After only throwing two curveballs in the first four innings, Kremer started leaning on the big breaker to try and get out of the jam. At first, it worked; Jonah Bride lined out to third on a curve, and Nick Allen popped out to the catcher off a breaking ball.\nHowever, after a walk to load the bases, Kremer tried to go to the curve one too many times. Tony Kemp singled a 2-2, two-out curveball softly up the middle, tying the game at two. Kremer would finish the inning and then got through the sixth unscathed. The final stat line—6 IP, 5 hits, 2 runs and 6 Ks—was enough to earn a quality start. Yet, it still felt like Kremer left a little something to be desired with his start—a testament to how dominant he and the O’s starters have been of late. \nBaltimore then became plagued with missed chances. With one out in the sixth, Mountcastle got on base with a walk. He then moved to third on a Ramon Urias double off the base of the Wall in left. However, unlike the A’s in the fifth, the O’s failed to capitalize on their second and third, one out situation. Mountcastle was thrown at the plate, running on contact when Jesus Aguilar hit a hard grounder to Machin at third. Austin Hays could do no better, grounding out to shortstop to end the inning. \nGUNNAR was the next victim of poor hitting with runners in scoring position. HENDERSON showed off his ability to hit to all fields in seventh, lacing a double down the left field line this time. However, Chirinos couldn’t drive him in this time, grounding out to third. Ryan McKenna was then caught looking at strike three to end the scoring threat. \nThe eighth inning was when the final act began and the Friday’s heroes truly emerged. Anthony Santander walked to lead off the inning and then advanced to second when Mountcastle reached on a slow roller to the second baseman. Brandon Hyde then made the interesting decision of bunting with his cleanup hitter, as Urias dropped down a perfect sacrifice to move up Santander and Mountcastle. \nAfter the bunt, Hyder really started pushing some major managerial buttons. He pinch-hit Cedric Mullins for Jesus Aguilar—only to see Mullins intentionally walked to load the bases. Then, with Austin Hays almost all the way to the right-handed batter’s box, Hyde pulled him back, inserting Adley. \nThe Orioles’ face of the franchise showed the plate vision and discipline of a ten-year vet. He took multiple close strikes before working the count full, and finally taking a fastball only inches below the zone—pushing home Santander with an RBI walk. Jorge Mateo then opened the flood gates, ripping a single through the left side of the infield on the first pitch he saw, bringing home Mountcastle and Mullins to make it 5-2. \n\n\nCHAOS!!!! pic.twitter.com/3MT4mOV5Iq— Baltimore Orioles (@Orioles) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nDillon Tate closed things out in the ninth with a strikeout and double play ball, sealing the Orioles’ 70th win of the season. While the game was certainly more chaotic than most of Birdland would have liked, it still showcased everything that’s been great about these O’s. The starting pitching was overall excellent, the young stars shined bright, and the Orioles picked up the W in a game they have no business losing if they’re going to make the playoffs. Now, all they needed to do is rest up and bring even more chaos tomorrow.",

        "description": "Photo by Duane Burleson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The fifth inning dooms Daniel Lynch. Daniel Lynch cruised through four shutout innings, but gave up four runs in the fifth as the Royals ultimately fell to the Tigers 5-4 in Detroit on Friday night. Lynch struck out four and walked three in five innings of work, and it was his third outing in a row he has gone just five innings or less.\nThe Royals got on the board first against Tigers starter Drew Hutchinson with a pair of runs in the second inning. With two outs, Michael Massey reached on a bunt single against the shift and Hunter Dozier followed up with a hit of his own. Kyle Isbel laced a single to center that allowed Massey to score, and when centerfielder Riley Greene kicked it, Dozier made it home as well to make it 2-0 Royals.\nBut it was the fifth inning that doomed the Royals. Willi Castro hit a one-out solo home run to put Detroit on the board. Lynch walked the next two hitters, then balked to advance them one base. A Victor Reyes sacrifice fly tied the game, but it was Javier Baez with the big blow, a two-run home run to make it 4-2 Tigers.\nThe Royals got a scare in the sixth when Salvador Perez was struck on the hand with a pitch that caused him to exit the game. After the game, manager Mike Matheny said x-rays were negative and Salvy had a right hand contusion and is day-to-day. With pinch-runner Sebastian Rivero at first base, Michael A. Taylor laced a two-run home run, his ninth of the year, to tie the game.\n\n\nMichael A. Tater ties the game with a two-run blast!  TV: Bally Sports Kansas CityStream: https://t.co/SD0bdLksMW#Royals pic.twitter.com/vKxhmK0kY5— Bally Sports Kansas City (@BallySportsKC) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nAmir Garrett gave the Royals a clean sheet in the sixth, but Carlos Hernández had trouble in the seventh. Number nine hitter Ryan Kreidler led off with a walk, which have been known to haunt. Victor Reyes singled him to second, and a single by pinch-hitter Harold Castro scored him for what would be the winning run. \nRoyals hitters managed just seven singles aside from Taylor’s home run, and drew just one walk all night. They fall to 53-80 and will take on the Tigers again tomorrow at 5:10 CT with Jonathan Heasley scheduled to face Michael Pineda.",

        "description": "Just a week ago, a judge ordered the release of the affidavit on which the FBI applied for a search warrant for Mar-a-Lago. That document revealed that Trump had taken highly classified documents from the government and held them in insecure locations. That document was horrifying, but it referred only to documents the government had already recovered, not the ones for which it would go on to search for on August 8.Today the unsealing of a court filing revealed that the August 8 search turned up more than 11,000 documents or photographs that were not classified, 31 documents marked CONFIDENTIAL, 54 marked SECRET, and 18 marked TOP SECRET. In addition, agents found 48 empty folders marked CLASSIFIED, and 42 empty folders marked to be returned to a military aide. Those documents were not filed with the envelopes.This story is unprecedented and explosive. As Sue Gordon, who was principal deputy director of national intelligence from 2017 to 2019, told MSNBC&#8217;s Nicolle Wallace yesterday, in addition to the potential for exposing national secrets, the exposure of the networks and techniques that were in those documents could unravel intelligence networks that took decades to build.The implications for the destruction of our national security at Trump&#8217;s hands are enormous.&nbsp;And yet, after President Joe Biden&#8217;s speech last night saying that &#8220;Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,&#8221; Republicans have rushed to attack Biden as divisive, hateful, or disparaging of half the country, claiming far more support than they have. Biden offered them an off-ramp from this profound scandal, inviting them to stand on the side of defending democracy, and they refused it.&nbsp;They have tied themselves to what looks like it is on the way to becoming the biggest attack on our national security in our history, but it is not clear to me that even remaining Republican voters will be okay with the compromise of our national security. National security used to be very important to Republicans.Trump&#8217;s attorney general Bill Barr seemed today to be trying to get whatever is left of the Republican establishment to abandon the former president. He told two different Fox News Channel programs: &#8220;I&#8230;think for them to have taken things to the current point, they probably have pretty good evidence&#8230;. I think the driver on this from the beginning was&#8230;loads of classified information sitting in Mar-a-Lago. People say this was unprecedented, well it&#8217;s also unprecedented for a president to take all this classified information and put them in a country club.&#8221;&nbsp;&#8220;I can&#8217;t think of a legitimate reason why they&#8230;could be taken&#8230;away from the government if they&#8217;re classified.&#8221; He added that he was &#8220;skeptical&#8221; that Trump had declassified the documents. &#8220;I think it&#8217;s highly improbable, [and]...if in fact he sort of stood over scores of boxes, not really knowing what was in them, and said &#8216;I hereby declassify everything in here,&#8217; that would be such an abuse and&#8230;shows such recklessness it&#8217;s almost worse than taking the documents.&#8221;Among all the Republican backlash over Biden&#8217;s speech, today, veteran CNN White House reporter John Harwood said:&#8220;The core point he made in that political speech about a threat to democracy is true.&nbsp;&#8220;Now, that&#8217;s something that&#8217;s not easy for us, as journalists, to say. We&#8217;re brought up to believe there&#8217;s two different political parties with different points of view and we don&#8217;t take sides in honest disagreements between them. But that&#8217;s not what we&#8217;re talking about. These are not honest disagreements. The Republican Party right now is led by a dishonest demagogue.&nbsp;&#8220;Many, many Republicans are rallying behind his lies about the 2020 election and other things as well. And a significant portion&#8212;or a sufficient portion&#8212;of the constituency that they&#8217;re leading attacked the Capitol on January 6th. Violently.&nbsp;&#8220;By offering pardons or suggesting pardons for those people who violently attacked the Capitol, which you&#8217;ve been pointing out numerous times this morning, Donald Trump made Joe Biden&#8217;s point for him.&#8221;&nbsp;Shortly afterward, Harwood announced he was no longer with CNN.&nbsp;A source told Dan Froomkin of Press Watch that Harwood had been told last month he was being let go, despite his long-term contract, and that he used his last broadcast to send a message.&#8212;Notes:https://www.reuters.com/legal/us-judge-orders-release-redacted-affidavit-trump-search-by-friday-2022-08-25/Aaron Rupar @atruparhelpful breakdown from CNN September 2nd 2022542 Retweets2,189 Likes/photo/1https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-mar-a-lago-government-and-politics-6bd103a8e418166b17a34d77e8d9102dhttps://presswatchers.org/2022/09/was-biden-right-or-was-biden-wrong-the-national-media-wont-say/Acyn @AcynBarr: I think for them to taken things to the current point they probably have pretty good evidence..

        "description": "Nathan Ray Seebeck-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The offense once again did nothing, Andrew Benintendi got hurt, and the bullpen fell apart. September resurgence! Sometimes, the score just tells you all you need to know about how a team is playing at the moment. The Yankees have lost more frustrating, close games as part of their skids than blowouts, but they picked a helluva time to get their asses kicked by the team that now whittled 10 games off their AL East lead in the span of a month — one where they’ve been the worst team in the American League. The Yankees lost, 9-0, in a game that was technically close through seven, but wasn’t really in truth.\nThe familiar suspects of this terrible skid were all there. For the sixth time since the beginning of August, the Yankees’ lineup got shut out, stranding runners and looking lifeless. The defense made some bad mistakes, with Josh Donaldson playing Public Enemy No. 1 this time around with two errors leading to the Rays’ first run. The starting pitching did a decent enough job; the score was 3-0 at the start of the eighth before the floodgates opened. Combined, it was an all-too-familiar recipe for disaster that fans of the 2022 Yankees have been force-fed for almost the entire second half.\nI almost want to end the recap right there because examining this mess too closely is like picking up a rock that just squished a cockroach. But I will do my best while still keeping it relatively brief because this Yankees ballclub is not at all playing like it deserves any fan’s headspace.\nStarting with the positives, Domingo Germán simply did his job again, just as he did for most of August. Through six innings, he kept the Rays’ offense at bay by allowing one run on five hits, wiggling out of trouble a few times in the process. The one run couldn’t really be blamed on him, as it was the result of a Donaldson error in the fourth that was immediately followed by another error on a nice relay involving Oswaldo Cabrera to get an out at home:\n\nCabrera’s heroics could not fully preserve the zero, though. David Peralta singled in a run to put Tampa on top. The Rays could’ve stopped there and won since the Yankees’ offense is such a joke these days, but alas, they did not. Just as Germán did last week in Oakland, he came back to the mound for the seventh with a low pitch count, but after a one-out walk to Isaac Paredes, Tampa delivered the crushing blow on a two-run homer by Christian Bethancourt to make it 3-0.\nThe first-half Yankees would hardly be intimidated by a late 3-0 deficit, but those guys are history. The second-half Yankees played like they never had a prayer against Rays starter Jeffrey Springs. Oh, they put a few guys on base, but they never scored; New York went 0-for-7 with runners in scoring position, and given how the team has played lately, only the most optimistic of fans would’ve been hopeful in those spots. Check out these highlights:\n\nA completely lost Donaldson called out on strikes to end the first with two men on\nTwo-on, one-out rally snuffed out in the third when Andrew Benintendi heard a “pop” in his wrist, felt numbness and had to leave* mid at-bat; Oswaldo Cabrera pinch-hit and popped up, while the slumping Giancarlo Stanton struck out\nIsiah Kiner-Falefa never gets to advance after a rare double to lead off the fifth\nIKF returns the stranding favor in the sixth by grounding out with runners on first and second\n\n*Benintendi’s X-rays were negative, but he’ll go for an MRI tomorrow. Although potentially losing a 101 wRC+ outfielder shouldn’t be crushing, it sure feels like it for the 2022 Yankees.\nThe Yankees never got another player in scoring position after then. The lineup is just a nightmare in all the worst ways.\nIn the eighth, the Rays turned this one into a laugher as they beat up on Greg Weissert and Anthony Banda. Weissert allowed two normal hits and then one gift on a Yu Chang topper behind the mound that he threw away. Chang got an infield hit and Weissert was charged with the Yankees’ third error of the night to make it 5-0. That ushered in a comically bad outing from the worst pitcher on the roster, Banda, who walked three — including two with the bases loaded — while giving up two singles and a hit batter.\nBy the time the dust had settled, it was 9-0, the Rays had trimmed the AL East lead to just five games, and manager Aaron Boone was left fuming at his team’s results in the postgame.\n\n\nAaron Boone: “I'm in charge of this team. What we're going through right now, I know better than anyone. […] I do think the effort is there. I think the care is there. But we've set a much better standard in that room that we've got to start living up to.”— Lindsey Adler (@lindseyadler) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nThe words are nice and all, but maybe the rookie top prospect who was called up yesterday should’ve started rather than sitting on the bench until two outs in the ninth inning of a blowout! No, Oswald Peraza didn’t get an exciting moment at all for his MLB debut, as he struck out to end this farce. Poor guy.\nThe Yankees and Rays will meet up again tomorrow night at the Trop, with Clarke Schmidt seeking redemption from an ugly return to the rotation last Sunday in Oakland. He’ll face Corey Kluber with the first pitch from his former teammate coming at 6:10pm ET. Will Peraza actually start this time? Who knows!!!\nBox Score",

        "description": "Rays reliever J.P. Feyereisen is dealing with renewed shoulder discomfort, manager Kevin Cash announced (via Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times). It&#8217;s now &#8220;highly unlikely&#8221; he&#8217;ll make it back to the mound in 2022, per Cash. Feyereisen has been out since early June with what was initially termed a shoulder impingement.\nIt&#8217;s a tough blow to the Tampa Bay bullpen. Feyereisen was quietly one of the most effective relievers in the game early in the season. He only allowed one unearned run in 24 1/3 innings through June 2, the only pitcher in the majors to work 20+ frames without allowing an earned run. He certainly wouldn&#8217;t have sustained that pace over a full season, but the right-hander struck out a very strong 29.1% of opponents while posting an excellent 5.8% walk rate. He generated swinging strikes on 16.3% of his total offerings, a top 30 mark leaguewide (minimum 20 innings).\nFeyereisen has been brilliant for more than a calendar year. The Rays acquired him from the Brewers in the May 2021 deal that sent Willy Adames to Milwaukee and also brought back Drew Rasmussen (a trade with which both clubs must be thrilled in retrospect). Since first donning a Rays uniform, Feyereisen has worked to a sparkling 1.48 ERA across 61 innings.\nThat quality showing seems likely to make him a core piece of Cash&#8217;s relief corps over the coming seasons. Feyereisen entered the season with one year and 108 days of MLB service time. He&#8217;s collected service time while on the injured list and will hit a full season, bringing him to 2.108 years this offseason. That seems likely to fall a bit shy of the Super Two cutoff for early arbitration eligibility &#8212; that date changes annually, but last year&#8217;s cutoff was set at 2.116 years, for reference. In that case, he&#8217;d make around the league minimum salary next season. Even if the Super Two cutoff is low enough that Feyereisen qualifies, he&#8217;ll still be plenty affordable in arbitration and is controllable through 2026.",

The Archives had become aware earlier this year it did not have everything from Meadows after seeing what he had turned over to the House select committee investigating January 6, 2021.”",
