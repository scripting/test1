        "description": "Today, President Joe Biden&#8217;s administration released an&nbsp; &#8220;economic blueprint&#8221; to show how the new laws and policies it has put in place &#8220;are rebuilding an economy that works for working families.&#8221;The Biden-Harris Economic Blueprint notes that Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris took office in the midst of unprecedented crises, including &#8220;an economy that for many decades had been failing to deliver for working families&#8212;with workers and middle-class families left behind, stagnating wages and accelerating costs, crumbling infrastructure, U.S. manufacturing in decline, and persistent racial disparities.&#8221; In the past year and a half, it says, the Democrats have set the nation &#8220;on a new course,&#8221; investing in a historic economic recovery based on a long-term strategy to make lasting changes to the economy that will carry the nation into the future, making sure that no one is left behind.The blueprint calls for empowering workers through unionization and new jobs; restoring the country&#8217;s manufacturing base by investing in infrastructure and clean energy; helping families by lowering costs and expanding access to affordable and high-quality health care, child care, education, housing, and so on; promoting industrial competition to open the way for entrepreneurs and bring down costs; and &#8220;rewarding work, not wealth,&#8221; by reforming taxation so that taxes do not go up on anyone who makes less than $400,000 a year, and that the wealthy and corporations pay their fair share.This blueprint pulls together much of what Biden has been saying all along, and it is quite clear about what this means. What the blueprint calls &#8220;new architecture&#8221; must, it says, &#8220;replace the old regime.&#8221; The old system sent economic gains to the top while outsourcing industries, and the end of public investment hollowed out the middle class. The new system will drive &#8220;the economy from the bottom up and middle out&#8221; because that system &#8220;ensures that growth benefits everyone.&#8221;&nbsp;While Biden and Harris are focused on the economy and the future, the Department of Justice is still handling crises created by the former president.Yesterday the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a motion to request a partial stay of Judge Aileen Cannon&#8217;s order last week, the one that said the DOJ couldn&#8217;t use the items the FBI seized when they searched the Trump property at Mar-a-Lago on August 8.&nbsp;In her Civil Discourse newsletter, law professor, host of the Sisters In Law podcast, and former U.S. attorney Joyce White Vance explained that the DOJ has asked for that order to be stayed as far as it concerns the classified records. That request is separate from an appeal of the order itself to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, which the DOJ has indicated it will undertake. With the motion it filed yesterday, the DOJ wants the court to hold off on enforcing the judge&#8217;s order that the government can&#8217;t review and use the materials seized &#8220;for criminal investigative purposes,&#8221; and the part that says the government must turn the records over to a special master.&nbsp;The DOJ pointed out that the intelligence community&#8217;s assessment of the damage done to our national security is tied together with the ongoing criminal investigation. Because the FBI is central to both, the judge&#8217;s order has shut down the national security review, which is vitally important to the country.&#8220;In plain English,&#8221; Vance writes, &#8220;DOJ is asking how the guy who took the classified nuclear secrets he wasn&#8217;t entitled to have is harmed if law enforcement gets to look at those materials to protect our national security.&#8221;The judge has given Trump&#8217;s lawyers until Monday to respond.&nbsp;Meanwhile, at Just Security, Michael Stern points out that in Nixon v. GSA,&nbsp; everyone&#8212;including President Richard M. Nixon&#8212;agreed that &#8220;the very specific privilege protecting against disclosure of state secrets and sensitive information concerning military or diplomatic matters&#8230;may be asserted only by an incumbent President,&#8221; suggesting that Trump has no grounds to assert executive privilege over the classified information seized.&nbsp;Also today, Judge Donald Middlebrooks of the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida dismissed a lawsuit Trump launched in March 2022 against Hillary Clinton and a number of his favorite villains alleging that &#8220;the Defendants, blinded by political ambition, orchestrated a malicious conspiracy to disseminate patently false and injurious information about Donald J. Trump and his campaign, all in the hopes of destroying his life, his political career and rigging the 2016 Presidential Election in favor of Hillary Clinton.&#8221; The people he was suing dismissed his lawsuit, saying, &#8220;[w]hatever the utilities of [the Amended Complaint] as a fundraising tool, a press release, or a list of political grievances, it has no merit as a lawsuit.&#8221; The judge agreed and demolished the 193-page lawsuit as lacking evidence, legal justification, and good faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;The lawsuit rehashed the Russia investigation, which Trump used to great effect during his term to deflect investigations into his wrongdoing. Two investigations, one by an independent investigation by Special Counsel Robert Mueller and another by the Republican-dominated Senate Intelligence Committee, revealed that Russia had attacked the U.S. presidential election in 2020 and that the Trump campaign had, at the very least, played along.But by using the machinery of government, including by putting loyalists into key positions, Trump reversed reality to argue that he was an innocent victim and that the investigators were actually the ones who had broken the law. He and his allies saturated the media with accusations that government officials, including FBI agents&#8212;many of whom he named in this lawsuit&#8212;were members of the &#8220;Deep State,&#8221; out to get him.&nbsp;Trump is resurrecting this old trope at a time when he is in the midst of yet another investigation for which the evidence against him is monumental. Now out of power, though, he has had to turn to the courts and, interestingly, contrived to get this case in front of Judge Cannon, who was rushed onto the court with very little experience after Trump had already lost the 2020 election.&nbsp;&#8212;Notes:Civil Discourse with Joyce Vance DOJ's Motion For A Stay ExplainedDOJ filed a motion today that is a real doozie. It&#8217;s a class act offering of an off-ramp to a judge who is badly in need of one. First off, we need to understand what this motion is and what it isn&#8217;t. The motion is a request for a partial stay of the Judge&#8217;s order last week that prohibited DOJ from using seized items until a special master could review t&#8230;Read morea day ago &#183; 445 likes &#183; 56 comments &#183; Joyce Vancehttps://www.justsecurity.org/83012/the-absence-of-any-executive-privilege-by-a-former-president-for-national-security-secrets/https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2022/all-they-had-to-do-was-ask-said-trump-a-timeline-of-efforts-to-retrieve-presidential-records/Peter Strzok @petestrzokTrump&#8217;s lawsuit against me and many others just dismissed.

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Rockies hit five homers - including the longest in Coors history - en route to the victory It was a rainy night in Denver that played host to a slugfest at Coors on Friday. Germán Márquez’s start was one to forget, but his lineup bailed him out with an offensive output that saw them put their power on display as the Rockies prevailed over the Diamondbacks in a 13-10 walk-off victory.\nStarting off hot\nThe scoring began early and often on Friday, initially by way of Jake McCarthy’s eighth home run of the year in the top of the first inning giving Arizona a quick 1-0 lead. That lead was not to last long as Ryan McMahon responded with a leadoff home run in the bottom of the frame. \n\n\nLEAD-OFF RYMAC JACK  pic.twitter.com/VESZmmjCsb— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nThe scoring continued in the second inning when Michael Toglia doubled and was immediately brought home on Elías Díaz’s eighth long ball of the year. The Rockies carried a 3-1 lead into the bottom of the fourth, and it was then that the bats would really wake up. \nBig boppin fourth frame\nColorado did some serious damage in the bottom of the fourth, kicked off by a Randal Grichuk’s leadoff knock and Toglia’s walk. Elías Díaz singled to put the game at 4-1, and Alan Trejo’s double-play ball scored another run. McMahon then homered for the second time, giving Colorado a 6-1 advantage. They weren’t done yet though, as Yonathan Daza singled and scored on C.J. Cron’s mammoth two-run homer, his 27th of the year. The awesome blast went 504 feet - the longest in MLB this season, and the furthest in Coors Field history - and highlighted the inning by scoring Colorado’s seventh and eighth runs.\n\n\nC.J. THAT BALL HAD A FAMILY pic.twitter.com/CFyD2W0wZ0— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Rockies cruised into the fifth inning with a seven-run lead. Surely things would go smoothly on their way to a victory from here. Surely...\nDisaster strikes\n \nYeah so... not great. \nGermán Márquez completely lost command of his pitches, especially his fastball, in the top of the fifth. It’s unclear if the rain may have played a factor, but he certainly did not have his best stuff available. The first nine - NINE - batters of the inning reached at scored in the frame. Eight of those were due to Márquez, who allowed four hits, two walks, and a hit-by-pitch in that inning alone. He departed with the bases loaded and no outs recorded, and with the score now 8-6, the Diamondbacks were in prime position to tie things as Daulton Varsho stepped to the plate. \nReliever Austin Gomber’s first pitch was a hanging slider that Varsho cranked into right field for a go-ahead grand slam, an absolute gut punch to the Coors faithful. Gomber recorded the next three outs without incident, but the Rockies now had work to do to regain their lost lead. \nMárquez’s final line read as four innings pitched with seven hits allowed, three walks, and nine earned runs against two strikeouts. He owns a 6.78 ERA at home this season, and has allowed 19 home runs in 15 starts at Coors. Not ideal.\n#coors\nSomehow, someway, Colorado was able to claw back to tie the contest. Doubles by Trejo and Daza in the bottom of the sixth scored the home team’s ninth run, while the tying tally crossed the plate in the seventh when Elehuris Montero (who entered the game after Brendan Rodgers was ejected for arguing a strikeout that he felt he held up on) rounded the bases all the way from first base on Díaz’s two-out double. \n\n\nTIE GAME! pic.twitter.com/KasRXNyjlb— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nThe game was improbably tied at ten as we entered the eighth inning. How was this wild battle going to end?\nDíaz does it\nDíaz knew he had a chance to end the game when he stepped up with two on and two outs in the bottom of the ninth, but it seemed he may not have an opportunity. Arizona reliever Caleb Smith seemed to eye the on-deck circle and appeared unsure of pitching to Díaz, but he eventually challenged Colorado’s catcher and made a fatal error. That error was a hung slider that Díaz didn’t miss, sending the ball to left field for a three-run walk-off home run, his ninth bomb of the season.\n\n\nDÍAZ CALLED GAME  pic.twitter.com/ecA2o2dmgN— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nDíaz’s seven RBI were enough to finally get the Rockies the win on a cold, rainy night. #coors\nUp Next\nMadison Bumgarner (6-13, 4.83 ERA) and José Ureña (3-6, 6.13 ERA) will hope to avoid allowing such offensive onslaughts when they take the mound for Arizona and Colorado, respectively, for the second game of the series on Saturday.\nFirst pitch is at 6:10pm MDT. See you then!",

        "description": "A few months ago Donald Trump sued Hillary Clinton in federal court for—\nWell, for being mean to him, I guess. This is decidedly not a federal crime, but Trump hoped to get a favorable hearing anyway by filing his suit in a Florida district where the only judge was Aileen Cannon, the Trump appointee who recently ruled for him in his plea for a special master in the Mar-a-Lago case. But through a quirk of scheduling the case ended up instead with a non-Trump judge who was decidedly not amused by Trump's filing. Here are a few of the best lines from Judge Donald Middlebrooks' dismissal of the entire case:\nWhat the Amended Complaint lacks in substance and legal support it seeks to substitute with length, hyperbole, and the settling of scores and grievances.\nTo say that Plaintiff’s 193-page, 819-paragraph Amended Complaint is excessive in length would be putting things mildly.\nKnowledge that Florida is a state in the United States does not equate to knowledge that Defendants’ actions will have consequences in Florida.\nIt is not simply that I find the Amended Complaint “inadequate in any respect”; it is inadequate in nearly every respect.\nAt its core, the problem with Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint is that Plaintiff is not attempting to seek redress for any legal harm; instead, he is seeking to flaunt a two-hundred-page political manifesto outlining his grievances against those that have opposed him.\nI wonder: Is Aileen Cannon at all embarrassed by the fact that Trump apparently expects her to rule in his favor like an old time machine pol no matter how stupid his case is? Because this was a pretty stupid case indeed.\n\nFacebook  \nTwitter \nEmail\nPrint",

Pale green caterpillars dangling from the pipit’s bill contrast neatly with the pink of this foster parent’s lower mandible. The cuckoo, plump and ungainly, gorges itself and looks for more. The pipit flies up into the foliage to oblige, and swiftly returns with another neat rack of fuel for the immense journey to sub-Saharan Africa on which this youngster will soon embark.As I watch, the fledgling drops from the branch. With wings acutely angled downwards, its barred form flies strongly down-valley, heading across tawny grass and heather before careering back to the oak branch again. It alights awkwardly, the pipit once more in rapid attendance. Continue reading...",

I’m super grateful to have had 14 different organizations allow me the opportunity to represent them. I was once told by a mentor that you are only as strong as the team you have around you, and I have an amazing team. I want to start by thanking my wife. She’s been by my side through the ups and downs of this journey. I love you E! I want to thank my parents for always believing in me and always making ANY sacrifices that had to be made in order for me to be able to get out on the field and play. My sisters have always been in my corner no matter what and their love and support has never changed! Love all of yall! Thanks to my kids for being my biggest cheer squad. To my in-laws, friends, and other family members, all of y’all have been nothing short of amazing for all of the motivation throughout all of these years. I want to thank all of my coaches, trainers, and doctors, on the field and off, for all of the hours of hard work put in to help me have an amazing career. This game has taught me many life lessons and allowed me to evolve into the person I am today! I will forever have memories that will live within me from the game that I loved and dedicated my life to. Thank you baseball for an amazing life experience that I will never forget!!\nThe timing of the announcement was special to Jackson for two reasons. Friday was his 39th birthday, and it was the 19th anniversary of his major league debut with the Dodgers, beating Randy Johnson — who at the time was one day shy of being literally double Jackson’s age — and the Diamondbacks in Arizona.\n\nThe Dodgers drafted Jackson in the sixth round in 2001 out of Shaw High School in Columbus, Georgia. A little more than two years later, the right-hander was pitching for the Dodgers in a race for the wild card spot. Jackson put up a 2.45 ERA in four games and 22 innings that month in the majors, including allowing one run in six innings to beat the D-backs in his major league debut, throwing 98-mph fastballs.\n“There’s not a whole lot more to ask of a guy, especially at that age. If he stays healthy, he’s going to pitch up here a long time,” Kevin Brown said after Jackson’s birthday debut, per the Los Angeles Times.\nA long time was an understatement, as Jackson pitched 17 years in the majors. The Dodgers traded him with Chuck Tiffany to the Rays for Danys Báez and Lance Carter before the 2006 season, one of seven times Jackson was dealt in his career.\n\nJackson pitched for the Dodgers, Rays, Tigers, Diamondbacks, White Sox, Blue Jays, Cardinals, Nationals, Cubs, Braves, Marlins, Padres, Orioles, and A’s. Fourteen teams is a major league record.\nWith the D-backs, pitched a no-hitter on June 25 against the Rays in Tampa, working around eight walks and throwing 149 pitches, a total that hasn’t been reached by a major league pitcher since.\nJackson last pitched in the majors in 2019 with the Tigers. He signed a minor league contract with Arizona in 2020, but did not pitch that season. \nThat year, Jackson did help found The Players Alliance, a nonprofit group focused on increasing diversity in baseball and addressing “baseball’s systemic barriers to equity and inclusion by creating pathways to opportunities on and off the field for an undeniable pipeline of Black talent.”\nJackson currently sits on the board of directors of The Players Alliance as secretary.\nJackson pitched one inning in one game in 2021 for High Point in the Atlantic League, but his highlight of the year was pitching two games for Team USA, winning a silver medal at the Summer Olympics.\nIn 17 major league seasons, Jackson had a 4.78 ERA (an 88 ERA+) and 4.48 FIP in 412 games, including 318 starts, with 1,508 strikeouts in 1,960 innings. That’s the 10th-most career innings pitched by anyone drafted and signed by the Dodgers in the standard June draft.",

        "description": "It would be a mistake to think Australians are ready to embrace a republicAs a staunch republican and a founding member of the Australian Republican Movement, I cannot but admire the extraordinary reign of Queen Elizabeth II. I have no doubt that Australia would have become a republic a long time before now if it were not for her.It is difficult to think of anyone in Australia’s history that has been held in such high regard and for such a long period of time. She was adored throughout Australia even before she became our Queen. Five years before her coronation, when she married Prince Philip in November 1947, Australians from all the towns and cities took to the streets in large numbers to celebrate the wedding, which, in the age before TV, was broadcast nationally on radio.

        "description": "Photo by Ed Zurga/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Shawnee Mission East grad tosses goose eggs. Joey Wentz, who graduated from Shawnee Mission East in the Kansas City area tossed 6 2⁄3 innings of shutout ball in a 10-2 blowout win for the Tigers. \nRoyals starter Daniel Lynch has had mixed results over the last month, and after a clean first inning, was rocked in the second in a 31-pitch inning. Eric Haase led off the inning with a home run, followed by two singles. Jeimer Candelario brought them all home with a 445-foot, three-run blast to make it 4-0 Tigers.\nLynch continued he struggles in the fourth when Candelario singled and Riley Greene doubled. Willi Castro grounded out to plate a run and Javier Baez drove home another run on a single to shallow center to make it 6-0. Lynch would leave after just 3 2⁄3 innings, having allowed ten hits and six runs. Candelario would drive home another run on a double in the fifth off Brad Keller to make it 7-0.\nHaase would smack his second home run of the night off Keller in the sixth, and add an RBI double in the eighth off Luke Weaver,  part of a three-RBI night.\nThat would be more offense than Wentz would need, as he was in total command all evening. He retired 20 of the 23 hitters he would face, allowing just one walk and two hits while striking out five. The Royals would must a run in the eighth and another in the ninth off Daniel Norris once the game was already out of reach. Nate Eaton drove home a run and was the only player in the lineup with more than one hit. The Royals managed just three walks and six hits all evening. \nThe Royals fall to 56-83 and will face the Tigers again tomorrow afternoon. The game has been moved up to 3:10 CT due to weather, and fans with tickets can use them for the new time, or can exchange them for another game.",

        "description": "Photo by Bob Levey/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Chas McCormick drove in three runs while Lance McCullers Jr. threw seven good innings. 89 victories! If you play for the Astros and your last name begins with “Mc”, then you probably had a good performance on Friday night in the first contest of a three-game series at Minute Maid Park. Houston took a 4-3 win thanks to Lance McCullers’ longest start of 2022 and a pretty good offensive effort by Chas McCormick.\nLet’s start with the pitching star. McCullers outdueled Michael Lorenzen with seven strong innings of four hits, two earned runs, one walk, and six strikeouts on 105 pitches (67 strikes). He won his third game of the campaign (3-1) and lowered his ERA to 2.20.\nBoth McCullers’ starts in September have come against the Angels, a team against he’s gone 12 2/3 innings of 10 hits and four earned runs along with 13 strikeouts.\nLance’s only mistake came against Mike Trout in the sixth inning. With a man on board, Trout deposited a McCullers pitch over the center-field fence for his 33rd home run of the season.\nIn the bottom of that inning, Jeremy Peña launched his 17th blast of the campaign and first since August 20. Peña’s solo jack was the spark for the Astros lineup and for McCormick, who was ready for a big stage in the seventh inning.\n\n\n\nLa Tormenta. ⛈ pic.twitter.com/noZ9WARgNN— Houston Astros (@astros) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nWith Trey Mancini on board, McCormick swatted a go-ahead homer (13) to leave things 3-2 with two innings more to go. McCormick, who went 2-for-3 with three RBIs, drove in another key run with a bases-loaded walk in the ninth (4-2).\n\n\nChas gets what he Wantz.   pic.twitter.com/drYkbgKlea— Houston Astros (@astros) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nBefore sealing the victory and getting his 26th save of the year, Ryan Pressly made us all feel in danger. Pressly allowed a Taylor Ward solo home run to shrink the lead to only one run (4-3). The Astros’ closer tied his career-high for saves (26) and still have plenty of time to set a new mark or even get to 30.\nOn Saturday, both teams will collide again with Shohei Ohtani on the mound for the Angels and José Urquidy as the starter for the Astros. Good pitching matchup!\nVIDEOS AND BOX SCORE HERE.",

        "description": "Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Swanson, d’Arnaud, Harris II and Grossman all went deep as Atlanta took a half-game lead over New York In a playoff-like atmosphere at T-Mobile Park on Friday night, the Braves rode four home runs and a gutsy pitching performance to a 6-4 win over Robbie Ray and the Mariners.\nWith the win, the Braves have moved one-half game ahead of New York in the NL East Race.\nThe Braves struck quickly in the first as Ronald Acuña singled and Dansby Swanson homered for a 2-0 lead. After a bit of a summer cool down, it seems Dansby may be heating up again for the final month of the regular season.\n\n\nDinger probability =  @LieutenantDans7 | #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/9rWogNglKf— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nSeattle tied things in the bottom of the second with a two-run shot of their own courtesy of Carlos Santana. The ball was flying all night long at T-Mobile Park.\nIn the fourth, Michael Harris II extended his hitting streak to 15 games with a hustle double out of the box. He came around to score on a Robbie Grossman single. Grossman continues to do his job, especially against left-handed pitching.\nThe Braves added on to make it 4-2 in the fifth as Travis d’Arnaud socked a 3-1 fastball just over the wall in right-center. Seattle answered in the bottom half with a two-out, two-strike homer from J.P. Crawford, who smoked a hanging curve from Charlie Morton.\nThe home run barrage continued for Atlanta in the sixth as they got into the Seattle bullpen. Michael Harris went opposite field for a leadoff long ball as his magical rookie campaign continued.\n\n\n   @MoneyyyMikeee | #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/L45m7vknfh— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nTwo batters later, Grossman picked up his third hit of the night with a solo shot of his own to make it 6-3.\n\n\nBlast, man#ForTheA pic.twitter.com/wYCqAzhTpM— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nMorton was fine overall, but he continues to get hurt by the long ball. He’s up to 24 homers surrendered on the season, which is six more than he’s ever surrendered before. He only gave up six hits in total, but half went over the wall. He also walked two and struck out five. Morton’s ERA on the season sits at 4.08.\nThe bullpen trio of A.J. Minter, Raisel Iglesias and Kenley Jansen brought hime the win.\nThe Braves are 87-51. The Mets lost (again) to the Marlins on Friday evening, giving Atlanta a half-game lead in the division for the first time all year.\nThe series continues Saturday night and the pitching matchup should be a dandy with Max Fried set to take on George Kirby, who owns a strong 3.15 ERA / 3.06 FIP / 3.25 xFIP over 20 starts this season. Kirby will be the first right-handed starting pitcher the Braves have seen since last weekend. First pitch is set for 9:10 p.m. ET.",

        "description": "Daniel Palencia | Chloe Trofatter / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  Doubleheader disaster for Iowa and Tennessee, but the Smokies clinched anyway. South Bend and Myrtle Beach both win.  Not a good day on the field for the Smokies today, but nonetheless:\n\n\nThe Tennessee Smokies have clinched a playoff berth for the first time since 2013!! See you on September 20 at Smokies Stadium for Game One of the playoffs. pic.twitter.com/Riw8aBN06f— Tennessee Smokies (@smokiesbaseball) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Smokies clinched a playoff berth when Rocket City beat Montgomery 8-6 to eliminate Birmingham from winning the second half. The Cubs will either qualify as the second-half champions or, more likely, as the team with the second-best overall record in the division after Rocket City wins both halves. \nIt is the first time the Smokies have qualified for the postseason since 2013.\nIowa Cubs\nThe Iowa Cubs were swept in a doubleheader by the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp (Marlins), 16-0 and 3-1. \nNothing went right for Iowa in game one, which was the continuation of a game that started yesterday but did not get out of the first inning. Starter Matt Swarmer got the loss after allowing four runs on seven hits in four innings. One of those hits was a two-run home run. Swarmer walked one and struck out four.\nRight fielder Jared Young went 1 for 2 with a double and two walks.\nIowa only had four hits in game one and they managed to hit into a triple play.\n\n\nIT'S A TRIPLE PLAY! pic.twitter.com/DxsWUyQPr1— Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp (@JaxShrimp) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nWyatt Short turned in another good start for Iowa in game two, allowing just one run on six hits over five innings. Short walked two and struck out four.\nWillians Astudillo hit a walk-off two-run bomb with two out in the seventh inning off of Brendon Little. Little had pitched 1.2 innings and gave up the two runs on just the one big hit and one walk. He struck out two.\nFirst baseman Matt Mervis went 2 for 3 with a double. \nShortstop Luis Vazquez was 2 for 2. \nCatcher John Hicks scored Iowa’s only run of the doubleheader in the fourth inning. After reaching on a fielder’s choice, Hicks went to second on a wild pitch. He then stole third base and scored on a second wild pitch. Hicks went 0 for 3. \nTennessee Smokies\nThe Tennessee Smokies dropped a doubleheader to the Pensacola Blue Wahoos (Marlins), 5-4 and 12-7.\nJordan Wicks turned in another impressive start for the Smokies in game one. He did not allow a run and gave up just one hit over four innings. Wicks struck out five and walked just one. He did hit one batter. \nTaking out one disastrous outing on August 20 when Wicks got rocked for six runs, five earned, over just one inning, Wicks has allowed just one total run over his past five starts and twenty innings. (Of course, that one outing in the middle there makes his overall numbers look worse.)\nThe bullpen let the Smokies down in game one. Samuel Reyes gave up three runs over two-thirds of an inning. Jarod Wright later took the loss after giving up a two-run home run in the top of the ninth. Wright’s final line was two runs on one hit and three walks over 2.1 innings. Wright also hit one batter. He struck out no one.\nThe Smokies only had three hits in game one, but one of them was a three-run home run by DH Jake Washer. Washer now has 16 home runs this year and two with the Smokies. He was 1 for 3. \nLeft fielder Nelson Maldonado was 1 for 2 with a run scored in game one. But he was also hit in the hand with a pitch in this game and ended up leaving the game after the half inning. He did stay in and run the bases after getting hit and stole second base.\nWasher’s home run.\n\n\nJAKE WASHER TIES IT UP WITH A 3-RUN HOMER!!! pic.twitter.com/v16IO0izlQ— Tennessee Smokies (@smokiesbaseball) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\nDalton Stambaugh started game two for the Smokies and was knocked around for five runs on eight hits over 4.1 innings. Stambaugh walked one and struck out one.\nThe Smokies bullpen in game two wasn’t any better and Ben Hecht got the loss after allowing five runs on one hit over just one inning of work. As you can probably guess, Hecht walked three and hit a batter. He did not strike anyone out.\nLeft fielder Cole Roederer hit two two-run home runs in game two. Roederer first one came in the second inning and the second one in the seventh. Roederer has six home runs this year and five with Tennessee. He was 2 for 4 in game two.\nDH Miguel Amaya connected for a solo home run in the third. It was his third Smokies’ home run and fifth overall. Amaya was 1 for 4. \nSecond baseman Chase Strumpf was 2 for 3 with a walk in game two. He scored twice and had an RBI single in the second.\nShortstop Andy Weber was 2 for 4 and scored once.\nFirst baseman Bryce Ball went 2 for 4.\nRoederer’s first home run.\n\n\nCole Roederer hits a 2-run shot! It's 3-2 Smokies in the bottom of the 2nd! pic.twitter.com/I4IDyHLCcW— Tennessee Smokies (@smokiesbaseball) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Smokies got another run in game two on this blooper by Griffin Conine:\n\n\nHey @Jomboy_ and @FoolishBB, not sure who to credit this RBI to, but it's 4-2 Smokies in the bottom of the 2nd! pic.twitter.com/qCoNNWpgtE— Tennessee Smokies (@smokiesbaseball) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nSouth Bend Cubs\nThe South Bend Cubs grilled the Cedar Rapids Kernels (Twins), 4-1.\nDaniel Palencia turned in a nice start, allowing no runs and just one hit over four innings. He struck out five and walked just one.\nThe win went to Joe Nahas in relief. Nahas gave up one run on three hits over 3.2 innings. He had some control issues as he walked four, but six strikeouts helped get him out of trouble.\nRiley Martin went the rest of the way for the save. Martin pitched 1.1 innings and allowed neither a hit nor a run, although he did walk one batter. Martin struck out two.\nJordan Nwogu stayed hot, going 3 for 4 with a walk tonight. Nwogu stole a base and scored one run.\nSecond baseman Fabian Pertuz was 3 for 5 with an RBI.\nThird baseman Luis Verdugo was 2 for 5.\nSouth Bend had 11 hits tonight and all of them were singles. All four of their runs were scored in the sixth inning. \nMyrtle Beach Pelicans\nThe Myrtle Beach Pelicans pan-fried the Carolina Mudcats (Brewers), 10-3.\nDidier Vargas started and got the win with some excellent control. Vargas pitched five scoreless innings even though he allowed five hits. But he did not walk anyone and struck out eight. Vargas threw 52 of his 68 pitches for strikes.\nThe Pelicans opened up a 9-0 lead by scoring in each of the first five innings. \nDH Haydn McGeary opened up the scoring with a three-run home run in the bottom of the first inning. It was McGeary’s first professional home run. He was 1 for 4 with a walk tonight.\nIn the second inning, second baseman Juan Mora made it 6-0 with a three-run home run of his own. It was Mora’s seventh home run on the campaign. Mora was 3 for 5 with two runs scored and three runs driven in.\nLeft fielder Ezequiel Pagan tacked on the tenth run with a solo home run in the tenth. Pagan was 2 for 5 with a double and the home run, which was his 11th this year. \nShortstop Josue Huma was 3 for 5 with a double. He scored twice and had an RBI single in the fifth. \nThird baseman James Triantos went 2 for 5 with a run batted in.\nHighlights:",

        "description": "A Which? survey has found that Wales has the best scenic railway, the Ffestiniog, plus two more in the top 10, which beats Switzerland and NorwayThe train steams across the Cob embankment: on the right are the peaks of Snowdonia and on the left glitter the waters of Tremadoc bay. The smartly painted locomotive, Merddin Emrys, built in 1879, puffs towards the undisputed European capital of scenic railway journeys: Porthmadog. “It’s a stunning panorama,” says local resident David Jones, “The best possible start or finish to any railway journey.” Jones is chair of Great Little Trains of Wales, a group that promotes a dozen heritage lines around the country. It comes as no surprise to him that, according to a new survey by consumer body Which?, Wales is home to three of the 10 most scenic railway lines in Europe. “I think we could have filled the entire top 10,” he says.The survey sampled the opinions of Which? members on aspects of Europe’s most picturesque lines, from views to comfort, cleanliness and value for money. The result is a star-studded array of Europe’s finest, including Switzerland’s spectacular Glacier Express and Norway’s vertiginous Flam Railway, which climbs 867 metres from fjord to mountaintop on one of the steepest standard-gauge tracks ever constructed.

        "description": "The late, great Vin Scully once said: &#8220;You don&#8217;t need an official scorer at Coors Field. You need a certified public accountant.&#8221;\nHe forgot to add a surveyor to track home run distances and a psychologist for the pitchers.\nThere were eight home runs hit in the Rockies&#8217; 13-10 victory over Arizona on a chilly, misty Friday night at Coors. Colorado won the game on Elias Diaz&#8217;s walk-off, three-run homer off lefty Caleb Smith.\nIt was Diaz&#8217;s second homer of the night and the fifth launched by the Rockies. It concluded a career night for Diaz, who hit 4-for-5 with a double and seven RBIs. The catcher, who was not available for comment after the game, set career highs in both hits and RBIs, and it was his first-ever multi-home run game.\nIncluded in the barrage was Colorado first baseman C.J. Cron&#8217;s two-run homer off Keynan Middleton in the fourth inning that traveled an estimated 504 feet, tied for the second-longest homer of the Statcast Era (since 2015). Cron&#8217;s homer trails only Nomar Mazara’s 505-foot blast for Texas on June 21, 2019.\n&#8220;That was pretty cool,&#8221; Cron said. &#8220;I&#8217;m a big dude and I like hitting homers. It was fun to finally hit one &#8230; It&#8217;s been a while since I hit one like that, so I&#8217;ll take it.&#8221;\nAsked if he&#8217;s got all of it, Cron replied: &#8220;I&#8217;ve got a little bit more in the tank. I&#8217;ve got a little bit more. At least one more foot.&#8221;\nCron&#8217;s titanic homer, which flew over the left-field concourse and possibly cleared the Toyota Tundra truck perched on a platform, tied Giancarlo Stanton&#8217;s blast as the longest in Coors Field history. Stanton, playing for Miami at the time, hit his homer on Aug. 6, 2016, in the fifth inning off Chad Bettis.\nManager Bud Black has been waiting for the Rockies&#8217; to unleash their power all season.  He&#8217;s seen it show up lately. The Rockies have homered 12 times through four games of the current homestand after hitting just four through their previous 10-game road trip. Colorado&#8217;s nine extra-base hits, including four doubles, were its most in a game this season.\n&#8220;I don&#8217;t think the hitting coaches or I can put a finger on it,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;The power is in there, right? We&#8217;ve talked about it. The power is in the track record of a lot of these guys and now it&#8217;s starting to show up.&#8221;\nOn the strength of solo home runs by Ryan McMahon in the first and fourth, a two-run blast by Diaz in the second, and Cron&#8217;s monster shot, the Rockies led 8-1 entering the fifth inning. But then the Diamondbacks lit up starter German Marquez and reliever Austin Gomber, scoring nine runs on six hits to take a 10-8 lead.\nMarquez, who appeared to be back on track recently, melted down. He served up a leadoff homer to Corbin Carroll, gave up three singles, hit No. 9 hitter Geraldo Perdomo, and walked two, including issuing a free pass to Ketel Marte to force in a run.\n&#8220;I kind of got lost and I couldn&#8217;t find the zone,&#8221; Marquez said. &#8220;It was just one inning.&#8221;\nGomber came on with the bases loaded and saw Daulton Varshow hit Gomber&#8217;s first-pitch slider over the right-center field wall for a grand slam.\nMarquez was excellent in his last two starts against the Mets and the Reds, but both of those games were on the road. Coors Field has eaten him alive this season. He has a 6.78 ERA with 19 homers given up in 15 starts in LoDo.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tProgressive catching guru Jerry Weinstein one of Rockies&#8217; hidden treasures: &#8220;He&#8217;s a hard (blank), but in the very best way&#8221;\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tC.J.

Will the Queen’s death change Meghan and Harry’s new chapter?Lois Beckett writes:The couple live in the celebrity enclave of Montecito, in a mansion reportedly purchased for $14.65m and have started Archewell, a combination of nonprofit and for-profit ventures that aims to “unleash the power of compassion to drive systemic cultural change”.In a move that echoes the post-White House ambitions of Barack and Michelle Obama, the pair signed a reported $100m, multi-year deal with Netflix to produce TV shows, films and children’s programs. Meghan launched a Spotify podcast Archetypes, featuring interviews with American celebrity royalty such as Serena Williams, Mariah Carey and Mindy Kaling.The duo is engaged in several humanitarian organizations, including Harry’s Invictus games, and frequently speak out on public issues…More scrutiny of Windsor family dynamics and the role these two royal dissenters might play in the reign of Harry’s 73-year-old father, Charles III, is likely, especially given the anticipated release of Harry’s memoir, which is expected to delve into the aftermath of Princess Diana’s death, and Harry and Meghan’s life in the UK before their departure to California.

        "description": "A Which? survey has found that Wales has the best scenic railway, the Ffestiniog, plus two more in the top 10, which beats Switzerland and NorwayThe train steams across the Cob embankment: on the right are the peaks of Snowdonia and on the left glitter the waters of Tremadoc bay. The smartly painted locomotive, Merddin Emrys, built in 1879, puffs towards the undisputed European capital of scenic railway journeys: Porthmadog. “It’s a stunning panorama,” says local resident David Jones, “The best possible start or finish to any railway journey.” Jones is chair of Great Little Trains of Wales, a group that promotes a dozen heritage lines around the country. It comes as no surprise to him that, according to a new survey by consumer body Which?, Wales is home to three of the 10 most scenic railway lines in Europe. “I think we could have filled the entire top 10,” he says.The survey sampled the opinions of Which? members on aspects of Europe’s most picturesque lines, from views to comfort, cleanliness and value for money. The result is a star-studded array of Europe’s finest, including Switzerland’s spectacular Glacier Express and Norway’s vertiginous Flam Railway, which climbs 867 metres from fjord to mountaintop on one of the steepest standard-gauge tracks ever constructed.

There are buzzards and deer, too. Under brilliant blue skies we surge into a land bathed in history and intrigue.I’m back on the Borders Railway for the first time since September 2015, when I joined the first passenger train to run on the reopened Borders line in almost half a century.

        "description": "Bruce Kluckhohn-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Oscar Gonzalez homered twice for the first time in his career The Guardians built a 7-0 lead Friday night, backed by a pair of home runs from Oscar Gonzalez, and Cleveland needed all seven of those runs to escape with a narrow 7-6 victory as the Minnesota Twins mounted a furious comeback over the final five frames.\nTwins starting pitcher Dylan Bundy was exactly what the doctor ordered for the Guardians. After Amed Rosario and José Ramírez reached on back-to-back infield singles with one out in the first inning, Josh Naylor’s RBI single scored Rosario to give Cleveland the early lead. But it was Oscar Gonzalez who broke the game open with a laser shot to the stands in left field, homering off an 0-2 slider to make it a 4-0 score in favor of the Guardians.\nBut Gonzalez wasn’t done with Bundy. After Austin Hedges homered to lead off the fourth inning, Gonzalez crushed a two-run shot off another slider in the fifth inning, giving Cleveland a commanding 7-0 lead. Unfortunately, that lead became less commanding as the game progressed.\n\n\nEncore, do you want more?#ForTheLand pic.twitter.com/BKK3VCK0r1— Cleveland Guardians (@CleGuardians) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nEven though the Guardians gifted him a 4-0 lead before he could even throw a pitch, Cal Quantrill rarely looked comfortable on the mound. There was a lot of traffic on the basepaths, though Quantrill wasn’t entirely to blame for that, as his infield defense frequently failed him. He battled through five innings, giving up nine hits, one walk, and two runs, only one of which was earned.\nQuantrill had two runners on and no one out in the both the second and the fourth inning, but kept the Twins off the board both times. He ran out of magic with runners on first and second and one out in the fifth inning. Jose Miranda’s RBI single broke up the shutout. Quantrill managed to strike out Nick Gordon, needing only to retire Gio Urshela to escape without further damage. Urshela hit a sharp grounder to Ramírez at third, but his throw to second was off the mark and Andres Gimenez couldn’t get a glove on it. A run scored on the error and everyone else was safe.\nEnyel De Los Santos took over for Quantrill in the sixth inning and recorded two quick outs before walking Sandy Leon. Unfortunately, that walk allowed the Twins to turn the lineup over and Luis Arraez took advantage, lining a double into the gap in right-center. Had it been anyone but Leon on first base, a run would have scored. De Los Santos managed to get two strikes on Carlos Correa before giving up a sharp grounder that slipped past a diving Josh Naylor. Leon scored and Oscar Gonzalez launched a throw home to try and catch Arraez, but the throw was off target. Arraez scored and suddenly Cleveland’s lead was cut to 7-4.\nNick Sandlin got the final out of the sixth inning before giving way to Trevor Stephan, who pitched a scoreless seventh. In the eighth inning, James Karinchak allowed a one-out single to pinch-hitter Kyle Garlick to bring Arraez to the plate. During the middle of the at-bat, Twins manager Rocco Baldelli asked the umpires to check Karinchak for foreign substances, which led to the bizarre scene of the home plate umpire running his hands through Karinchak’s hair. The umpire cleared Karinchak, who got Arraez to fly out, bringing Correa to the plate with two outs.\nUnfortunately, Karinchak hung a curveball to Correa, who deposited it into the seats in left field to make it a one-run game. It snapped his streak of 24.2 scoreless innings, dating back to July 6.\nThankfully, Emmanuel Clase bounced back from Wednesday night’s rough outing and struck out a pair in a scoreless ninth inning to close it out for the Guardians.",

Deyni Olivero was decent, allowing 3 runs in 5 2⁄3 innings with 1 walk and 4 strikeouts. Camden Duzenack’s 2-run homer in the 7th gave the Aces a 4-3 lead, which Blake Rogers and Caleb Baragar were unable to hold. The game went into the 10th, in which a double play ended Reno’s scoring chance and the Bees walked it off on a sacrifice bunt and sacrifice fly off J.B. Wendelken.\nAA: Amarillo Sod Poodles 6, Arkansas Travelers 10\nBox Score\nFrom the very first hitter, Slade Cecconi knew he was in for a rough start. Cecconi allowed 7 runs on 10 hits with 3 of them leaving the park with 1 walk and 6 strikeouts. 5 of those runs scored in the 5th inning. The Sod Poodles made a charge to get themselves back in the game, scoring 6 times between the 4th and 5th inning to make it a 1-run game. Deyvison De Los Santos and Blaze Alexander both had 2-hit games, with the former scoring twice and the latter driving in 2. Andrew Saalfrank couldn’t do enough to keep Amarillo in the game, coughing up 3 runs in 1 1⁄3 innings.\nHigh-A: Hillsboro Hops 4, Everett AquaSox 2\nBox Score\nA solid pitching night for Hillsboro made a 4-run 7th inning stand. Yilber Diaz struck out 7 in 4 scoreless innings to set the tone for the night. Collin Sullivan allowed a solo home run in each of the 2 innings he pitched, but became in line for the win when Hillsboro took the lead. Adrian Del Castillo’s bases-clearing double gave the Hops a 3-2 lead and Neyfy Castillo  snuck a ground ball through the left side to plate Del Castillo. Dillon Larsen and Christian Montes De Oca held the lead, the latter picking up an impressive 5-out save with 3 strikeouts.\nLow-A: Visalia Rawhide 9, Inland Empire 66ers 8 (F/10)\nBox Score\nVisalia blew two separate leads, but still found a way to win it in the 10th thanks to Juan Corniel’s walkoff fielder’s choice. Visalia took a big lead in the 2nd inning, scoring 5 times thanks to some big hits from Oscar Santos, Manuel Peña, and Ivan Melendez. Jose Cabrera threw a quality start, holding the 66ers to 3 runs in 6 innings and struck out 6. The bullpen blew a pair of two-run leads, with Landon Green and Luis Tejeda combining to give up 5 runs and record only 5 outs. Alfred Morillo restored order, striking out 6 of the 7 hitters he faced, including the side in the top of the 10th to set up the walk-off bid. Two intentional walks sandwiching a wild pitch loaded the bases with 1 out with Corniel hitting a grounder to second. The 66ers could not turn two, allowing the winning run to cross the plate.",

        "description": "Decided to wing it and not take notes on tonight’s game. Mistakes were made. I must say that it feels great to be back, but what in the world was I thinking when I agreed to a Coors Field recap? On top of that, I also thought it would be a great idea to not take notes during tonight. Perhaps that saved me the frustration of having a scorecard that looks like the one Jack texted to me?\n\nThis game was about as bipolar as the Colorado weather. Yesterday, they were somewhere in the 90’s and by game time today it was in the mid 50’s with light showers. A sign of things to come. German Marquez took the mound for the Colorado Rockies and he is typically a challenging opponent for Arizona. Marquez had a career 3.88 ERA against the Snakes coming into the game with a 6-6 record in 21 starts. Through four innings tonight he was on that same trajectory before getting rocked in the fifth. \n\nJake McCarthy scored the first run of the game on a solo home run to right center field with two outs. That blast extended McCarthy’s hitting streak to six games, and he now has four home runs in his last nine games along with a cool .823 OPS on the season. \n\nColorado wasted no time tying the game up on a solo shot against Arizona starter Zach Davies in the bottom of the first from lead off man Ryan McMahon. Those two first inning homers represented the first of eight home runs combined by Colorado and Arizona in the game, and so goes Coors Field. Colorado broke the tie in the following inning on a two run home run from Elias Diaz, the first of his two on the evening. Davies’s’s’s’s’s outing would not last beyond the fourth inning as the Rockies chased him by scoring an additional five runs in that frame. Randal Grichuk got it started with a single, and a walk by Michael Toglia put runners on first and second with no outs. Elias Diaz singled him home making the score four -to-one, but Alan Trejo hit into a double play that the D’backs gladly traded for an additional run. Unfortunately for Davies and Arizona, that would not be the end of the scoring. Ryan McMahon ended Zach’s outing with his second solo home run of the evening. Kenyan Middleton came on in relief could not provide a clean outing and surrendered a massive two run home run to C.J. Cron giving Colorado an eight-to-one lead.\n\nAs quickly as that lead appeared, it evaporated faster than a storm cloud in an Arizona summer in the very next inning. Corbin Carroll began the top of the fifth with his second career MLB home run. Marquez completely imploded after that with the following: walk, single, hit by pitch, single, walk, single, single. When he was finally lifted from the game, Arizona made the score six-to-eight and had the bases loaded with no outs. Bud Black sprinted out to the mound to replace Marquez with Austin Gomber. He immediately allowed a grand slam to Dalton Varsho, and just like the Arizona had come back from being down by seven runs to lead by a score of ten-to-eight. Coors Field. Once the bases were clear, Gomber retired the next three batters in order to end the inning.\n\nIf you thought Arizona was going to maintain that lead for the remainder of the game, well then you just have not watched a baseball game in Colorado ever. The Rockies tied the game with a series of doubles in the sixth and seventh innings by Alan Trejo, Yonathan Daza, and Elias Diaz. Those two baggers came off of Kevin Ginkel, Kyle Nelson, and Reyes Moronta. Caleb Smith pitched a clean inning for Arizona in the eighth, and because the score was tied going into the bottom of the ninth Lovullo ran him out again.\n\nSmith first walked Charlie Blackmon to start the bottom of the ninth. Blackmon, not being as quick as he once was, was replaced on the bases by Garrett Hampson. After Elehuris Montero popped up for the first out, Hampson was caught trying to steal second (after replay challenge by Arizona) for the second out of the inning. Arizona was one out away from pushing the game to extra innings, but the Rockies had other plans. A Randal Grichuk walk and Michael Toglia single put runners at the corners with two outs. Elias Diaz, already with three hits and four RBI’s in the game as the #8 hitter, hammered a 2-1 slider from Caleb over wall in left center for a walk off 13-to-10 victory.\n  \n        \n      FanGraphs\n      09/09/22 D’backs (10) @ Rockies (13)",

        "description": "Oscar Gonzalez had a great night. Unfortunately there are no photos later than this, from the 7-0 lead. That live photo access ain’t what it used to be, and it is late.  | Bruce Kluckhohn-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  After falling behind 0-7, Minnesota made this interesting... but the better team won. OK, straight quickie recap version:\nAfter some unlucky bounces in the first inning, Dylan Bundy tried too hard to minimize the damage in a “crucial division race” and got bombed. I don’t think it is a crucial division race; I think the teams were evenly, slightly above-average for most of the year and Minnesota is just too injured right now.\nIn any case, after Cleveland built a large lead, they started playing the kind of defense that slightly-above-average teams will play if they think they’ve got a laugher on their hands. This lousy defense, and some more hitting by the very hot Carlos Correa, made it a close game.\nBut despite knocking around usually-good Guardians relievers Enyel De Los Santos and James Karinchak to make this an almost-comeback, Emmanuel Clase did what he does and stopped the swinging-too-hard Urshela &amp; Sanchez. When Jake Cave came up as the last chance, you kinda wished the fans who’d been there for five hours could get a statistical anomaly. It was not to be.\nIn the interest of full disclosure, though, here’s my inning-by-inning notes, only corrected for typos:\n1: Hey, this is exciting! I don’t have cable, so it’s been years since I could watch an important late-season Twins game on TV. Granted, it’s somewhat annoying Apple TV, but still...\nRight there, that’s what you don’t quite get on radio. LF Nick Gordon runs about five hundred miles to make a sliding foul-ball catch for the first out. It’s a terrific play. Then, on an Amed Rosario grounder way into the hole, Carlos Correa shows his range by getting to it and his experience by not stupidly trying to throw it. An easy double-play ball hit by Jose Ramirez bounces off Dylan Bundy’s left heel, and everybody’s safe.\nOh yeah and then Bundy throws some poorly located breaking stuff and there’s a single and a Dong and this game is almost certainly already over. Watching the TV has just lost its magic appeal.\nFour Twins bat and only Jose Miranda doesn’t swing at every bad pitch. He doubles with two outs. Nick Gordon swings at the first bad pitch. Guardians 4-0\n2: Bundy gets out of a second-and-third, two out situation (caused by Nick Gordon trying to quickly hit the cutoff man rather than take an extra second to aim directly at 2B).\nThe Twins get a Gio Urshela single and Gary Sanchez walk. Then (after the obligatory Jake Kave K), MLB’s stupid replay system kills them. On a Gilberto Celestino dribbler to the mound, Cal Quantrill dumbly doesn’t take the easy out at first. He instead “opted for a weird back-foot throw” (as Brandon puts it on the GT) and it short-hops 2B Andres Gimenez. Gimenez juggles it between his glove hand, free hand, leg and foot and by the time he actually gets a grip on the ball, Sanchez is safe standing up.\nThe ump made a great call here. Live, it looked like Sanchez was out easily. In slo-mo, he was clearly safe. The ump got it right.\nBut there’s a replay challenge. And after about 150 seconds, the umps in New York get it wrong.\nI’ve always thought that there should be a 60-second limit on reviews. If it’s close enough to take longer than that to decide, it’s a judgement call anyways, and no more likely to be correct than the original call. This one was called right and reviewed wrong. Then Sandy Leon does not hit because he is not a hitter.\nOh I’m SO HAPPY I have a screen to see this crap\n3: Apple TV is trying WAY too hard to impress us all with its knowledge of probabilities. The best ones, like highlighting spray charts or hot/cold areas in the strike zone, have been around for at least ten years.\nApple has a little number in the bottom-right hand of the screen showing some random probability that may or may not have anything to do with what’s relevant in the game right now. It changes several times during the AB.\nThis is fun when radio announcers mention some odd statistical possibility just to make silly baseball talk. When it’s on, all the time, it’s less charming.\nI’m sure this has NOTHING to do with Apple TV’s relentless promotion of gambling websites, including one that lets people bet on games during the games “all the way to the last out.”\n4: Austin Hedges leads off by donging Bundy, who looks already gassed. He does get a GIDP after another single. Yay him.\nGordon and Urshela single. Sanchez Ks. It’s Jake Cave time! No, it’s not. Celestino can send this to the stars! Nope, dark matter.\nArt Deco Bridge Name over Let’s Include The Two Cities Bloomington Isn’t In Name 5-0\n5: For reasons I won’t get into it’s soon 7-0. I’m going to ignore anything more that happens besides some rare pithy observations I get watching TV.\nOkay, the Twins score some on Butt Defense that is like a Butt Casserole cooked by Butts.\nTV says \"people are on their feet.\" Then the camera cuts to a wide-angle pan. Nobody's on their feet!\nThey're loud, seeing as the crowd still remaining could probably fit into CHS Field. But they are not standing. As to the noise, it is Friday, and there was an hour-plus rain delay, and they don't just sell beer at ballgames anymore. You can buy whiskey and such. If you have entirely too much money. Erie superior to Superior 7-2\n6: Cleveland’s dugout has Dubble Bubble gum in a bucket. They still have Dubble Bubble?\nReminds me of a Metrodome tour ca. 2003 or so. In the Twins dugout, there was a lot of gum on the roof. I guess at one point Doug Mientkiewicz put his gum on the roof when it was his turn to be in the on-deck circle, and he ended up getting a big hit. So he left his gum there for good luck. So other guys started doing it. Ah, baseball.\nI do love Jake Cave’s most excellent salt-and-pepper beard. Because the TV is READING MY MIND, they mention that Cave never spits out his gum after a good AB. \"So, he's on his third or fourth piece tonight.\" Hey, that's mean! Kinda funny, though.\nCorrea gets a hit that Cleveland butts into one more run scoring than should. More Snow Over Colder Temperatures 7-4\n7: In honor of Apple TV, here's some random probabilities I just made up...\nProbability Twins make the playoffs: 2%\nProbable number of games Cleveland wins in the playoffs: 1\nProbability the Falvine take any responsibility for putting together a pitching staff like this every d**n year: -infinity and beyond\nTo his credit, veteran Aaron Sanchez is doing a better job \"eating innings to save the bullpen\" than Bundy did.\nApple TV either separates the ump calling \"strike\" (he does so by grunting \"RIIIIPE\" like a constipated Klingon) into the far left or far right speaker. It's like the effect of early experiments in rock mixing, very \"Sgt. Pepper.\" Well, the Beatles did release their more experimental records on Apple...\n8: Friendly commenter trizongozob expresses vast frustration with how the comment threads are working and bids adieu.\nI've noticed it too. Those things have gotten completely wonky lately.\nIt's as good a time as any to mention that SB seems to be planning another of their Brilliant Corporate Strategy shifts, and they've quietly let several less-trafficked team sites go dark. We are not one of the bigly-trafficked sites.\nIf there were anything I knew beyond that, I'd share it unless asked not to (from loyalty to the siterunners, not SB), but I don't know more and Ben hasn't asked me to keep anything quiet. It just doesn't look good for our little corner of the sandbox over here. (Points to anyone getting that semi-Minnesota reference!)\nSome writers have talked about starting a thing elsewhere (they always have) but the thing is, finding a way to set up a website that has a good live commenting interface is really tricky.\nAnybody who wants to design one for us for free, you'd get a bunch of free writers to boot! Except one writer, whom I will not mention, who needs a heavy supply of frog food for some inscrutable reason involving Terrariums.\nThe ump is checking Cleveland’s pitcher for having gel in his hair. He walks out and lovingly ruffles those locks. I can't tell if he's uncomfortable doing so or thinks \"ah, this is why I love my job.\" Like, that hand so is NOT getting washed until he can get back to the hotel and enjoy that smell in Private Time.\nUm, Correa hits a homer and now the score's... 7-6?\nEnd of notes, I watched the finish and commented on it with the few people left on the thread. I’m too tired to go back and polish these into a coherent account the way I normally would.\nLook, this definitely puts Minnesota in a bad position (Chicago also won). But if they keep it fun as long as possible, isn’t that better than what we expected before the season began?\nStuds of the game: Correa, Miranda, Apple TV production crew for showing Arraez hanging over the edge of the dugout in the 9th with his arm draped around Miranda’s shoulders hoping for more magic that didn’t happen.\nDuds of the game: Bundy, Apple TV production crew for every single one of their awful “3D’ graphics, they weren’t as bad as NFL graphics but they were close\nCOTG goes to everyone who was there for the last few innings, particularly trizonzobob for calling out the crummy bugs in the system now.\nAnd, hey folks, this division is still winnable, right? As long as a team focuses on the positives of tomorrow, rather than the disappointments of yesterday? If only there were a song along those lines...\n\nSaturday’s game will feature Chris Archer and Triston McKenzie at 6:15, catch ya there maybe, but probably not, I’ve got a lot of stuff to get done before the game on Sunday and I was up too late tonight!",

For a start, Venice has the world’s jolliest festival trailer, a gorgeously coloured animation of King Kong, acrobats and flying cowboys, all set to jangling ukulele. It puts you in a joyous mood at the start of every film, although it might not last when you’re confronted by something as brutally bleak as Andrew Dominik’s Blonde. Absolutely the hot ticket in the Venice competition, this is the much-awaited biopic of Marilyn Monroe, as imagined in the novel by Joyce Carol Oates.Or, rather, it’s the story of “Marilyn Monroe”, the alter ego of a young woman named Norma Jeane: an artificial creation that the young star comes to despise, but also becomes addicted to, as she navigates a succession of traumas, starting with her childhood subjection to the volatility of her disturbed mother (Julianne Nicholson). Haunted by the phantom of a never-known father, Norma Jeane looks for “Daddy” in the men she marries – Joe DiMaggio (Bobby Cannavale), Arthur Miller (Adrien Brody) – but only finds happiness of a sort in a sexually intense triangle with the narcissistic sons of Charlie Chaplin and Edward G Robinson.

The birds of prey were at one time extinct across the country, which makes the recent hatching of the two osprey chicks cause for celebration. “It’s such a rare thing,” said Dunstan. “There are only around 30 breeding pairs of ospreys in England, so to have a pair on our land breeding and raising chicks is so exciting.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "They’re cheap and easy to cook. But as demand soars, it seems eggs are becoming luxury items. Plus Felicity Cloake puts regular and posh varieties to a taste testThere are few things on Earth as perfect as an egg. As Vladimir Nabokov wrote in the single most appetising parenthesis in western literature, a soft-boiled egg with buttered toast is “(the most delicious meal known to man)”. With the cost of living crisis worsening, there are few cheaper sources of nutrition, too. The egg is egalitarian and utilitarian. To my mind, there is no reason for Deliveroo to exist when you can prepare a three-egg omelette in 30 seconds.From a farmer’s perspective, eggs are equally miraculous, since they arrive on the production line as neatly and uniformly as Model T Fords – which is far from the case with bacon, tomatoes or milk. “Really, you just need a room, a grader, some hens, and you’re away,” says Paddy Bourns, an organic egg farmer at Cackleberry Farm in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire. “You can sell them anywhere because they’re ready-packed in their shells. You could drive down the road now, pick up some eggs, put them in a box and sell them out of your gate. There are not many products you can do that with.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "These really are different photos of Liam Hendriks profanely exhorting another win home for the White Sox. Sure, every one looks the same. And the cuss words are probably the same. But, trust us, they’re different every time. | Robert Edwards-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Good Guys snag another late-game W on their final attempt to save the season Well folks, they have done it again! The White Sox (71-68) have been on another level over the last week or so, and they continued that into tonight’s win. \nGee ... I can’t seem to quite put my finger on why, but the team has been absolutely raking. They posted 14 runs in the opener against the A’s on Thursday. However, today they couldn’t seem to buy a hit if their lives depended on it. Baseball is weird, so of course they would go scoreless after scoring two touchdowns last night ... well, almost scoreless.\nLucas has struggled throughout the 2022 season, and though he’s shown flashes of his previous ace status, it’s been a grind. Gio immediately gave up a hit to Tony Kemp to begin the game, and Kemp eventually scored after Ramón Laureano grounded out, to knock in the first run of the game. \n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, the South Siders racked up hits for days. Hits for the entire team, the bench, some SSSers in the crowd, a few vendors, and then some. But while in the opener nobody could stop the White Sox from hitting, on Friday nobody could buy them a safety. Journeyman Austin Pruitt shut down a very hot-hitting White Sox offense, starting the game going five innings with no hits. \nIs it weird that I didn’t feel like the Good Guys were totally down and out, even with only four innings left? Compared to how the rest of this season has unfolded, yes, yes it is. \nLucas was able to recover, drawing a double play in the second, and not giving up another hit until the fifth. But Kemp struck again, this time driving in a run, before Sean Murphy could follow suit with a double to center, scoring Kemp. Just like that, it was 3-0, Oakland. It’s going to be one of those games, isn’t it? Giolito still drew six K’s, though his ERA remains troubling, at 5.18.\nThe Athletics continued to cruise through the game, and the recent White Sox hitting suspects were having an off night — except for Eloy Jiménez, who hit his 12th homer of the year to score the first South Side run in the ninth to cut the deficit to two:\n\n\n\n\nSo many things seemed to happen at once: Grandal walked (of course he did), AJ moved some runners, and with two outs Vaughn’s dinky single cut the lead to one, and then Romy stayed hot to tie the game at three on a single to left. \nBless Adam Engel for not being as slow as Yasmani Grandal!\n\n\n\n\nWE ARE TIED 3-3!! \nI could try to pretend I wasn’t having a blast, but I was jumping around my living room, so I would be a lie. Liam Hendriks is warming up in the bullpen, the White Sox are actually battling and having some fun? I was almost genuinely wondering if this was real life!\nElvis Andrus remains our “top deadline acquisition” (ha-ha), and doubled home a couple more to take the lead. Sorry, but I’m not over this thrilling comeback, so we are watching again, together.\n\n\n\n\nHendriks walked the first batter in the ninth, but quickly got out of it with a GIDP and secured the W, delivering the White Sox into sole possession of second place after Minnesota’s loss to Cleveland. \nThis was a refreshing win for the Pale Hose, as we’ve seen them showcase their ability to fight late in games, but we don’t always see them consistently have the confidence to put together the solid at-bats that are needed to come back in a game.\nIf you’ve read any of my previous recaps, you’ll know that writing about a win is a big deal, as the Sox have lost almost twice as often as won when I’m on coverage. But more appropriate to our favorite ball club, we also know that Tony La Russa shouldn’t be allowed back anywhere remotely close to managing this team again. \nIt’s only Oakland, and the “easy” part of the season, but we are within reach of completing this ridiculous season-long comeback, and I'm embarrassed to say I’m enjoying the dang ride.\nLet’s see what tomorrow has in store, shall we?",

        "description": "Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Rare Mookie Betts error cost two runs An unusual 35-minute rain delay in San Diego pushed the start time back of the series opener between the Dodgers and Padres on Friday evening. \nDustin May and Mike Clevinger were both out of the game by the sixth inning, and neither were involved in the decision. The NL rivals went back-and-forth and eventually locked into a 4-4 tie. A rare Mookie Betts fielding error in right field resulted in two runs for the Padres. \nThe Dodgers struck first in San Diego. Freddie Freeman crushed his 18th home run of the season, a 446-ft. to center field, to give the Dodgers a 1-0 lead in the first. \n\n\nCame through drippin'. pic.twitter.com/Ph71i3UofG— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nTrent Grisham took advantage of May’s lack of command in the bottom half of the third and smashed a three-run home run to give the Padres a 3-1 lead. \nThe Dodgers scored twice in the top of the third to tie the game up. Freeman drove in the Dodgers’ second run of the game with a sac fly to make it a one-run game. Mookie Betts scored on a Will Smith swinging bunt single to make it 3-3. Mookie Betts set up the inning when he got hit with a Clevinger four-seamer, a pivotal point in the frame. \nTrayce Thompson swung the pendulum back to the Dodgers’ side with a majestic solo home run off Clevinger in the fourth. It was a sweet moment for Thompson who played with the Padres earlier this season. \n\n\nTrayce being Trayce. pic.twitter.com/3g7Bsdmsyw— Los Angeles Dodgers (@Dodgers) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nMay’s continued poor command and a pair of sloppy errors in the fifth allowed the Padres to tie the game 4-4. Manny Machado scorched a ball into the corner. Betts, an elite outfielder at cutting balls off in the outfield, made a rare two-run error. The ball ricocheted off his ankle and away from him, and that allowed Juan Soto to score all the way from first. A flustered May committed a second error in the frame when he failed to field a Josh Bell comebacker. \nCaleb Ferguson took over for May and pitched a scoreless sixth. Chris Martin allowed a Machado single, his third hit of the night, but nothing else in the seventh. Dave Roberts let Martin go one more at-bat in the eighth, and he struck out Jake Cronenworth. \n\n\nChris Martin has faced 57 batters as a Dodger. He has yet to walk one.— Dodger Insider (@DodgerInsider) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nPhil Bickford was the next arm out of the Dodgers’ bullpen and allowed a two-out single to Wil Myers, but that was all. \nJosh Hader got the ball in the top of the ninth for the Padres and struck out Thompson and Bellinger to send the Dodgers down 1-2-3. Bellinger went 0-for-4 and is now hitting .197 on the season. \nCraig Kimbrel didn’t have Let It Go blaring through the speakers like he does at Dodger Stadium. Nevertheless, the pony-tailed reliever let it go with some great pitching in the bottom of the ninth to preserve the 4-4 tie and push the game to extra innings. \nRoberts had Heath Hembree intentionally walk Machado in the bottom of the 10th. Hembree struck out Bell looking for a big first out. Cronenworth singled to right field to bring home Soto, the placed runner. \nFriday particulars\nWP — Adrian Morejon  (4-0): 1 IP, 0 H, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 16 pitches\nLP — Heath Hembree (3-1): 1 IP, 1 H, 1 ER, 1 BB, 1 K, 7 pitches\nHR — Freddie Freeman (18), Trent Grisham (17), Trayce Thompson (9) \nStolen Base Count: 88\nUp next\nSaturday’s game features a southpaw showdown. Julio Urias (15-7, 2.29 ERA, 185 ERA+) battles Blake Snell (6-8, 3.73 ERA, 12.2K/9). \nFirst pitch from Petco Park is at 6:40 p.m. PT on SportsNet LA (weather permitting).",

        "description": "Translation is the key to magic, as Kuang uses her genre to sharpen a historical investigation into colonisation, learning and powerWelcome to Babel: the great Oxford translation institute in an alternative version of Victorian England, where translators hold the keys to the British empire. Every device and engineering technique there is, from steam trains to the foundations of buildings, relies on silver bars enchanted with “match pairs”; words in two different languages that mean similar things, but with a significant gap between them. The bars create the effect of the difference: feelings, noises, speed, stability, colour, even death. The magic comes from “that sublime, unnameable place where meaning [is] created”.Bright children are taken from all corners of the empire, fluent in Chinese or Arabic, raised in England, and put to work at Babel to translate, thus finding new match pairs and making new magic – only ever used for the benefit of the rich in London, and to the detriment of those the translators must leave behind in their colonised homelands. We follow Robin Swift from his earliest childhood in China, through his time at Babel, and from his hope that translation is a way to bring people together, to the terrible realisation that, in this colonial framework, “an act of translation is an act of betrayal”.

The first image of Queen Elizabeth II that I can remember looking at was her profile on the new decimal coinage we were shown in infant school.

        "description": "Queen Elizabeth’s achievement was to adapt the monarchy to sweeping change without ever letting on what she was doingWhen the future Queen Elizabeth II was born in 1926, her great-great-grandmother, Queen Victoria, had been dead for scarcely a quarter of a century, and it was less than 30 years since the spectacle and splendour of her diamond jubilee. Viewed from the vantage point of 1897 or 1901, the long years of Victoria’s reign had given the British much to feel proud of and be grateful for: constitutional stability, democratic progress and increased prosperity at home, and the extraordinary expansion of the greatest empire that the world had ever known. Small wonder, then, that Queen Victoria gave her name to her age – an age in which everything about Britain and its dominions had seemed to be getting bigger and better and greater and grander.These precedents were much in the mind of the new Queen’s first prime minister, Winston Churchill, when he broadcast in February 1952 on the death of her father, King George VI. For Churchill was a product of the late 19th century, and the last authentically Victorian figure to occupy 10 Downing Street. As he ended his broadcast, he turned from eulogising the late king to acclaiming the new monarch, by linking the last great reign of a female sovereign with the one to come: “I,” he concluded, “whose youth was nurtured in the august, unchallenged, tranquil glow of the Victorian era, may well feel a thrill in invoking once more the prayer and the anthem ‘God save the Queen.’” Continue reading...",

        "description": "Nobel prize winner Orhan Pamuk on Salman Rushdie’s attack, responding to extremism in Turkey – and his new, oddly prophetic, pandemic novelThe Turkish Nobel prize‑winning novelist Orhan Pamuk never sleeps for more than four hours at a time. He likes to read and maybe write a bit when he wakes. So it was the middle of the night when he learned the news about the attack on Salman Rushdie in the US last month. Like Rushdie, who has needed protection since a fatwa was decreed following the publication of The Satanic Verses in 1989, Pamuk has had bodyguards for 15 years, after he made comments about the 1915 mass killings of Armenians and Kurds in an interview in 2005. Pamuk and Rushdie became friends when they were both living in New York in the early 2000s.Earlier that day, I had interviewed Pamuk on Zoom about his new novel, Nights of Plague, set on an imaginary island in the early 20th century, at the end of the Ottoman empire. Does it make him more fearful for himself, I asked in a follow-up call. “I would say cautious is the right word,” he replies carefully. At first, unable to sit in cafes, or stroll about his beloved city of Istanbul alone, he worried that having protection would distance him from the everyday life that is his inspiration. But over the years he has become “quite relaxed about it … I’m used to it.” As he likes to joke: “I used to have three bodyguards, now I have one, which means Turkey is improving.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "The Justice Department and former President Donald Trump presented dueling visions Friday night of the process and personnel for an outside review of documents seized from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate last month as part of an FBI investigation into alleged illegal possession of classified documents.\n\n\n\nProsecutors and lawyers for Trump each presented two options for potential “special master” candidates to U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon, who declared in an order Monday that she plans to appoint a third-party to sift through the seized records and decide what information investigators are entitled to keep.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department proposed Barbara Jones, a former federal judge and Bill Clinton nominee who has filled the same special master role in three of the most politically sensitive investigations in recent years, including probes into Trump lawyers Michael Cohen and Rudy Giuliani.\n\n\n\nProsecutors also offered up former federal appeals court judge Thomas Griffith, a George H.W. Bush appointee who retired in 2020 from the powerful D.C. Circuit.\n\n\n\nTrump, on the other hand, proposed Raymond Dearie, a retired chief federal judge and Ronald Reagan appointee in the Eastern District of New York who also served on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. Dearie, who most notably presided over the corruption cases against FIFA officials, also signed one of the warrants the FBI used to surveil 2016 Trump campaign aide Carter Page.\n\n\n\nTrump’s lawyers also nominated Paul Huck Jr., who appears to have significant ties to figures in Trump’s orbit. The former Jones Day attorney advised Florida Gov. Charlie Crist in 2007-2008, serving in his administration at the same time Trump’s current attorney, Chris Kise, was also advising Crist, who was then a Republican but is now a Democrat. Huck is married to Barbara Lagoa, a federal appeals court judge Trump also considered for the Supreme Court. Lagoa is one of 11 judges on the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals, where a three-judge panel is soon expected to consider DOJ’s appeal of Cannon’s special master order.\n\n\n\nAnother disagreement emerged over the timeline of the special master review. DOJ proposed that the review be completed by Oct. 17, while Trump’s attorneys argued that it would take more than twice as long, requesting 90 days for the process to play out.\n\n\n\nCannon will now consider the proposals, as well as the Justice Department’s broader objections to the special master review before deciding next steps.\n\n\n\nProsecutors have said if she does not act by Thursday on their request to essentially carve-out the potentially classified documents from the special master review, they plan to take their request to the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit. The Justice Department has also asked Cannon to lift the portion of her Monday order that&nbsp;temporarily bars investigators from reviewing documents&nbsp;that contain potential national-security secrets.\n\n\n\nSo far, neither side appears to have formally rejected the other side’s special master candidates, but prosecutors told Cannon that they’d only gotten Trump’s names “shortly after” 6 p.m. Friday.\n\n\n\nThe main sticking point in the special master plans laid out by both sides seems to be the set of roughly 100 documents with classification markings, such as “Top Secret.” In connection with their appeal filed Thursday, prosecutors are asking that the potentially classified records be excluded from the review process the special master would undertake.\n\n\n\nTrump’s attorneys say that material should also be subject to assessment by the special master and they argue that Trump has the right to see and potentially assert executive privilege over any classified records that qualify as presidential records under federal law.\n\n\n\nNotably, in the Friday night filing, Trump’s attorneys once again did not echo Trump’s claim that he had declassified any of the materials he possessed at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nAnother point of disagreement: the special master’s bill. Prosecutors say Trump should bear the entire cost, since he is the one who requested the independent arbiter. Trump’s team wants to go dutch, with each side paying half the bill.\n\n\n\nThe next action in the legal fight is expected Monday morning, when Trump’s attorneys face a deadline to respond to the Justice Department’s request that Cannon exempt the records with classification markings from the special master review. Trump’s lawyers signaled Friday that they plan to oppose such a carve-out.",

        "description": "Michael Magill doesn’t drive his father’s Oldsmobile, to paraphrase that bygone ad slogan.It’s his grandfather’s 1984 4-door Toyota Corolla sedan.You may spot it on the road in the northern suburbs near his home in Blaine, an automotive dinosaur — a light blue, boxy, rusty relic of the Reagan era.Chances are you will hear it first.“I cut the muffler off it and removed all the emissions stuff,” Magill said. The periscope-like tailpipe sticking up from the back bumper is just a novelty. Appearances only. Same with the dead cell phone he has glued to the roof — decidedly the car’s most modern component.“I’ve been pulled over by the cops multiple times,” he said. “They’re like, ‘Do you know you left your phone on your roof?’”A dead cell phone is glued to the top of Michael Magill’s 1984 Toyota Corolla, seen here in Blaine, Minn. on Aug. 18. Magill says he likes fooling people into thinking he forgot his phone on the roof of his car. Ben Hovland | MPR NewsIt’s supposed to be a joke.As many drivers prepare to turn the page to electric propulsion, when artificial intelligence is standard equipment on many new cars and wheel-spinning street racers are the move of the moment, Magill’s decades-old Corolla isn’t vintage or a collector’s item, but an enduring curiosity, now with more than 811,000 miles on it.It still has the original engine and the original transmission. The car pre-dates Magill, who is only 23 years old, but it has been in his family the entire time. His grandfather purchased it from a dealership in Seattle.“It was given to my father in 1991, who gave it to my older brother, and I got it about two months later.”Back in the day, the ‘84 Corolla was hailed for its “economy, practicality, dependability and affordable style,” as Motor Week described it. The model marked the changeover to front-wheel drive for Toyota’s popular Corolla and helped make that a near universal vehicle configuration. It was the shape of the future.Now, Magill’s version can barely hit the speed limit on the freeway. It’s even slower uphill. “Not really more than about 20 miles an hour,” Magill says. “But if you throw it in second gear, it’ll make it.” He’s painted an ironic lightning bolt on the roof and hood.The passing road surface is clearly visible through the passenger-side front footwell. A kind description for the upholstery is tattered. Magill keeps Vise-Grip pliers to roll down the front passenger window, since the hand crank is long lost.But the car is still running.Michael Magill’s 1984 Toyota Corolla features many custom modifications, seen here in Blaine, Minn. on Aug. 18. Some of his updates include a periscope-like tailpipe extension and taped-over wheel wells, which, according to Magill, increase fuel economy.Ben Hovland | MPR NewsMagill’s secret: good luck — the Corolla has never been in a major crash — and regular maintenance. “Oil changes every 3,000 miles, a new clutch every 100,000 miles,” he says.The Corolla is already a minor internet celebrity. It regularly shows up on Minnesota-centric Reddit, and mechanics have been known to post about it when it pulls in for occasional routine maintenance.And it gets a fair amount of attention as he drives it around. “You don’t see a lot of them,” Magill says. “I have a lot of people saying, oh, I used to have one of these … if you grew up in the 80’s, you probably had one of these in your life.”Magill says he wants to keep the car alive and see the odometer turn over that fateful time, back to “0000000,” the million-mile mark.Michael Magill poses in his 1984 Toyota Corolla, seen here in Blaine, Minn. on Aug. 18.Ben Hovland | MPR NewsIt will be a challenge. Parts are almost impossible to find. Manufacturers quit making the headlight bulbs back before the turn of the century, and Magill has scrounged up three spares to keep the car road-legal. As for the rest of its components, junkyards have long scrapped anything remotely compatible with a 1984 Toyota, of any kind.“You can barely find anything stateside,” he says. “But Australia has quite a few parts for this car and engine. Pakistan and Venezuela actually have a pretty good parts supply.”Spare parts or not, Magill, who works at a Coon Rapids box factory, depends on the ride. it’s his main car.“It’s noisy. It’s very slow. But it gets probably 52 miles to the gallon right now. I mean, around town, you can’t get much better than this.”",

        "description": "David Butler II-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Levine hints at Cashman’s future; How Yanks have changed Lou Trivino and Scott Effross’ pitch mix; Sayonara, shift (plus other changes); MLB recognizes MLBPA’s representation of minor leaguers. NJ.com | Mike Rosenstein: When Randy Levine went on Jon Heyman and Joel Sherman’s podcast the other day, the attention-grabbing headlines were the comments the famously, er, outspoken man made about Aaron Judge’s contract status. Flying under the radar, though, were his comments about Brian Cashman, whose contract is up at the end of the season. Though it ultimately comes down to Hal Steinbrenner to make the decision on Cashman’s future, Levine was highly complimentary of the job the incumbent has done and it’s expected that, after 25 straight winning seasons, Cashman will be back for a 26th and beyond. This is, of course, playing fortune-teller a little bit, but if I were a betting man, I’d be on another season with Cashman at the helm. \nFanGraphs | Ben Clemens: It’s not all that uncommon for teams to change a reliever’s pitch mix when they are acquired at the deadline. This year, as we all know, the Yankees acquired both Lou Trivino and Scott Effross at the deadline, and Ben Clemens of FanGraphs fame has dove deep into their pitch mix numbers and extrapolated some conclusions so that we don’t have to! The conclusions? So far, so good for the new men in the ‘pen. \nMLB Trade Rumors | Steve Adams: It’s been a subject of rumors for quite a while, but now it’s official: The shift, at least as we’ve come to know it, will be banned in 2023. That means there must be two defenders on each side of second base when the pitch is released, all infielders must have both feet within the boundary of the infield, and there is to be no switching sides amongst infielders. Along with these defensive restrictions, bases will be bigger and a pitch clock will be introduced. All of these measures are being put in place to hopefully increase the pace of play, increase action, and, at least in the case of bigger bases, reduce injury potential. \nMLB Trade Rumors | Steve Adams &amp; Anthony Franco: Though this isn’t necessarily Yankees news, per se, and doesn’t pertain to the majors, the news that MLB will voluntarily recognize  the MLBPA’s representation of minor leaguers has the potential to cause ripple effects across the game. This is fantastic news for minor leaguers who have historically been neglected when it comes to collective bargaining, and could potentially help to pave the way for an improved situation for minor league players. \nIn addition to all of this, Jose Trevino was also placed on the paternity list and Ben Rortvedt was called up from Triple-A:\n\n\nPrior to tonight’s game, the Yankees made the following roster moves:• Placed C Jose Trevino on the paternity list.• Recalled C Ben Rortvedt (#38) from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre.— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\nAaron Boone also provided a couple updates on absent members of the roster before Friday night’s game:\n\n\nJosh Donaldson is still on track to return from the paternity list tomorrow, per Aaron Boone. “We’re looking forward to getting him back. We need him to be a big part of our lineup.”— Max Goodman (@MaxTGoodman) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nAaron Boone says he thinks Bader will be headed to Double-A Somerset for rehab and will play at least a week of games. Subject to change, of course. https://t.co/T43wWy2HUb— Max Goodman (@MaxTGoodman) September 9, 2022",

I’m not one for goodbyes at the best of times, so happily this means I never really have to part with my favourite fruit and vegetables; instead, I get to enjoy them in a different guise. Whereas fresh produce needs very little doing to it, the art of preserving lends itself to bigger, louder, funkier flavours. The ingredients get to know each other in whatever controlled environment we’ve put them and, somehow, they transform into wonderfully intense spoonfuls of deliciousness. And that, I’d say, is a definite win. Continue reading...",

That&#8217;s a secret identity that most of us are aware of.\r\nAnd if you&#8217;re up on pop culture, you know that the best Batman was played by the late actor Adam West.\r\nVisit the visual search engine Lexica, though, and you&#8217;ll see that it knows that Adam West was Batman. A search for &#8220;Adam West&#8221; (with no mention of roles, DC comics or secret identities), shows us this:\r\n\r\nIt&#8217;s important to note that none of these are pictures of Adam West, in or out of costume. It simply &#8220;knows&#8221; that Adam West is Bruce Wayne is Batman, and shows us some reconstructed images of Batman from the 1960s. It also knows that we might be looking for Batman, even though it&#8217;s a secret. The new algorithm it&#8217;s using is more than twice as good at figuring out what a picture is a picture of.\r\nWhen a human does something mysterious like this sort of leap, we simply call them smart. It&#8217;s a simple way to describe something we don&#8217;t understand. Complexity and breadth mixing in mysterious ways.\r\nAnd now computers are doing it all the time. (Except when they don&#8217;t&#8211;lots of the searches are not quite ready for the public.)\r\nPS check out this story about West and the phone book.\r\n\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&#160;",

        "description": "The celebrity shoemaker was a fixture of the 90s London scene, then after the collapse of his business – and his mental health – he found salvation from a very unlikely source ...‘This morning in my garden I picked literally kilos of tomatoes. What am I supposed to do with kilos of tomatoes?!” asks Patrick Cox, once one of the most famous shoemakers in the world, as he drives me to his home in Ibiza, which he shares with his beloved pit bull, Titus. “It’s got solar panels and a well. So I’m pretty much completely off grid, which is the dream.”Once, this would have been Cox’s nightmare. “Getting up at 5am to do the gardening? When I was 30, I’d have been like: ‘What the fuck is wrong with you?!’” he says, and makes one of his bend-forward-at-the-belly big laughs. Back in the 90s and early 2000s, Cox, now 59, was shoemaker to the moneyed – through his high-end Patrick Cox line – and the masses, with his cheaper, mega-selling brand Wannabe, whose chunky loafers became the defining footwear of the era. Spindly stilettos by Manolo Blahnik might have made more appearances on Sex and the City, but at their peak Wannabe loafers sold 1m pairs a year. Cox’s handsome, impish face was frequently photographed at all the A-list parties. He was Elizabeth Hurley’s plus-one on the red carpet, best friends with Elton John and David Furnish. “I was the last one every night to hang up my disco shoes,” he says. He wasn’t nicknamed Party Pat by Janet Jackson for nothing. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Peppa Pig, the beloved cartoon pig popular with children, has found a powerful enemy in the right-wing Brothers of Italy (FdI) party. \n\n\n\nThe controversy revolves around a recently aired episode of the British children&#8217;s show that introduces a polar bear named Penny with same-sex parents.\n\n\n\n&#8220;The decision of the authors of the cartoon to include a character with two mothers is unacceptable&#8221; said FdI&#8217;s culture spokesperson Federico Mollicone. &#8220;Political correctness strikes once again, and it&#8217;s our children who pay for it.&#8221;  \n\n\n\nMollicone, who also sits on the parliament&#8217;s broadcasting commission, called on Italy&#8217;s national broadcaster to not air the episode.  \n\n\n\nThe call was picked up by other members of the party, which is the front-runner in the country&#8217;s upcoming elections. \n\n\n\nIsabella Rauti, senator and FdI spokesperson for equal rights, said she hoped that the national broadcaster didn&#8217;t &#8220;act as a megaphone for controversial ideologies.&#8221; And FdI co-founder Fabio Rampelli, vice president of Italy&#8217;s lower house, said that the problem wasn&#8217;t Peppa Pig but the &#8220;indoctrination of children, online and through cartoons.&#8221; \n\n\n\nThe animated pig, once described by former British Prime Minister Boris Johnson as looking &#8220;like a hairdryer,&#8221; isn&#8217;t without its defenders in Italy.\n\n\n\nNicola Fratoianni of the Italian Left party said that LGBT families &#8220;exist and are part of our everyday life. To hide that fact means not living in this world.&#8221;\n\n\n\n&#8220;A new enemy besieges the nation: @peppapig,&#8221; joked Democratic Party parliamentarian Alessandro Zan.",

Nothing gives a greater flavour of the times – or of how much life in Britain has changed since then.“Listened to it all,” Raynham told the chroniclers of Mass Observation, the forerunners of public opinion testing. “I took advantage of the religious part to put the lunch on the table. They loved the lunch – tom [-ato] soup, a big salad with Nut Meat brawn and strawberry blancmange and jam and top of milk.” She went on to spring clean behind the couch: “did room, later crocheted, later rested.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  We head to a Saturday matinee.  Just like all the Yankees’ other short hot streaks in the second half, this most recent one has fizzled out, with the team quickly falling back into a malaise. To some extent, it can’t be helped, with the club currently fielding a pretty solid roster just on the injured list. But they still have to find ways to win games to hold onto the AL East lead, and they simply do not look up to the task at the moment.\nOn the site, Chris discusses why Lucas Luetge deserves some more respect, while Esteban analyzes how the Yankees deploy the sweeper better than any team in baseball. Also, John wonders if there’s any way a certain top shortstop prospect still in the minors could end up helping the Yankees in 2022.\nToday’s Matchup\nNew York Yankees vs. Tampa Bay Rays\nTime: 1:05 p.m. ET\nTV: YES Network, Bally Sports Sun, MLB Network (out-of-market)\nRadio: 1280 WADO, 660/101.9 FM WFAN\nVenue: Yankee Stadium\nFun Questions:\n1. Do the Yankees currently have any true-talent above average hitters in their lineup other than Aaron Judge? (sorry, not exactly a fun question)\n2. Is there any way Gerrit Cole could get back into the AL Cy Young race with a hot finish?",

        "description": "Scores, news, and notes, from around the Detroit Tigers’ farm system for Friday, September 9, 2022. Toledo Mud Hens 3, St. Paul Saints 2 (F/10)(box)\nRicardo Sanchez gave the Hens a strong start in a close game, and the Hens walked it off after a controversial call cost them the game winning run in the ninth.\nSanchez went six innings, allowing just a run in the sixth inning before departing. He allowed just four hits and a walk, striking out four. The Hens scattered a couple hits before breaking through for two runs in the fourth inning. Andre Lipcius came up with a two-run single after Zack Short and Josh Lester led off the inning with walks.\nThe Saints scored off Sanchez in the sixth, and tied the game with a run against Luis Castillo, recently back from a short MLB stint, in the seventh. In the ninth, Lipcius hit what should have been a walkoff double to score Josh Lester. Lester was somehow called out at home on a call that, without the benefit of slow motion review, looks incredibly awful. Angel De Jesus locked down the Saints in the top of the 10th, and it was Jack Lopez coming through with the 10th inning walkoff single to score Lipcius, who started on second base, with the game winner.\n\n\nOhhhh boy. Andre Lipcius hits what *should* be a walk-off double, but Josh Lester is called out at home… pic.twitter.com/nLN9Zd9Xrr— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n Mud Hens Walk-off Win Jack Lopez sneaks this one through the infield to score Andre Lipcius and give Toledo a 3-2 win in the 10th. pic.twitter.com/DNAqP1kEmD— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nLipcius: 2-4, R, 2B, SO\nDavis: 2-3, 2B, BB, SO, CS\nSanchez: 6.0 IP, ER, 4 H, BB, 4 SO\nComing Up Next: RHP Josh Winder (0-0, 3.38 ERA) starts for the Saints on Saturday at 5:05 p.m. EDT. The Hens are yet to announce a starter.\nAltoona Curve 3, Erie SeaWolves 1 (box)\nThe offense just didn’t have it in this one. However, the Bowie Baysox also lost as the two clubs have been knotted up atop the division all week and can’t separate from one another.\nTy Madden got the start in this one and wasn’t very efficient. He lasted just four innings, though the two runs he allowed were both unearned. A Luis Castillo error extended the third inning with two outs, and the Curve broke through. Madden did strike out five on the way and has looked pretty darn good since his promotion to Double-A. \nMeanwhile the offense managed just three hits in this one against a pretty good starting prospect in Quinn Priester in the Pirates’ system. Gage Workman’s fifth inning triple was the only real opportunity they generated all game long. Michael De La Cruz hit a solo shot in the ninth inning to avoid the shutdown after the Curve scored in the top half of the inning. Andrew Magno and Brendan White were good in relief of Madden.\n\n\nGage Workman with a triple to left off the CVS wall in left. pic.twitter.com/gwYgbE7ScM— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\nDe La Cruz: 1-4, R, RBI, HR, BB\nMadden (L, 2-1): 4.0 IP, 2 R, 0 ER, 5 H, BB, 5 SO\nComing Up Next: The test for the offense won’t get any easier against RHP Carmen Mlodzinski (4-8, 4.91 ERA) on Saturday at 4:05 p.m. EDT. The SeaWolves haven’t announced a starter yet. \nWest Michigan Whitecaps 4, Great Lakes Loons 0 (box)\nDesperately needing to win out to have a chance at the second half division title, The offense built a nice early lead and Dylan Smith came up with a superb outing to lead the Whitecaps over the Loons on Friday.\nSmith two-hit the Loons over six innings, walking a pair but striking out six. After some arm fatigue saw his performance suffer in the summer months, it’s good to see him finishing strong. The Tigers pitching factory remains deep, and we’re very interested to see how Smith responds at Double-A next year after showing a lot of positive signs in his first pro season.\nThe offense staked Smith to a four run lead right in the bottom of the first. Danny Serretti and Jace Jung were aboard with singles when Jake Holton singled in Serretti. Izaac Pacheco followed with this blast to make it 4-0. First baseman Justice Bigbie followed with a double, but Austin Murr flew out to end the inning. Bigbie had two doubles and has absolutely mashed over the past week and a half since coming up from Lakeland.\n\n\nStarting out   in the first!  Izaac Pacheco with a 3-run    @ThatDanHasty pic.twitter.com/2sNfPANBVe— West Michigan Whitecaps (@wmwhitecaps) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nSince his call-up to West Michigan on August 25th, Justice Bigbie is batting .368 (8-for-23, 7 games). Here’s his 3rd double since his call-up. @ThatDanHasty on the call. pic.twitter.com/7gMO1uS17c— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\nBigbie: 3-4, 2 2B, SO\nPacheco: 1-4, R, 3 RBI, HR, SO\nSmith (W, 8-6): 6.0 IP, 0 R, 2 H, 2 BB, 6 SO\nComing Up Next: Lake County won on Friday over the TinCaps, so the Whitecaps remain a game behind in the chase with two games left in the season. Good weekend to head out to Comstock Park to see Jackson Jobe (2-0, 0.84 ERA) on Saturday at 6:35 p.m. EDT. The Tigers top prospect will take on RHP Kendall Williams (3-5, 4.38 ERA).\nJupiter Hammerheads 9, Lakeland Flying Tigers 3 (box)\nThe Flying Tigers hung in there until a bullpen meltdown sank their chances in the late innings.\nJake Miller struggled a bit in his start, allowing four runs in 3.1 innings of work. After Miller allowed two in the first, the Flygers came back with two in the second. Dom Johnson walked with one out, and Adinso Reyes doubled. Jose De La Cruz lined a single to center, scoring them both and tying things at two apiece. Johnson led off the fourth with his second pro home run and the Flying Tigers briefly led 3-2, but that would be the high water mark for them. Miller allowed two in the bottom half and was lifted. The Hammerheads never looked back.\nJohnson: 1-3, 2 R, RBI, HR, BB, SO\nReyes: 2-4, R, 2B, 2 SO\nGraham: 2-4, SO\nComing Up Next: First pitch is set for 6:00 p.m. EDT on Saturday in Jupiter.",

        "description": "Brittney Griner is still detained in Russia. The WNBA star has now been imprisoned for 205 long days.In August, Griner was found guilty of drug possession and smuggling for traveling with less than a gram of cannabis oil, and sentenced to nine years in a Russian penal colony. During her trial, lawyers argued that she had a medical note for the cannabis oil, but it did no good. Ironically, this is the same country that found a loophole in the legal system to allow fans attending the 2018 FIFA World Cup to bring cannabis and—check this—even cocaine and heroin into the country, if they provided the proper paperwork.But Griner’s problems are not just in Russia. I have been shocked by Americans’ reactions to Griner’s imprisonment. It is not just that so many Americans aren’t outraged enough. It’s that so many—especially in the right-wing media—are actually celebrating her detainment. They are trying to turn Griner into an enemy and a criminal, in a way that reveals a long-standing animosity toward those who are Black and athletic and who use their platform to speak out against injustice in America.[Jemele Hill: Brittney Griner’s plight says more about America than Russia]“On the bright side, B Griner won’t have to endure our National Anthem for 9 whole years! What a win for her!” the Fox News commentator Tomi Lahren tweeted to her 2 million followers after Griner’s sentence was announced. It was a reference to Griner’s refusal to walk onto the court when the anthem was played—a protest against the killing of Breonna Taylor by Louisville police officers in 2020. Instead of reflecting on what her fellow American citizen would have to endure in a Russian penal colony for charges Lahren herself described as “excessive, overblown, and overkill,” Lahren took the opportunity to taunt and shame Griner for exercising her First Amendment rights.Griner has a history of using her platform to speak on issues affecting people of color. After she told Andscape that “nothing is being done” about Taylor’s death, she began wearing Taylor’s name on the back of her jersey as a tribute. After George Floyd was killed by a police officer two months after Taylor’s death, Griner again refused to take the court while the anthem played.“We should not play the national anthem during our season,” she told a reporter at The Arizona Republic. “I think we should take that much of a stand. I don’t mean that in any disrespect to our country.” She explained that her father had fought in Vietnam and served as a law-enforcement officer for 30 years. “I wanted to be a cop before basketball,” she said. “I do have pride for my country.”But this wasn’t enough for some people. “Perhaps Griner’s time in Russian jail will inspire a newfound gratitude for our government, our national anthem, and our Anglo-American heritage, which provide her the freedoms she now no longer enjoys,” Micah Veillon, then an editorial intern, wrote for The American Conservative.[Tom Nichols: Nine years? Brittney Griner is a political prisoner]Veillon used the word our to mark Griner as an outsider who needs to learn how to be more moral, patriotic—and white. This is about an athlete who has represented her country on the Olympic stage not once but twice, in Rio de Janeiro and Tokyo, bringing home two gold medals. Former President Donald Trump also got in on the Griner-bashing. In an appearance on The Clay Travis &amp; Buck Sexton Show, he called her a “potentially spoiled person … loaded up with drugs.” He said that it would not be worth it for the State Department to try to release a Russian prisoner in exchange for her freedom.This hostility is not a new phenomenon. Black athletes who bridge sports and social justice have always found themselves targeted by right-wing politicians and pundits for voicing dissatisfaction with the status quo. I am reminded of the Fox News host Laura Ingraham’s 2018 diatribe against LeBron James for publicly criticizing Trump. Ingraham said that James should keep politics out of sports and “shut up and dribble.”Because Griner didn’t shut up and dribble, she faces the same backlash. Lahren, Veillon, and others can’t outright attack Griner for her race, so they instead cast her as unpatriotic. To them, Griner is ungrateful and undeserving of freedom and compassion; she isn’t American enough to be saved. This is the politics of dehumanization. A headline in The American Conservative says it all: “Is Brittney Griner Worth It?”Of course she’s worth it. Griner is a human being who deserves to be in the loving arms of her wife and to return to what she loves: to that sheer gracefulness that turns a court and a ball into a wonder in this world. But Griner does not have to be magical or spectacular to be treated with respect. She can criticize her country and belong back on American soil.",

        "description": "Several of the poets appointed by, or inherited by the Queen, had to deal with public mockery. No wonder Philip Larkin turned down the role“Oh, God, the royal poem!” John Betjeman wrote to a friend early in his laureateship. “Send the H[oly] G[host] to help me over that fence. So far no sign: watch and pray.” For a woman who wasn’t noted for a deep interest in literature, the Queen was served by some highly skilled poets laureate. Yet almost all found the job burdensome, and none produced his or her best work while wearing the laurels – certainly nothing to match, say, Tennyson’s Charge of the Light Brigade.The official verse they wrote in some ways mirrors changing attitudes towards the monarchy over the course of Elizabeth II’s long reign. Though, given that most holders of the job have written poems on a wide range of themes – not just to mark royal hatches, matches and dispatches – it’s fair to say that their work reflects broader shifts in social and political concerns....The crown translates a woman to a Queen endless gold, circling itself, an O like a well,This lady whom we crown was bornWhen buds were green upon the thornYou are bridge-builders still.

        "description": "The American ambassador to Belgium is set to decamp to set up shop in the Brussels neighbourhood of Etterbeek, according to local media. \n\n\n\nU.S. authorities have picked the former offices of ING bank for their new location, broadcaster LN24 reports. \n\n\n\nCurrently, the embassy is located in the heart of the city, near the Arts-Loi metro station. But attempts to beef up security have run up against legal problems after complaints from residents, prompting the search for a new address.\n\n\n\nThe embassy in 2016 mooted the idea of a re-location to the suburb of Watermael-Boitsfort, but the idea was eventually shot down. \n\n\n\nThe new site promises to be a huge project, with the new seat bringing the embassy together with the U.S. representation to the EU and NATO. \n\n\n\nLN24 reports that Etterbeek Mayor Vincent De Wolf welcomes the move: “I am delighted that the Americans have chosen our beautiful town to settle in.”\n\n\n\nThe project will see significant redevelopment of the location, with the office building currently standing on the land set to be demolished. Part of the plot will be set aside for the construction of residential housing. \n\n\n\nDe Wolf said that buy-in from local residents is needed for the plan to succeed, given the disruption that NATO and international summits will cause to the area. The project still awaits permitting, but the mayor says he views the arrival of the embassy “with a positive spirit.”",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;A recent protest in San Juan, Puerto Rico made headlines late last month after police officers clashed with demonstrators.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nProtesters gathered outside of the Governor’s Mansion in Old San Juan to protest the island’s contract with LUMA Energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLUMA has overseen Puerto Rico’s energy transmission and distribution since last June.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOver the last 13 months, Puerto Ricans have repeatedly taken to the streets to protest LUMA Energy, the private company that controls the island’s energy transmission and distribution, as frequent blackouts and high energy costs become more burdensome.  \n\n\n\nOne of the most recent demonstrations took place late last month with hundreds of protesters gathering outside of the Governor’s Mansion in Old San Juan demanding that the island’s contract with the private energy company be canceled.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe demonstration took a violent turn after police discharged tear gas into a crowd, clashed with protesters, and appeared to attack a photojournalist covering the gathering.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We share the frustration our customers have over the fragile nature of Puerto Rico’s electric system, which has suffered from years – if not decades of mismanagement and neglect by the prior operator,” a LUMA spokesperson said in an email to Changing America.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The 3,000 men and women of LUMA are determined to rebuild the energy system and in just a little over a year, they have made significant progress in rebuilding, repairing and restoring the grid, including replacing thousands of poles, connecting tens of thousands of customers to solar and improving customer service.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a press conference the day after the protest, Puerto Rico Police Commissioner Antonio Lopez blamed a small group of protesters at the August 25 demonstration for attacking officers with rocks and other objects and promised that the incident with the photojournalist would be investigated.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLUMA has been in Puerto Rico since June of 2021 and was contracted to work with the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA) in managing the island’s power. PREPA is now solely responsible for electricity generation while LUMA oversees transmission and distribution.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe company, which is a consortium between the Canadian company ATCO and Houston-based Quanta Services, was awarded a 15-year-contract to provide electricity and make desperately needed upgrades to the island’s fragile power grid, which was devastated by Hurricane Maria in 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut while LUMA’s presence was meant to help an island still reeling from the aftermath of deadly hurricanes Maria and Irma, it has struggled so far to make life easier for millions of Puerto Ricans, critics say.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo why are people so frustrated with LUMA?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJob losses and alleged worse working conditions&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThousands of PREPA&nbsp;line workers lost their jobs or transferred to other government departments following the LUMA contract.&nbsp;The president of UTIER, the union that represents PREPA workers, told The Washington Post&nbsp;members were offered jobs with LUMA but many opted to not join the private company due to what they considered were poorer working conditions. Many would lose pension benefits, seniority or have their health care plans changed, he told the outlet.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet many of LUMA’s 3,000 workers are former PREPA employees, a LUMA spokesperson told Changing America.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe LUMA spokesperson did confirm that some former PREPA employees who chose to be transferred to another government position were assigned to jobs that they were not qualified for like custodial work at schools.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFrequent (and long) blackouts&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPuerto Rico suffered power outages before LUMA Energy arrived on the scene. And the company was contracted specifically to help fix Puerto Rico’s fragile power grid. But islanders continue to be plagued with power outages and blackouts sometimes lasting for days with the private company at the helm. \n\n\n\nOne particularly bad power outage occurred in the spring. In April, at least 500,000 people on the island were left without electricity after a fire broke out at a main power plant in Guayanilla, a city in the southwest of the island. People were left without electricity for three to five days causing the island’s education department to cancel classes for students and for courts to close. The outage also forced some businesses to close early since they couldn’t afford the cost of running a generator and an intensive care unit at a major hospital in the city of Mayaguez was left without power.  \n\n\n\nA spokesperson from LUMA argued that no true blackout, where 100 percent of the island is in darkness, has occurred under the company’s watch and that the April 6 outage was “irregular.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is an ongoing investigation into what happened at the plant to cause the outage, according to the LUMA spokesperson. They added that outages like what happened in the Costa Sur plant are things that LUMA workers are constantly trying to prevent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEnergy cost hikes&nbsp;\n\n\n\nElectricity bills have repeatedly gone up in Puerto Rico since LUMA arrived. In July, the company announced, on the behalf of PREPA, its seventh consecutive monthly bill increase this year, bumping prices to 34 cents per kilowatt hour. The company did announce its first rate decrease ever last month, a reduction of 2.75 cents per kilowatt hour. But the lower price will only last two months.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIncreases in electricity costs stem from rising fuel prices, a LUMA spokesperson said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn average household consumes 800 kilowatt-hours of electricity a month on the island. And power bills of over $200 a month are a burden for the 43 percent of the island’s 3.2 million residents that live below the poverty line.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. national average for electricity is 14 cents per kilowatt-hour. &nbsp;",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder the 2010 Affordable Care Act, employers are required to provide full coverage for certain preventive services.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, a new ruling out of Texas found coverage of certain services, like pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), violates employers’ rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould this decision be upheld, experts say it will undermine efforts aimed at preventing a myriad of diseases and conditions, including HIV.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAffordable health care in the United States falls far behind other developed nations and is especially unattainable for certain racial minorities and low-income Americans. A new ruling out of Texas could make matters even worse. \n\n\n\nFederal Judge Reed O’Connor struck down Wednesday a key provision of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) that requires employer-sponsored insurance to cover certain preventive services – including pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP), a medication that drastically reduces the likelihood of contracting HIV – to ensure patients would not shoulder out-of-pocket costs.\n\n\n\nThe judge ruled that the provision violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act by requiring people to provide coverage that conflicts with their faith or personal beliefs. The decision, which is expected to be challenged, jeopardizes individual health decisions for the more than 13 million Texans and 150 million Americans overall who have employer-sponsored health insurance.\n\n\n\nHigher costs and added barriers for patients\n\n\n\nEven before Wednesday’s decision, most Americans vulnerable to HIV infection used PrEP at disproportionately low rates. Overall, 25 percent of the 1.2 million people for whom PrEP is recommended were prescribed it in 2020 – that’s up from 3 percent in 2015. And coverage is not equal, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhite Americans make up 66 percent of PrEP coverage, whereas Black Americans comprise 6 percent of coverage and Latino Americans represent 16 percent of coverage. This is despite Black and Latino Americans accounting for 42 and 27 percent of new HIV diagnoses in 2021. White Americans accounted for 26 percent of new HIV diagnoses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men are most at risk for HIV, and this is especially true for Black and Latino communities. HIV also particularly affects Black women, transgender women, and people who inject drugs.\n\n\n\nHeterosexual men made up 7 percent of new HIV diagnoses and heterosexual women accounted for 16 percent in 2019. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew HIV infections are also concentrated in the South, where Americans generally lack affordable access to reproductive health care for HIV and sexually transmitted diseases, birth control, abortion and gender-affirming care. In Texas, more than 22,000 people were prescribed PrEP and more than 123,000 people were at high risk for HIV in 2020.\n\n\n\nA month’s supply of a brand-name PrEP is around $2,000 without insurance, while a generic version costs $30 to $60 per month. Most insurance packages offer the medication for free.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf the ruling is upheld, communities most vulnerable to HIV infections – many of whom already face discrimination and stigma – would be tasked with overcoming another financial barrier to receiving preventative treatment, Perry N. Halkitis, a dean and professor at Rutgers School of Public Health, told Changing America.\n\n\n\nHalkitis is a public health psychologist who has focused most of his work on infectious disease, and is the ​​founder and director of the Center for Health, Identity, Behavior &amp; Prevention Studies at Rutgers University.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The last thing you want to do is put another obstacle in place, and if that other obstacle is now financial, then there is going to be even more of a likelihood that uptake will be decreased,” Halkitis said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFinancial burden on workplaces and the economy\n\n\n\nThe new ruling could make medical costs more expensive for workers, employers and the economy, Halkitis says.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat’s because it is ultimately cheaper to prevent HIV than to treat it, and managing chronic conditions is costlier to employers than preventative services. A company would spend more covering chronic diseases like HIV than it would if it also covered preventative care – something it’s incentivized to do not only to keep costs down but also to ensure the health of their employees.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You take away PrEP then what's going to happen is that a subset of your workplace will become HIV infected,” Halkitis said. “So, in turn, you're going to be paying for lifelong medications. The burden to the economy and to the company is much greater in treating HIV than preventing HIV and that is such a clear argument for PrEP, and such a clear argument that would encourage this organization and this judge to uphold PrEP access.”\n\n\n\nThe Texas decision also risks opening up the door for employers to deny coverage for any preventive service they feel violates their religious beliefs, risking affordable access to screenings for cancer and heart disease, for instance.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“To me, it speaks about the need for a more universal health care system in our country,” Halkitis said. “Where these kinds of decisions by employers are not being made, where my health decisions are being made by me and not by the person that I work for, where people who need jobs can take jobs without fear of repercussion that their employers are going to tell them who to have sex with, how to have sex, and what to do with their bodies.”\n\n\n\nThe future of HIV and preventative care\n\n\n\nWhile it’s unclear if the ruling would be enforced outside of Texas or the employers challenging the ACA provision, it would have strong implications for preventative care of all kinds.\n\n\n\nIn his decision, O’Connor ruled against requiring coverage for other preventative services like screenings for colorectal and other cancers, depression, and hypertension — arguing that the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force’s system for deciding which services should be fully covered was unconstitutional.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOutside of affecting the ACA, the decision from Texas could also impact the country’s goal of eliminating new infections of HIV by the end of the decade.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the lawsuit, Texas employers argued that paying for health plans that cover PrEP can “facilitate or encourage homosexual behaviour,” adding they do not want or need the coverage themselves because they “are in monogamous relationships with their respective spouses\" and “neither they nor any of their family members are engaged in behavior that transmits HIV.\"\n\n\n\nBut access to PrEP does not lead to homosexual behavior, Halkitis noted, likening the argument to those made in the 1990s that claimed putting condoms in schools would promote teenage sex.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This notion that somehow we make somebody gay because we give them a medication that prevents them from becoming sick is perhaps the most ludicrous, anachronistic, homophobic and completely atheocratic way of thinking about sexual identity,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHIV can also be transmitted from positive mothers to their children and through needle sharing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNotably, since the introduction of PrEP and other viral suppressing medications, which make patients unable to transmit the virus, rates of new HIV infections have decreased, especially in high uptake areas like New York.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2019, former President Trump’s administration introduced a plan to eliminate transmission of HIV in the United States by 2030.\n\n\n\nBut if this decision is upheld, it could undermine that mission, while “the goal of having no new HIV infections by 2030 will be completely, completely a non-reality,” Halkitis said. “This is the last thing we need to get this virus under control.”",

        "description": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell sounded a warning to Americans last month as the central bank continues its efforts to combat high prices: The fight against inflation is going to be painful. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation. They will also bring some pain to households and businesses,\" Powell said last month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Fed has hiked interest rates four times this year already in an effort to stanch price increases. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen the Fed raises interest rates, money becomes more expensive to borrow, harder to get, and more worthwhile to save. The goal is to bring down the amount of money consumers and businesses are willing to spend to a level where firms can no longer afford to keep raising prices for their goods and services.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn other words, the Fed wants demand for goods and services to fall closer to supply which has dwindled as a result of obstacles created by the COVID-19 pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and other shocks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn an ideal world, the Fed can raise interest rates gradually enough to bring inflation down without slowing the economy. But economists generally agree that inflation has risen too high for the Fed to bring it down without causing at least some hardship.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We're taking a very distributed pain that’s very unpopular because it touches everybody,” said Claudia Sahm, a former Fed research director, of high inflation, “and there's only a fraction of the country that's gonna pay for it to get it down.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The people who will pay, who feel the pain from the Fed fighting inflation, they are not sitting at the table making the decisions,” she continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere are three ways Americans could feel the squeeze.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWorkers will lose power and protection&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Fed’s rapid rate hikes will bring to an end two years of rapid wage growth, record-breaking job openings and remarkably low layoffs.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. still added 315,000 jobs in August and wages rose 5.2 percent over the past year, but economists expect job growth to slow and the unemployment rate to rise as businesses feel the squeeze of higher rates. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat means many workers who’ve not yet gotten raises won’t get one and may have fewer other employment options with better compensation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Whereas in the past, businesses would quickly lay off excess labor at the first hint of a slowdown in activity, the first post-pandemic response is to reduce hiring,” wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Pantheon, in an analysis last week.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFed officials are hopeful they can slow hiring enough to curb inflation without forcing businesses to layoff employees. Even so, Sahm warned it could take several months for the economy to feel the full weight of the Fed’s actions. The delayed impact means the Fed may move to slow the economy too much and not realize it before it’s too late.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“When inflation comes down, all of us as consumers benefit for sure. But to get that down, some of us as workers will get hurt,” Sahm explained.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSahm added that those most at risk are relatively new hires and groups who often have persistently higher rates of unemployment, including Black Americans, Hispanics, non-college educated workers and those with disabilities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“For Black and brown and low wage workers, the pain will be severe from fighting inflation,” Sahm said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHarder for businesses to grow and expand&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSmall business owners in particular will face serious headwinds as the Fed saps consumer spending from the economy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSlower sales and the higher cost of borrowing money may make it difficult—if not impossible—for some firms to not only invest in their workforce, but their physical operations and the equipment they use.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“While US businesses remain optimistic about the outlook and corporate finances are generally healthy, elevated uncertainty regarding the trajectory of final demand, persistent inflation, market volatility and rising interest rates will lead to more conservative hiring and investment decisions,” Daco wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPart of that is by design, since the Fed wants to reduce the amount of demand for ever-more-expensive goods and services. But smaller firms and those with high debt loads may face steep obstacles without the power and scale of larger businesses to weather the storm.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHigher home payments, slower home sales&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHomeowners and buyers will feel the pain of the Fed’s fight against inflation across the housing market as higher interest rates slow sales and force listing prices down.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Fed’s rate hikes have caused mortgage rates to nearly double over the past 12 months, hitting 5.89 percent for 30-year loans this week, according to Redfin. The steady climb in rates has pushed the average monthly payment on a median-priced home to $2,337, up 40 percent from $1,664 a year earlier.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHomeowners looking to sell will likely find fewer offers and may be forced to bring their asking prices down, a sharp break from more than a decade of interrupted home price growth.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHome-buying interest is down 11 percent over the past 12 months, according to Redfin’s Homebuyer Demand Index, which measures requests for tours and services from the company’s real estate agents. Touring activity as of Sept. 4 was also down 38 percent from the start of the year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The housing market always cools down this time of year, but this year, I expect fall and winter to be especially frigid as sales dry up more than usual,\" said Redfin Chief Economist Daryl Fairweather.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/3636688-democrats-seek-campaign-opportunity-with-obamacare-court-ruling/",
        "description": "Democrats are seizing on a federal judge's ruling against ObamaCare's prevention coverage as an opportunity to campaign on preserving health care just two months before the midterm elections.\n\n\n\nThe ruling on Wednesday by Judge Reed O'Connor in Texas&nbsp;escalates&nbsp;another battle over ObamaCare, and could jeopardize access to preventive care for millions of Americans, including&nbsp;screenings for&nbsp;colorectal and other cancer, depression and hypertension, among many other&nbsp;services.\n\n\n\nRunning on saving the Affordable Care Act (ACA) has proven effective for Democrats in the past:&nbsp;The party used the GOP's attempt to repeal the law in 2017 to mount a successful campaign in 2018 to take control of the House.&nbsp;Earlier this year, the Supreme Court's June decision to overturn Roe v. Wade gave Democrats another health issue with which to galvanize their base — and now it appears they're looking to build on that strategy with O'Connor's ruling.\n\n\n\n\"With the GOP’s utter disdain for our health, safety and freedom, it is only a matter of time that another drug, treatment, vaccine or health service becomes the next target of their extremism,\" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement shortly after the&nbsp;ruling.\n\n\n\nPelosi also indicated that Democrats will look to tie the ruling directly to the GOP's \"extreme MAGA\" agenda and the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This extreme MAGA ruling comes just months after the Republican-controlled Supreme Court discarded precedent and privacy in overturning Roe v. Wade. Since then, House Republicans have plotted an unhinged, dangerous campaign to punish our most personal decisions, from abortion care to birth control and more,\" Pelosi said.\n\n\n\nFrederick Isasi, executive director of the liberal group Families USA, said it's a \"very straight line\" between the Supreme Court's abortion decision and O'Connor's ruling.\n\n\n\n\"I think the big signal here is it's another example ... where a small group of folks who have a very ideological, or hardcore religious perspectives are now changing our laws to restrict the freedom of people and their ability to access health care services,\" Isasi said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile issues like inflation, gas prices and immigration have dominated campaign rhetoric on the GOP side, Democrats have been hammering Republicans on health issues like abortion and the cost of prescription drugs. The decision from O'Connor injects more fuel into&nbsp;the fight.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"As a thirty-five-year ovarian cancer survivor, I am outraged that this judge would take us back to the days before the ACA when individuals suffered pain and even death because coverage for routine cancer screenings were not guaranteed without cost-sharing,\" Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ruling shows \"that conservatives on the bench are on the march to overturn a number of hard won freedoms earned by Americans,\" DeLauro said.\n\n\n\nO'Connor has a history of ruling against ObamaCare, as well as other Democratic policies. In 2018, O'Connor sided with a coalition of GOP state attorneys general and struck down the entire health law as unconstitutional, a decision that was eventually overturned at the Supreme Court in 2020.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration said it was reviewing the ruling, and is expected to appeal. Additional briefings from both sides were due Friday, but O'Connor granted an extension until Sept. 16.\n\n\n\nUnder ObamaCare, any service or drug that gets an “A” or “B” level recommendation from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), a volunteer panel of experts, must automatically be added to a list of free services covered by insurers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere are more than 100 services on the list, and experts say the requirement has led to better health outcomes\n\n\n\nBut O’Connor ruled any services recommended by members of the USPSTF are invalid because they “are unconstitutionally appointed.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ruling also specifically targeted the HIV drug regimen known as preexposure prophylaxis, or PrEP. O'Connor said ObamaCare's requirement that PrEP be fully covered violated the religious freedom of a company owned by Steven Hotze, a well-known Republican donor who has challenged ObamaCare on other occasions.\n\n\n\nHotze argued that being forced to cover PrEP “facilitates and encourages homosexual behavior, intravenous drug use and sexual activity outside of marriage between one man and one woman.\"\n\n\n\nKatie Keith, director of the Health Policy and the Law Initiative at Georgetown University's law school, said O'Connor didn't specify how broad the decision will be. It could apply only to the plaintiffs who filed this lawsuit, or he could strike down the whole ACA provision.\n\n\n\nKeith said it was \"disheartening\" to see another legal challenge to the ACA.\n\n\n\n“We know now that access to all of these incredibly important evidence-based preventive services are at risk,” Keith said. “If we lost these provisions, we would really return to a pre-Affordable Care Act era where each individual employer and insurance company can pick and choose what preventive services they want to cover and whether they can charge you cost sharing.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHealth care has not been a winning campaign topic for Republicans in recent cycles. Since failing to repeal the health law in 2017, the GOP has been largely silent on the topic of ObamaCare.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVulnerable GOP candidates have also lately softened their language on abortion and even tried to scrub references to past comments&nbsp;on the issue&nbsp;from their campaign websites.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIsasi said if Republicans oppose O'Connor's decision, they need to speak up.\n\n\n\n\"We know that this is a judge who's very aligned with Republican politics. He's very ideological. And it's incumbent upon conservative members of the [Republican Party] to speak up and say that is too far,\" Isasi said.&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/3636564-how-a-railroad-strike-could-send-food-prices-soaring/",
        "description": "The nation’s supply of food could take a hit if railroad workers go on strike, driving up prices at the grocery store and limiting U.S. grain exports to countries facing famine.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs soon as next week, 115,000 freight rail workers could walk out if they cannot reach a new contract with railroads, potentially shutting down the national rail network that transports 20 percent of all grain shipments.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile unions say they want to avert a strike, and Congress has the power to block it, the U.S. food sector is rattled by the prospect of a national railroad shutdown in the middle of peak harvest season.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA ‘devastating ripple effect’&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEven a short-lived interruption “would create a devastating ripple effect” on the nation’s fragile supply chains, said Lee Sanders, senior vice president of government relations and public affairs at the American Bakers Association.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Rail-dependent facilities would be unable to receive materials and ingredients, and millions of Americans a day would be unable to receive the baked goods they rely on to feed themselves, their families, and communities,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA railroad shutdown in mid-September would quickly overwhelm grain storage facilities, leaving farmers with few options to store their crops and boosting the chance of spoilage. Many grain processors would shut down, raising the price of bread and other common items, while farmers would be saddled with huge crop quantities and lower commodity prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It's kind of a double whammy when you hit both the beginning and the end of the supply chain,” said Max Fisher, chief economist at the National Grain and Feed Association.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFreight railroads also carry roughly half of fertilizer, and farmers can’t afford delays, according to a Wednesday letter to congressional leaders from The Fertilizer Institute.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If farmers do not receive fertilizer, it results in lower crop yields, higher food prices, and more inflation for consumers,” Corey Rosenbusch, the group’s CEO, told lawmakers.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSoaring food costs — which agricultural groups blame partially on existing railroad disruptions — have hit American families particularly hard. Grocery prices rose 13.1 percent over the last year ending in July, the largest annual increase in more than four decades, according to Labor Department data.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere typically isn’t a backup plan for crops that are transported by rail, particularly when the trucking industry is already struggling to keep pace with demand. The same goes for coal, crude oil, steel, lumber, car parts and other items frequently loaded onto freight trains.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA nationwide railroad work stoppage would cost the U.S. economy more than $2 billion per day and cause shipping containers to stack up at ports, according to estimates from the Association of American Railroads.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGrain exports and global food security&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBecause roughly one-third of U.S. grain exports travel by rail, a work stoppage would also cut down on America’s ability to ship food to foreign nations, particularly those in East Africa and the Middle East that face a&nbsp;risk of famine following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA coalition of food and agricultural groups, including the American Farm Bureau Federation, urged lawmakers on Thursday to block a freight rail strike, warning that it would have “devastating consequences” for global food security.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Congress must be willing to act to ensure our farmers and ranchers can continue to help feed the world,” the groups wrote in a letter to the top lawmakers on transportation committees.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe United Nations estimates that the number of people facing acute food insecurity has risen from 145 million to 345 million since 2019, and 50 million people in 45 countries are nearing famine.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussia blocked off Ukraine’s access to the Black Sea at the onset of the invasion, cutting off nations that rely on Ukraine to provide large shipments of grain and cooking oil.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe warring countries signed a deal to open up Black Sea shipments in July, but Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday criticized the agreement, prompting fears that he could abandon it entirely.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat lies ahead &nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. rail workers could legally strike as soon as Sept. 16 after the White House-appointed Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) released recommendations last month meant to bring railroads and unions closer to a deal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFive unions have reached tentative agreements with railroads on a new contract based on the PEB recommendations, which call for 24 percent raises over five years and back pay but don’t address workers’ concerns about grueling hours and limited time off.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bulk of rail workers belong to unions that haven’t struck a deal. And a recent online survey from grassroots group Railroad Workers United found that more than 9 in 10 railroad workers would vote to reject the PEB recommendations and go on strike.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf workers vote for a strike, Congress would likely intervene to block it. They could then vote to fast-track a new contract. Railroads, retailers, growers and other industries are largely urging lawmakers to simply implement the terms laid out by the PEB.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, some business groups are worried about the prospect of a slow congressional response to a rail walkout, driven either by lawmakers’ inexperience with the issue or political games ahead of the midterms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration, eager to avoid more economic disruption just before November, is pushing unions and railroads to secure an agreement before the issue comes before Congress. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh joined a negotiation session Wednesday before the National Mediation Board.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We are confident the parties will make every effort to negotiate in good faith toward a mutually acceptable solution, and we urge both sides to do so promptly,” a White House official said in an email.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Pennsylvania Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz is going on the offensive against his Democratic rival John Fetterman after weeks of falling victim to Fetterman’s robust digital operation and trailing in the polls.\n\n\n\nThis week marked a shift in Oz’s strategy as his campaign ramped up pressure on Fetterman to participate in televised debates. Meanwhile, a pro-Oz group rolled out an ad targeting Fetterman over a 2013 incident in which he pulled a gun on a Black male jogger he suspected of a crime.\n\n\n\nHis new onslaught against Fetterman come as the environment in Pennsylvania and across the country increasingly favors Senate Democrats, with several election handicappers recently shifting the Keystone State Senate race into the “toss-up” category.\n\n\n\nThe latest Real Clear Politics polling average shows Fetterman leading Oz by 6.5 points, but Oz’s allies say that the Republican will likely close that gap as many candidates do after Labor Day.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s full steam ahead,” said one national Republican operative. “I think Dr. Oz’s shift is just everyone is coalescing around him and Fetterman can no longer hide behind Twitter.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe week’s coverage of the race was largely dominated by the back-and-forth between Oz and Fetterman’s teams over scheduling televised debates ahead of Election Day.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOz has called on Fetterman to participate in a series of debates beginning this month. On Tuesday, the Republican Senate candidate used a joint press conference with retiring Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) to call on the lieutenant governor to debate the celebrity doctor. The following day, Fetterman&nbsp;told Politico in an interview&nbsp;that he is committed to attending one debate against Oz “sometime in the middle to end of October” and on a “major television station” in Pennsylvania.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’re absolutely going to debate Dr. Oz, and that was really always our intent to do that,” Fetterman told the outlet. “It was just simply only ever been about addressing some of the lingering issues of the stroke, the auditory processing, and we’re going to be able to work that out.”\n\n\n\nOz’s allies have framed the interview as a concession from Fetterman after Oz hit him over debate attendance. They also point to the fact that Fetterman was absent from a primary debate that took place in early April.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Before John Fetterman had his stroke he was also scared to debate his opponents, especially in the primaries,” said the national GOP operative.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOz’s allies argue that a debate held during the middle or end of October will be too late for most voters looking to vote early. Fetterman’s allies say that the date works well given that the election is on most voters’ minds by the middle of October, as opposed to a September debate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublicans also point to what they say is a natural advantage for the former TV doctor.\n\n\n\n“He’s got a huge amount of experience on television and that experience is in an interactive setting, so I think he’s used to that,” said Keith Naughton, a Republican strategist with experience working on Pennsylvania campaigns. “The key for him is to have some good practice so that he can handle some of the aggressive questioning that he’s not used to.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats, on the other hand, argue that the Oz camp is essentially using the back-and-forth over the debates as a distraction from what they say are bigger issues with the Republican candidate.\n\n\n\n“It’s important to remember that he’s attempting to dig out of a pretty big hole that he’s in after the summer he had,” said a national Democratic operative. “If any issue has been defining the race it’s been ‘Mehmet Oz is not from Pennsylvania and doesn’t get Pennsylvanians.’”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFetterman’s campaign over the summer launched an aggressive digital campaign painting Oz as out of touch and unfamiliar with the state. In July, they enlisted former “Jersey Shore” cast member Nicole “Snooki” LaValle to highlight the question of Oz’s residency in a campaign video. Fetterman also started a petition last month to add Oz to the New Jersey Hall of Fame. Fetterman and Democrats have also hammered Oz over his properties.\n\n\n\n\"Every week of this campaign has brought fresh revelations about Mehmet Oz that have put him on the defensive, and they’ve all pointed to one conclusion: he’s a fraud, an out-of-touch millionaire who doesn’t understand the concerns of Pennsylvania’s working families,” said Patrick Burgwinkle, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “The only reason he’s running for Senate is to serve himself, and his multi-millionaire friends, and that’s why he’ll be rejected in November.”\n\n\n\nFetterman’s supporters also pointed to an op-ed from the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette’s editorial board on Friday calling on Oz to stop attacking Fetterman over the debates.\n\n\n\n“Now that Mr. Fetterman has thrown down the gauntlet, it’s time for Mr. Oz to call off his attack dogs,”&nbsp;the paper’s editorial board wrote.\n\n\n\nThe op-ed marks a notable change in tone for the publication, which had argued that Oz had “legitimate concerns” about Fetterman’s health amid the debate row.\n\n\n\n“If Mr. Fetterman is not well enough to debate his opponent, that raises serious concerns about his ability to serve as a United States senator,” the piece said.\n\n\n\nWhile plans for a debate have not yet been set in stone, most observers seem to agree that Pennsylvanians shouldn’t count on seeing Fetterman and Oz on a debate stage together more than once.\n\n\n\n“I expected that they’re going to do one and that’s it,” Naughton said.&nbsp;",

This process has as much to do with taking ownership of ideas as it does with apps. Second, we’ll look at how you can organize and link ideas to make them useful to you and direct them at new questions. Third, and maybe most important, we’ll focus on how you get that information back out of your notes and into a form you can use to share your ideas with others.\n\nDan Allosso provides a guide to how to make notes and carve them into ideas. Chris Aldrich has also provided an annotated copy of book to annotate with Hypothesis.The post 📑 How to Make Notes and Write first appeared on Read Write Collect.",

        "description": "From Chineke! to a beguiling Golda Schultz, the Swiss fixture made a bold and varied return, but the Vienna Phil stole the showIn the wanton days when air travel was king, pre-planetary concerns, pre-Covid, one aspect of musical life was a given. Elite orchestras crisscrossed the globe in a ritual dance every summer, looping through each other’s schedules and coming together in the weft of arrival or departure. Edinburgh and the Proms were fixtures, with several leading European venues, among them the annual festival in Lucerne, Switzerland, founded in 1938 and one of the oldest of its kind.This year, if with caution, some still masked, orchestras are travelling once more. Their plans to offset carbon omissions remain vague, but these are hard times and we await patiently. The Lucerne festival – which already has an exemplary sustainability programme – was back to full strength, welcoming the world’s top ensembles and soloists to its many-layered season. Its important contemporary strand featured the British composer Thomas Adès, with the premiere of his festival commission, Air, for violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter. (Further performances for those of us who missed it are scheduled next year for the US, but none as yet for the UK.) Continue reading...",

I appreciate what it’s trying to do, but if you add too much, in an instant, there is no return. This led to my second small-but-illuminating discovery, namely that Marmite makes great stock and, well, here we are. This risotto, contrary to what you might assume, is perfectly gentle (the Marmite is a back note); the party is in the tomato and chilli butter, in which I’ve used my favourite crispy chilli oil to give the cherry tomatoes some fireworks.

        "description": "The slow-cooking financial disaster that has been simmering in Donald Trump’s business Crock-Pot is now coming to a boil. Truth Social — the Twitter knock-off the former president launched six months ago in reaction to Twitter, Facebook, and YouTube’s decision to deplatform him — might reduce itself to the smoke and char of bankruptcy, according to recent business press reports. \nThe swill the site serves attracts only a fraction of what Twitter does. Google has yet to approve downloads of its app from the Play Store over moderation issues, blocking it from 40 percent of the smartphone market. It lost $6.5 million in the first year and seems unable to pay its bills. But worst of all, the merger plan that would give it a stock market listing and the $1.3 billion it hoped to raise has stalled. \nOnce upon a time, Trump fed his 89 million Twitter followers a several-times-a-day mash of insult, provocation and bombast. But he has attracted only an estimated 3.9 million to his Truth Social account, making him one of the biggest social media flops of the decade. Where did the magic go? Why have Trump’s followers forsaken him? Is Truth Social doomed? \nTrump deserves credit for marketing his Twitter account to its Everestian heights. He’s always known how to play to the crowds, titillate them and leave them wanting more. During his first campaign and presidency, even a garden-variety Trump tweet could convulse newsrooms. But that was a function of his front-runner status and later his place in the Oval Office. He drew an enormous audience not because he was Donald Trump tweeting but because he was the tweeting president. The power of the office endowed his tweets with muscle that could move financial markets, bury political careers, inspire death threats against his enemies and make the press snap to attention. But exiled to Mar-a-Lago and denied his social media accounts rendered him just another celebrity squeaking noises from a tiny soapbox. When his profile shrank, he became easier to ignore.Even so, why didn’t the tens of millions of the 89 million who followed him on Twitter or the 74 million who voted for him in 2020 make more of an effort to visit his new address? Blame it on the network effect. If you already have a Twitter account, it takes just a millisecond to click and add another person’s feed to your account. But downloading a new app just to follow a single somebody takes mental energy, especially if there aren’t many other accounts on the app you wish to follow. Trump out of office proved to be as boring as Trump in office was disruptive. Everything we’re learning about Trump’s inability to convene a large-scale audience on Truth Social we learned in miniature from the failure of his mid-2021 blog, which he killed after 29 days. Like most media figures, Trump needs the boost of the network effect provided by Twitter (or CNN or Fox News Channel) to build a mass audience. All by his lonesome, he’s just a political carny on a lightly trafficked midway shouting invitations to his freak show. \n Plenty of Trump’s followers were either agnostic about his tweets or politically hostile to them. Many followed him just to stay in the know or for the hate clicks. \nThis is not to say you can’t build a good business serving mostly Trumpians or mostly conservatives or mostly liberals. But such narrowcasting comes at the expense of winning the largest potential customer base. Twitter wisely places no political litmus tests, real or implied, between aspiring account-holders and an account as long as they promise not to spew bilge from their perch. Everybody is accepted. By appearing exclusionary, Truth Social resigned itself to marginal appeal. \nNothing about Truth Social’s disastrous beginnings should surprise us. Donald Trump has proved himself again and again to be a wreck of an entrepreneur. Steaks, his university, water, an airline, casinos, the USFL, a mortgage company, vodka — the list reads like a guide on how not to succeed in business. Associating Trump with a new venture has become a business death wish. \nTrump is still the frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2024 and could well wind up in the White House (assuming he’s not behind bars). But there’s also evidence that Trump has simply exhausted the Trump meme he invented. Trump’s deranged outrage style once contained real entertainment value — which explains why moderates and liberals followed him on Twitter even if they wouldn’t vote for him. But in his post-presidency and especially in the weeks following the Mar-a-Lago search and investigation, the show has gone stale. Vainly, he has sought to top himself by sharing QAnon-related material on Truth Social, denouncing the FBI like a madman trapped in a bunker, and calling for his reinstatement as the “rightful winner“ of the 2020 election. He’s become a carnival geek biting the heads off of snakes, which can be a fabulous show the first couple of times you see it, but after that, meh. Could today’s Trump devise enough fresh outrage to produce even a brief TikTok? \nAre there any geek shows left? Send updates to&nbsp;Shafer.Politico@gmail.com.

        "description": "“An aggressive push by Republicans to pass hard-line antiabortion measures is faltering in some state legislatures and on Capitol Hill, the latest indication that many Americans are balking at extreme restrictions being imposed since the fall of Roe v. Wade,” the Washington Post reports.\n\n\n\n“In South Carolina, Republicans failed to pass a near-total abortion ban during an extended legislative session Thursday night, unable to agree on whether to include exceptions for rape and incest. In West Virginia, a recent special session over similar legislation ended in gridlock.”\n\n\n\n“At the same time, efforts to advance a strict nationwide ban in Congress have quietly fizzled.”",

        "description": "Dan Brink\n    \n\n  Aaron Judge did what he could to try and carry his team, but again lost some ground in his chase of history. Welcome back to the Aaron Judge Home Run Record Tracker! We’re taking a daily look at where Aaron Judge’s monster season tracks compared to some of the other historic single-season home run leaders in anticipation of Judge potentially joining their ranks. We’ll be going by Team Game because not every player’s seasons were in sync with the calendar days and everyone didn’t play all of the team’s games, which makes this our universal standard. Now, onto Game 139:\nAaron Judge through Game 139 of 2022: 55 HR\nTeam Game 139: 9/9 — 2-for-4, 2 1B, 1 RBI, 2 K\nJust another performance from Judge and the Yankees that feels all too familiar from this second half. Judge does what he can to try and carry this team, and the players around him fail him. He provided half of the team’s offensive output with an RBI single and reached base three times, but the lineup around him once again looked rather listless. Judge and the Yankees will have to regroup quickly ahead of a matinee today against Tampa. \nRoger Maris through Game 139 of 1961: 53 HR\nTeam Game 139: 9/5 — 0-for-4\nJust a clean, old-fashioned Oh-fer for Roger today. No walks, no strikeouts, no times reaching base. Just four balls in play, corralled by the defense for outs. As often seemed to be the case, Mickey Mantle took advantage of his teammates off day to close the gap in the ‘61 home run chase, hitting a solo homer for his 51st of the year.\nBabe Ruth through Game 139 of 1927: 51 HR\nTeam Game 139: 9/11 — 1-for-4, 1 HR, 1 RBI, 1 R\nRuth was really starting his finishing kick here. After notching number 50 yesterday, he moved right on to 51, this one a fourth-inning solo shot off Milt Gaston. Ruth and his teammates couldn’t manage much else that day, though, with the Yankees falling 6-1 to the St. Louis Browns.\nBarry Bonds through Game 139 of 2001: 59 HR\nTeam Game 139: 9/4 — 2-for-2, 1 HR, 1 RBI, 2 R, 2 BB\nPretty close to a vintage game for Bonds. A single, two walks, and his 59th homer of 2001:\n\nThis one came in the seventh off of Miguel Batista, and helped the Giants to a 5-2 win. Bonds didn’t quite get into this dinger the way he did some of his other moonshots, but it all counts the same in the record books.\nMark McGwire through Game 139 of 1998: 57 HR\nTeam Game 139: 9/1 — 3-for-5, 2 HR, 3 RBI, 3 R\nMcGwire was on fire, launching two home runs in consecutive at-bats against the Marlins:\n\nWatch the video of each dinger, and you’ll see they were almost carbon copies of each other, long shots to nearly the exact spot in center field. For the first home run, there was a lone fan that had snuck into the tarped-off center field area to try and secure a long ball. By the second dinger, a small army of fans had assembled to corral a potential dinger. \nSammy Sosa through Game 139 of 1998: 55 HR\nTeam Game 139: 9/1 — 0-for-4, 3 K\nSammy lost some ground here, having entered the night tied with McGwire, but unable to match McGwire’s two-homer game. In fact, this was one of Sosa’s worst games of 1998. Each of his outs either came with runners on or to lead off an inning, meaning that by Win Probability Added, Sosa did more to hurt his team’s chances of winning than any other player in this particular game. The Cubs were able to squeeze this one out, holding off the Reds for a 6-5 win.",

        "description": "Photo by Rich Schultz/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Catch up on all the Mets prospects in yesterday’s minor league action! *All results from games played on September 9, 2022\n\nTriple-A: Syracuse Mets (55-78)\n\nSYRACUSE 8, ROCHESTER 3 (BOX)\nSyracuse got down 2-0 in the first, but immediately rallied back with seven runs over the first third of the game to run away with this one. Mark Vientos had two hits, including his 24th homer of the season, while Travis Jankowski had three steals. Most importantly, Tylor Megill continued his rehab assignment with a perfect inning of work, striking out one.\n\nCF Travis Jankowski: 1-3, R, RBI, 2 BB, 3 SB (12)\n3B Luis Guillorme: 2-3, R, RBI, BB\n2B Gosuke Katoh: 0-1, K\nDH Mark Vientos: 2-5, R, HR (24), RBI, 2 K\n1B Dominic Smith: 0-4, 2 R, BB, K\nRF Daniel Palka: 2-4, R, K\nLF Jake Mangum: 1-3, R, BB, SB (6)\n2B-3B Yolmer Sanchez: 1-3, 2B, 3 RBI, K\nSS JT Riddle: 2-4, R, 2B, RBI\nC Michael Perez: 1-4\nRHP Jesus Vargas: 4.0 IP, 3 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 1 BB, 2 K\n\nREHAB ALERT: RHP Tylor Megill: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K\nLHP Josh Walker: 2.0 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 0 BB, 2 K, W (1-2)\nRHP Yoan Lopez: 2.0 IP, 2 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 3 K\n\n\nDouble-A: Binghamton Rumble Ponies (23-35/51-77)\n\nPORTLAND 11, BINGHAMTON 5 (BOX)\nEvery Rumble Pony that pitched in this one was bad. Garrison Bryant was left in one inning too long and was charged with six runs in the seventh, and both Justin Courtney and Josh Hejka gave up multiple runs in relief. The poor performance on the mound wasted homers from Wyatt Young and Ronny Mauricio, though the rest of the offense didn’t do a whole lot.\n\n2B Wyatt Young: 1-4, R, HR 6), RBI, K\nRF Zach Ashford: 1-4, R\nSS Ronny Mauricio: 2-4, R, HR (25), 2 RBI, K\nLF Carlos Cortes: 0-4, 2 K\nDH Brandon McIlwain: 1-3, R, BB, 2 K\nCF Rowdey Jordan: 2-4, R, 2B\nC Hayden Senger: 1-4, 2 K\n1B Jeremy Vasquez: 2-4, 2 RBI\n3B Nic Gaddis: 0-4, 3 K\nRHP Garrison Bryant: 6.1 IP, 7 H, 6 R, 6 ER, 2 BB, 3 K, L (3-3), E (1)\nRHP Justin Courtney: 0.2 IP, 1 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 2 BB, 2 K, BS (2)\nRHP Josh Hejka: 1.0 IP, 4 H, 3 R, 2 ER, 1 BB, 1 K\n\n\nHigh-A: Brooklyn Cyclones (39-24/70-60)\n\nBROOKLYN 3, WINSTON-SALEM 0 (BOX)\nBrooklyn managed ten hits but strangely not a whole lot of action. Alex Ramirez and Stanley Consuegra each had two hits and a strikeout while Joe Suozzi went deep with the biggest hit of the day. That was more than enough support for Jeffrey Colon and Daison Acosta, who combined to allow only five baserunners and strike out ten.\n\nLF Matt Rudick: 1-5, R, K\nRF Alex Ramirez: 2-4, 2B, RBI, BB, K\n1B JT Schwartz: 0-4, BB, 2 K\n2B Jose Peroza: 2-4, 2B, RBI\nCF Stanley Consuegra: 2-4, K\nC Jose Mena: 0-4, 2 K\n3B William Lugo: 0-4, K\nDH Joe Suozzi: 1-4, R, HR (8), RBI, K\nSS Shervyen Newton: 1-4, R, K\nRHP Jeffrey Colon: 7.0 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 8 K, W (1-0)\nRHP Daison Acosta: 2.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 2 K, S (10)\n\n\nSingle-A: St. Lucie Mets (31-29/71-55)\n\nFORT MYERS 4, ST.

        "description": "I wish my friend Anne Garrels could have lived just a few days longer. She died early last Wednesday, but if she’d held on a few more hours, I like to imagine that she would have been able to enjoy (even while pretending to dismiss) the torrent of admiration from colleagues and listeners for her work as a foreign correspondent with National Public Radio. I wish she’d been able to read the glowing obituary that The New York Times had prepared for her. Couldn’t they have shown it to her on Tuesday, when she was in hospice care, instead of holding it for Thursday’s paper, when she was gone? As usual, the Times kept its finely wrought tribute from the one person it would have meant the most to. I wish she’d known how important she was especially to younger women in journalism—her drive, her honesty, her voice, her wit, her elegance, her courage. Maybe she did know, but I never heard her say so. And now those women can’t tell her.This year I’ve lost several friends and one close family member, and it always seems to go this way.Queen Elizabeth died the day after Annie, and I couldn’t help slightly resenting how quickly Her Majesty’s ascension to immortality intruded on the Garrels minute. At least the Queen got to have her platinum jubilee before she died. She got to stand on the balcony of Buckingham Palace while she was still alive and gaze down and wave to her subjects as they thronged the Queen Victoria Memorial and demonstrated how much they admired and loved her. She got to read the tributes as they poured in from all over the British Commonwealth. She got to bask in the historic achievement of having lasted on the throne for 70 years and done so without complaint.Annie’s achievement was to have risked her life countless times and pushed herself to her limits in the Soviet Union, China, Bosnia, Kosovo, Chechnya, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and, perhaps most significantly, Iraq, in order to convey to her listeners with truthfulness, eloquence, and compassion the all-too-human reality of historic events, especially of war. Between these two accomplished women, it’s hard for me to see why the Queen’s death should matter more.I met Annie in Baghdad early in the war. I didn’t know what I was doing, and she did—better than just about anyone—but she never let this fact disturb our friendship, which crossed the Atlantic and took root and grew in the Berkshire Hills, where she lived with her husband, Vint Lawrence, and where I often visited. No doubt Annie could be sharp-elbowed in the field, but I never felt the slightest poke. It’s strange, but I don’t remember having many conversations about work with her. Journalists, and I’m no exception, are addicted to gossip and tale-telling and invidious comparisons and undying grudges, but there was little of that with Annie. We mostly talked about family, politics, books, gardening, and dogs. My late pug Fred and I once spent a couple of nights with Annie, Vint, and their three big Labs—I needed a place to get some writing done, and they generously gave me a room. One day Fred ate an entire bowl of food meant for those three dogs five times his size. His belly dragged on the wooden floorboards. “Jesus!” Annie exclaimed, with characteristically frank disgust and affection. Her friendship was unconditional, and we were always welcome back.I saw Annie more often after she retired from NPR, in 2010. She kept working, and wrote an utterly original book about a small, ordinary Russian city, Putin Country. But more and more, life was taken up with illness—her lung cancer, Vint’s leukemia—and then loss. After Vint’s death, in 2016, I felt a sense of loneliness close in around her. This is also how it seems to go. The news moves on by the minute, younger people are always busy, and even the most renowned names fade from public memory. The last narrowing years are utterly incommensurate to what came before—the long life lived in all its fullness. Why should Anne Garrels have apologized to me for taking up my time? But even as her health declined, the vitality that once drove her to travel so far and deep into foreign places never dimmed for the near at hand.I can see her standing in our kitchen with a glass of red wine, her big smile revealing the gap between her front teeth, as she interviewed our kids about their lives. Or kneeling in our garden, planting lilies she’d brought down from Connecticut. Or, a few weeks ago, eating fresh corn on her terrace in the summer evening sun, talking about Ukraine—too ill to report there, she’d helped raise a million dollars for medical supplies—and watching Moose, the dog she had left, chase after Neptune, our new one.I wish I’d known that she was fading fast. I would have gone to see her one more time. I would have tried to tell her what she meant to me, and to so many others. “You may not care, but your legacy is going to surprise you,” I would have said. “Just hang on another day or two and you’ll see.” I wish she’d stayed long enough to read this.",

        "description": "Photographs by Elena SubachAs soon as the first air-raid sirens sounded last winter, Elena Subach, a photographer and curator in Lviv, began to worry. “Lviv is itself an open-air museum,” she told me. “You cannot hide it in a bomb shelter.” All over Ukraine, curators mobilized to try to protect what they could and transfer movable items for safekeeping. In Lviv, museum staff and volunteers rushed to preserve the city’s treasures, putting steel plates over stained-glass windows and preparing canvases for transport. Subach photographed these efforts. At the Lviv National Gallery, she found a woman’s portrait obscured by bars of packing tape—the same tape that Ukrainians soon learned to use to prevent their windows from shattering under the impact of Russian attacks.The protected artworks remind us of all that could not be saved, of the scale of Ukraine’s irrevocable loss. While Lviv’s artworks have so far survived, the same cannot be said of those in Melitopol, Mariupol, Kharkiv, Chernihiv, and far too many other cities where museums—and communities—have been leveled by missile strikes.When we spoke recently, Subach recalled watching curators ready the 18th-century baroque wooden sculptures of Johann Georg Pinsel, “the Ukrainian Michelangelo,” for storage. On that day, in late February, Pinsel’s angels could barely be seen beneath their bubble wrap. The angels (below) now reside in an unknown location, Subach told me, silently guarding Lviv from their temporary refuge. “Until the victory, no one will take them out.”This article appears in the October 2022 print edition.",

The Pittsburgh Pirates finally got it together with their bats led by youngster Oneil Cruz, and pitcher Roansy Contreras continues to have good starts as the Bucs had it rollin’ in multiple phases with an 8-2 over the St. Louis Cardinals on Friday night. \nCruz finished the day 3-for-5 with three RBIs along with a double and a triple to raise his average on the season to .226 up from sub .200 just two weeks ago and continues to look better and better at the plate as he gets comfortable. \n\n\nOneil Cruz is so fun to watch. pic.twitter.com/QcHU7IPrxt— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nIn fact, all of the Pirate bats had their mojo workin’ on Friday night, as the Buccos pounded out 15 hits on the evening and every starter had at least one knock. Cal Mitchell was a perfect 3-for-3, Bryan Reynolds was 2-for-5, and Ke’Bryan Hayes returned to the lineup to go 2-for-4. Ben Gamel only had one hit, but it was a solo home run that got the scoring started in the second inning.\n\n\nBen Gamel - Pittsburgh Pirates (8) pic.twitter.com/cWGppdpCtv— MLB HR Videos (@MLBHRVideos) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\nMichael Chavis also had a two-run triple that helped put the game away late. \nOn the mound, Contreras was cruising, as he went five and one third inning, giving up just one run on four hits with two walks and a strikeout. He picked up his fifth win of the season to move to 5-4 and the bullpen combined to give up just one run the rest of the way. \nAfter somewhat slow starts, Cruz and Contreras have been showing glimpses of why the orgnization is so high on them, and if they can continue their development, they should both be key pieces of Pittsburgh’s future. \nIn an otherwise bleak season, watching those two play ball has been pretty fun.",

        "description": "King Charles III said that he was \"deeply aware\" of the inheritance and duties of becoming Britain's sovereign in Saturday during a speech at St. James's Palace. \n\n\n\nThe king was officially proclaimed the sovereign of Britain on Saturday by the Accession Council following the death of of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II. The council convenes following the death of a monarch to officially proclaim the successor to the throne. \n\n\n\n“I am deeply aware of this great inheritance and of the duties and heavy responsibilities of sovereignty which have now passed to me,” he said to his audience at St. James’s Palace in London.\n\n\n\nThe king continued: “In taking up these responsibilities, I shall strive to follow the inspiring example I have been set in upholding constitutional government and to seek the peace, harmony and prosperity of the peoples of these islands and of the Commonwealth realms and territories throughout the world.”\n\n\n\nCharles thanked the Accession Council, the nation and the world for the sympathy given to him and his siblings during their time of mourning following Elizabeth's death. The queen was 96 at the time of her passing. She is the longest-reigning monarch in Britain's history, serving seven decades on the throne. \n\n\n\n“My mother’s reign was unequaled in its duration, its dedication and its devotion,” he said. “Even as we grieve, we give thanks for this most faithful life.”\n\n\n\nThe king added that his mother “gave an example of lifelong love and of selfless service” to her children as well as the world at large.\n\n\n\n“And in carrying out the heavy task that has been laid upon me, and to which I now dedicate what remains to me of my life, I pray for the guidance and help of almighty God,” he concluded.\n\n\n\nCharles gave his first address to the nation as king on Friday, the day following the queen’s death, where he expressed his love and devotion to his mother. He also expressed his love for the royal family, including Prince Harry and his wife Meghan.\n\n\n\n“May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest,” Charles said of his mother in his Friday speech.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3635350-let-history-be-the-judge-of-what-is-fascism/",
        "description": "Recent discussions of fascism create an opportunity to look at history’s most brutal fascist, Adolf Hitler, at how he approached politics and power, and whether there are similarities between Hitler’s Germany and today’s understanding of fascism.\n\n\n\nThere have been volumes written about Hitler, examining who he was and his infamous role in shaping history. One of the most enlightening analyses of Hitler is the 1993 essay, “Working Towards the Führer,” by British historian and Hitler scholar Sir Ian Kershaw. The essay is subtitled, “Reflections on the Nature of the Hitler Dictatorship.” While this is a complex subject, what Kershaw does quite brilliantly is discuss the nature of Hitler’s tenure as Führer, how he governed, and his relationship with his followers.\n\n\n\nKershaw examines Hitler’s autocratic approach to political power but points out that, although his rule was unchallenged, he was oddly removed from overseeing the details of governing Germany. He calls Hitler and the Nazis a classic charismatic leadership movement. Kershaw uses German sociologist Max Weber’s charismatic authority paradigm to explain Hitler’s relationship with the German people. This includes the idea that the leader is on a heroic mission and is revered by his followers. The leader is also the person who comes to the rescue in a crisis, presumably even if the crisis is manufactured.\n\n\n\nIn a recent paper by social psychologist Alexander Haslam et. al., the authors discuss a model for understanding a mutually advantageous relationship between charismatic leaders and their followers. The leader derives influence by leading but also by allowing followers to help determine how the goals of the group — the leader’s goals — are achieved. At the same time, followers show their loyalty to the leader by working toward the goals he has defined, which helps to empower the leader. Leaders and followers need and use each other. The authors call this an integration of identity leadership and engaged followership.\n\n\n\nThroughout his tenure as Germany’s leader, Hitler remained generally popular. He was the defining force in the Nazi Party, and blind loyalty to the Führer was a necessary feature of being a Party member. There was no room for debate or disagreement. The Nazis were unequivocally the “Führer Party.” Hitler had a vision — goals— of Germany’s rebirth, of expanding German territory, battling Bolshevism and the unconscionable elimination of German Jews, who he tragically used as a scapegoat for Germany’s problems. His methods were barbaric. Yet, his followers worked to enact his vision and to please the Führer. Leaders and followers reinforced each other’s roles, no matter how devastating.\n\n\n\nHitler was detached from the running of the Nazi Party and the government bureaucracy. His habits were, as Kershaw describes them, that of an “indolent youth.” He rose late in the day, read press clippings, and did not behave as a head of state. As one of his former aides described him, “He disliked the study of documents.” He would make decisions without examining an issue. He trusted that things would work themselves out. Rather than relying on written records and using analyses by his aides to determine government policy, he would make oral pronouncements that could be Delphic in nature about what he wanted done.\n\n\n\nKershaw talks about a “systemlessness” to the Nazi government. The institutions of government were unclear, making Hitler the sole source of legitimacy. He used “special authorities” to circumvent government institutions. His whims were the law. Hitler believed in the triumph of the (his) will in dealing with complicated problems. Since there was not a government that had rationally functioning institutions — no “deep state” to challenge him — there was no hedge against Hitler and his followers implementing their acts of terror and malfeasance. What is particularly striking about Hitler’s style was the importance he placed on personal loyalty. Loyalty was defining in gaining access to power.\n\n\n\nKershaw describes Hitler as a unifier, activator and enabler of the Third Reich. He kept the squabbling members of the Nazi Party elite together, gave the Party purpose and enabled its inhumane policies. He was the instigator for the fall of decency and standards in Germany. He mainstreamed extremism, and his followers supported his efforts. Nazi atrocities got their agency from Hitler. The Party faithful and others who believed in the Führer tried to outdo themselves in anticipation of his will. Kershaw describes a rivalry between two provincial leaders who were trying to outdo each other in furthering Hitler’s goal of making Germany “racially pure.” He quotes a Nazi Party functionary, who describes the role of the Party faithful, “… It is the duty of everybody to work towards the Führer along the lines he would wish.” Hitler’s “lines,” as interpreted by his followers, permitted — indeed incited — acts of atrocity and violence against those perceived to be at odds with the Führer’s master plan and wishes.\n\n\n\nThe sobering lessons of history are often ignored. Pundits and other political observers can judge whether there are concerning similarities between the threat to democracy today and the threat that Hitler and the Nazis posed in their time. There is something unique about every generation, but also something similar. A lack of imagination — “We could never make the mistakes of a previous generation” — helps to ensure that history’s warnings may not be heeded. But there is also the possibility, to paraphrase Seamus Heaney, that history, if understood, can rhyme with hope.\n\n\n\nWilliam Danvers is an adjunct professor at George Washington University’s Elliott School and worked on national security issues for the Clinton and Obama administrations.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Colorado Rockies news and links for Saturday, September 10, 2022  Todd Helton had 15 career games played in the outfield during his 17-year Major League career, all coming during his first taste of the big leagues in 1997. At the time, the Colorado Rockies still employed the franchise’s first ever All-Star Andrés Galarraga to man first base, so getting Helton’s bat in the lineup meant deploying him to left field, outside of his normal comfort zone at first base. But Galarraga was set to be a free agent after the 1997 season, so the temporary positioning of Helton was apparent. By the start of the 1998 season, Helton was back at first, where he would play for another 2,170 games.\nThis is the latest parallel between Helton’s path and Michael Toglia’s (No. 11 PuRP), a comparison the organization has not been shy about making. \nA first-round selection out of UCLA in 2019, Toglia has been a highly-regarded defender at first base and an unconventional archetype of hitting prospect for the Rockies. Balancing a high-strikeout, high-power profile, Toglia has posted a 120 wRC+ in his minor league career despite a .240 average and a strikeout-rate just short of 30% in 999 at-bats. \nThe compromise in Toglia’s offensive equation has been working counts and drawing walks, which he has done at a 13% rate in the minors. This plate approach was proven in his 2022 minor league season, where he posted walk and strikeout rates in-line with his career averages while clubbing 30 home runs between 97 games at Double-A Hartford and 17 games at Triple-A Albuquerque. \nThose numbers took time to stabilize, however. During the first two months of the season, Toglia hit just .215 while posting an unsightly 37.6% strikeout rate. He turned a corner in June, though, raising his OPS over 200 points while cutting his strikeout rate down to a much more palatable 25%. This newfound approach and upturn in production led to Toglia’s eventual promotion on August 30th.\n“He made a little mindset shift in the middle of the summer after some good conversations with some people in our player development department about being a little bit more aggressive earlier.” said manager Bud Black, who also made sure to point out Toglia’s first MLB home run came on the first pitch of his at-bat against reliever Kenley Jansen. \n\n\nHome Run #1 for Michael Toglia! pic.twitter.com/ckyM10uSH9— DNVR Rockies (@DNVR_Rockies) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nAll told, Toglia has put together a .278/.333/.583 line with seven extra-base hits in his ten games played with the Rockies so far. The thump in his bat has been a welcome addition to a lineup that is thirsty for more power, but has come at a cost. To get his name in the lineup Toglia has been moonlighting in right field, starting six games in the outfield grass compared to four so far on the infield dirt. \nThis is uncharted territory for Toglia, as he spent just nine of his 270 career minor league games in the outfield.\n“Yeah…I think I’ve doubled my career total.” said Toglia, who hasn’t sweated the added responsibilities. “I think it’s an easier position to adjust to than going from the outfield (to the) infield. So, I’ve handled it well.”\nLike Helton – who has played his part in the development process – Toglia has had to play outside of his normal defensive responsibilities to get into the lineup. But unlike Helton, there does not seem to be an immediate plan to get Toglia regular playing time at his home position in the near-future.\nColorado currently employs four primary first baseman on their active roster: Sean Bouchard, C.J. Cron, Elehuris Montero and Toglia. Bouchard has proven his versatility as an outfielder and the club is still working to get Montero to stick at third base, so there is some maneuverability for the current roster. But Cron’s contract keeps him entrenched at first base for another year, and the questions about Montero’s ability to handle third are far from answered.\nThis is a problem that has been brewing for the Rockies for some time. Heading into the 2022 trade deadline, the benefits of moving Cron to clear a path were apparent. That narrative has only become more lucid with Cron’s subpar second-half and Toglia’s rise to the bigs.\nSo, heading into the 2023 season, the Rockies will have decisions to make if they want to fulfill Toglia’s “first baseman of the future” promise. Abstaining from transacting and playing first basemen at various positions is an unpopular decision that the organization has stuck to to this point. But for a franchise that has been searching for a homegrown fixture at 1B since it’s last such product retired in 2013 — and is not hiding who they think that will be — it seems clear what the best course of action is moving forward. Now, the only question is if they will commit to it.\n★ ★ ★\nPitch timer, shift restrictions among announced rule changes for ‘23 | mlb.com\nFriday morning, the Joint Competitive Committee — a  recently formed panel of Major League Baseball consisting of four active players, six MLB appointed members and one umpire — voted in favor of three new rules for the 2023. The simplest change is base size, increasing from 15 square inches to 18 square inches with home plate unchanged.\nThe pitch timer, designed to create a quicker pace of play, will start with a 30-second timer between batters. During an at-bat, there will be a 15-second time with the bases empty and a 20-second timer when runners are on base. If a pitcher violates the pitch clock, an automatic ball will be charged. The same consequences exist for batters, who will be charged a strike if they do not abide. The pitch clock will reset if a pitcher picks-off or simply steps off the rubber.\nThe final agreed change is a limit to defensive shifts. Teams on defense must have (at least) four players on the infield dirt at the time of every pitch, with two players on each side of second base. This new rule bans infielders from positioning in the outfield grass or overloading one side of the infield. If a team is in violation of the shift ban, the hitting team can choose an automatic ball in the count or the outcome of the ball in play.\n★ ★ ★\nOn The Farm\nTriple-A: El Paso Chihuahuas 9, Albuquerque Isotopes 7\nIt was a loss, but a wild loss, for the Albuquerque Isotopes. They trailed El Paso 7-0 through the first seven innings, with five runs coming against starter Karl Kauffmann who did manage to strikeout 11 in 5 2⁄3 innings. The Isotopes rally started with a grand slam from D.J. Peterson, his 18th home run of the season, to cut the lead to 4-3. Tim Lopes would kick off the bottom of the ninth with a solo shot to bring the lead down to down. That deficit was finally cut down on a two-run single from Sam Hilliard, with still no outs. Unfortunately the Isotopes would stop there and send the game to extra-innings. The Chihuahuas quickly put up two runs in the top of the tenth, which Albuquerque was unable to match in their half of the tenth.\nDouble-A: Somerset Patriots 2, Hartford Yard Goats 1\nNoah Davis locked horns with Randy Vasquez of the Patriots for a pitchers duel on Friday. Davis pitched into the sixth inning, allowing one run on four hits. He struck out seven in his 5 2⁄3 innings. He departed with scored tied at one after Willie MacIver drove in the lone run with an RBI ground-out in the fifth inning. Unfortunately, the Hartford offense couldn’t mount any pressure in the late innings and ultimately fell after Austin Kitchen surrendered a solo home run in the top of the ninth inning.\nHigh-A: Tri-City Dust Devils 5, Spokane Indians 3\nSpokane never led in their road matchup with the Dust Devils. Starter Andrew Quezada gave up four runs in 4 2⁄3 innings, notching five strikeouts with no walks but surrendering nine hits. Nick Kent and Ronaiker Palma drove in the Indians’ first two runs with ground outs in the third and sixth innings. Robby Martin Jr., who had two hits in the game, drove in Spokane’s final run with a single in the seventh.\nLow-A: San Jose Giants 12, Fresno Grizzlies 4\nThe wrong-side of a sweep for the system was completed with a tough night for the Grizzlies against the Giants. The game was tied 3-3 after three innings thanks to two RBI from A.J. Lewis, but the pitching fell apart from there. For starter Jarrod Cande, the good was eight strikeouts but the bad was four runs on two homers in four innings. In relief, Felix Ramires didn’t fare much better with four runs (one unearned) in his two innings while, after him, Sergio Sanchez managed to give up his four runs without getting three outs. Fresno was out-hit 13-to-4 in the ballgame.\n★ ★ ★\nPlease keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting. Thanks!",

        "description": "Photo by Richard Rodriguez/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Toronto and Houston emerged with just one-run wins after some timely late inning hitting. The Yankees freefall continued on Friday as they took a 4-2 loss to the Rays, trimming the AL East lead to just 3.5 games.\nWhile the Rays are the team the Yankees need to be most immediately preoccupied with, there’s plenty of other teams they’re getting drawn towards, record-wise. While we know that Tampa Bay gained ground, let’s check in on the rest of the competition in today’s edition of the Rivalry Roundup.\n\nToronto Blue Jays (77-60) 4, Texas Rangers (59-78) 3\n\nTop Rangers’ prospect Josh Jung got some headlines with a home run in his first career MLB at-bat, but it was Toronto who came away with the victory thanks to Danny Jansen’s ninth inning RBI single. The hit broke a 3-3 tie after the Rangers had rallied to tie things up in the bottom of the eighth.\nToronto had opened up an early lead after scored three runs over the first three innings, and got a solid six-inning, two-run outing from Ross Stripling. However, the Rangers slowly fought their way back into the game, eventually evening things up thanks to a Corey Seager  RBI single in the eighth, his second hit and second RBI of the game. However, Jansen came through, and the Rangers ended up stranding the potential tying run in the bottom of the ninth.\n\nHouston Astros (89-49) 4, Los Angeles Angels (60-78) 3\n\nMike Trout’s fifth consecutive game with a home run got the Angels off to a lead, but a pair of Astros’ ones flipped the score and allowed Houston to come away with the win.\nAfter five scoreless innings, Trout game the Angels a 2-0 lead with a sixth inning home run, but the Astros answered fairly quickly. Jeremy Peña got one run back with a homer in the bottom of the sixth, but Chas McCormick hit a two-run shot that would give Houston a lead they would never relinquish.\nMcCormick also drove home a run with a bases loaded walk in the eighth, which ended up being fairly important. In the top of the ninth, Taylor Ward homered, but it ended up being too little, too late for LA.\n\nAtlanta Braves (87-51) 6, Seattle Mariners (77-61) 4\n\nSeven different Braves’ batters recorded hits, led by Robbie Grossman with three, as their balanced effort allowed them to get past the Mariners.\nThe teams traded two-run homers early, with Atlanta’s Dansby Swanson hitting one in the first and Seattle’s Carlos Santana going deep in the second. However, Grossman recorded the first of his two RBI with a fouth inning single, an the Braves would never trail again.\nAtlanta went up by as many as three runs, but Santana kept it close with another home run, ensuring that it was only a two-run game going into the final innings. However, an eighth inning walk would be the only base runner the Mariners put on over the final two innings, as Rasiel Iglesias and Kenley Jansen combined to finish things off.\nWhile it’s less relevant in the AL playoff race discussions, the win took the Braves into first place in the NL East for the first time this season.\nOther Contenders\n\n\nBaltimore Orioles (73-65) 3, Boston Red Sox (67-72) 2: Gunnar Henderson’s two-run single capped off a three-run sixth inning that allowed Baltimore to rally past Boston. The Red Sox had opened a 2-0 lead in the third, but it was an especially impressive day for the Orioles’ bullpen, who combined to five scoreless innings, allowing their offense to eventually overtake the Red Sox.\n\nChicago White Sox (71-68) 5, Oakland Athletics (50-89) 3: The A’s took a no-hitter through 6.1 innings, but it didn’t end up mattering. The White Sox rallied with five ninth inning runs off A.J. Puk, flipping the result after they seemed doomed to a loss.\n\nCleveland Guardians (71-65) 7, Minnesota Twins (69-68) 6: After jumping out to a 7-0 lead by the fifth inning, the Guardians threated to give it all back as Minnesota came all the way back to get within just one run. The Twins had their chance too, leaving a runner stranded in scoring position in the eighth, as their rally attempt wasn’t enough.",

Much of the album is outwardly about pleasure: of dancing, of togetherness, of physical contact and sex. Recorded in the London studio that Al Doyle set up during the pandemic, it’s the first Hot Chip album to be written from scratch by the full band all in the same room, and its sound reflects that pooling of energies, full of exuberant dance rhythms and arrangements that burst at the seams.\nCondé Nast https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/hot-chip-freakout-release/\n\nThe post 🎵 Freakout Release (Hot Chip) first appeared on Read Write Collect.",

        "description": "Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Recent #Cubs,#MLB, and #MiLB news, four days a week. Yan Gomes continued his fine hitting and Drew Smyly shoved for a win. Welcome to today’s edition of Cub Tracks news and notes™, a greatest-hits from Chicago-style beat writers and bloggers, ground from #Cubs, #MiLB, and #MLB baseball, overheated, and then cold-brewed overnight for maximum flavor.\nAdrian Sampson is 1-5, with a 3.76 ERA, 55 SO in 76⅔ innings, and a 1.291 WHIP. That won-loss record indicates that the bullpen treats him roughly, but also that he leaves the game with men on base fairly often. Still, he has the look of a maybe rotation piece, maybe a long tosser, and given the general run of the 2022 season, he has been a revelation. Javier Assad likewise, with his results from a slightly smaller sample size. It’d be great if they both stick, my jokes about their similarity notwithstanding. The Cubs are going to need a little more than that... but still, good to have in the back pocket while we await developments.\nThe current knot on the string is a three-game series with the San Francisco Giants. Drew Smyly opposing former White Sox hurler Carlos Rodón was the kickoff. The Giants are having a rough year, especially away from home,  but they’re a good club, and Rodón is having an All-Star season.\nSmyly shoved. Manuel Rodriguez pitched better than the record will reflect — he had very little help from the umpire. Brandon Hughes closed up shop. Best of luck to Nick Madrigal’s groin, which has the tightness. Maybe looser pants?\nHighlights:\n\n\nTwo-run blast off the bat of @Yan_AGomes! pic.twitter.com/rSjN8UcJ0A— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nNico cleans up. pic.twitter.com/s4ThKAAHVI— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven innings of 1-hit ball from Drew Smyly!   pic.twitter.com/2QiXqhBzup— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nCubs win!Final: #Cubs 4, Giants 2. pic.twitter.com/AOYfM18MR3— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\n* means autoplay on, or annoying ads, or both (directions to remove for Firefox and Chrome). {$} means paywall. {$} means limited views.

Your legacy.”\nBrett Taylor (Bleacher Nation*): Adrian Sampson: Keeps being a solid pitcher, challenging future roster discussion. “There’s value there as a back-end starter and swing man.” Jordan Bastian talks Sampson. Tony Andracki has words also.\nJordan Bastian (MLB.com*): Javier Assad one of many ‘difficult decisions’ on Cubs’ horizon. “We’re trying to figure out our roster, which is a bit more complicated than usual,” Jed Hoyer said. \nSahadev Sharma (The Athletic {$}): After an impressive debut, what more can the Cubs expect from Hayden Wesneski? “The Cubs aren’t in denial about who Wesneski just dominated.”\nPatrick Mooney (The Athletic {$}): Do the Cubs have star power in their farm system? Insights into top hitting prospects. “It’s hard to accurately predict who all the great players are going to be,” said Jared Banner, the current vice president of player development for the Cubs.\nTim Stebbins (NBC Sports Chicago*): Willson Contreras’ MRI encouraging for 2022 return. “The results were consistent with his diagnosis of a sprained left ankle.”\nGordon Wittenmyer (NBC Sports Chicago*): Cubs’ David Ross opens Ian Happ ‘Gold Glove conversation’. “I haven’t looked at the rest of the league, but it feels like he’s played some of the best defensive left field in the league for me,” the Cubs manager said. Maddie Lee seconds that emotion.\nRichard Johnson (Cubbies Crib*): Here’s how to fix Christopher Morel’s issues at the plate. “Morel is getting eaten alive in the strike zone.”\nTim Stebbins (NBC Sports Chicago*): Seiya Suzuki takes highs with lows as rookie season nears end. “I feel like I’m getting used to the atmosphere,” Suzuki said. “I’m facing all these pitchers more than once, so I’m used to what their stuff is.”\nDavid Hill (Call to the Pen*): Former Chicago Cubs outfielder Kosuke Fukudome to retire. “A decade after his final major league game, former Chicago Cubs outfielder Fukudome is ready to hang up his cleats.”\n\nFood for Thought:\n\n\nGet in, nerds!

(credit: ReedPOP)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSEATTLE—In-person video game conventions are back! Kind of!\nNerdy conventions and other physical events began reappearing in public halls late last year, though what a difference a year makes. PAX West 2021 was my first in-person convention since the COVID-19 pandemic began, but the event was a ghost town, full of empty, blacked-out spaces and massive gaps in the cast of showcasing companies. Last week's PAX West 2022, on the other hand, finally felt like the real deal, and it was fortunately met by a vigilant, mask-wearing crowd.\nSome gaming companies have apparently moved on from local convention participation, with Microsoft and Sony not hosting PAX West booths (though each had a presence at last month's boisterous Gamescom 2022 in Cologne, Germany). Hence, this post-PAX \"coolest upcoming games\" feature is far from comprehensive, owing as much to missing companies as to specific games not demoing well in packed convention halls. Even so, we played enough diverse fare to feel comfortable shouting out solid PAX West highlights.Read 20 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

No pesky fans asking awkward questions here (at least at the main studio panels), but plenty of super-smooth sneak peeks at movies and TV shows to come, all delivered up from the 7,000 capacity D23 hall at Anaheim Convention Centre with the sort of sparkling production and star power you’d expect from the studio that currently rules Hollywood.Attendees for Friday afternoon’s panel for Disney and Pixar were warmed up for a packed two-hour panel with Cynthia Erivo, aka the blue fairy in the studio’s new live action take on Pinocchio, singing When You Wish Upon a Star. A couple of hours later, West Side Story Oscar-winner Ariana DeBose saw us out with a never-before-heard song from newly announced Disney Animation Studios film Wish, ‘More For Us’ (cue standing ovation).

        "description": "CNN’s Jake Tapper suggested on his show \"The Lead\" Friday that it would be \"clever\" for President Biden to invite former President Trump to Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral. \n\n\n\nBiden said Friday that he would attend the queen's funeral after Buckingham Palace announced her passing Thursday. Elizabeth was 96 at the time of her death. She is the longest-reigning monarch in Britain's history and has been succeeded by her son, King Charles III. \n\n\n\nTapper noted during a panel discussion on his show that the United Kingdom is allowing each country to decide who to bring to the queen’s funeral.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I mean, the U.K. has made it very clear, that’s up to the president. He’s invited. He can bring whatever delegation. So obviously, Obama, you know, Carter, Bush, no-brainers. What about Trump? Will he invite Trump?” Tapper said.\n\n\n\nAll living former presidents released statements of condolences within hours of the announcement of her passing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think that the clever move is to invite him and see if he goes,” Tapper said. “I don’t think former President Trump would want to be subordinate on Air Force One, and I think probably he prefers his own plane anyway.”\n\n\n\nTrump released his own statement on Thursday regarding the queen’s passing, saying he’ll “never forget Her Majesty’s generous friendship, great wisdom, and wonderful sense of humor. What a grand and beautiful lady she was—there was nobody like her!”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInviting Trump would not be an unprecedented move, as previous presidents have invited former presidents to funerals of world leaders during their time in office.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, then-President Obama invited former President George W. Bush to Nelson Mandela’s funeral.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe discussion from Tapper comes after Biden has intensified his attacks on Trump, describing his predecessor as a threat to democracy. Trump has responded, calling Biden “an enemy of the state.”",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3636693-biden-white-house-loves-californias-energy-solutions-shortages-and-high-costs/",
        "description": "Check out the latest energy crisis hobbling California: Smoke from fires triggered by an extended drought is obscuring the sunlight needed to power solar panels.\n\n\n\nBut, at the same time, a tropical storm is generating rain and clouds, which are also hampering solar generation. Shouldn’t the storm be dousing the fires?\n\n\n\nRenewable energy, it turns out, is not only unreliable; it’s downright confusing.\n\n\n\nWhat else can go wrong in the Golden State? In a word, plenty. California is suffering an energy catastrophe that is almost entirely self-inflicted. Bad policies (including decades of sloppy forest management) have exacerbated the impact of a dire drought, while green mania has stripped the state of the kinds of back-up solutions that are critical to shifting to renewable energy.\n\n\n\nThe astonishing thing is that policymakers here in the U.S. will learn nothing from the California’s travails. In fact, in a trip to the Golden State just days before officials warned citizens of impending energy blackouts, Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm gushed to an interviewer, “California is in the lead and can show the rest of the nation how it is done.”\n\n\n\nLet us sincerely hope not.\n\n\n\nHere is what California is actually showing the nation:\n\n\n\nRenewable energy from solar and wind power is unreliable and must be back-stopped by steady nuclear or fossil-fuel facilities;Energy independence is energy security;Forcing an accelerated transition to renewable energy can put lives and economies at risk.\n\n\n\nWe should have learned the same lessons from the ongoing energy crisis in Europe, which began way before Putin invaded Ukraine and which stems from many of the same “rush to green” mistakes being made on the West coast. But the climate zealots in Biden’s White House are unmoved.\n\n\n\nGranholm visited California just before Gov. Newsom asked residents to turn up their thermostats to 78 degrees and refrain from charging their electric vehicles (EVs) between the hours of 4 p.m. and 9 p.m. EVs that, as it happened, the state recently mandated would be the only kind of car sold in California by 2035.\n\n\n\nGranholm waxed positively giddy over what she saw. “I love the fact that California is unabashedly bold about [green] energy policy,” she enthused, adding “California’s boldness has … shaped our willingness in the federal government to move further and faster.”\n\n\n\nOne wonders what part of California’s energy solutions Granholm admires. Is it that homeowners pay 88 percent more for electricity than Americans elsewhere? Or that industrial users are being charged 99 percent more than their competitors in other states?\n\n\n\nMaybe she’s envious that Californians pay 43 percent more than the national average for gasoline today or that natural gas for heating homes in Los Angeles costs 23 percent more than in the rest of the country.\n\n\n\nSurely California residents are not happy with those comparisons. Especially low-income residents, for whom the costs of basic items such as rent and energy comprise a larger-than-average share of their monthly budget.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey cannot be happy, too, that officials threaten power outages when the temperature hits 115 degrees in parts of the state; people could die.\n\n\n\nGranholm, like Democrats elsewhere, talks a lot about energy “equity.” But there’s nothing equitable about paying hugely inflated electricity costs to provide leftwing politicians with spiffy climate credentials.\n\n\n\nWhy is California in its current fix?\n\n\n\nStart with the obvious, on the supply side. The Golden State boasts some of the nation’s largest oil and gas reserves but chooses not to produce them for environmental reasons. California’s oil reserves rank fifth in the U.S, but California imports some 1.4 million barrels per day of oil, while producing only 400,000 barrels a day.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe climate warriors in the state, while shutting down local production, have also blocked construction of new pipelines. Even though the state has chosen to import 70 percent of the oil it consumes, there are no pipelines available to access the commodity (at possibly lower prices) from other states. Shipping oil via trucks or rail is of course not acceptable, for environmental reasons. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIronically, the state is importing oil from countries such as Ecuador, Iraq and Saudi Arabia — countries with much more lenient environmental regulations that the U.S.\n\n\n\nAlso, the state has been shutting down natural gas and nuclear power plants, even though the latter are emissions-free and presumably could help California reach its 2045 zero-carbon goal.\n\n\n\nResponding to the latest crisis, officials decided to bring several gas-fired generators online and give Diablo Canyon, a critical nuclear plant that is the state’s single biggest source of electricity, a stay of execution. It had been scheduled to be shut down by 2025. But the Democrat-run state legislature acknowledged in a rare moment of clarity that turning off the lights and air conditioning in the middle of a record heat wave might finally rouse abused voters from their torpor.\n\n\n\nDiablo Canyon not only provides 9 percent of the state’s electricity, it also generates 15 percent of California’s clean energy.\n\n\n\nOfficials are rushing to electrify California, mandating a switch not only to EVs but also to electric appliances. Simply said, the infrastructure necessary to accommodate the massive expansion of demand is not in place. There have already been occasional blackouts over the past two years at moments of stress. With demand from EVs increasing, those outages will likely increase.\n\n\n\nIn comments contesting the EV mandates, the Western States Petroleum Association wrote in a statement, “electrification of the transportation sector will increase demand by around 300,000 gigawatt-hours statewide.” That translates into a doubling of electricity demands.\n\n\n\nOur nation may choose to transition to renewable energy, despite the negligible impact our efforts will likely have on the Earth’s climate.

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Muncy missed Friday’s series opener in San Diego Dodgers infielder Max Muncy received a cortisone shot in his left knee after Wednesday’s game, and was unavailable for Friday’s series opener in San Diego, per multiple reports.\nManager Dave Roberts told reporters at Petco Park that the hope is for Muncy to be available off the bench as early as Saturday, per Jack Harris of the Los Angeles Times.\nMuncy said he thinks the knee issues might stem from his new step-back motion to begin his swing, per Bill Plunkett of the Orange County Register. Plunkett also reported, “Muncy had an MRI of his knee ‘about a week ago,’ Roberts said, that showed ‘some kind of irritation’ but nothing serious.”\nMuncy joins Gavin Lux in the recent cortisone club. For Lux, it’s been a neck issue keeping him sidelined. Friday was Lux’s seventh straight game missed, and he’s been limited to just four starts and 18 plate appearances over the Dodgers’ last 16 games. Sounds like he won’t play for a while, either, per Fabian Ardaya at The Athletic.\n\n\nGavin Lux might swing a bat tomorrow, Dave Roberts said, but is close to a week from game activity. Won’t go on the IL — Roberts said they don’t feel they need to add the extra position player (they view this current group as who they’re choosing from right now for postseason).— Fabian Ardaya (@FabianArdaya) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\nLinks\nJoey Gallo has started 22 of the 34 games for which he’s been active with the Dodgers, but he’s only completed 12 of those games, and has been heavily platooned, the left-hander batting only five times against left-handed pitchers. J.P. Hoornstra at the Los Angeles Daily News wrote about Gallo embracing the role. “Maybe I can contribute a little bit but, you know, it’s nice to have such depth and so many talented players up and down the lineup that anybody can take over a game,” Gallo said. “It’s a lot of weight off your shoulder, I think.”\nBen Clemens at FanGraphs wrote about relievers acquired at the trade deadline have changed their pitch mix. Among them is Chris Martin, who has thrown his four-seam fastball 12 percent more often with the Dodgers, with great success. “What he does have is pinpoint command,” Clemens wrote. “His calling card is moving the ball across the strike zone depending on his opponent.”\nJayson Stark at The Athletic had some fun facts regarding the Dodgers’ juggernaut season, including this quote from a rival executive referencing the team’s pythagorean record: “We get bored with greatness sometimes. ... But that team is really awesome. I don’t know if they’re going to be ‘win-117-games awesome.’ But I think if they had to, they probably would, if that makes any sense. That’s how good they are.”\nDustin Nosler at Dodger Stadium took a stab at predicting the Dodgers’ postseason roster.\nBeginning Saturday at the Fullerton Museum Center and running through December 31, the National Baseball Hall of Fame exhibit “Picturing America’s Pastime,” featuring a collection of photos, will be on display. Among the events at the museum will be a celebration for Tommy Lasorda on September 22, Lasorda’s birthday, as well as the opening of an adjacent Lasorda exhibit beginning Saturday evening.",

        "description": "The goslings are born. Photographs of geese courtesy of Friends of Morningside Park.\nBy Lisa Kava\nIn the middle of May, just as spring arrived in New York City, six goslings were born in Morningside Park. Locals enjoyed watching the newcomers to the neighborhood waddle around with their parents. Photos were posted on Instagram of the sweet family, who brought smiles to the faces of park visitors.\nBut by the end of June, as their feathers began to come in, it became clear that something was not right. Parkgoers noticed that the goslings’ wings bent out to the sides and seemed to hang low. Photos were posted on the neighborhood app Next Door.\nSomething was not right.\nAllison Jones, a senior volunteer for the nonprofit organization Friends of Morningside Park was particularly concerned and reached out to bird rescue organizations hoping for answers. Jones connected with Jessica Hope, at They All Want to Live, and Rita McMahon, the director of the Wild Bird Fund.\nAngel Wing Syndrome.\nJones learned that sadly five of the six goslings developed a deformity called Angel Wing Syndrome, and will never be able to fly. The condition can be congenital or a result of poor nutrition, she told West Side Rag in a phone interview, explaining that it often happens when birds are fed bread and processed foods.\n“Angel Wing Syndrome occurs when birds do not get enough necessary vitamins and minerals,” Jessica Hope elaborated. “Wild birds are very good at seeking out and finding proper food in the wild but when they are routinely fed unhealthy, human foods, they fill up on this instead of the food they should be eating. This results in the nutritional deficiencies that cause Angel Wing.”\nThe goslings were being fed junk food.\nBoth Jones and Hope often witness people feeding bread and cheerios to geese in Morningside Park, despite signage which says not to feed wildlife. “The goslings in Morningside Park were being fed junk food.” Hope said.\nMcMahon, of the Wild Bird Fund, told WSR that if Angel Wing Syndrome is found early enough it could be corrected. “If the birds get to us when they are very young and fuzzy, we can put splints on their wings and help them to fly. Unfortunately, these goslings are past this point in time.”\nBirds who are unable to fly may not survive winter. “The problem is that once the ponds and lake freeze the geese cannot get food,” Hope said. “A flightless goose is at risk of starvation and lack of water when ponds freeze.&#8221;\n\nTraffic stoppers- CPW and 110th this morning. #birdcpp pic.twitter.com/ZtZVl8q5AC\n&mdash; caren jahre (@CarenJahre) August 13, 2022\n\nMcMahon began to search for a sanctuary for these Angel Wing geese. As she was putting together a plan, something unusual and unexpected happened. In mid-August, the parent geese were spotted walking their babies (through traffic) from Morningside Park to a new home at The Pool in Central Park at 110th Street.\n“These parents are incredible,” McMahon said. “They really thought about what they were doing and decided that Central Park was a better place for their kids.”\n“Canada geese are extremely loyal to, and protective of their families. The parents of the goslings who developed Angel Wing Syndrome in Morningside Park are healthy and flighted, and likely familiar with the city parks and where bodies of water are. When a new flock of geese arrived at Morningside, the parents decided it was best to leave, but their kids couldn’t fly. They walked them from Morningside to Central Park, through traffic. It is incredible but not surprising. They are incredibly intelligent and emotionally complex birds,” Hope said.\nSanctuary. Photographs by Paul Lange.\nMcMahon found a sanctuary in upstate New York that agreed take in the geese. Rangers from the NYC Parks Department will “apprehend the birds once the parents leave and bring them to the Wild Bird Fund,” McMahon said, explaining that the parent geese eventually migrate. Wild Bird Fund will then transport the geese to the sanctuary in Rensselaer County, NY, which hosts other Angel Wing geese, and has two ponds, a heated barn, and a full-time caretaker. “They will have freedom to roam with other birds. This will be their forever home,” McMahon said.\nFreedom.\n“Our Urban Park Rangers are monitoring the goslings. We plan to keep the family together until the flying adults migrate in the fall. Rangers will work with WBF to transport the birds afflicted by Angel Wing Syndrome to [the] private sanctuary.” a spokesperson for Parks wrote in an email to West Side Rag.\nNormally Canada geese parents migrate once their goslings’ primary feathers come in, McMahon explained. “But these parents have shown extraordinary care for their young, taking them to The Pool in Central Park by foot.”  WSR asked what will happen if these parents do not leave. “We have not encountered that before, but I think we would take the Angel Wing geese to the sanctuary and let the parents go on with their lives which is the usual pattern of life for geese.”\nRead before you feed! More explicit signs.\nAllison Jones said that new signs with more specific details about the dangers of feeding wildlife have recently been placed by residents. She hopes that with further explanation and education people will not feed the geese.\n&#8220;I don’t think most people feeding the geese meant any harm.  But we really need to raise awareness, it’s so important,” Jones said.\nMcMahon agrees.  “These geese will have a happy life at the sanctuary, but we must spread the word that feeding birds is very harmful. Do not feed the birds. Leave them be. People need to understand there are serious ramifications.”",

Nor is it, whatever facile cleverness may say, a mere romantic pantomime, appealing to easy sentiment with its remembrance of things past and to popular curiosity, with its play on personality.

        "description": "Ukrainian forces are advancing into the Kharkiv region, pushing back the Russian line, according to the U.K. Defense Ministry. \n\n\n\nThe territory in the east of the country was captured early on in the invasion, but a Ukrainian counterattack launched earlier in the week is driving into Russian-held territory. \n\n\n\nThe British military said the attack has penetrated 50 kilometers into what had been the Russian front-lines. &#8220;Russian forces were likely taken by surprise. The sector was only lightly held and Ukrainian units have captured or surrounded several towns,&#8221; the ministry said.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ukraine&#8217;s official Defense Ministry twitter account: &#8220;Armed Forces have liberated and took control of more than 30 localities in the Kharkiv region.&#8221; \n\n\n\nAmid the unexpected success of the counterstrike, footage has emerged of Ukrainian citizens in formerly occupied areas greeting the advancing troops as liberators. \n\n\n\nThe Washington-based think tank Institute for the Study of War estimates that the offensive has resulted in the capture of 2,500 square kilometers as of September 9. \n\n\n\nThe counterattack marks the biggest involuntary reversal on the part of the Russian military in the conflict so far. According to the U.K. Defense Ministry it could lead to even bigger gains for the Ukrainian forces. \n\n\n\n&#8220;A Russian force around Izium is likely increasingly isolated. Ukrainian units are now threatening the town of Kupiansk; its capture would be a significant blow to Russia because it sits on supply routes to the Donbas front line,&#8221; the ministry said.",

        "description": "Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The O’s gain ground in the wild card race, MLB passes new rules, and voting for Most Valuable Oriole. Good morning, Birdland!\nThe Orioles gained ground in the playoff race! Their 3-2 win over the Red Sox paired with the Mariners 6-4 loss to the Braves has the O’s only four games out of a playoff spot, a half-game improvement over where they started the day,\nHowever, that good news comes with a caveat. Chasing down the Mariners has some added difficulties that chasing the Blue Jays does not. The most straightforward is the fact that the Orioles still play the Blue Jays six times while they are done playing the Mariners this season. Connected to that, the Orioles can still win the head-to-head tiebreaker with the Blue Jays. That tiebreaker has already been lost against the Mariners. So, while the standings may say four games back, tying the Mariners won’t be enough. They need to finish ahead of them.\nRegardless of how you spin it, though, the Orioles just need to keep winning games. There is no secret sauce there. If they win all of the games left on their schedule, they get into the playoffs. If we want to be more reasonable, winning like 75% of their games probably gets it done too. But there isn’t much wiggle room beneath that.\nBut that is the 10,000-foot view. The O’s can only worry about the game right in front of them. For today, that is a 5:05 first pitch against those Red Sox. Jordan Lyles returns from his illness to take on Michael Wacha.\nLinks\nMajor League Baseball passes significant rules changes including pitch clock, banning defensive shifts | ESPN.comMost of these rule changes seem completely fine, and will eventually feel like second nature to the sport. I don’t love the rule against the number of pickoff attempts within an at-bat, but I get it. Successful pickoffs are relatively rare anyway, and likely unworthy of the amount of time they can often suck up.\nOrioles welcome MLB’s new rules on shifts, pitch clock, base size: ‘A good thing for the game’ | The Baltimore SunAnd here is the Orioles-specific slant to the rule changes. The pitch clock, in particular, is mentioned with Jordan Lyles and Terrin Vavra giving the takes of an old veteran and a rookie. Vavra has already experienced the pitch clock in Triple-A, and he seems to say you just get used to it. I like it!\nHenderson breaks down game-winning RBI hit | Orioles.comWe really are getting spoiled this year with the quality of rookies that the Orioles have promoted. Gunnar Henderson and Adley Rutschman take some of the best at-bats on the team every single night, and then they are studs on defense too. It just feels surreal. \nWho’s deserving of Most Valuable Oriole? | Roch KubatkoFor me, it’s Rutschman with Anthony Santander as a rather distant second place. Everything turned around when Rutschman came up, and he makes an impact in all aspects of the game. That’s tough to beat. \nAL Wild Card Race Getting Right (Ep. 98) | The Warehouse PodcastAn hour of Orioles-centric talk to accompany you during yard work or folding laundry today.  Please listen!

        "description": "The U.S. Navy has ordered an independent investigation into the Navy SEAL selection course following the death of a sailor during the program, according to a report from The New York Times.\n\n\n\nVice Chief of Naval Operations Admiral William K. Lescher called for the investigation in a letter obtained by the paper. \n\n\n\nThe investigation will focus on the Basic Underwater Demolition/SEALS (BUD/S) course, probing its safety measures and drug testing protocol as well as the qualifications of medical personnel assigned to the program.\n\n\n\nMany sailors have been found to use performance-enhancing drugs to get through BUD/S, particularly during what is known as “Hell Week,” the most intense part of the selection course where sailors experience dire physical conditions, according to the Times. \n\n\n\nThe Aug. 31 letter also ordered investigators to look into changes made since the passing of Kyle Mullen in February. Mullen was a Navy sailor who died after being sent to the hospital in San Diego shortly following Hell Week.\n\n\n\nAn anonymous Navy official told the Times that the Naval Special Warfare Command (NSWC), which houses the SEALs, had also been investigating Mullen’s death before their probe was brought to a halt.\n\n\n\nLeaders found that the NSWC report placed too much responsibility on Mullen rather than highlighting the flaws of the SEAL training program, according to the official.\n\n\n\nThe letter indicates that the Special Warfare Command will refocus its investigation into whether Mullen died in the line of duty, but will leave other questions to the independent investigators.\n\n\n\n“The Navy remains committed to transparency and ensuring the final reports are thorough, accurate, impartial, and that confidence and credibility are maintained throughout the entire process,” it told the Times.\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the Navy for further comment on the investigation.",

        "description": "Photo by Denis Poroy/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A franchise mark for most wins in a season is in sight The Dodgers on Friday lost a series opener to the Padres at Petco Park in San Diego, but still remain on pace for the best record over a full season in franchise history. Here’s a look at their chase for a team record, plus something a National League team hasn’t done in over a century, and a longshot pursuit of the major league wins record.\nMost MLB wins in a season\nBoth the 1906 Cubs and 2001 Mariners won 116 games, the major league record. Chicago did so in only 152 games, and Seattle accomplished the feat under the current 162-game schedule format.\nThe Dodgers, now 94-43, still technically have a chance to beat or match this mark, but it’s a long shot. Los Angeles would need to win 22 of their final 25 games just to tie the record.\nThe Cubs in 1906 beat the Pirates in their 137th game, a 12th victory in a row that brought Chicago’s record to an absurd 105-32. In 2001, the Mariners in their 137th game beat the Orioles to end a series in Baltimore, improving to 98-39.\nThe Dodgers are currently on pace to win 111 games, which would be the second-most in National League history, behind only those 1906 Cubs. The last NL club to win more than 108 games in a season was the 1909 Pirates, who finished 110-42.\nBest Dodgers record\n106 wins is the mark to shoot for here, accomplished by both the 2019 and 2021 teams. The 2022 Dodgers need only to finish 13-12 to set a new franchise record for wins.\nThe Dodgers in 2019 were 88-49 through 137 games, and last year were 86-51 at this point in the season, both on their way to 106 wins.\nBut the 2022 Dodgers also have a chance to also have the best winning percentage in team history, over a full season. The 2020 team was 43-17 (.717) in the pandemic-shortened season, but we’ll exclude the 60-game regular season when comparing across eras.\nThe 1899 Brooklyn Superbas were 101-47 (.6824), and the 1953 Brooklyn Dodgers were 105-49 (.6818). To beat those teams, the 2022 Dodgers — currently with a .686 win percentage — would need at least 111 wins, meaning a 17-8 finish.\nThrough 137 games, the 1899 Superbas were 94-43, and the 1953 team was 95-42.",

        "description": "Photo by Michael Owens/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Yankee bullpen is proof of the club’s deep understanding of the sweeper. To sweep, or not to sweep. The sweeper has taken the baseball world by storm in 2022. It’s not a new pitch by any means, as players have been throwing this iteration of a slider since baseballs have been thrown. However, in the era of information, coaches and players have learned how to better program the sweeper into a different pitchers’ arsenals. As the months go by, we see another pitcher sporting it as their primary breaking ball. Yet not every sweep is a good one, and even when it moves across the entire plate, it may be very recognizable. \nThat last point stands for many other teams, but not the Yankees. Multiple pitchers on the Yankees have excelled with their sweepers this season, and it’s because they have the right idea of how to use them within the context of the rest of their repertoire. \nThe first four on the staff that come to mind are Clay Holmes, Jonathan Loáísiga, Michael King, and Lucas Luetge. These four relievers use the sweeper in tandem with their primary fastball. The pitch can yield a whiff, or it can yield soft contact. My focus for this article will be a visual representation of how each pitcher does this, starting with Holmes.\n\nNote the location on this pitch. Yes, the final endpoint Is low and away, but it breaks across the middle/middle-away part of the plate. This sets up the location of the next pitch. \n\nSinker middle-inside. Holmes excels at working within the lower two-thirds of the strike zone. The vertical break nature of his two primary pitches promotes him starting pitches in the middle part of the zone, vertically speaking. Being aware of this allows him to constantly yield uncomfortable swings. By no means is he an elite bat-misser. He lives by getting a happy combination of whiffs and soft contact. By focusing on this area of the strike zone, he gets the most out of his slider and sinker. The batting average against his slider this season is .182.\n\nMy favorite skill of King’s was his ability to run his sinker back over the strike zone with late life. Because of his consistent spotting of this pitch, he forces hitters to have to cheat on it. You have to recognize the pitch early so you don’t get fooled and beat to end an at-bat on a called strike. \n\n\nCan you see why one slider was taken and the other was not? The first started too far below the zone. Despite its wicked movement, it did not matter. Reynolds easily was able to recognize and take. In the follow-up slider, King adjusts the location to just slightly below the zone and is able to yield an ugly whiff. Why does one location work and not the other? Reynolds is aware of King’s ability to get the backdoor sinker in at any moment. In trying to not get beat by it, he chased a slider which directly crossed paths with the sinker earlier in the at-bat. That’s King’s M.O. Backdoor sinkers and sliders low and off the plate. Without the sinker, there is no slider with a .130 batting average against. \n\nLoáisiga’s bread and butter is the running two-seam fastball. When he lost the pitch’s location, his entire game collapsed. I say that because his sweeper is nasty, yet it didn’t matter. Hitters can lay off the sweeper if there is nothing else to keep them honest. In fact, they can even sit on a pitch as nasty as this if there is nothing else to show. With him spotting up his sinker like this again in the past two weeks, his sweeper has begun to get the soft contact it did last year. See for yourself. \n\n\nA whiff, then soft contact due to Arozarena cheating to beat the two-seamer and not beat the ball directly into the ground. It’s nice to see Loáisiga back doing his thing and pairing these two pitches to perfection.\n\n\nLuetge has one of the best left-handed sliders in all of baseball. On the year, the pitch has a .184 batting average against and is a miserable sight for any lefty. It starts at your face and ends in the other batter’s box. But this type of loop isn’t effective without another pitch to keep the hitter’s timing and swing path honest. Some batters can sit on the pitch and drill it if you’re throwing it with no other deceptive offering.\n\nA cutter right down the middle that yields a pop up. Why exactly was this pitch not drilled in the gap? The answer is Arraez saw a slider as the pitcher traveled to the plate. As he enters the swing zone, you can see him drop his shoulder and barrel, trying to lift the slider and hit the bottom part of the baseball hard. This slight variation in pitch velocity and movement fooled Arraez. Deception deception. Yankees pitchers consistently do this better than teams across the league.\nIt’s a balance of a coaching staff and individual pitcher understanding what the outlier skill is, and how to adapt everything else to play that skill up. Pitch tunneling and design are only as effective as a player’s ability to actually execute pitches and changes to their arsenal. Certain deliveries, release points, and mechanics are more suited to specific pitch locations and movements. As a collective unit, the Yankees have done a great job at complementing the sweeper. Last year it was the sinker, this year it’s the sweeper. What will the future entail? If the last couple seasons are any indication, whatever it is the Yankees cook up will help their pitchers level up again.",

In 1982, Japanese watchmaker Seiko debuted a wristwatch that could receive UHF and VHF channels, albeit the actual receiver was in a huge belt pack you had to connect to the LCD screen on your wrist.

        "description": "SWG3 Galvanizers, GlasgowLoud and lurid, the American duo fuse distorted vocals, synthetic pop and singalong punk in a madcap extravaganzaThe stage is invisible, a wall of fog lit by strobes. Two figures bounce out of the mist, one wearing a giant yellow wizard’s hat that glows fluorescent in the UV light. So dense is the dry ice, so magenta and lime green the lights, sometimes all you can see is this disembodied hat – which belongs to Dylan Brady, 50% of 100 Gecs – or an arm, sometimes attached to Laura Les, the Gecs’ other 50%.But the duo make their presence felt. Loud, lurid and packed with nagging hooks, 100 Gecs’ music provides the kind of sensory overload that powers moshpits and burrows deep into the brain with its Dr Seuss rhymes and catchy choruses. It’s fitting that you can only see parts of Brady and Les, because their music is so bitty: a barrage of noises, sugary melodies, short, sharp smash-and-grabs on your attention. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The U.S. State Department released a statement on Friday expressing concern about the Russian government’s “interference” with the rights of imprisoned Russian opposition leader Alexey Navalny, an outspoken critic of President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\n\n“The United States is deeply concerned by the Russian Government’s escalating, arbitrary interference with Aleksey Navalny’s rights,” wrote department spokesperson Ned Price.\n\n\n\nPrice said that prison officials have interfered with Navalny’s defense by forcing supervision of meetings with his lawyers and imposing delays on the exchange of documents between Navalny and his counsel.\n\n\n\n“This interference, along with his repeated diversion to solitary confinement for minor alleged infractions, is further evidence of politically motivated harassment,” Price said. \n\n\n\n“His arrest upon return to Russia was already shameful, but the Russian Government’s insistence on harassing him further only highlights its insecurity and fear of those who speak the truth.”\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has said previously that Navalny was poisoned with a nerve agent in an alleged assassination attempt by Russian officials in 2020 after he expressed support for the protests occurring in Belarus and predicted that similar turmoil would occur in Russia.\n\n\n\nHe was transferred to Germany for medical treatment following the poisoning. \n\n\n\nThe opposition figure was arrested upon his return to Russia the following January and sentenced to 2 1/2 years in prison.\n\n\n\nThe State Department released a statement last month condemning the attempt against Navalny on its two-year anniversary and calling for the Kremlin to “fully … dismantle its chemical weapons program.”\n\n\n\nSince his initial arrest, Navalny’s sentence has been extended to more than 20 years on charges of fraud and contempt of court, counts that are contested by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and European Foreign Policy Chief Josep Borrell, among others.\n\n\n\nThe Russian government has also charged Navalny for creating an “extremist group in order to incite hatred towards officials and oligarchs.”",

        "description": "PRAGUE — Fearful of high prices sparking social unrest, European governments are ladling out support, but their strategy may backfire.\n\n\n\nOn the one hand, cash-strapped voters are taking to the streets demanding an end to historically high prices; on the other hand, copious handouts and sweeping tax cuts risk doing more harm than good.\n\n\n\n“The &#8216;whatever it costs&#8217; approach would not be the right response against inflation,” French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire told reporters on the sidelines of a meeting of EU finance ministers in Prague this week. “You run the risk of feeding inflation instead of fighting inflation.”\n\n\n\nInflation keeps accelerating, averaging 9.1 percent in August across the currency zone and reaching above 20 percent in the Baltics. The European Central Bank on Thursday raised interest rates by an unprecedented 75 basis points, and warned more hikes might be needed.\n\n\n\nThe rise in prices is largely the effect of an energy supply crisis triggered by the war in Ukraine, and Russia’s decision to shut off gas supplies to Europe in retaliation for sanctions.\n\n\n\nAs a result, electricity prices — which under EU rules are linked to the price of gas — are now several times higher than a year ago, sending bills soaring and hurting businesses’ and households’ bottom lines. In Germany, Europe’s largest customer of Russian gas, power prices reached a staggering record of €1,000 per megawatt/hour in August before subsiding.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo far, the pressure to appease angry voters has had the upper hand. Governments have rushed to spend hundreds of billions of euros — in some cases amounting to several percentage points of GDP — through policies including cutting fuel excise duties and VAT rates, handouts to households, and bailouts to energy companies.&nbsp;On average, the EU spent 0.9 percent of its GDP in efforts to cushion the impact of inflation in the first eight months of 2022, a figure that&#8217;s likely to double by year’s end, Economy Commissioner Paolo Gentiloni said.\n\n\n\nBut this is largely helicopter money that doesn’t target those most in need, and runs the risk of incentivising demand and countering central bankers&#8217; efforts to rein in inflation. \n\n\n\n“When you introduce a measure, the tendency to leave it there is inevitable; and when you have a difficult situation it’s very difficult to limit your intervention to certain groups,” Gentiloni said, urging governments to make support &#8220;temporary and targeted.&#8221;\n\n\n\nBut targeting low-income groups is challenging, Irish Finance Minister and Eurogroup President Paschal Donohoe acknowledged. “Responding to help societies in a targeted way from a policy point of view is complex,” he said, adding that “scale and design” were key.\n\n\n\nFinance ministers on Friday agreed to prioritize targeted cash transfers instead of broad-based measures.\n\n\n\n“We clearly err on the side of income transfers to be more efficient,” said ECB President Christine Lagarde, noting a slight improvement in the design of aid measures, 15 percent of which are now targeted, compared to 10 percent previously.\n\n\n\nBut while public opinion has been overwhelmingly in support of Ukraine and the EU’s response to Russia’s invasion, politicians are wary that the public may turn against them and they see big spending as a means to prevent backlash and social unrest.\n\n\n\n“There is a strong political wind blowing, and we’re doing our best to lean against it and to prevent excesses from taking place,” said an EU official.",

        "description": "Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Baysox lost in their bid to claim sole possession of first place, but all other affiliates won in a good day on the farm. Triple-A: Norfolk Tides 6, Memphis Redbirds (Cardinals) 5\nThe Tides stormed out to an early 6-0 lead and then held on for dear life as the Redbirds made a tight game of it. Cole Uvila stranded the tying run at third to end the game after Memphis had scored two runs in the ninth.\nLet’s talk about Joey Ortiz, shall we? The 24-year-old fourth-round pick in 2019, ranked the Orioles’ #24 (tied) prospect in Camden Chat’s composite rankings, just continues to rake since his promotion to Triple-A. He went 3-for-5 with his second home run for Norfolk and is now slashing .409/.447/.659 with six extra-base hits in 11 games at his new home. Colton Cowser (#5), who was promoted along with Ortiz, has had a much slower adjustment. He went 0-for-4 with two strikeouts yesterday and is 3-for-38 at Norfolk. Veteran Brett Phillips lashed a two-run triple but was thrown out at home on the play.\nI admittedly had forgotten all about Alexander Wells, but the Aussie lefty made a rehab start and worked two scoreless innings. Chris Vallimont was the bulk guy, working 5.2 innings and giving up three runs. On the Memphis side, old friend T.J. McFarland worked two scoreless for the Redbirds.\nBox score\nDouble-A: Richmond Flying Squirrels (Giants) 5, Bowie Baysox 2\nThe Baysox were the only O’s affiliate to lose last night, which is a shame, because they’re the ones who most need to win. Bowie entered the series in a first-place tie with Erie for the second-half division title, but have lost the first three of this set. The good news is that Erie has done the same against Altoona, so the two clubs remain tied. \nThe Baysox tried to pull off some late-inning dramatics. Down 2-0 in the eighth, Maverick Handley and Chris Givin smacked back-to-back homers to tie the game. But Richmond’s Carter Aldrete — nephew of former big leaguer Mike Aldrete — tagged Griffin McLarty for a decisive three-run homer in the top of the ninth. \nBowie starter and Trey Mancini trade acquisition Chayce McDermott (#19) had a dominant performance on the mound, racking up nine strikeouts and holding Richmond to just one hit. Nice! He wasn’t terribly efficient, issuing three walks and leaving after 4.2 innings with 93 pitches, but overall it was much more good than bad. Among other notable prospects, Connor Norby (#12) went 1-for-4, while Coby Mayo (#6 tied) took an 0-for-4 with three strikeouts.\nBox score\nHigh-A: Aberdeen IronBirds 8, Jersey Shore BlueClaws (Phillies) 2\nThe IronBirds collected 12 hits in cruising to an easy victory over the BlueClaws. The number eight and nine hitters in the lineup, Isaac De Leon and Luis Valdez, each went 3-for-5. Valdez added two more stolen bases to his tally, giving him 70 steals in 85 attempts across two levels this year. He fast, y’all. Donta’ Williams had two hits, including a homer.\nLeadoff man Jud Fabian (#17 tied) was hitless in four at-bats. The 2022 competitive balance pick is 1-for-17 in six games for Aberdeen. Fellow recent draftee Dylan Beavers (#10) had a two-run single.\nStarter Ignacio Feliz gave up two runs in four innings, walking three and fanning seven. He has 135 strikeouts in 92.2 innings, a superb 13.1 K/9 rate. Behind him, Houston Roth, Dylan Heid, and Nick Richmond combined for five scoreless, hitless innings of relief, though each surrendered two walks.\nBox score\nLow-A: Delmarva Shorebirds 3, Down East Wood Ducks (Rangers) 1\nA three-run rally in the second inning was all the Shorebirds needed to secure the victory, thanks to an excellent three-man pitching effort. Right-hander Tyler Joyner, rehabbing from Norfolk, allowed one run in 2.2 innings, and Conor Grady did fantastic bulk work, tossing 4.1 scoreless innings and striking out seven. Righty Trace Bright, the Orioles’ 2022 fifth-round pick, finished things up with two scoreless frames for his first professional save.\nNumber one overall pick Jackson Holliday (#3 prospect) was 0-for-2 but drew two free passes. The 18-year-old Holliday has more walks (15) than strikeouts (10) in his 12 games at Low-A. Second baseman Adam Crampton drove in a pair of runs. \nBox score\nSaturday’s scheduled games:\n\nNorfolk: at Memphis, 4:05 PM. Starter: Birthday boy Mike Baumann (2-6, 4.20)\nBowie: vs. Richmond, 6:35 PM. Starter: Brenan Hanifee (2-1, 4.64)\nAberdeen: at Jersey Shore, 7:05 PM. Starter: TBD\nDelmarva: vs. Down East, 7:05 PM. Starter: TBD",

The most successful online casinos tend to be in countries with solvent players, and Australia is very successful in this regard. Read the article material and understand the top online casino for real money in Australia here; we have highlighted the best options in the list:\n\nGolden Crown - truly the best online casino in Australia, with a fantastic welcome bonus and loads of free spins.\nPipper Casino is an excellent casino with various games and no deposit bonus.\nDazard is one of Australia’s most online real money casinos with fabulous free spins bonuses and state-of-the-art software.\n\n  \n        \n  \nThe most popular gambling developers\nAustralian online casinos for real money care about the quality of gaming software, and are often willing to overpay for the services of a well-known developer. So here we have a list of the most popular game developers:\n\nMicrogaming is the oldest game company, founded back in 1994. This company has earned its reputation for hard work and its main feature - progressive slots.\nPlaytech is one of the gambling industry’s most prominent gaming corporations, with more than 5000 employees.\nNet Entertainment is a famous Swedish company with more than two hundred well-known gambling games on its account. \n\n  \n        \n  \nTrends in the market of casino games for real money\nThe Australian gambling market is quite rich and developing at a fast pace. This is because the standard of living in Australia is very high; it allows many people, especially the older generation, to spend their time playing games without fear of getting into debt or spending their last money. \nAnalysts predict that we expect a steady growth of about 8 percent annually in the gambling industry over the next five years.\nAt the time of 2022, the value of Australia’s gambling market is about 4 billion dollars. The average amount of deposits from one player exceeds a thousand dollars annually.\nThe highest authorities controlling the gambling business in Australia\nThe high level of gaming culture in Australia and the opportunity to earn real money in the casino is primarily the merit of careful regulatory agencies. It is the total control of compliance with all regulations and ensures the game’s safety and customers’ trustworthiness. Here are all the significant authorities that operate in Australia:\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nLegislative policy on gambling\nThe Australian government tries in every possible way to limit the activities of online casinos when playing for real money. In 2001, an important law was passed that actually prohibits casino owners from offering online gambling format: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Gambling_Act_2001. Still, the players themselves are not affected by this law and cannot be punished, so many people use illegal casino services.\nAll gambling businesses must be registered in Australia and have licenses issued by the authorized body. \nTaxation of winnings at online casinos in Australia\nAustralians are not harassed in terms of taxes on online casino winnings; the government spares players from this burden. According to the law, gambling income is unpredictable and cannot be consistently provided for a person.\nHowever, online casino owners are required to pay some percentage of their business income. The taxes vary from state to state and are often subject to adjustment.\nDisclaimer\nRemember, players under 21 are not allowed to gamble in casinos. If you do decide to become a player—do not lose your head and play for fun, not spending every penny in the hope of winning back or get rich.",

Use it in good health.\nBut we live in a competitive society, and so the one company that produces iOS-based phones and the myriad brands that make Android-based phones always feel that they need to explain why their product is more spectacular, more flexible, more secure, more fun, and more whatever than the ones powered by the other OS. As a result, whenever a company introduces a feature that’s new to its OS, it proclaims it as innovative, wonderful, and never seen before. Anyone who has attended or watched a product introduction — from Apple, Google, or Samsung —...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "The ‘hot chef’ sensation of Darren Star’s romantic comedy has roles in two new films that offer the chance to show he’s more than a heart-throbLucas Bravo, the French actor who shot to fame in 2020 playing Gabriel, AKA the “hot chef”, in Netflix’s Emily in Paris, would like to put a few rumours to bed. The first concerns his bank balance. “I saw on the internet the other day that my net worth is $1m,” he says, with incredulity. “Imagine! There’s this impression that you do just one project and have this visibility, and suddenly you have a house in the [Hollywood] hills and you’re set for life.” Another is that, prior to acting, his main job was modelling. Given the thirst that erupted on social media when he first appeared in Emily in Paris, this wouldn’t seem unlikely. “I am not a model,” he says firmly. “My parents did take me to an agency when I was 16, and I did one runway for Paul Smith, but the experience wasn’t for me. Fashion felt like a cold place and I was too sensitive for it.”Bravo, 34, lives in Paris, though he is talking from a hotel in New York where, fresh from an appearance on a US chatshow, he is wearing a floral shirt. Set against the flowery wallpaper and matching floral curtains behind him, he has the appearance of having melted into the wall. “The shirt seemed like a good idea when it was given to me this morning but I didn’t know I was going to end up in this room,” he says, anxiously. “It’s, um, a lot of information.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "President Joe Biden recently stood in front of a blood-red background in Philadelphia, framed by two Marines, to denounce millions of \"MAGA Republicans\" and his political&nbsp;opponents as \"semi-fascist\" extremists.&nbsp;In Wilkes-Barre, Pa., former president Donald Trump stood before his followers and denounced Biden as an \"enemy of the state\" and the FBI as \"vicious monsters.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough I have previously expressed alarm over what I call the \"age of rage,\" we are seeing a more serious turn as our leaders fuel that rage in hopes of retaining or regaining power.\n\n\n\nNot surprisingly, polls show more than 40 percent of voters now believe we are&nbsp;heading into a civil war.&nbsp;Not only are more columnists discussing the approach of&nbsp;a possible civil war, President Biden&nbsp;reportedly&nbsp;told a senior Democrat: “I certainly hope [my presidency] works out. If it doesn’t, I’m not sure we’re going to have a country.”\n\n\n\nA Trafalgar poll&nbsp;shows a majority of Americans believe Biden tried to \"incite conflict\" with his Philadelphia speech. Given an opportunity to assume higher ground after that speech, Trump instead engaged in the same kind of unhinged rhetoric. Liberal and conservative pundits add to all that by discussing the gathering clouds of civil war while&nbsp;blaming each other.\n\n\n\nWhile many insist there is a systemic failure of our&nbsp;political system, the United States faces not a constitutional crisis but a crisis of leadership, because both parties view rage as a political weapon.\n\n\n\nAs polls show the midterm election tightening, both parties appear to be giving up reason in favor of rage for better results.\n\n\n\nDespite our history of highly divisive periods, this is one of the most dangerous we have encountered.\n\n\n\nI recently completed a study of what I call \"rage rhetoric\" and how our country has addressed such periods, legally and politically, from colonial to contemporary times. Rage politics is the most dangerous form of demagoguery. With the rise of democracy came a rise in demagogues who sought to use rage to generate popular support. As Aristotle noted, demagogues “are like the fishers for eels; in still waters they catch nothing, but if they thoroughly stir up the slime, their fishing is good.\" The fishing is particularly good today, as people tend to receive their news from siloed, partisan sources.\n\n\n\nRage politics is nothing new\n\n\n\nRage politics is not new to America, and the period that is most similar to today occurred at the very start of our republic.\n\n\n\nAt the start of the 19th century, the newly minted nation was deeply divided between Federalists aligned with John Adams and Democratic-Republicans aligned with Thomas Jefferson. President Adams labeled Jeffersonians as “seditionists,\"&nbsp;while Jefferson referred to the Adams administration as \"the reign of the witches.”\n\n\n\nAdams sought to punish his opponents through the infamous Alien and Sedition Acts. Vermont Rep. Matthew Lyon was prosecuted for criticizing Adams’ “unbounded thirst for ridiculous pomp, foolish adulation, and selfish avarice.” Adams seemed eager to prove the point through partisan prosecutions. Twenty-five leading Democratic-Republicans were arrested, including journalists; others were threatened with arrest if they uttered such thoughts.\n\n\n\nFederalist journalist William Cobbett called Jeffersonians \"frog-eating, man-eating, blood-drinking cannibals\" and the \"refuse of nations.\" Federalist newspapers&nbsp;predicted that if the Jeffersonians prevailed, then “murder, robbery, rape, adultery, and incest will be openly taught and practiced, the air will be rent with the cries of the distressed, the soil will be soaked with blood, and the nation black with crimes.”\n\n\n\nNot unlike today, Supreme Court justices also were threatened. Then-Chief Justice John Jay was hated for his negotiation of what became known as the Jay Treaty with Great Britain; he was a target of Democratic-Republicans who considered the court a cabal of political activists. One editorial declared: “John Jay, ah! The Arch traitor — seize him, drown him, flay him alive.” Crowds burned Jay in effigy, including a Kentucky mob that stuffed its effigy with gunpowder, guillotined it, then blew it up. Jay remarked that he could travel the \"country at night by the light of [my] burning&nbsp;effigies.”\n\n\n\nLater, Chief Justice John Marshall also was burned in effigy after writing the famous opinion in Marbury v. Madison. While the opinion is known for laying the foundations of judicial authority, it was an outgrowth of Adams’ attempt to appoint a slew of \"Midnight judges\" in his final hours as president, in order to dominate the courts. (Sound familiar?)\n\n\n\nToday’s leaders seek to garner support by leading the mob. In 2020, for example, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)&nbsp;declared on the steps of the Supreme Court:&nbsp;“I want to tell you, [Justice] Gorsuch, I want to tell you, [Justice] Kavanaugh, you have released the whirlwind and you will pay the price. You won’t know what hit you if you go forward with these awful decisions.”\n\n\n\nWin-at-any-cost strategy\n\n\n\nPeople like Schumer hardly make convincing revolutionaries. They want to tap into the energy of rage while assuming it will be directed solely at their opponents — but history often has proven such assumptions wrong. Revolutions take on an appetite of their own; French journalist Jacques Mallet du Pan famously observed during the French Revolution that “like Saturn, the Revolution devours its children.”\n\n\n\nToday's rage rhetoric is strikingly similar to what we saw in the Adams-Jefferson period. Though many denounced Biden's speech as inflammatory and divisive, others complained it did not go far enough. MSNBC regular&nbsp;Elie Mystal objected to Biden's use of \"MAGA Republicans\" when, he claimed, all Republicans are white supremacists. Mystal and others have denounced the Constitution as&nbsp;“trash,”&nbsp;and even some law professors want to “reclaim America from Constitutionalism.”\n\n\n\nRather than temper such passions, both Biden and Trump appear intent on fueling the rage to win at any cost in 2022 and 2024.&nbsp;With leaders on both sides trafficking in rage politics, it is hardly surprising that&nbsp;Americans expect an increase in political violence.\n\n\n\nFortunately, our&nbsp;Constitution was not just written for times like these, it was written and ratified in times like these. It (and we) have survived.\n\n\n\nAs we did in the 1800s, we will not commit the self-immolation advocated by so many — but the costs are likely to be high, due to the failure of leadership that is fueling this crisis of faith.\n\n\n\nAuthor James Freeman Clarke once said “a politician thinks of the next election; a statesman thinks of the next generation.” Today, we have far too many politicians and far too few statesmen at an increasingly perilous moment.\n\n\n\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University. Follow him on Twitter @JonathanTurley.",

        "description": "Photo by Tim Heitman/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Friday’s trip around the four Dodgers affiliates results in a blowout win, a pair of losses and a suspended game due to rain.\nPlayer of the day\nLeonel Valera was 3-for-6 with a double and two singles to drive in five of his teams 14 runs Friday. The 23-year-old has been solid over the last 25 games, driving in 25 runs while going 27-for-95 (.284) with six homers, two triples and two doubles.\n\n\nLeonel Valera had 3 hits and 5 RBIs for Tulsa and is hitting .354 so far in September with 13 RBIs and an OPS over 1.000. #dodgers pic.twitter.com/jlEbmYtevj— Dodger Poke Report (@dodger_poke) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nTriple-A Oklahoma City\nOklahoma City starter Michael Grove was touched up for five runs in the first four innings and despite the bullpen allowing just one run the rest of the way, the deficit was too much to overcome. OKC could only get halfway, falling 6-3 to Tacoma (Mariners).\nThe loss drops the Dodgers into a tie for first place in the PCL East, with El Paso (Padres) winning Friday night. Round Rock (Rangers) lost their game and remains a game behind the pair in a race that has really tightened over the last two weeks.\nAmazingly, the Dodgers were 3-for-7 with runners in scoring position but only one of those hits brought in a run. After OKC loaded the bases with nobody out in the seventh, Devin Mann grounded into a double play to score a run.\nThe first two runners reached in the eighth when Andy Burns singled home a run and brought Edwin Ríos to the plate with a chance to get OKC back in the game. Ríos collected a run batted in but on a sac fly and they wouldn’t score again.\nRehabbing pitcher Danny Duffy pitched another scoreless inning Friday, stranding a one-out double. Friday was the fifth scoreless effort in the past six appearances on this rehab assignment.\nDouble-A Tulsa\nTulsa was already up by a pair when they unleashed a six-run seventh and five-run ninth to win 14-2 over Frisco (Rangers).\nThe Drillers loaded the bases with nobody out to start the seventh, setting the table for the top of the order to do some damage. Valera grounded out to second to bring in the first run of the inning, followed by a two-run single for Justin Yurchak. Three batters later, Andy Pages singled home two more and Kody Hoese capped it off with a single to drive in Pages.\nYurchak’s seventh-inning single allowed him to up his on-base streak to 22 consecutive games. Since July 1, Yurchak has hit for a .346 average.\nA total of four batters turned in multi-hit efforts for Tulsa, including Jeren Kendall who had a solid night at the plate. The former first rounder went 3-for-4 with three runs scored and an RBI-single in the big ninth inning. Pages finished 3-for-5 with the pair of RBI and Ryan Ward went 2-for-5 with two doubles and two runs scored.\n\n\nAndy Pages had 3 hits including his 25th double and 3 RBIs for Tulsa. Pages has 2 doubles, 3 RBIs, 2 runs scored, and 6 total bases in the last 2 games with Frisco. #dodgers pic.twitter.com/QexVTmtwM2— Dodger Poke Report (@dodger_poke) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nCombining with Valera’s big night, the quartet accounted for 11 of the team’s 15 hits.\nTulsa pitching was outstanding Friday, holding the RoughRiders to two runs (one earned) on four hits and four walks while striking out 11. Starter Lael Lockhart was lifted one out away from completing five innings on one-run ball, striking out five in the process.\nHigh-A Great Lakes\nFor the third time in this series, the game ended in a shutout. Unfortunately for the Loons, it’s the second time it’s fallen in the L column for them, dropping a 4-0 game to West Michigan (Tigers) Friday.\nAll four runs of the game were scored in the first inning on a run-scoring single for Jake Holton, immediately followed by a three-run blast for Izaac Pacheco. Both teams managed only three hits the rest of the eight scoreless innings.\nLow-A Rancho Cucamonga\nRancho has a 6-2 lead over Lake Elsinore (Padres) in the home half of the third when the game is resumed Saturday.\n\n\nDue to weather circumstances, the Quakes will continue tonight’s game tomorrow at 5 p.m. in a double header against the LE Storm ☔️ pic.twitter.com/Vl4Nbl12xO— Rancho Cucamonga Quakes (@RCQuakes) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nTransactions\nLow-A: Rancho Cucamonga Quakes activated OF Kyle Nevin from the 7-day injured list.

        "description": "Photo by Daniel Shirey/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Can the Yankees’ top prospect still make an impact in the big leagues this season? Although he should, it feels unlikely, thouhnot impossible. Knock, knock, knock.\nDo you hear that?\nKnock, knock, knock.\nIt’s a noise we’ve heard twice in the past month, once for Oswaldo Cabrera, once for Oswald Peraza.\nKnock, knock, knock.\nThat’s the sound of Anthony Volpe, the Yankees’ top prospect and the fifth-ranked prospect in baseball, knocking on the door of the major leagues. Promoted to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre after Oswald Peraza received the call to The Show, Volpe struck out in two of his first three plate appearances at the Triple-A level. Since then, however, he’s gone 11-for-22 with two home runs, two doubles, and two stolen bases, working three walks and striking out just twice. It’s a small sample size, but even so, he’s absolutely pummeled opposing pitchers to the point where it’s easy to wonder whether he even needs time in Scranton.\n\nIt’s a fair question. It’s not unheard of, after all, for top prospects to skip the uppermost level of the minor leagues and instead jump straight from Double-A to the Majors. Seattle Mariners outfielder Julio Rodríguez played just 46 games in Double-A before opening the season as Seattle’s starting center fielder. The Atlanta Braves promoted Michael Harris straight from Double-A Mississippi back in May. Each has a strong case for the Rookie of the Year Award in his respective league.\nLooking further back, we can find some players that made the jump to join a team in the middle of a pennant race. Back in 2016, Andrew Benintendi was called up by the Red Sox on August 2nd after just 63 games with the Double-A Portland Sea Dogs, as they sought outfield help for a team sending Brock Holt into left field on a daily basis. The Chicago Cubs called up Kyle Schwarber twice in 2015, once for a weeklong cameo in June and then for good in July. His first call-up came straight from Double-A, and between his two stints with Chicago, he spent just 17 days with the Triple-A Iowa Cubs. Volpe would be in good company, and Keith Law of The Athletic was already banging the “Volpe to the majors” drum when he was still in Somerset.\nOf course, the question with Volpe isn’t whether or not prospects of his pedigree have been able to successfully make the jump with no experience at Triple-A (or, as it would be in Volpe’s case, practically none). The question, rather, is what that potential path is. With less than a month left in the International League season and a shave under a month left in the Yankee season, there really isn’t enough time for Volpe to hit well enough for a long enough stretch to truly force the issue, especially considering how cautious the Yankees have been promoting their prospects of late.\nTime left in the season may not be on Volpe’s side. However, the Yankees are currently plagued by the one thing that accelerates prospect timelines with frequency: injuries. At the moment, DJ LeMahieu, Anthony Rizzo, Matt Carpenter, Andrew Benintendi, and Harrison Bader are on the injured list, while Giancarlo Stanton has battled a foot injury and has barely played the last few days. Currently, the only position player on the 40-man not already on the active roster is Everson Pereira (thanks to Ben Rortvedt’s recent promotion with Jose Trevino on the paternity list). If anyone else goes down, they’ll have to make room for another player. And if you’re going to add somebody to the 40-man, why not add Volpe?\nIt’s unlikely, of course, especially since the Yankees are actually at a spot where they need to free up 40-man spots for players who might be activated from the 60-day IL in upcoming days: Bader, Luis Severino, Zack Britton, and Miguel Castro. Still...\nKnock, knock, knock.\nIf Volpe keeps knocking, nothing’s impossible.",

        "description": "Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Drew Smyly turns in a strong effort in a 4-2 Cubs win This was the kind of game that makes you roll your eyes a little bit. Not because anything bad happened, but because the team looked so polished after getting pounded on Wednesday and then letting one get away in the ninth inning on Thursday. On Friday? The Cubs just executed. The Giants are pretty clearly a better team than the Reds at this point,  but the Cubs just fired on all cylinders yesterday. \nThere is that old cliché about momentum being as good as that day’s starting pitcher. If that were fully true, of course, the Cubs would have won Thursday when they wasted a good start by Adrian Sampson. But, a big hat tip to Drew Smyly for making it two straight good starts for the Cubs. It is easy to hang your head after the team allows four late runs in a 4-3 loss. \nSmyly upped Sampson’s performance by one inning, throwing seven scoreless and allowing only a double, two walks and hitting a batter. He did face one batter into the eighth and induce a ground ball that turned into an error. Two of those other four runners happened in the second inning and then Smyly really locked in. I hope the Cubs have been able to sell Drew on being a part of what is building here again. Like most fans, I’m good at spending Cubs money, but I’d find a way to keep him here, even if it meant guaranteeing some extra money in the form of another option year with a buyout or something like that. Certainly I’d understand if Drew wants to get on the market after a really nice season like this one though. \nDrew is the easy choice for my top star of the game. The second spot has to go to Nico Hoerner. The Cubs only had five hits and he had two of them. One of those left the yard with a man on base. He also stole a base. Nico has been a star this season. He’s had a 4.1 fWAR season. The value comes more from the glove than the bat, but the bat has produce wRC+ of 110. He’ll have a chance of producing a 10 HR/20 SB season, needing one homer and two stolen bases to get there. \nIt’s always going to be tough for a guy without a lot of power to sustain value as they age. Defensive skills and speed erode over time. I’m wishful thinking that Nico can progress at least a little like a Ryne Sandberg who still wasn’t any kind of thundering power hitter in his MVP season of 1984. If you haven’t watched in a while, look at the swing of Ryne Sandberg in the “Sandberg/Sutter” game. He was a line drive hitter that just found the seats occasionally. Of course looking at the career progression of one of the best players ever to play the game is folly. But I’m going to dream anyway.\nMy third choice has to be Yan Gomes. Yan is a glove first backup catcher. But he’s having a nice homestand at the plate and he had a two-run homer and a walk on Friday. His homer in the bottom of the second (with Hoerner aboard) came after Smyly’s roughest inning and gave Drew a little breathing room. Yan provides really great value as a backup catcher. I think his bat has to leave you wanting if he’s in there every day. But he seems so steady with the glove, I’ve heard nothing bad about his game calling and he does  have some occasional pop. \nHeroes and Goats recognizes one player I didn’t and I’ll give the extra hat tip here. I usually only recognize a reliever if they go multiple innings or are perfect. Every Cubs fan knows just how difficult the last four outs of a game can be. But Brandon only needed five batters to record them. He did yield a single, but was otherwise nasty. \nBrandon has flashed some serious potential and as is always the case with late inning relievers, you are dealing with razor thin margins. He can certainly be an excellent back of the game reliever. It’s there in front of him. He needs to continue to put in the hard work that got him here after being a late converter to pitching full time. He’ll surely be challenged next year as he develops and more and more scouting develops on him. But he has a real chance to be the next really strong bullpen product from the Cubs system. \nLet’s go to the official numbers on Heroes and Goats and show you how WPA scored it. \nGame 138, September 9: Cubs 4, Giants 2 (58-80)\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs\n  \nReminder: Heroes and Goats are determined by WPA scores and are in no way subjective.\nTHREE HEROES:\n\n\nSuperhero: Drew Smyly (.335). 7IP (25 batters), H, 2BB, R (0ER), 8K, HBP (W 6-8)\n\nHero: Brandon Hughes (.175). 1⅓ IP (5 batters), H, K (Sv 4)\n\nSidekick: Nico Hoerner (.165). 2-3, HR, 2RBI, 2R, SB\n\nTHREE GOATS:\n\n\nBilly Goat: Manuel Rodriguez (-.105). ⅔ IP (5 batters), H, 2BB, R, K\n\nGoat: Seiya Suzuki (-.042). 1-4, 3K\n\nKid: Alfonso Rivas (-.034). 0-3, 2K\n\nWPA Play of the Game: Yan Gomes’ second inning two-run homer off of Carlos Rodon set the tone for this one. (.137)\n*Giants Play of the Game: Evan Longoria’s two-run double with the bases loaded in the eighth inning. (.103)\n\nRizzo Award Cumulative Standings: (Top 5/Bottom 5)\nThe award is named for Anthony Rizzo, who finished first in this category three of the first four years it was in existence and four times overall. He also recorded the highest season total ever at +65.5. The point scale is three points for a Superhero down to negative three points for a Billy Goat.\n\nDavid Robertson +22.5\nNico Hoerner +17.5\nScott Effross +17\nChristopher Morel +14\nPatrick Wisdom +13.5\nDaniel Norris/Frank Schwindel -9.5\nRowan Wick -10.5\nYan Gomes -13\nJason Heyward/Rafael Ortega -15.5\n\nUp Next: Game two of the three game set. Marcus Stroman’s numbers look pretty mundane (3-6, 3.73). One of the reasons? He’s struggled at Wrigley Field. I know he was very excited to be here. He doesn’t seem like the type that the moment would get to, so I don’t know what the explanation is. Hopefully, he can post a couple of strong starts heading into the offseason and have that behind him before 2023 gets here. \nLogan Webb (12-8, 2.89) has been terrific for the Giants. This looks like a tough game. Let’s see if the Cubs can make it two straight.",

        "description": "Scenes like this will be rarer in 2023 — and the game is going to get crazier as a result. | Richard Rodriguez/Getty Images\n    \n\n\n  Reporting on the new 2023 restrictions has completely buried the lede; stolen base numbers are going to explode When we reported the rules changes approved for 2023 yesterday, we got one aspect wrong. But it wasn’t really a mistake, at least not one you could blame us for.\nOne of the four main rules changes, “rubber disengagement,” contains a restriction on the battery (and a boon to baserunners) that seemed too unbelievable to be true: Pitchers may only make two pickoff attempts per at-bat.\nIf this is the rule, and as Friday went on it sunk it as truth, it effectively means just one pickoff attempt, because pitchers will have to “save” their second in case the runner just starts walking to second base. And if you DO make two moves, then the runner WILL be able to walk to second base. \nOf course, runners can still be caught too far off-base, and pitchers with great moves to first will be their own deterrent against the running game. But runners will find new ways to draw pickoff attempts, and the only goal is to get to two ... because once a pitcher throws over twice, the battle is over and the runner gets second base — he can lead off 40 feet if he wants.\nSo, draw a throw and get back safely — not automatic, but also pretty scientific — and you’re thisclose to earning a free bag.\nThe new restrictions on pickoff attempts have far more ramifications for the game than a pitch clock or defensive shifting, the two rules changes that are getting all of the attention. The restrictions basically will allow any base-stealer worth their salt to run freely. It will render stolen base records to date invalid. And it could turn 75% of current catchers into DHs.\nGiving a MLB baserunner an extra half-step, which at minimum this does, plus the few inches reduced between bases (the larger base) should make Billy Hamilton $50 million next year.\nI know, I know, what’s wrong with me that this is making me nuts? Well, some players in the White Sox system (the pickoff restrictions have been in play for all of 2022 in the minors) have been running wild — or, at least, very successfully — with stolen bases:\nDJ Gladney: 10-of-11 (91%)Duke Ellis: 56-of-65 (86%)D.J. Burt: 41-of-48 (85%)Adam Haseley: 16-of-19 (84%)Wilber Sánchez: 38-of-46 (83%)José Rodríguez: 40-of-50 (80%)James Beard: 28-of-37 (76%)Misael González: 13-of-17 (76%)J.J. Muno: 23-of-31 (74%)Yoelqui Céspedes: 30-of-41 (73%)Tyler Neslony: 19-of-26 (73%) \n(Remember, metrics studies from Tom Tango’s The Book on down indicate that as low as a 66-70% success rate on SBs makes the effort worthwhile.)\nCharlotte Knights: 103-of-158 (65%)Birmingham Barons: 182-of-239 (76%)Winston-Salem Dash: 111-of-141 (79%)Kannapolis Cannon Ballers: 135-of-168 (80%)TOTAL: 531-of-706 (75%)\nYeah, yeah, these are probably the numbers every year, right? Wrong. And remember, the White Sox system is very bad, so its positive numbers (like, steals) are going to lag behind all the better teams they compete against.\n\nCharlotte’s International League division in Triple-A went from 1,895 steals at a 76% rate in 2021 to 2,456 (and counting) at a 78% rate\nBirmingham’s Southern League division in Double-A went from 679 steals at a 69% rate in 2021 to 1,227 (and counting) at a 77% rate\nWinston-Salem’s Sally League division in High-A went from 1,333 steals at a 74% rate in 2021 to 1,782 (and counting) at a 77% rate\nKannapolis’ Carolina League division in Low-A went from 1,838 steals at a 78% rate in 2021 to 2,261 (and counting) at a 79% rate\n\nDarren Black, our minors analyst, has pooh-poohed my ranting, surmising that the better baserunners will steal, and steal successfully, more often with these rules — nothing more. \nBut in the majors, there is no development time, or skill exercises that may be getting played out in real time, to interfere with the sheer mechanics of the game; Project Birmingham is literally being run as a sort of extended instructional league for the Sox in Double-A this month. MLB, on the other hand, will be cutthroat from Opening Day; anyone mastering a read of pitcher moves and developing the ability to draw a throw will be turning walks and singles into doubles and triples.\nIsn’t that always the case in baseball? Sure, to a degree. But the finite nature of the limited-pickoffs rule is what kills me. This is a milder form of, but akin to, a three-ball walk, or the batter getting to specify the next pitch thrown on a three-ball count.\nThis rule is going to create HAVOC. Rickey Henderson should come out of retirement.\nEventually, pitchers may adjust and try to let runners hang themselves with aggressiveness or overconfidence. But best case in the immediate term is that pitchers will have to give the baserunner his biggest ca. 2022 lead and just let it be. Or, throw over once, fail to get him 99% of the time, and then let him duplicate that big lead — the one he probably steals successfully on 90+% of the time — and go.\nFor certain elite base-stealers, they will be impossible to be stopped unless they get themselves thrown out (wheels spin, stumble). For smart base-runners, it will be nearly impossible. Anyone with speed, even a bad baserunner? Your rate of success just broke 50%, or even 60%.\nThis pickoff restriction fundamentally changes the game. Will the game adjust? It always does. But restricting pickoff throws plays with the physics of the game in a really big way. There simply aren’t enough big-armed catchers to offset the advantages baserunners now have. \nSure, maybe five years from now the James McCanns will get paid Mike Trout money to stop the running game, every catcher in the majors will have a killer cannon and instantaneous pop times, and we’ll see RFs and 3Bs, or even SSs and CFs, get turned into backstops. But until that time, the base paths are going to be on fire.\nPitch outs? Sure, we’ll see more. And that means more walks. Or, possibly a good consequence: Forcing pitchers to attack the zone more (due to wasted pitches) and more balls in play. We’ll see; I’d gamble we’ll just see more SBs lead to into unplanned IBBs that keep force plays in order. More scoring? Sure. Bastardized SB totals? Probably.\nIncreased base size alone will make 1-2% more attempts successful — or hell, maybe 5-10%. On top of that, now a pitcher basically can’t throw over, and a runner has to in essence pick himself off?\nUnder these rules, Henderson would have had 300 steals a year, and 4,000 career SBs. For an elite or even just smart baserunner, now even third base is better than a 50/50 proposition.\nHe won’t be, but Hamilton should be a very rich man next year. A smart team will snap him up. A Duke Ellis as a pinch-running specialist will turn a walk into a triple, EVERY TIME.\nAt the MLB level, this rule change is going to be jack up the running game. EVERY TIME Hamilton gets on, he will be on second. Of course, you can’t steal first. But turning EVERY walk into a double is no small ripple in the game.\nVery good base-stealers will go from 75%+ to 90% or better, and that includes more attempts at 3B. Maybe even increased thefts of home.\nWith this change, if the White Sox don’t bring back Grinder Ball or pull out the Let’s Go, Go-Go White Sox speed for 2023, they are blowing a big opportunity. They might want to look into re-acquired McCannon, too.",

        "description": "On this day 45 years ago, Wilbur Wood bruised some Angels. | Focus on Sport/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Choose your poison: killer heat or an errant knuckleball 1930\nFuture Hall-of-Famer Luke Appling made his White Sox debut. It was the start of the legacy of great Sox shortstops, which would include Chico Carrasquel, Luis Aparicio and Ozzie Guillén. \nAppling went 1-for-4 in a 6-2 loss to the Red Sox. \n\n1954\nPaul Richards, one of the greatest managers in club history, resigned to accept a dual position of general and field manager for the Baltimore Orioles. Richards was the man credited with turning around the fortunes of the franchise in 1951 with his aggressive running/pitching/defense philosophy. White Sox pitcher Billy Pierce called Richards the smartest manager he ever had. Richards was also credited with turning around Nellie Fox, helping make him into a very good hitter. \nRichards left because the White Sox were not willing to give him a multi-year contract extension or a raise, and because of personal disagreements he had with GM Frank “Trader” Lane.\n\n1967\nComing off of two straight losses to the Tigers and in danger of falling out of the pennant race, Joe Horlen threw a no-hitter. \nAlmost 24,000 Sox fans saw Horlen win, 6-0. White Sox second baseman Wayne Causey saved the no-hitter with a grab of a smash up the middle off the bat of Jerry Lumpe in the ninth inning. Causey’s throw just nipped Lumpe at the bag. Horlen hit a Tiger and another reached base on an error, other than that, he was perfect on the afternoon.\nRookie Cisco Carlos then shut out Detroit, 4-0, in the second game, vaulting the Sox right back into pennant contention. It was the last time in franchise history the White Sox threw doubleheader shutouts.\n\n1976\nNolan Ryan struck out 18 White Sox in a 3-2 win at Comiskey Park. Chicago rallied to tie the game, 2-2, in the bottom of the sixth, after a walk to Jim Essian, a single by Jim Spencer and a two-run double from Jorge Orta. Two more walks (Ryan had nine in the game) loaded the bases with two outs, but Alan Bannister popped out to right field to end the threat. California came right back during their next bats to take the lead, on a run-scoring double.\nRyan finished strong, striking out the final five White Sox batters he saw in the game, but only after loading the bases again in the eighth inning.\nAlso, it was on this day the White Sox activated 52-year-old Minnie Miñoso, making him an active player in the majors for his fourth decade. He would make his season debut in the next day’s game.\n\n1977\nWhite Sox pitcher Wilbur Wood tied an AL record by hitting three Angels hitters in a row, in the first inning of the club’s 6-1 loss at Anaheim. With two out and a man on, Wood hit Dave Kingman, Don Baylor and Dave Chalk.",

        "description": "Two days after his mother&#x27;s death elevated him to the throne, King Charles III was officially proclaimed Britain’s monarch Saturday in a pomp-filled ceremony steeped in ancient tradition and political symbolism — and, for the first time, broadcast live online and on air.Charles, who spent seven decades as heir apparent, automatically became king when his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, died on Thursday. But the accession ceremony was a key constitutional and ceremonial step in introducing the new monarch to the country, a relic of a time before mass communications.Scores of senior British politicians past and present, including new Prime Minister Liz Truss and five of her predecessors, gathered in the ornate state apartments at St. James’s Palace for the meeting of the Accession Council.They met without Charles, officially confirming his title, King Charles III. The king then joined them, vowing to follow his mother’s “inspiring example” as he took on the duties of monarch.“I am deeply aware of this great inheritance and of the duties and heavy responsibilities of sovereignty which have now passed to me,” he said.Speaking of his personal grief, he said: “I know how deeply you and the entire nation, and I think I may say the whole world, sympathize with me in this irreparable loss we have all suffered.&quot;The new king formally approved a series of orders — including one declaring the day of his mother&#x27;s funeral a public holiday. The date of the state funeral has not been announced, but it is expected to be around Sept. 19.This is the first time the accession ceremony has been held since 1952, when Queen Elizabeth II took the throne.Charles was accompanied at the ceremony by his wife Camilla, the Queen Consort, and his eldest son Prince William. William is now heir to the throne and is now known by the title that Charles long held, Prince of Wales.The ceremony ended with a royal official publicly proclaiming King Charles III the monarch from a balcony at the palace. In centuries past, this would have been the first official confirmation the public had of their new sovereign.David White, the Garter King of Arms, made the proclamation flanked by trumpeters in gold-trimmed robes before leading cheers — “hip, hip, hooray!” — for the new king.Gun salutes rang out in Hyde Park, at the Tower of London and at military sites around the U.K. as he announced the news, and scarlet-robed soldiers in the palace courtyard doffed their bearskin hats in a royal salute.The proclamation was read out in the medieval City of London and at other locations across the U.K.Two days after the 96-year-old queen died at Balmoral Castle in Scotland following an unprecedented 70 years on the throne, people still came by the thousands to pay their respects outside Buckingham Palace in London. The scene was repeated at other royal residences across the U.K. and at British embassies around the world.Britain is holding a period of mourning for the queen, with days of carefully choreographed ceremonies marking the death of the only monarch most people have ever known.For many Britons, her passing, though long expected, is a destabilizing experience. It comes at a time when many Britons are facing an energy crisis, the soaring cost of living, the uncertainties of the war in Ukraine and the fallout from Brexit.The country has also just seen a change of leader. Truss was appointed by the queen on Tuesday, just two days before the monarch died. On Saturday, Truss and other senior U.K. lawmakers lined up in the House of Commons to take an oath of loyalty to the new king.Normal parliamentary business has been suspended during a period of mourning for the queen. The House of Commons was holding a rare Saturday session so lawmakers could pay tribute to the late monarch.Charles struck a note of continuity on Friday, vowing in a televised address to carry on the queen’s “lifelong service,” with his own modernizing stamp.The new monarch looked to both the past — noting his mother’s unwavering “dedication and devotion as sovereign” — and the future, seeking to strike a reassuring note of constancy while signaling that his will be a 21st-century monarchy.He reflected on how the country had changed dramatically during the queen’s reign into a society “of many cultures and many faiths,” and pledged to serve people in Britain and the 14 other countries where he is king “whatever may be your background or beliefs.”He also tried to overcome a reputation for aloofness in his first hours as monarch, spending time shaking hands with some of the thousands who came to leave flowers and pay tribute to the queen at the gates of Buckingham Palace. He was greeted with shouts of “Well done, Charlie!” and “God save the king!” One woman gave him a kiss on the cheek.In the next few days the queen’s body will be brought from Balmoral, first to Edinburgh and then to London, where she will lie in state before a funeral at Westminster Abbey.In his speech, Charles struck a personal note, speaking of his sorrow at the loss of “my darling Mama.”“Thank you for your love and devotion to our family and to the family of nations you have served so diligently all these years,” he said, ending with a quote from Shakespeare&#x27;s “Hamlet” — “May flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.’”",

        "description": "Photo by William Purnell/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Are changes coming? Local kid Joey Wentz had about 40 friends and family in the crowd last night to watch him defeat the Royals.\n\n“I grew up a Royals fan and watched them win the World Series which is super cool, and to be on the field tonight was awesome,” Wentz said...\n“My grandpa had Royals tickets since the ‘80s,” Wentz said. “So I’d come out here a lot. It’s definitely special for me to play here.”\n\nToday’s game has been moved up to 3:10 CT due to weather.\nDavid Lesky at Inside the Crown sees a Royals roster that just doesn’t fit together.\n\nThey have too many outfielders, too many catchers and too many infielders. But they also don’t have enough starting pitchers or relievers and they don’t have nearly enough certainty at any of the positions where they have too many players. It’s a mess. That mess can be turned into a positive, but it’s a mess.\nI want to break this down by position, but that even starts to create a bigger web because this player can play here or there or even over there, which is great, but putting that player there makes that other player move to the other spot, which then displaces a third player and, well, you get it. \n\nMarcus Meade at Royals Farm Report writes what makes prospect Gavin Cross such a good hitter.\nCross has incredible hand eye coordination, and that becomes apparent when you see how frequently he gets the barrel to the ball. Hard hit balls aren’t just a function of strength or bat speed; they’re primarily a function of hand eye coordination. And he’s got a ton of it. In the homerun clip above, you see a fastball that missed the target and was just in off the plate. To be able to get the barrel to that ball is impressive. It’s one thing to hit middle-middle fastballs on the barrel. It’s another to hit balls that are in the shadow of the strike zone. That shows a healthy amount of barrel control, which means he won’t just hit balls hard when they’re down broadway. He can hit balls hard all over the strike zone (and maybe outside of it).\nKevin O’Brien at Royals Reporter wonders if the Jason Simontacci firing means more changes are coming.\n\nSimontacchi being gone probably signals a desire to change on a pitching end for this Royals organization. And if the Royals feel a change is merited after five years for Simontacchi, it is likely they make think a change is necessary at the Major League level after five years with Eldred as well.\nThe Royals will probably wait until the end of the season, but it seems likely that an Eldred announcement will come swiftly after the season is over for Kansas City in early October.\n\nJordan Foote at Inside the Royals wonders if Salvy is back to his 2021 form.\nThe Rays activate infielder Wander Franco.\nThe Reds designate outfielder Albert Almora for assignment.\nThe Yankees honor Derek Jeter for his Hall of Fame induction.\nRockies first baseman C.J. Cron hits the longest home run of the Statcast era.\nHow the surging Braves caught the Mets in the East.\nDan Syzborski at Fangraphs looks at young Japanese stars Roki Sasaki and Munetaka Murakami.\nAlbert Pujols is leaving the game on his terms.\nMLB voluntarily recognizes minor league players unionizing with the MLBPA.\nFormer Angels World Series star Scott Spezio is trying to put his life back together after battles with addiction.\nWith contract negotiations having ended, did the Ravens err in not reaching agreement with Lamar Jackson?\nHow Serena Williams reshaped tennis forever.\nAn environmental disaster in Uzbekistan is now a tourist attraction.\nAutomatic braking vehicle-pedestrian systems still struggle to see people in the dark.\nWhy Disney didn’t buy Twitter.\nYour song of the day is the Georgia Satellites with Keep Your Hands to Yourself.",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Ladies and gentlemen, I present to you a classic example of “no lead is secure in Coors Field”. Diamondbacks News\nArizona 10, Colorado 13The Diamondbacks jumped out to a quick 1-0 lead, courtesy of a Jake McCarthy solo shot in the first inning. The Rockies responded with a tying run in the bottom of the first, then proceeded to shell Zach Davies, chasing him from the game in the fourth, and then piling on some more against Keynan Middleton. The Snakes came to the plate in the sixth, down 8-1 in what was shaping up into a laugher of a game. That’s when Arizona sent nine men to the plate, scoring all of them, before finally making an out. Unfortunately, that wound up being the last of Arizona’s scoring and (surprising absolutely no one) the two run lead was simply not enough of a cushion for Arizona’s bullpen to hold on to secure the victory.\nVarsho Gets First Career Slam in Game of Coors Field BombsThe Diamondbacks strung together an impressive come-from-behind inning, plating nine men in the sixth inning. The scoring was capped by Daulton Varsho launching his 24th home run of the season, this one his first career grand slam. The game featured eight home runs in all, including Corbin Carroll’s second blast and the second-longest tater recorded in the Statcast era, courtesy of C.J. Cron.\nLadies and gentlemen, the Var-show\n\n\nThis has turned into an amazing year for Daulton Varsho. This is his first career grand slam pic.twitter.com/qgr2CyoBE2— Jack Sommers (@shoewizard59) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nGood thing wall-scrapers and moon shots count the same\n\n\nCJ Cron hit this ball 504 feet.  Coors. (This is a fun one because A) the initial camera angle makes it seem like it hit the surface of Mars B) I don't know how much I trust a distance marker on a truck ad and C) whooaaa, what a blast.) pic.twitter.com/vXNrPTeZBp— Mike Petriello (@mike_petriello) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nNine-Run Sixth Not EnoughArizona’s offense went cold after a massive opening to the sixth inning and the bullpen was unable to protect a two-run lead in the hitter-friendly environment of Coors Field.\nOther Baseball News\nMLB Passes Significant Rules ChangesThere will be some new rules in place next season. There will be a pitch clock, limits on pickoffs, larger bases, and a banning of the shift. All of this was passed along party lines, the players opposed, the owners and their mouthpiece supporting the changes.\nMLB Plans to Voluntarily Recognize MLBPA RepresentationIn a somewhat surprising, but probably savvy move, Rob Manfred has announced the MLB is prepared to voluntarily recognize the MLBPA’s representation of the games minor leaguers.\nPostseason Watch: Braves Move Into Sole Possession of FirstUnlike their crosstown siblings, the New York Mets have not been engaged in a freefall from the top of their division. In fact, since June 1st, when they held a 10.5 game lead on the rest of the NL East, they have posted a .602 winning percentage, which would equate to a 97 win season over 162 games. The Braves have simply bee that much better. Atlanta has surged to the top of the standings playing at a .727 pace, which would be good enough for a single-season record 117 wins over the span of 162 games.\nRangers Debut Josh JungThe Rangers finally called up their top prospect, Josh Jung. The young infielder responded with a home run in his first at-bat, then added a single and a stolen base later in the contest.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/yankees-designate-ronald-guzman-for-assignment.html",
        "description": "The Yankees announced that they have designated first baseman Ronald Guzmán for assignment. Josh Donaldson was activated from the paternity list in a corresponding move.\nGuzmán, 27, was just selected to the roster a few days ago to give the Yanks another option at first base when Anthony Rizzo went on the injured list. Since then, the club also placed DJ LeMahieu on the IL, further depleting the depth chart at first. The start at that position has gone to Marwin Gonzalez in each of the past three games as well as today, indicating the Yankees are evidently satisfied enough with his performance to let Guzmán go. Guzmán got six plate appearances in his short time on the roster but went hitless while striking out in five of them.\nDespite that poor showing in a very small sample, Guzmán was having a much better season prior to his call-up. In 90 Triple-A games this year, he&#8217;s hit 12 home runs while walking in 11.8% of his plate appearances, leading to a .260/.357/.466 batting line that amounts to a 119 wRC+. The strikeouts were present there as well, however, as he went down on strikes 27.6% of the time.\nSince the trade deadline has passed, the Yankees will placed Guzmán on waivers in the coming days. He has over three years of MLB service time, meaning he would have the right to reject an outright assignment and elect free agency. Should any team decide to put in a claim, he can be retained for a further three seasons via arbitration.\nMarly Rivera of ESPN reported Guzmán&#8217;s DFA before the official announcement.",

        "description": "Back in June, it was reported by Tim Prudente and Justin Fenton of The Baltimore Banner that the Angelos family was battling over the Orioles franchise. Peter Angelos, now 93, was the lead investor of a group that purchased the club in 1993 and has been at the helm since. However, he collapsed in October of 2017 due to the failure of his aortic valve and then established a trust with his wife and two sons as trustees.\nThe reporting in June provided details of a lawsuit coming from Louis Angelos, one of Peter&#8217;s two sons, alleging that John, the other son, had seized control of the team with the intention of selling and perhaps relocating the team to Tennessee. Shortly after those allegations came to light, John released a statement refuting them.\nPrudente has released a new piece at the Baltimore Banner this week with further reporting on the matter, looking at court documents from the ongoing legal dispute. According to the attorneys of Georgia Angelos, the wife of Peter and mother of John and Louis, she wanted to create some space between the family and the team. Peter had a reputation as a very hands-on owner, which led to attention that the family wanted to move away from. &#8220;After years of bad press that Peter micromanaged baseball operations at the Orioles, Georgia wanted to create distance between her family and the ‘baseball side’ of the organization,&#8221; Georgia&#8217;s attorneys wrote in court documents. &#8220;John similarly abhorred any management structure other than an organizational pyramid with full delegation of authority to a staff of trained professionals and executives, headed by a General Manager responsible for all day-to-day decision making.&#8221;\nHer attorneys go on to argue that general manager Mike Elias, hired in late 2018, was aggressively pursued by the Giants but instead agreed to come to Baltimore on the condition that he would report to John only because John would give Elias the freedom to handle the baseball decision without interference. &#8220;This understanding was crucial to Elias’s decision to come to the Orioles — a club long plagued by anti-organizational culture — so much so that John, with Georgia’s approval, codified these delegated rights in Elias’s employment contract,&#8221; Georgia&#8217;s attorneys wrote.\nThe documents go on to allege that Louis was not happy with this turn of events and demanded to be in charge of baseball operations, repeatedly contacting Elias about which baseball players the team might sign. The behaviour of Louis caused him to be excluded from a new board for the team that his mother created in August of 2020, which featured John as chairman and CEO.\nThe dismissal of Brady Anderson, who had been serving as vice president of baseball operations, also comes up in the court documents. Georgia&#8217;s attorneys alleged that Louis was friends with Anderson and unilaterally raised Anderson&#8217;s salary from $300K  to $900K in 2018. However, when Elias was brought in, he tried to steer the club to a greater analytical approach that didn&#8217;t align with Anderson&#8217;s style. Louis insisted on keeping Anderson around, with Elias agreeing to a compromise where Anderson was moved to a position as an outside consultant with lower pay. &#8220;While Anderson agreed, he felt slighted, a sentiment he could not hide and which eventually led to his termination,&#8221; Georgia&#8217;s attorneys write. Anderson departed the Orioles organization in 2019.\nThis is an ongoing legal matter where the allegations haven&#8217;t been substantiated in court and an attorney for Louis declined to provide comment for the report. Interested readers are encouraged to read both reports, though more information is likely to be revealed as the legal process plays out.\nRegardless of how it came to be in the boardrooms of the front office, the Elias-led Orioles are a reality that is starting to show encouraging signs at the big league level for the first time. After losing at least 108 games in each of the past three full seasons, the O&#8217;s are much better here in 2022. Their 73-65 record is the best they&#8217;ve had in quite some time and has kept them in the playoff race down the stretch, just four games out of a Wild Card spot with just over three weeks remaining. That big step forward is at least partly due to the club&#8217;s 2019 draft, which was Baltimore&#8217;s first with Elias at the helm.\nElias recently spoke with Ken Rosenthal of The Athletic about that draft, which saw the club scoop up catcher Adley Rutschman, infielder Gunnar Henderson and outfielder Kyle Stowers, all three of whom are already in the majors. Despite the pressure of having the number one overall selection, it seems Elias and the club didn&#8217;t have much doubt about using that pick on Rutschman. &#8220;He provided for us the best combination of floor and ceiling,&#8221; Elias says. &#8220;We thought the leadership component would be a separator, which is looking like it could be the case. And I thought it was rare, a once-in-a-decade kind of thing to get an offensive catcher in a draft.&#8221;\nEven before that draft selection, Rutschman was mentioned as one of the best prospects in the sport. Since then, he continued rocketing up prospect boards, being considered by many to be the top prospect this year. Since ascending to the big leagues, Rutschman has lived up to the hype in a big way. He&#8217;s hitting .255/.363/.449 for a wRC+ of 135, production that&#8217;s 35% better than the league average hitter but even further beyond the average catcher. He&#8217;s also been great on the other side of the ball, with his 16 Defensive Runs Saved second in the league among catchers despite missing the early part of the season, just barely behind Jose Trevino&#8217;s 17. Put together, he&#8217;s been worth 4.1 wins above replacement on the season, according to FanGraphs. Among all catchers, that trails only J.T. Realmuto and Sean Murphy, who have each played at least 28 more games than Rutschman.\nBased on the strong season for the O&#8217;s, Elias said last month that the club expects to &#8220;significantly escalate the payroll&#8221; this winter. It&#8217;s hard to know exactly how the club will approach things, given that we don&#8217;t have precedent for how Elias will behave under these new conditions. With the team in rebuild mode for his entire tenure up until now, the front office has avoided significant commitments and hasn&#8217;t signed a free agent to a multi-year contract since the four-year deal Alex Cobb got in March of 2018, before Elias was hired. That means they have effectively no future commitments on the books and can theoretically go after any free agent they desire. It will be interesting to see how they play their cards, with Rosenthal reporting that their list of targets includes &#8220;a top-of-the-rotation starter,&#8221; in addition to a backup catcher and an infielder, with the specific position of the infielder depending upon where the multi-positional Henderson settles.\nThe club will be looking for &#8220;quality rather than quantity&#8221; on the pitching front, Rosenthal says, which makes sense given that the club already has some intriguing rotation candidates in the fold. Young pitchers like Tyler Wells, Dean Kremer, Austin Voth, Kyle Bradish and Spenser Watkins have all had some promising starts this year, to varying degrees. The club also has reinforcements coming over the horizon, with Grayson Rodriguez considered by many to be one of the top pitching prospects in the sport. John Means could also return to the mix at some point next year, after undergoing Tommy John surgery in April. Given that collection of internal candidates, it would make sense for the O&#8217;s to shoot for a single impact starter rather than spreading money around to a handful of less-impactful options. Rosenthal lists Chris Bassitt, Carlos Rodón, Nathan Eovaldi, Jameson Taillon, Corey Kluber and Michael Wacha as some of the available hurlers who would make for logical targets, as the O&#8217;s hope to turn the page from perennial basement dwellers to consistent contenders in the AL East.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3636544-lets-save-americas-atlantic-salmon/",
        "description": "<p>Wild Atlantic salmon, known as the “King of Fish” for their sporting qualities, are on <a href=\"https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/species/atlantic-salmon-protected#:~:text=The%20Gulf%20of%20Maine%20DPS%20of%20Atlantic%20salmon%20is%20listed,to%20protect%20all%20Atlantic%20salmon.\">the brink of extinction</a> in the United States. Once numbering as many as a half million in U.S. rivers, Atlantic salmon dwindled to as low as 450 in recent years. The National Marine Fisheries Service has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to help restore this iconic species by insisting on conservation measures to the Kennebec River in Maine. The Kennebec was one of the most productive rivers in the country for salmon and other freshwater-marine fish. <a href=\"https://apnews.com/article/toronto-dams-fish-salmon-maine-d43d50c2b875fefd85d3de332d847268\">Four hydropower projects, owned by the energy conglomerate Brookfield Renewable Partners</a>, prevent Atlantic salmon, American shad, river herring and other species from migrating to and from the ocean in a safe and timely manner and to rebuild sadly diminished populations. These dams account for <a href=\"https://www.nrcm.org/blog/path-to-restoring-kennebec-river/\">only 0.4 percent of Maine’s total power generation</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Kennebec River, along with the Penobscot, are the only two large rivers in the U.S. with extant populations of Atlantic salmon. Salmon in both are endangered, but <a href=\"https://www.newschainonline.com/news/us-could-demand-action-on-dams-to-save-last-atlantic-salmon-282752\">the Kennebec’s is particularly vulnerable</a> because most of its high-quality spawning habitat is in the tributary Sandy River, upstream of the four Brookfield dams.The small number of returning adult salmon that enter the fishway at the first dam on the river, the Lockwood Dam, cannot get to the Sandy River their own — they must be captured and trucked there. <a href=\"https://www.nrcm.org/blog/fatal-flaws-brookfields-proposal-for-kennebec/\">Brookfield’s proposed measures</a> for upstream and downstream fish passage at each of its four dams will not pass Atlantic salmon and other sea-run species in sufficient numbers to restore viable, self-sustaining populations. Not only do these dams impede upriver migrations but their impoundments expose migratory fish to high temperatures, disorient them by reducing river flow speeds, and provide an environment in which predator species thrive. Restoration of these fish is not possible without dam removal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shawmut Dam, the third dam on the Kennebec, is currently undergoing <a href=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2021/11/24/federal-regulators-to-review-effects-of-4-lower-kennebec-dams-on-fish-a-victory-for-conservationists/\">Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) relicensing</a>. As part of that process the Fisheries Service must issue a “biological opinion” that will evaluate the cumulative impact of continued operation of all four Brookfield dams on endangered Atlantic salmon and other sea-run fish. In the past, successful restoration of migratory fish on the Kennebec has only occurred as part of relicensing processes in which federal agencies took bold steps. This led to <a href=\"https://www.nrcm.org/news/20-years-ago-edwards-dam-removal-sparked-movement-free-flowing-rivers/\">removals of the Edwards and Fort Halifax dams</a>, which brought dramatic increases in sea-run fish populations; the river herring run in one tributary went from zero over the century and a half before dam removals, to 6 million in only a few years following. Not only are river herring important ecologically as estuarine and marine prey species but commercial fishermen travel far from Maine’s coast to net these fish for scarce lobster bait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a>Progress on the Kennebec River has stalled at the Lockwood Dam, and neither Brookfield nor previous dam owners have </a><a href=\"https://www.pressherald.com/2022/06/02/kennebec-river-dam-owner-dismisses-state-fish-passage-plan-as-counterproductive/\">installed effective fish passage</a> there in the 24 years since the Edwards Dam removal. The National Marine Fisheries Service holds the fate of Atlantic salmon in its hands. The decisions the agency makes in its upcoming biological opinion will help determine whether Atlantic salmon survive or go extinct in the United States. <a href=\"https://www.opb.org/article/2022/07/19/think-out-loud-new-federal-reports-removing-snake-river-dams-to-help-fish/\">The federal government has shown interest in removing multiple dams</a> on the Snake and Klamath Rivers in the West. The Kennebec is a similarly critical resource in the East, and the Fisheries Service must not condemn it to the same fate as the other great East Coast salmon rivers, the Connecticut and the Merrimack. These rivers have modern engineered fish passage systems that <a href=\"https://therevelator.org/endgame-new-england-river/\">were supposed to restore populations of salmon</a> and other freshwater-marine fish, and they have failed spectacularly. Salmon have disappeared from these rivers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maine gets most of its hydropower from a scant number of dams; about nine out of more than 120 generating dams provide more than half of the state’s hydroelectricity. Each of these dams are larger than Brookfield’s four lower Kennebec damsand tend to be higher in watersheds where they do not destroy migratory fish populations<a href=\"https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/maine-solar\">. In 2021 alone</a>, <a href=\"https://www.mainepublic.org/environment-and-outdoors/2021-11-12/maines-solar-power-generation-has-surged-in-the-last-two-years-community-solar-projects-are-a-major-part-of-that-growth\">Maine installed more solar electric capacity</a> than Brookfield’s four lower Kennebec dams provide, even accounting for the fact that hydroelectric facilities operate more of the time than solar generators. <a href=\"https://www.seia.org/state-solar-policy/maine-solar\">Over the next five years</a>, Maine is likely to install solar capacity greater than five times these dams’ capacity. Maine also has ambitious plans to add thousands of megawatts of offshore wind power to its grid. Brookfield’s lower Kennebec dams are increasingly insignificant as a renewable energy resource.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Society has not done a good job balancing hydropower with sea-run fish resources. The great fish migrations that used to feed much of the country have collapsed, largely due to dams. Engineered fish passage systems have failed to bring these populations back. The National Marine Fisheries Service, the agency most responsible for protecting coastal fisheries resources, needs to take a hard look at the imbalance between using rivers for hydropower and restoring native fish runs. The agency’s upcoming Kennebec biological opinion must start to remedy this imbalance. Endangered Atlantic salmon and the other migratory fish species are not compatible with the continued existence of the four lower Kennebec dams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>John Waldman, Ph.D., is a professor of biology at Queens College, City University of New York.

        "description": "In recent months many of us have gotten used to the Russia-Ukraine war as mostly a stalemate, with small gains in each direction often canceling each other out but no dramatic changes.

The device could also house an 8MP Sony IMX355 sensor (the same one used by the Pixel 6A) on the inside and another Samsung S5K3J1 around the front.\n\n\nAccording to the...\n\n\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

Court Chief Justice John Roberts defended the court’s legitimacy on Friday in his first public comments since the end of its last term, during which it issued controversial rulings including the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\nRoberts said at a judicial conference in Colorado Springs, Colo., that criticizing the court's decisions is \"entirely appropriate,\" but argued that “simply because people disagree with opinions is not a basis for questioning the legitimacy of the court,” according to Bloomberg.\n\n\n\nRoberts warned against such criticisms, emphasizing the importance of the court's unique role.\n\n\n\n“If the court doesn’t retain its legitimate function of interpreting the Constitution, I’m not sure who would take up that mantle,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe chief justice added: “You don’t want the political branches telling you what the law is, and you don’t want public opinion to be the guide about what the appropriate decision is.”\n\n\n\nFellow Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch was also present at the 10th Circuit Bench and Bar Conference, where he addressed the leak of a draft opinion in the Dobbs case that occurred earlier this year before the final ruling was issued.\n\n\n\n“Improper efforts to influence judicial decision-making, from whatever side, from whomever, are a threat to the judicial decision-making process,” said Gorsuch to the audience of judges, according to the Wall Street Journal, adding that it is “terribly important” for the court to identify the source of the leak.\n\n\n\nRoberts launched an investigation shortly after the leak occurred in May, calling it a “singular and egregious breach of that trust that is an affront to the Court and the community of public servants who work here.”\n\n\n\nThe leak of the draft opinion, which indicated the court was poised to overturn Roe, sparked protests outside the Supreme Court and some justices' homes in opposition to the coming decision.\n\n\n\nAt the conference, Roberts described his daily drive through the barricades that were installed around the Supreme Court building amid the protests as “gut-wrenching.”\n\n\n\nRoberts said that the past year was “difficult in many respects” for the court and its nine justices. \n\n\n\n“I think just moving forward from things that were unfortunate is the best way to respond,” he said, according to CNN.\n\n\n\nHe noted that the barricades around the Supreme Court have been removed and added that the public will be allowed to attend the court’s arguments again when its next term begins on Oct. 3, after being barred from doing so due to COVID-19 restrictions.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court term beginning next month will deal with contentious issues such as affirmative action, environmental regulations and religious liberty.\n\n\n\nThe justices' comments came the same day Vice President Harris expressed concern about the \"integrity\" of the Supreme Court following its Dobbs decision during an interview on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\"\n\n\n\n\"We had an established right for almost half a century, which is the right of women to make decisions about their own body, as an extension of what we have decided to be, the privacy rights to which all people are entitled. And this court took that constitutional right away. And we are suffering as a nation because of it,” Harris said, adding, “That causes me great concern about the integrity of the Court overall.”\n\n\n\n— Updated at 11:24 a.m.",

        "description": "The announcement of the&nbsp;new&nbsp;centrist&nbsp;Forward&nbsp;Party&nbsp;— created by former Democratic presidential candidate Andrew Yang,&nbsp;former&nbsp;Republican&nbsp;New Jersey governor&nbsp;Christine Todd Whitman&nbsp;and former Florida&nbsp;Republican&nbsp;congressman David&nbsp;Jolly&nbsp;—&nbsp;has&nbsp;prompted some journalists to&nbsp;ask whether the time is ripe for a third party.&nbsp;So have attempts among some establishment Republicans to&nbsp;encourage&nbsp;non-Trumpian Republican&nbsp;candidates&nbsp;to compete in elections.&nbsp;Adding fuel to these discussions, recent polls&nbsp;seem to&nbsp;show substantial&nbsp;support for&nbsp;a third party or third-party&nbsp;candidates.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor example, a&nbsp;July 2022 Harvard-Harris poll&nbsp;found that 58 percent of Americans said they would consider voting for a moderate independent candidate for president if the 2024 match was between Joe Biden and Donald Trump.&nbsp;A&nbsp;YouGov survey&nbsp;conducted around the same time (July-August)&nbsp;found slightly more Americans saying&nbsp;a third party is necessary (39 percent) than those who say the Democratic and Republican parties are sufficient to represent Americans (30 percent … 31 percent are unsure).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlmost&nbsp;half of Americans (46 percent) say they would consider voting for a third-party candidate&nbsp;versus&nbsp;22&nbsp;percent who say they&nbsp;would not&nbsp;(32 percent were&nbsp;unsure).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd a 2021&nbsp;Gallup poll&nbsp;made headlines with&nbsp;62&nbsp;percent&nbsp;of Americans saying&nbsp;the&nbsp;Republican and Democratic&nbsp;parties do such a poor job representing the American people that a third party is needed, the highest percentage&nbsp;yet&nbsp;recorded&nbsp;in Gallup surveys.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat kind of third party?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGiven the poll numbers, it might seem that a third party&nbsp;would have great potential for 2024.&nbsp;Yet, as&nbsp;Lee&nbsp;Drutman, William&nbsp;Galston&nbsp;and Tod Lindberg&nbsp;pointed out in 2018, “third party enthusiasts don’t agree on what that third party should be.” Republicans who support a third-party entrant&nbsp;tend to&nbsp;want the&nbsp;new&nbsp;party to move to the right&nbsp;of the current GOP&nbsp;rather than to the center, while those who are Democrats divide between wanting a party that is more moderate or more liberal. This reflects the&nbsp;underlying ideological composition of the established parties.\n\n\n\nChicago Council Surveys&nbsp;show that Republicans are&nbsp;fairly&nbsp;homogenous&nbsp;in their identification as conservative (77 percent vs. 23 percent moderate in 2022). While&nbsp;Democrats have become more liberal over time,&nbsp;their supporters&nbsp;are&nbsp;more of a&nbsp;mix&nbsp;between ideological&nbsp;moderates (58 percent) and liberals&nbsp;(42 percent).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nForward’s slogan is “Not Left. Not Right.&nbsp;FORWARD”&nbsp;— to appeal to middle-of-the-road Americans. But the so-called “moderate”&nbsp;voters&nbsp;are not all of one mind, either.&nbsp;A portion of the moderates will&nbsp;disagree with other moderates.&nbsp;According to&nbsp;William&nbsp;Galston,&nbsp;“if the United States had a parliamentary system, we would have five distinct blocs of voter —&nbsp;roughly speaking, a progressive Sanders/AOC party, a center-left Biden party, a centrist/business-oriented Bloomberg party, a traditional-conservative Pence party, and a conservative populist Trump Party. Voters who give priority to climate change might organize a sixth ‘Green’ party, as they have in Germany and elsewhere.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWho&nbsp;are&nbsp;these&nbsp;third-party&nbsp;fans?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn general, across the polls, Democrats and independents are more likely than&nbsp;Republicans to support a third party.&nbsp;Moderates and Liberals&nbsp;are&nbsp;more inclined than Conservatives, and college graduates are more likely than those with less education.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe YouGov poll found that interest in a third party is more popular among those who are&nbsp;focused on social rather than economic&nbsp;issues.&nbsp;Bottom line: a third party&nbsp;like Forward — with a focus on the moderate middle&nbsp;— could&nbsp;potentially&nbsp;bleed voters away from Democratic&nbsp;more than Republican&nbsp;candidates.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the near term, Forward is unlikely to make much of a splash.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere’s the&nbsp;structural disadvantage it has in terms of&nbsp;fundraising&nbsp;and resources compared to the established parties. Secondly,&nbsp;in a New Yorker interview,&nbsp;Yang himself&nbsp;said that&nbsp;he and his crew aspire to getting Democrats and Republicans to support the Forward party principles, not to leave their registered party and run on&nbsp;the Forward Party ticket. Those principles include, among other things, ranked-choice&nbsp;voting&nbsp;and open primaries&nbsp;in order&nbsp;to&nbsp;weaken extreme partisanship and to&nbsp;help the American political system become “restored and rejuvenated”&nbsp;(essential&nbsp;reforms&nbsp;to become a&nbsp;multiparty system).&nbsp;But&nbsp;Drutman,&nbsp;et al, point out that the U.S. public neither supports nor sees these reforms as necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nForward so far has only principles and hasn’t yet taken a stand on policies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMoreover, Forward is banking its appeal&nbsp;as a party&nbsp;that wants to do politics&nbsp;without conflict: “we stand for doing, not dividing.” But dividing is exactly how the most successful third parties have succeeded in the past.&nbsp;They criticized&nbsp;and pulled voters away from&nbsp;the two established parties.\n\n\n\nIn the words of&nbsp;Jamelle Bouie,&nbsp;successful third parties&nbsp;activated “a narrow slice of the public over a specific set of&nbsp;issues. They further polarized&nbsp;the electorate, changed the political landscape and forced the established parties to reckon with their influence.” Examples include the&nbsp;Free Soil Party&nbsp;that&nbsp;forced an antislavery agenda&nbsp;on the two-party system and&nbsp;became the nucleus of the Republican Party;&nbsp;Teddy Roosevelt’s Progressive Party, that championed reforms that were&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;adopted on the&nbsp;eight-hour workday&nbsp;and&nbsp;conditions of child labor; and the&nbsp;Populist Party&nbsp;of the 1890s that&nbsp;pushed&nbsp;economic reforms to create a more equitable society&nbsp;to the heart of political debate.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. political system drastically needs new&nbsp;energy,&nbsp;and a third party is a great idea. But&nbsp;at least right now,&nbsp;it doesn’t seem like Forward is&nbsp;setting itself up to be a consequential disruptor.\n\n\n\nDina Smeltz is a senior fellow at the Chicago Council on Global Affairs. ",

        "description": "Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images\n    \n\n  He has been a very good pitcher for the Yankees, and Yankees fans should treat him as a treasure. Being a player for the Yankees can be a harrowing experience at times. On occasion, the criticism that fans throw at players is justified. On others, that criticism becomes a way to just express frustration with the team as a whole. The Yankees have had a miserable stretch this second half, and it has fans feeling infuriated about the state of the team. One of the few players who has not been a problem is Lucas Luetge. But for whatever reason, the left-hander does not always get the respect that he should as a valuable contributor in the Yankee bullpen. \nIn fact, he has been one of the most consistent bullpen arms on the team. Over 42 games in 2022, he has an excellent 2.55 ERA in 49.1 innings pitched. While he has certainly faired better against left-handed batters with only three earned runs over 17.0 innings, and a .275 wOBA allowed, he has done adequately against right-handed batters as well, having allowed a .303 wOBA. Notably, his peripherals match his performance.\n  \n        \n      Credit: Baseball Savant\n      Lucas Luetge 2022 MLB Percentile Rankings\n  \nLuetge has one of the absolute best hard hit percentages in the entire league along with similarly great average exit velocities on balls hit. Both of these numbers are in the top one or two percent of the league. At the same time, he has a fairly good strikeout percentage (65th percentile), and an even better expected slugging percentage (79th percentile). \nHowever, Luetge stands as an outlier among relievers (and pitchers in general) as someone who throws softly. His average fastball (cutter) sits at about 87.7 mph. That's less than changeup velocity for someone like Gerrit Cole or Luis Severino. Cole’s changeup averages velocity sits at 89.7 mph, a couple mph higher than Luetge’s fastball!\nLuetge’s been able to mix and match effectively with his three-pitch repertoire. He has a cutter that he uses 55.8 percent of the time, a slider at 30.2 percent, and a curveball which he brings out 14 percent of the time. Each of these pitches is an average or above average pitch in terms of movement.\n  \n        \n      Credit: Baseball Savant\n      Lucas Luetge 2022 Pitch Movement\n  \nHis bread and butter pitch, the cutter, features tons of great horizontal movement. His cutter offers 60 percent more horizontal break than the average cutter, with slightly below average vertical drop. His slider offers a similar movement profile. This pitch features 43 percent more horizontal break and four percent greater drop than the average slider. \nAll of this leads to pitches that have been fairly good in practice. Each of them has provided results that have allowed Luetge to be one of the better relief pitchers in the league.\n  \n        \n      Credit: Baseball Savant\n      Lucas Luetge Run Values by Pitch Type\n  \nWhile he might use the cutter as his foremost pitch, it has been hit around a little bit by opposing teams. However, he has suffered from some amount of bad luck. The batting average on the cutter this year has been .317, but the expected batting average is much lower at .261. \nIn contrast, his slider has been particularly effective with a .184 batting average. In addition, no one has been able to hit Luetge’s curveball at this point, with an excellent expected batting average of only .048. The pair of secondary offerings allow Luetge to keep opposing batters completely off balance, despite a complete lack of velocity. While Luetge’s fastball struggles to get even within five mph of Jacob deGrom’s slider velocity, hitters have to deal with a trio of pitches that all look similar but behave in slightly different ways, resulting in whiffs and lots of weak contact.\nAll of this has culminated in suprisingly strong production from the 35-year-old for a second straight season. Luetge deserves all of the praise for managing to provide the Yankees extremely consistent performance, even as the team craters elsewhere. He shouldn’t be an object of ire, even if his tepid velocity gives him the look of a man overmatched on a major league mound. If he continues to pitch like he has, Lucas Luetge, the journeyman, should have a legitimate role to play on the Yankees’ postseason roster.",

        "description": "Russia’s Defense Ministry said Saturday that it is pulling back forces from two areas in Ukraine’s Kharkiv region where a Ukrainian counter offensive has made significant advances in the past week.Defense Ministry spokesman Igor Konashenkov said the troops would be regrouped from the Balakliya and Izyum areas to the Donetsk region. Izyum was a major base for Russian forces in the Kharkiv region.Konashenkov said the move is being made “in order to achieve the stated goals of the special military operation to liberate Donbas,’” one of the eastern Ukraine regions that Russia has declared sovereign.The claim of pullback to concentrate on Donetsk is similar to the justification Russia gave for pulling back its forces from the Kyiv region earlier this year.Earlier, Ukrainian officials on Saturday claimed major gains in a counteroffensive against Russian forces in the country&#x27;s northeast, saying Ukrainian troops had cut off vital supplies to front-line hotspot.Ukrainian Foreign Ministry spokesman Oleh Nikolenko suggested the Ukrainian troops had retaken Kupiansk, a town along the main supply route to Izyum, long a focus on the Russian front line and the site of heavy artillery and other fighting. Nikolenko tweeted a photo showing soldiers of the 92nd Separate Mechanized Battalion of Ukraine in front of what he said was a government building in Kupiansk, 73 kilometers (45 miles) north of Izyum.The Security Service of Ukraine, known as the SBU, hours later posted a message which it said showed its forces in Kupiansk, further suggesting it had been seized by Ukrainian troops. The Ukrainian military didn&#x27;t immediately confirm entering the town, a railway hub which Russia seized in February, when its mayor surrendered to avoid civilian casualties.Later Saturday, videos on social media began to circulate also appearing to show Ukrainian forces on the rural outskirts of Izyum at a roadside checkpoint. A large statue bearing the city’s name could be seen in the footage. Ukrainian forces did not acknowledge holding the city.Earlier Saturday, the British Defense Ministry told reporters it believed the Ukrainians had advanced as much as 50 kilometers (30 miles) south of Kharkiv, and described Russian forces around Izyum as “increasingly isolated.”“Russian forces were likely taken by surprise. The sector was only lightly held and Ukrainian units have captured or surrounded several towns,” the British military said, adding that the loss of Kupiansk would greatly affect Russian supply lines in the area.The Institute for the Study of War, a Washington-based think tank, likewise referenced sweeping Ukrainian gains, estimating that Kyiv has seized around 2,500 square kilometers (965 square miles) in its northeastern breakthrough. The institute said it appeared that “disorganized Russian forces (were) caught in the rapid Ukrainian advance.” They cited social media images of apparent Russian prisoners seized in the advance around Izyum and surrounding towns.The same report said Ukrainian forces “may collapse Russian positions around Izyum if they sever Russian ground lines of communication” north and south of the town.Moscow did not immediately acknowledge or comment on the claims by Ukraine and its Western allies. However, Vladislav Sokolov, the head of the Russian-appointed local administration, said on social media that authorities in Izyum have started evacuating residents to Russia.The fighting in eastern Ukraine comes amid an ongoing offensive around Kherson in the south. Analysts suggest Russia may have taken soldiers from the east to reinforce around Kherson, offering the Ukrainians the opportunity to strike a weakened front line.Ukrainian Defense Minister Oleksii Reznikov told the television channel Ukraina that the Russians had no food or fuel for their troops in the area as Kyiv had cut off their supply lines.“It will be like an avalanche,” he said, predicting a Russian fallback. “One line of defense will shake and it will fall.”The Ukrainian military was more circumspect about the reported gains, claiming in its regular update Saturday to have taken “more than 1,000 square kilometers” (386 square miles) from pro-Kremlin forces this week. It said “in some areas, units of the Defense Forces have penetrated the enemy’s defenses to a depth of 50 kilometers,” matching the British assessment, but did not disclose geographical details.Officials in Kyiv have for weeks been tight-lipped about plans for a counteroffensive to retake territory overrun by Russia early in the war, calling on residents to refrain from sharing information on social media.However, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in a nightly video address Friday that Ukrainian troops had reclaimed more than 30 settlements in the Kharkiv region since the start of the counteroffensive.“We are gradually taking control over more settlements, returning the Ukrainian flag and protection for our people,” Zelenskyy said.He spoke after the Ukrainian governor of Kharkiv reported that the national flag had been raised over Balakliia, a town recaptured by Ukrainian troops on Thursday following six months of Russian occupation.“Balakliia is Ukraine! Today, together with the military, led by the commander of the Ground Forces Oleksandr Syrskyy, we raised the Ukrainian flag,” governor Oleh Syniehubov wrote on Telegram.Elsewhere, Ukrainian emergency services reported that a 62-year-old woman was killed in a Russian missile strike in the Kharkiv region overnight. It said her body was found buried in the rubble of her home, which was flattened by the strike.Syniehubov also accused Moscow of pummeling settlements retaken by Kyiv in its recent advances, along with other residential areas in the region. He said in a Telegram post that five civilians were hospitalized in the Izyum district, while nine others suffered injuries elsewhere in the region.In the embattled Donbas region south of Kharkiv, the Ukrainian governor said civilians were killed and wounded overnight by Russian shelling near the city of Bakhmut, a key target of the stalled Russian offensive there. Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram that two people died and two more suffered injuries in Bakhmut and the neighboring village of Yahidne.Meanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock arrived in Kyiv on an unannounced visit Saturday, saying that Europe would not tire of helping Ukraine despite Russian President Vladimir Putin’s efforts to raise the pressure by withholding energy supplies from European Union nations.Baerbock said Germany will assist Ukraine in finding and removing mines and other unexploded ordnance left by Russian troops in areas where they have been pushed back by Ukrainian forces.Despite the gains made by Ukraine’s armed forces, U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the head of NATO warned Friday that Ukraine&#x27;s fight against Russia appears set to drag on for months. Blinken said the war was entering a critical period and he urged Ukraine&#x27;s Western backers to keep up their support through what could be a difficult winter.",

        "description": "Oscar Gonzalez hit two home runs and drove in five runs, and Austin Hedges added a solo homer as the Cleveland Guardians held on for a 7-6 win against the Minnesota Twins on Friday night.Gonzalez, the surprise rookie, had four hits and Cal Quantrill (12-5) won his eighth straight decision. Cleveland scored the first seven runs of the game, including four in the first inning after the start was delayed 1:16 due to rain.Minnesota’s Carlos Correa hit a two-run homer off Guardians reliever James Karinchak in the eighth, but Karinchak stranded the tying run at second to end the inning and Emmanuel Clase finished for his 32nd save.“It was a weird game,” Cleveland manager Terry Francona said. “Then they kept coming and we got a little sloppy, but fortunately, glad the game is over now, it didn’t go another inning because I don’t know.”The Guardians extended their lead in the American League Central to 1 1/2 games over the Chicago White Sox and 2 1/2 over Minnesota. The Guardians and Twins play seven more times over the next two weeks.Quantrill gave up two runs — one earned — and nine hits in five innings. The Guardians have held on to first despite losing nine of their previous 13 games.“Obviously they fought their way back, but I thought we had them under control, for the most part, all game long,” Quantrill said. “It’s important games to win. We’ve got to beat them if we want to have a chance at the playoffs.”Minnesota starter Dylan Bundy (8-7) surrendered season-highs with seven runs and 12 hits in 4 2/3 innings. The Twins have lost seven of nine and fell to third place behind Chicago, which rallied to beat Oakland.“I thought today’s game said a lot,” Correa said. “We’re never out of a game. They have a great bullpen and we’re able to bounce back and make it a really close game and make them use their high-leverage guys. There’s a lot of positives that we can take out of today’s game even though we didn’t get the W.”Friday’s game looked like two struggling teams instead of a matchup of teams fighting for the postseason. There were multiple miscues from each team and Cleveland had two errors. It had plenty of drama, too.Correa had four hits, homering for the third straight game, and driving in four runs during the comeback.Before Correa’s homer off Karinchak, Minnesota manager Rocco Baldelli had umpires check the pitcher for illegal substances. Karinchak was touching the back of his head and going to the rosin bag before every pitch.“I think I have an obligation to our players and to our team to do what I think is right,” Baldelli said. “And I believe it would have been hard for me and for our group as a whole to watch their pitcher do the things that he does on the mound, in a very upfront and straightforward way of trying to apparently alter some things. The last thing on earth that I want to do is go on the field and ask for a player check. It’s not something I’ve ever done. It’s not something I’ve really even considered doing, until watching this young man pitch.”Home plate umpire Ted Barrett did a full check of Karinchak, even running his hand through his hair. Barrett told a pool reporter he didn’t find anything during his check.Karinchak had his scoreless inning streak of 24 2/3 innings snapped and nearly hit Jose Miranda with a pitch after Correa’s homer.&quot;They think I was cheating, but I have no worries because it’s sweat and rosin,” Karinchak said.Up nextRHP Triston McKenzie (9-11, 3.18 ERA) starts for Cleveland in the second game of the series Saturday night. Minnesota counters with RHP Chris Archer (2-7, 4.47).",

        "description": "(Stunt)American session drummer Kenny Wollesen and sax player Ned Ferm join forces on a record infused with Scandinavian cool and folk notesIt’s just possible that the dread word “experimental” applies to this music, but happily not the equally dread “challenging”. It’s unusual, certainly, but once you’re tuned in, these 45 minutes are full of unexpected charm. The basis is a set of tunes played by a quartet of saxophone, percussion, guitar and double bass, mostly original compositions with a folkish tinge. To this have been added delicate layers of sound to intensify the mood of each piece, with occasional brief interludes of abstract sound. It’s the creation of Kenny Wollesen, a noted US session drummer, and Ned Ferm, an American saxophonist long established in Copenhagen, where this work was conceived and largely recorded. The guitarist and bassist are Rune Kjeldsen and Anders Christensen. It was the opening number that grabbed my attention, a fairly straight version of Sonny Boy (1928, Al Jolson). It’s a good tune, and Ferm plays it beautifully. The added sounds do more for the melody than its mawkish lyric ever did. I listened on and enjoyed it all. I think it must be the Scandinavian touch.

In the south, Ukrainian troops are pushing Russia’s most capable combat units back towards Kherson and fixing them against the west bank of the Dnipro River, where they can be destroyed in place with artillery.In the north-east, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise counteroffensive to sever the ground lines of communication north of Izyum, the base from which Russian forces were attempting to push into Donbas, compelling a Russian withdrawal. Several key capabilities have enabled these successes. In June, the Ukrainians could not concentrate their forces because of the volume of Russian artillery arrayed against them and struggled to get timely tactical intelligence from unmanned aerial vehicles – drones – because of extensive Russian electronic warfare and air defence complexes.

Vice President Harris has appeared before audiences around the country in recent days, she has posed a question asked by would-be voters: “Why should I vote?”\n\n\n\nHarris has told the crowds publicly — and has reiterated to aides privately — that Democrats have to give them a good answer that will lure them to the polls.\n\n\n\nDuring addresses in Texas and Massachusetts this week, she ticked off a string of reasons, from democracy being at stake to abortion rights. And in some speeches this summer, she has also directly taken on policies by Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R).&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There are, as there have always been, forces that stand in our way. Forces that oppose ... even the most commonsense gun safety proposals,” Harris said during a July speech at the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority convention in Orlando. “Forces that include extremist, so-called leaders, who instead of expanding rights work to restrict rights.”\n\n\n\nPresident Biden and Harris have both struggled with low approval ratings, raising real questions about how much help they can provide to Democratic candidates in the House and Senate. So far, the two have not appeared alongside candidates in key races in Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona.\n\n\n\nRepublicans, for their part, have gone on the attack against the president and the vice president.\n\n\n\nGeorgia GOP Senate candidate Herschel Walker this week used Harris to go after Democrats on the issue of race, saying in a new ad that she and others were seeking to use “race to divide us.” Harris and Biden were featured prominently in the ad.\n\n\n\nBut other Democrats say they believe Harris can be an effective voice in getting Democrats to the polls by touring the country and giving the grassroots a sense of the stakes at play.\n\n\n\nOne source who has advised Harris questioned her effectiveness in certain states.\n\n\n\n“I doubt she’ll be the messenger deployed to win over swing states,” the source said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the source and others in her orbit said Harris can be very effective in broader get-out-the-vote events and in helping to keep abortion rights front and center — as well as in fundraising efforts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHarris has been crisscrossing the country and appearing at events to appeal to various voting blocs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe traveled to Houston on Thursday to deliver remarks at the National Baptist Convention. In August, she traveled to Boston for a conversation on reproductive rights with Republican Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker and to Las Vegas for remarks at a steelworkers union convention.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, Harris will speak at the Democratic National Committee’s summer meeting in Maryland, and on Sunday, she’ll appear on NBC’s “Meet the Press” in an interview she recorded on Friday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA source close to Harris said her appearances are about “rallying not just the base, but about bringing other people in.”\n\n\n\nHer appearances, the source said, are “not just the big speeches” — like the one she delivered to steelworkers in Nevada last month — but the more personal “touches,” the source added, pointing to the vice president’s meetings with Hispanic lawmakers on the heels of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\nHarris has consistently tied in meetings about reproductive rights in her political travels.\n\n\n\nIn Las Vegas, she tacked on a meeting with state legislators on abortion issues while visiting the city for the steelworkers union speech.\n\n\n\nHarris has been a leading voice from the administration on reproductive rights following the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade, and she’s met with local leaders and advocates to discuss the issue in Florida, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, North Carolina, Virginia, Indiana and Massachusetts, among other states.\n\n\n\nDemocrats this cycle are hopeful that abortion is an issue that will bring voters out in November and maybe attract additional votes from independents or moderate Republicans, especially in states where leaders are passing restrictive abortion laws.\n\n\n\nAntjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist, sees Harris as the right person to lean into that strategy on the trail.\n\n\n\n“She is really giving a real voice to some of the issues that women are facing in this country, whether they supported the ticket or not,” he said. “I think her voice is so magnetic that it’s going to attract a wide range of followers, amplifiers and supporters.”\n\n\n\nSince the start of her tenure as vice president, some Democrats said they had been underwhelmed by Harris’s lack of a policy portfolio and her presence on the national stage overall. Her approval ratings have hovered below 40 percent, and she has been plagued by a constant revolving door of staffers.\n\n\n\nThere continue to be questions about whether she could successfully run for president should Biden choose against a second term. Biden has insisted he intends to run for office again, and Harris has said she will work for his reelection.\n\n\n\nAn August&nbsp;poll&nbsp;from her home state of California found voters would prefer their governor, Gavin Newsom (D), in the 2024 Democratic presidential primary over Harris. In another&nbsp;poll&nbsp;last month, Harris trailed former President Trump by 7 percentage points in a hypothetical 2024 presidential match-up.\n\n\n\nStill, Democratic strategists argue that she is an asset on the campaign trail for this midterm cycle, and she is focused on helping Democrats hold onto Congress and expand their majority.\n\n\n\nDemocratic strategist Eddie Vale said Harris can serve as a “closer” of sorts who will appeal to women.\n\n\n\n“I think that there’s not an issue that she cannot take on or talk about. What she is doing now, I think, is very intentional. She is out updating and educating people on one, the things we have done and two, how high the stakes are,” Seawright said.\n\n\n\nHe added that she’s a team player and said she is doing what makes sense for Democrats this cycle, “and is not necessarily playing a selfish role in terms of what she can do to be helpful.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "As Vladimir Putin’s army continues its assault on Ukraine, G7 countries have unveiled a&nbsp;price cap&nbsp;scheme on Russian oil exports to limit the Kremlin’s&nbsp;lucrative oil revenues. Despite the good intentions underlying the cap, experience suggests that these efforts alone will be insufficient to bleed the Russian war machine of financial resources. Rather, a genuine commitment to driving down Putin’s petrodollars requires a coalition of oil-producing countries to ramp up the global oil supply.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCurrent Western efforts to target Russia’s roughly&nbsp;$20 billion monthly&nbsp;oil revenues are ineffective at best, and counterproductive to American national security at worst. The patchwork of Western bans on oil imports is symbolically caveated by the European Union’s&nbsp;carveouts&nbsp;for Bulgaria, Croatia and central European states that rely on the Druzhba pipeline. Supporters of the current embargos point to Russia’s prolific offloading of cheap oil as an indication of their success. But a deluge of discounted energy to America’s rivals and enemies, such as the&nbsp;People’s Republic of China&nbsp;and&nbsp;the Taliban, is a pyrrhic victory for the American national interest, especially when Russia continues to turn a profit on its oil exports.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRecognizing the shortcomings of the current scheme, the Biden administration has spearheaded an internationally coordinated&nbsp;price cap&nbsp;on Russian oil exports. Putting aside global tepid enthusiasm for the cap, the success and enforcement of such an elaborate framework would be unlikely. The G7 announcement implies that only seaborne oil exports would be covered. This provides a clear loophole for China’s existing&nbsp;overland pipeline&nbsp;with Russia. Around one-third to half of China’s Russian oil imports could&nbsp;be maintained&nbsp;through this pipeline, coupled with the short seaborne voyage from Russia’s eastern&nbsp;Kozmino terminal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMoreover, faith in the efficiency of Western sanctions should be cautioned by Iran’s continued ability to turn a&nbsp;multi-billion-dollar&nbsp;monthly trade in crude oil, despite a comprehensive blanket of American primary and secondary sanctions. Ironically, the same European countries that developed the&nbsp;INSTEX trade mechanism&nbsp;to dodge American sanctions on doing business with Iran would be forced to condemn any similar creativity involving seaborne Russian oil.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese well-intentioned efforts have exclusively focused on diminishing Putin’s war chest by managing and manipulating the demand for Russian oil. However, demand is only half of the price equation. To drive down the Kremlin’s oil revenues, a \"coalition of the drilling,\" similar to President George W. Bush's \"coalition of the willing\" is needed to supercharge global non-Russian oil supply. Hamstrung by climate orthodoxy, the G7 joint statement on the price cap makes a perfunctory call for greater oil production to limit price volatility. Rather than an afterthought tucked away in the final paragraph, bringing more oil to the global market should be the tip of the spear. \n\n\n\nRecent pleas for greater oil production in the Middle East, most notably by President&nbsp;Joe Biden, overlook a wealth of production potential beyond the Gulf. The most glaring being that of the United States, where daily crude production remains 1 million barrels below its pre-pandemic&nbsp;March 2020 peak. Although the Biden administration says&nbsp;nothing can be done&nbsp;to boost domestic drilling, captains of the energy industry have detailed&nbsp;a regulatory wish list&nbsp;to regain lost capacity. Focusing the breadth of the bureaucracy on facilitating the production of more oil would make the United States the cornerstone of a winning coalition while bringing more oil first and foremost to domestic markets.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA \"coalition of the drilling\" would find ready partners among the African members of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC). In July, while president Biden was preoccupied with lobbying Saudi Arabia, five out of seven African OPEC members fell short of their own quotas by more than a collective 1 million barrels each day. Facilitating security, technology and private sector engagement with these countries and their business communities would help them to meet their existing quotas, while simultaneously diminishing the value of Putin’s oil exports. \n\n\n\nBoth within and outside of the OPEC cartel, several African countries are already preparing to&nbsp;make their collective case&nbsp;for greater oil and gas production at the November COP 27 climate confab. From&nbsp;Nigeria&nbsp;to&nbsp;Uganda, leaders across the continent are publicly acknowledging their own national interest in the alleviation of poverty through greater access to reliable and affordable energy. This chorus has become so loud that the Biden team’s recently released&nbsp;Africa strategy&nbsp;was forced to include lukewarm support for natural gas. Rather than&nbsp;threatening African partners&nbsp;over sanctions compliance, the Biden administration could build a durable coalition to drain Putin’s war chest upon the self-interest of would-be oil producers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCurrent efforts to manage and manipulate demand for Russian oil constitute an important first step to starving Russia’s war machine. Alone, however, they amount to a loose patchwork that will become weevil-holed by opportunistic non-compliance and smuggling.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA \"coalition of the drilling\" — forged through domestic regulatory reform, and international private sector engagement and security assistance — can drive down the value of every Russian barrel of oil.\n\n\n\nOliver McPherson-Smith is a research fellow at the Hoover Institution.&nbsp;",

They boast about their firepower and claim they will crush inflation, their longtime adversary. No quarter will be given in the war. The collateral damage will be high.A week on Thursday, the Bank of England will raise interest rates for a seventh time since last December, probably to 2.25%, and semaphore the message to financial markets that Threadneedle Street is not finished in its quest to defeat inflation.

        "description": "Queen’s family applauded after stopping to talk to well-wishers on way from private service at Crathie KirkCharles proclaimed King – latest updatesMembers of the royal family were given spontaneous applause at the gate to Balmoral Castle after stopping to talk to well-wishers and inspect the deep mound of flowers lying at the wall.Prince Andrew, his daughters Eugenie and Beatrice, Prince Edward and Sophie, and Princess Anne had driven to Crathie Kirk, the church close to Balmoral where the Queen and her family worshipped every Sunday during her holidays on Deeside, for a brief, private service shortly before 2pm on Saturday.As they returned to Balmoral, their convoy stopped at the narrow granite bridge over the River Dee to allow the family to greet about 150 well-wishers, who had been waiting patiently for up to 45 minutes behind a crowd barrier.Before walking back into the estate, Sophie was seen dabbing at tears as she read some of the inscriptions on the bouquets; flanked by his daughters and siblings at the black- and gold-painted gates, Andrew held up his hands together in a prayer of thanks, provoking a burst of applause from the crowd.Dressed in a black mourning suit, Andrew was the most talkative, asking visitors where they had come from. He spoke to Jackie McIntosh, 69, an airport worker from Aberdeen. “It’s very sad, it is, to see him because they’re a family at the end of the day, who’ve lost their mum,” she told reporters after their brief exchange.John Coutts, her partner, 49, added: “It’s only been a couple of days since they lost their mother, like the rest of us they are human, no one expected this. It was decent of them to speak with us.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photograph by Ava Stryker-Robbins.\nBy Ava Stryker-Robbins\nWhile pickles may be seen as solely a condiment for burgers and sandwiches, a local eatery advances the idea that pickles can be so much more. Jacob’s Pickles, a restaurant on Amsterdam at West 84th Street, has a wonderful selection of pickles in addition to their southern American-style food. As cited by Jacob’s Pickles&#8217; website, “Pickles have a real place at the table…the pickle brings magic to everything we do.”\nJacob’s Pickles has an assortment of many pickled vegetables, including cucumbers (normal pickles), beets, carrots, jalapenos, and string beans.\nTheir Candy Red Beets were deliciously sweet and flavorful, with a touch of cinnamon that truly made it feel like fall. The beets had a smooth and enjoyable consistency. The Dilly Green Beans were immensely flavorful and had a satisfying crunch with every bite. The Sweet and Spicy Carrots were delicious and crunchy, and the Thyme Jalapenos were extremely spicy, but very tasty. Their traditional pickles—Kosher Dill, Hot Sours Cukes, Big Dill Kosher Cukes, and Horseradish Cukes—were all beyond delicious. Each type of pickle had robust flavors and was crunchy, smooth, and delicious.\nJacob’s Pickles was opened in 2011 by Jacob Hadjigeorgis with the mission of “bringing good food to good people,” as cited on their website. According to Kevin, a restaurant employee who spoke with West Side Rag, “[When he started] Jacob actually brined the pickles back in his own home…[and] figured out the flavor profile and brought them here…The recipes have not changed. It is our tradition.”\nJacob’s Pickles is a comfort-food restaurant, and, as Kevin explains, “comfort food is where your heart and soul feel warm after eating…It is a time of communion, it is a time of talking, it is a time of communication and just making sure you are on the same page about life.”\nAt Jacob’s Pickles, you can order one pickle type for $5, 4 types for $15, or 8 types for $20.\nThe Dish: Pickles and other picked vegetables\nThe Restaurant: Jacob’s Pickles (509 Amsterdam Ave on 84th Street)",

        "description": "&#8220;People ask: &#8216;Would you or would you not like to be young again?&#8217; Of course, it is really one of those foolish questions that never should be asked, because they are impossible&#8230; You cannot unroll that snowball which is you: there is no &#8216;you&#8217; except your life — lived.&#8221;\n\n“In old age we should wish still to have passions strong enough to prevent us turning in on ourselves,” Simone de Beauvoir wrote as she considered how to keep life from becoming a parody of itself, while across the English Channel the ever-sagacious Bertrand Russell was offering his prescription for how to grow old and across the Atlantic the vivacious elderly Henry Miller was distilling the secret to remaining young at heart as a matter of being able to “fall in love again and again… forgive as well as forget… keep from growing sour, surly, bitter and cynical.”\nBut no one has approached the universal problem of advancing from youth to old age, or the dialogue between the two within a lifetime and across generations, more insightfully, delightfully, and with richer nuance than the great classics scholar and linguist Jane Ellen Harrison (September 9, 1850&ndash;April 15, 1928), whose extraordinary life I came upon in Francesca Wade&#8217;s altogether scrumptious book Square Haunting: Five Writers in London Between the Wars (public library) and whose work revolutionized the modern understanding of Ancient Greek culture by upending millennia of patriarchal revisionism with Harrison&#8217;s discovery of an entire class of “matriarchal, husbandless goddesses” central to community life and ritual. \nIn her sixty-fifth year, as World War I was breaking out, Harrison reflected in a letter that &#8220;work &#038; friendship come to be the whole of life.&#8221; As the ledger of her life grew thick with decades, she never lost her intellectual vivacity, her lively intergenerational friendships, her active engagement with the ever-pulsating world of scholars and artists &#8212; in no small part because of the life and love she shared with her significantly younger partner: the poet, novelist, and translator Hope Mirrlees.  \nHope Mirrlees and Jane Ellen Harrison\nThat same year, Harrison was startled to hear one of her young, talented colleagues at Trinity College proclaim that “no one over thirty is worth speaking to.” With her winking intelligence, she observed:\nThis is really very interesting and extraordinarily valuable. Here we have, not a reasoned conclusion, but a real live emotion, a good solid prejudice, a genuine attitude of gifted Youth to Crabbed Age. It is my business to understand and, if I can, learn from it. Give me an honest prejudice, and I am always ready to attend to it.\nIn a sentiment that ought to be the ultimate manifesto for intellectual and emotional humility, direly needed in our own time, she adds:\nI am long past blame and praise, or, rather, I am not yet ready for them; there is so much still waiting to be understood.\nAnd so she set out to do just that in an entertaining, existentially profound essay titled &#8220;Crabbed Age and Youth,&#8221; published in her 1915 essay collection Alpha and Omega (public library).\nHarrison considers the rudiments of maturity and what makes us who we are by examining the &#8220;relations between fairly mature youth and quite early middle age,&#8221; defining the latter as &#8220;anything completely or hopelessly grown up &#8212; anything, say, well over thirty,&#8221; winking at the relativity of age with the memory of a time when a person of fourteen appeared to her child-self &#8220;utterly grown up.&#8221; Reflecting on the young scholar&#8217;s remark, and noting in herself with even greater alarm a similar &#8220;counter-prejudice&#8221; against youth, she observes:\nThe reasons by which people back up their prejudices are mostly negligible &#8212; not reason at all at bottom, but just instinctive self-justifications; but prejudice, rising as it does in emotion, has its roots in life and reality.\nShe notes that while there is often great friction between the young and the old, this friction can, &#8220;if rightly understood and considerately handled on both sides, take the form of mutual stimulus and attraction&#8221; &#8212; for it most often springs from a lack of understanding of each other&#8217;s state of being and frame of reference. The source of this friction is also the source of the exquisite complementarity of the two life-stages: \nYouth and Crabbed Age stand broadly for the two opposite poles of human living, poles equally essential to any real vitality, but always contrasted. Youth stands for rationalism*, for the intellect and its concomitants, egotism and individualism. Crabbed Age stands for tradition, for the instincts and emotions, with their concomitant altruism. (*Note: Due allowance of course being made for the anti-intellectual reaction in the present generation.)\n[&#8230;]\nThe whole art of living is a delicate balance between the two tendencies. Virtues and vice are but convenient analytic labels attached to particular forms of the two tendencies. Of the two, egotism, self-assertion, are to the youth as necessary &#8212; sometimes, I sadly think, more necessary &#8212; to good living than altruism. Moreover, the egotism of youth is compulsory, inevitable, and equally the altruism of age is ineductable.\nIllustration by Maurice Sendak for poet Robert Graves&#8217;s little-known children&#8217;s book.\nA century before the selfing pandemic of social media, Harrison considers the chief handicap of the young &#8212; their tendency to &#8220;masquerade,&#8221; which calls to mind Hannah Arendt&#8217;s insight into being vs. appearing and our impulse for self-display, and Walt Whitman&#8217;s reflection on what trees teach us about being rather than seeming. She writes:\nActing is sinking your own personality in order that you may mimic another’s. Masquerading is borrowing another’s personality, putting on the mask of another’s features, dress, experiences, emotions, and thereby enhancing your own&#8230; Youth, and especially shy Youth, is strongly possessed by the instinctive desire to masquerade.\n[&#8230;]\nMasquerading bores Crabbed Age. Why?\nSimply because the impulse to imaginative self-enhancement dies down as soon as liberty to live is granted&#8230; Crabbed Age is busy living, not rehearsing, and living, if sometimes less amusing, is infinitely more absorbing. It takes so much out of you.\nAnd yet the old have their own way of oppressing the young, equally alienating to both and equally damaging to the collective mosaic of culture:\nIt is a waste of time putting up signposts for others who necessarily travel by another, and usually a better, road. Old people are apt to make disastrous confusion between information that can be accumulated and conveyed, that is identical for all time, that is knowledge, and experience, that which must be lived and cannot be repeated.\nBut Old Age does worse than that. In trying to impose its experience as a law to youth it sins not only through ignorance, but from sheer selfishness. Parents try to impose their view of life on their children not merely or mostly to save those children from disaster &#8212; that to a certain extent and up to a certain age we must all do &#8212; but from possessiveness, from a desire, often unconscious, to fill the whole stage themselves.\n[&#8230;]\nThe truth that it has failed to grasp is a hard one for human nature. This truth is that, in all matters that can be analyzed and known, Youth starts life on the shoulders of Age, and therefore&#8230; sees farther and is actually more likely to be right.\nAcross this divide youth and old age frustrate and bore each other &#8212; one excited about everything, especially the masquerade of the self, the other increasingly specialized and outward-focused in its excitations, and at times oppressively so. But eventually, Harrison observes, life intercedes and the young are forced &#8212; by falling in love, by creative self-actualization, by some great calamity or illness, by the demands of a career, by the demands of a family &#8212; to shed their masks and narrow their locus of concerns, growing more entwined with other selves:\nThrough any bit of actual work or responsibility, Youth takes a part in life, becomes a real part, instead of claiming a theatrical whole, straight-way Youth mellows, becomes interesting and easier to live with.\nIn a passage of extraordinary insight into the meat of life, she writes:\nReal life &#8212; and here comes the important point &#8212; real life, as contrasted with life imagined and rehearsed, on the whole compels at least a certain measure of altruism. There are many methods of compulsion, some gentle, some violent. We will consider for a moment only two, and these the most normal.\nNormally, in the first place, life itself will lure you, catch you, and marry you, make a father or a mother of you, and your children will soon stop your masquerading, and teach you that you are not the centre of their universe &#8212; nay, compel you to revolve round the circumference of theirs. Marriage, through the lure of passion for the individual, compels your service to the race. This great education in altruism is necessarily more drastic and complete for woman than for man.\nBut suppose you elude the natural lure of life. There is society waiting with its artificial lure &#8212; waiting to catch you and make an official of you, a functionary, a thing that is only half or a quarter perhaps yourself, and a large three-quarters that tool and mouthpiece of the collective conscience. How often one has seen a year’s officialdom turn a man’s spiritual hair grey! The gist of all officialdom is not its labels, its honours, but the sacrifice of the individual will; and for this society is always ready, and rightly, to pay a big price. Of course, though there is loss, there is great gain in officialdom as in marriage. Each is a godly discipline by which the young man learns not to be the centre of his own universe.\nIllustration by Maurice Sendak for a rare edition of the Brothers Grimm fairy tales.\nRecognizing that children are often the most distilled and unalloyed version of all of our adult puzzlements and confusions, she adds:\nThis being the centre of your own &#8212; of course, quite fictitious &#8212; universe is best seen in the extreme case of the megalomania of young children, as yet untaught by life. Their own experience is always illuminating. \n[&#8230;]\n At seven years old one cannot analyze, so one must agonize. That is why it is so terrible to be a child, or even a young thing at all. One sees things, feels them, whole. There is no such devastating, desolating experience as to have been at the centre, warm and sheltered, and suddenly to be at the outmost circumference, and be asked to revolve as spectator and sympathizer round a newly-formed centre.\nWe carry much of that primal self-centeredness, and the grief of its loss, well into young adulthood &#8212; a term, and concept, that didn&#8217;t exist in Harrison&#8217;s era. Eric Berne&#8217;s revolutionary framework of the Child, Parent, and Adult ego-states that live in each of us was still half a century away. With her own singular lens on how we become ourselves &#8212; and our selves &#8212; Harrison writes:\nAs long as you want to be, and feel yourself to be, the whole of life, as long as you do not specialize and become a functionary, you do not co-operate, you cannot apprehend or be interested in the personalities of others. You are only one of a great chorus, all masquerading, all shouting, “Me, Me—look at ME!” Once you specialize, once you become an actor with a part in life, then you need all the other actors; the play cannot go on without them. Even your part in it depends on them. The me becomes us.\n[&#8230;]\nFar from it being true that specialization narrows the individuality, specialization is almost the condition of any true individualism. Through co-operation the sense of personality is born and nourished&#8230; The narrow, tedious people are those who are “living their own lives” and consciously “developing their own individualities” &#8212; trying to out-shout the other members of the chorus instead of singing in tune, playing their part as actors in a troupe.\nWith the kind of lucidity that only conscientious hindsight confers, she paints an image that captures the whole paradox of becoming:\nIt is one of the tragic antinomies of life that you cannot at once live and have vision&#8230; Looking back on life I seem to see Youth as standing, a small, intensely-focused spot, outside a great globe or circle. So intense is the focus that the tiny spot believes itself the centre of the great circle. Then slowly that little burning, throbbing spot that is oneself is sucked in with thousands of others into the great globe. Humbled by life it learns that it is no centre of life at all; at most it is one of the myriads of spokes in the great wheel. In Old Age the speck, the individual life, passes out on the other side, no longer burning and yet not quite consumed. In Old Age we look back on the great wheel; we can see it a little because, at least partially, we are outside of it. But this looking back is strangely different from the looking forward of Youth. It is disillusioned, but so much the richer. Occasionally nowadays I get glimpses of what that vision might be. I get my head for a moment out of the blazing, blinding, torturing wheel; the vision of the thing behind me and without me obscurely breaks. It looks strange, almost portentous, yet comforting; but that vision is incommunicable.\nArt by Carson Ellis from What Is Love? by Mac Barnett\nCrowning the essay is a wonderfully nuanced definition of age, emanating a kind of wisdom difficult for the ego to nod at but beautiful and necessary:\nAnyone who cares passionately for abstract discussion, be his hair never so grey, his hand never so palsied, is in spirit young. I do not say this is an advantage. It is possible to stay young too long. There is a “time to grow old.”\n[&#8230;]\nPeople ask: “Would you or would you not like to be young again?” Of course, it is really one of those foolish questions that never should be asked, because they are impossible. You cannot be &#8212; you that are &#8212; young again. You cannot unroll that snowball which is you: there is no “you” except your life &#8212; lived. But apart from that, when you rise from what somebody calls “the banquet of life,” flushed with the wine of life, can you want to sit down again? When you have climbed the hill, and the view is just breaking, do you want to reclimb it? A thousand times no! Anyone who honestly wants to be young again has never lived, only imagined, only masqueraded. Of course, if you never eat, you keep your appetite for dinner.\nThe day after Jane Harrison died &#8212; an unseasonable spring day of &#8220;bitter windy rain&#8221; &#8212; Virginia Woolf recorded in her diary that she had gone for a walk in the cemetery and run into Hope, Jane&#8217;s partner, distraught and &#8220;half sleep&#8221; with grief. Virginia, who was months from publishing Orlando &#8212; her four-century love letter to Vita, the great love of her own life &#8212; recounted her encounter with the brokenhearted Hope:\nWe kissed by Cromwell’s daughter’s grave, where Shelley used to walk, for Jane’s death. She lay dead outside the graveyard in that back room where we saw her lately raised on her pillows, like a very old person, whom life has tossed up, &#038; left; exalted, satisfied, exhausted.\nHope later received a note of condolence from Virginia, containing a single line. &#8220;It was more comforting than all my other letters put together,&#8221; she told a friend half a lifetime later. It read:\nBut remember what you have had.\ndonating = lovingFor a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

        "description": "Aaron Judge’s work is impressive, but it probably won’t set the record some people wish it did. | Gregory Fisher-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  It’s pointless to debate about the “real” home run record. It’s right there in the books. Way, way back in 2001 and 2003 there were very similar arguments being had by fans of the American League. Did Ichiro Suzuki in 2001 and Hideki Matsui in 2003 deserve to have a shot at Rookie of the Year awards? The people arguing against them largely seemed to have ulterior motives in the forms of other players they preferred get the award. That was certainly true of Royals fans in 2003 with Angel Berroa playing his rookie season for KC.\nAs it turns out, the arguments are all moot. Ichiro did win the award in 2001 and while Matsui came in second - to Berroa no less! - the votes he received were officially recorded and he will forever be known as the 2003 RoY Runner-up. You see, it isn’t up to us fans to decide these things. MLB is the authority over its own records. And that brings us back to Aaron Judge.\nAs of this writing, Aaron Judge has 55 home runs on the season. An astonishing number to be sure. He’s almost certain to break the Yankees’ single-season record of 61 set by Roger Maris. What he is unlikely to do is to break the MLB single-season record of 73 set by Barry Bonds. This has led to some people arguing whether or not Bonds’ record should count and whether Judge might hold the “real” record when he’s done (fans willing to dismiss Bonds seem equally willing to ignore all the home runs hit by Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire.) This is a dumb argument. Like it or not, Barry Bonds hit 73 home runs in 2001. They were legally hit in official MLB games. MLB has not stricken those home runs from the record - which is likely a far more complicated exercise than you assume - and so they officially count. If Judge mashes 19 home runs in the month of September he can have the MLB home run record. Otherwise, he’ll be behind at least Bonds and probably Sosa and McGwire, too. That’s just the way records work.\nRule changes are coming to MLB next year\nMLB announced yesterday a set of three new rules that will be implemented next season. I’d just like to take a moment here to run my victory lap for successfully predicting exactly the rules which will be implemented next year. I already said what I have to say about the rules, so let me pull back the curtain a bit on sportswriting predictions, instead.\nAt their very best, a sports prediction is simply making an educated guess. Alongside that, sportswriting is, first and foremost, an entertainment business. Or, it was until sports betting exploded back onto the scene, anyway. But most sportswriters still treat it as entertainment because that’s how they’ve always done it. Finally, so far as I am aware, there is no penalty for guessing wrong. All of that means that sometimes making a prediction is more complicated than looking at all of the available data and choosing the most likely outcome. \nThis is why you’ll see a bunch of NFL pundits suggesting that the Chiefs might not win the AFC West this year. It’s not that that’s the likeliest outcome. It’s also not because they necessarily truly believe that all the factors that could lead KC’s football team losing more games than another AFC West rival will come to pass. It’s just as likely because they simply think it’s boring to pick the Chiefs to win the division again, and they feel they can make a reasonable argument against it.\nSo keep that in mind the next time you hear a prediction that seems patently ridiculous to you. It’s entirely probable that the sports commentator in question also thinks it’s unlikely but wanted to say something different in order to provide you with more entertainment. Also, the nature of educated guesses and the massive range of outcomes in sports means that whenever we do get one right, we almost all feel the need to crow about it.",

        "description": "The Russian Defense Ministry announced on Saturday that it had removed forces from around several areas near the city of Kharkiv, according to state-run media agency TASS. \n\n\n\nIn a bulleted statement posted to Telegram, TASS reported that the Russian Defense Ministry made a number of statements regarding the war in Ukraine on Saturday. \n\n\n\nChiefly, the ministry said that troops had been removed from the Balakleya and Izyum regions to \"step up efforts in the Donetsk\" region, according to the translated message. \n\n\n\n\"The Izyum-Balakleyskaya grouping of Russian troops was rolled up in three days and transferred to the territory of the DPR,\" the statement from TASS read. \n\n\n\nRussian forces left to focus on achieving “the stated goals of the special military operation to liberate Donbass,” the defense ministry said.\n\n\n\nThe announcement came after Ukrainian officials said its forces had made&nbsp;major advances in the region in the past week. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nUkraine’s security service and foreign ministry both said on Saturday that Ukrainian troops had retaken the town of Kupiansk, north of Izyum. Videos circulating on social media and reports from the British Defense Ministry also suggested that Ukrainian forces were advancing on Izyum.\n\n\n\nIn the nearly seven months since Russia first invaded Ukraine, it has been forced to reevaluate its aims for the war. \n\n\n\nAfter failing to take the Ukrainian capital of Kyiv, Russian forces refocused their efforts on eastern Ukraine, where most of the fighting has occurred in recent months.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

nation cannot afford apologists for NASA, any incompetent or greedy contractors who may supply the agency, nor the clueless politicians who enable failure and the disgraceful waste of American taxpayers’ hard-earned money.\n\n\n\nThe two recently scrubbed launch attempts for the $4.1 billion unmanned Artemis 1 moon mission is not the problem; it’s simply a poorly cobbled-together poster child for a once great space program that is spiraling down into late-night joke status. But the punchline of this joke is negative national and economic security consequences for the American people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring his historic speech on Sept. 12, 1962, at Rice University, on the need for the United States to become the “preeminent spacefaring nation,” John F. Kennedy stressed: “We mean to be a part of it — we mean to lead it. For the eyes of the world now look into space, to the moon and to the planets beyond, and we have vowed that we shall not see it governed by a hostile flag of conquest, but by a banner of freedom and peace. … For space science, like nuclear science and all technology, has no conscience of its own. Whether it will become a force for good or ill depends on man, and only if the United States occupies a position of preeminence can we help decide whether this new ocean will be a sea of peace or a new terrifying theater of war.”\n\n\n\nThe young president was right to articulate those worries. That said, he was about six decades too early. In 1962, there was no nation capable of turning space — or the moon — into the ultimate “high ground” for military purposes. Today, Russia remains a worry, but it is the People’s Republic of China that is taking center stage in the militarization of space. President Kennedy’s 1962 fear is all too real in 2022. All that we know, from low Earth orbit to the surface of the moon, one day may be “governed by a hostile flag of conquest.”\n\n\n\nThe belief by some that once humans cut through Earth’s atmosphere into the vacuum of space, our flaws, greed, prejudices and military ambitions will be left behind is not only naïve, but dangerous. And NASA and our space program are foundering because they are leaderless and lack a true champion.\n\n\n\nAside from working on space-related issues at the Pentagon, and later consulting for NASA and the Space Shuttle team, I also had the honor to speak with all 12 men who walked on the moon.&nbsp; Each told me that without the enthusiastic support of the U.S. president, the space program would be rudderless in a number of substantial ways. Sadly, our space program has not had that champion since Kennedy. Some presidents of late honestly have seemed more interested in space heaters than space programs.\n\n\n\nToday, as NASA focuses on matters such as identity politics, the proper use of pronouns and global warming, China is taking dead aim at the moon and the energy independence-giving helium-3 that litters its surface. The helium-3 isotope could provide a potentially limitless supply of safe, clean, green energy. Some experts estimate the moon’s surface holds over 2 million metric tons of helium-3, and that just 25 metric tons could fuel the energy needs of the United States for a year.\n\n\n\nSo, helium 3 could prove to be the game-changer that not only reshapes our future but also determines control of the near solar system. Many people may not be familiar with this “miracle” isotope, but I can assure you the military leaders who run China’s space program realize its potential and are counting on it.\n\n\n\nJust as China strategically buys the silence of Big Tech and other U.S. corporations, American universities, sports entities and Hollywood with multibillion-dollar contracts, Beijing is predictably stealing our milk money and eating our lunch when it comes to being the “preeminent spacefaring nation.”\n\n\n\nChina is depending on NASA, our defense contractors, the White House and Congress to go even more woke, waste more money and time, and continue to ignore the lessons of history. Should the do-nothing Republicans somehow win back control of Congress in November, they would be wise to initiate hearings to hold NASA and its contractors accountable for their politically correct but foolish decisions.\n\n\n\nThe moon and the energy independence and military advantage it can provide is waiting. China is heading there, and its taikonauts are bringing a bright red “Keep Off” sign with them.\n\n\n\nDouglas MacKinnon, a political and communications consultant, was a writer in the White House for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush, and former special assistant for policy and communications at the Pentagon during the last three years of the Bush administration.&nbsp;",

— How clean are the air and water in your state? \n\n\n\nUsing 2021 data, U.S. News and World Reports' feature on the \"Best States\" has ranked U.S. states on several metrics, including economics, education and health care. The listing also measures natural environment, which is based on a state's air/water quality and pollution levels.\n\n\n\nPollution was determined based on air and water emissions from industry and utilities, and overall measures to long-term human health effects, using information from the Environmental Protection Agency.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tCalifornia school district asks parents to house teachers as costs surge\t\n\n\n\n\nBelow are the most polluted (no. 50-40) and least polluted (no. 10-1) in U.S. News' Pollution Rankings.\n\n\n\nStates with the worst pollution\n\n\n\n50. Louisiana\n\n\n\n49. Nevada \n\n\n\n48. Indiana\n\n\n\n47. Delaware \n\n\n\n46. Utah\n\n\n\n45. Ohio \n\n\n\n44. Oregon\n\n\n\n43. Tennessee\n\n\n\n42. Illinois\n\n\n\n41. Alabama \n\n\n\n40. Texas \n\n\n\nLouisiana ranks dead last, coming in as the most-polluted state in the U.S., according to EPA information.\n\n\n\nA January 2022 study by Tulane University found very high incidences of cancer in Louisiana, the second-highest in the U.S. At least 85 cancer cases per year in the state were due to exposure to high levels of air pollution, the study found. Authors included data for neighborhoods in an area between Baton Rouge and New Orleans, which is locally known as \"Cancer Alley.\"\n\n\n\nThe state of Nevada ranks as the second-most polluted state, according to EPA information. Just last year, Nevada ranked among the \"unhealthiest\" states for air quality in the American Lung Association's State of the Air report.\n\n\n\nAt that time, Melissa Ramos, manager of the Nevada ALA's Clean Air Advocacy, said the Classic Car loophole was partly to blame for the state's high emissions. Under the state's Classic Vehicle Insurance policies, vehicles bearing certain license plates are exempt from emissions testing. Some tightening of the laws on classic vehicles is coming Jan. 1, 2023, however. \n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tIs now the right time for Millennial and Gen Z workers to switch jobs?\t\n\n\n\n\nThe least polluted states\n\n\n\n10. Idaho \n\n\n\n9. Colorado \n\n\n\n8. Maine \n\n\n\n7. Rhode Island\n\n\n\n6. California \n\n\n\n5. Wyoming \n\n\n\n4. New Mexico \n\n\n\n3. South Dakota \n\n\n\n2. New Hampshire \n\n\n\n1. Vermont\n\n\n\nThe state of Vermont is aware of its relatively good bill of health. \n\n\n\nThe Vermont Agency of Natural Resources writes that \"Vermont's air quality is considered to be among the best in the nation.\" The agency notes, however, that Vermont's air is not pollutant-free.\n\n\n\nInteresting: Even though California ranks sixth among the least polluted states, many of its cities rank among America's most polluted. Research from the American Lung Association ranked cities by ozone pollution, year-round particle pollution, and short-term particle pollution. California areas that ranked in the ALA's top 10 most polluted cities in all three pollution categories include Los Angeles-Long Beach, Bakersfield, Fresno-Madera-Hanford, and Sacramento-Roseville.\n\n\n\nPollutants\n\n\n\nSix common air pollutants identified and regulated by the EPA are carbon monoxide, lead, nitrogen oxides, ground-level ozone, particle pollution (also called \"particulate matter\"), and sulfur oxides. Other air pollutants include asbestos, fuel oils and kerosene, and benzene.",

        "description": "(NEXSTAR) – The National 9/11 Museum &amp; Memorial has a special place for “sky blue.”\n\n\n\nIn recent years, the 9/11 Museum &amp; Memorial has encouraged buildings across New York City to light up their rooftops or facades in remembrance of those who were killed during the attacks on September 11. Specifically, the city’s iconic buildings will be illuminated in a striking sky blue — a color that holds special significance for the organization, and the city as a whole.\n\n\n\nSky blue, or “Memorial Blue” as the color is also referred to, symbolizes the city’s (and the world’s) general perception of the sky in the morning just prior to the attacks. In fact, the cloudless skies above NYC on 9/11 had been described as what pilots and meteorologists call “severe clear,” meaning visibility conditions were seemingly infinite, according to the National 9/11 Museum &amp; Memorial.\n\n\n\nThis year, dozens of iconic buildings, landmarks and institutions will again be partaking in the “Tributes in Light” event, itself an extension of the longstanding (and perhaps more recognizable) “Tribute in Light” art installation in Lower Manhattan, which form two columns of white light shining up the heavens.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSmaller 9/11 Tribute Museum in NYC closing its doors\t\n\n\n\n\nSky blue, too, is also a prominent feature of one of the museum’s most visually arresting installations, titled “Trying to Remember the Color of the Sky on That September Morning.” Found inside museum's Memorial Hall, the piece is comprised of 2,983 watercolor squares — representing each of the lives lost on Sept. 11 and the 1993 bombing at the World Trade Center — showcasing different hues of blue to symbolize our memories of the sky on the morning of September 11, 2001. \n\n\n\n“Our own perception of the color blue might not be the same as that of another person,” the museum explains of the different hues in the piece, created by artist Spencer Finch. “However, just like our perception of color, our memories share a common point of reference.”\n\n\n\nThe \"sky blue\" campaign is an extension of the longstanding “Tribute in Light” art installation in Lower Manhattan, which comprises of two vertical columns of light representing the Twin Towers. (AP Photo/Stefan Jeremiah)\n\n\n\nThe Museum is also encouraging folks to “Remember the Sky” by sharing photos of the sky to social media on Sept. 11, to help ensure that younger generations never forget the significance of the date.\n\n\n\n“Through creating a shared moment of active remembrance together, the 9/11 Memorial &amp; Museum aims to help spur conversation on social media platforms and elsewhere that can serve as a bridge between memory and history for the tens of millions of young people who did not live through that day that changed our world forever,” the museum has written of the campaign.\n\n\n\nThose wishing to learn more about the commemorations taking place on 9/11 can visit 911memorial.org for additional information.",

        "description": "Photo by Norm Hall/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Lugbauer’s 27th blast set the new high watermark in Mississippi’s franchise history While the offenses on the Atlanta Braves farm system didn’t have the most spectacular days, they were able to string hits together when it mattered to put up big innings in three wins. FIrst round pick Owen Murphy put up a flawless outing in Augusta’s win while Drew Lugbauer set the single season home run record for Mississippi. \n(61-70) Gwinnett Stripers 1, (69-62) Buffalo Bisons 3\nBox Score\n\nOzzie Albies, 2B: 0-3, .167/.167/.167\nTaylor Motter, DH: 1-2, HR, 2 BB, .250/.344/.516\nKyle Muller, SP: 5 IP, 6 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 2 BB, 6 K, 3.06 ERA\nSeth Elledge, RP: 1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K, 4.07 ERA\n\n\n(61-70) Gwinnett Stripers 1, (69-62) Buffalo Bisons 3\nBox Score\n\nDelino DeShields, CF: 0-1, 2 BB, .227/.374/.270\nTaylor Motter, RF: 2-3, HR, 4 RBI, .261/.356/.609\nHernan Perez, 2B: 1-3, .280/.324/.422\nMike Soroka, SP: 4 IP, 3 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 2 BB, 3 K, 5.06 ERA\nMichael Tonkin, RP: 1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K, 3.53 ERA\n\nLife was tough for the Gwinnett bats in game one, with Taylor Motter’s solo home run in the fourth inning being the only run they scored in the game. Only two Gwinnett hitters reached base in the game with Motter having the honors thrice and Joe Dunand recording a single and a walk. That home run in the fourth did tie the game 1-1, but Buffalo was right back at it in the bottom of the inning to take the lead. Kyle Muller was shaky at times throughout this start and the first inning hurt him when he allowed a run on two hits and a walk. He could have been in for a longer evening, but on the final play of the first Jake Marisnick was successful in cutting down a second runner trying to score to get Muller out of it. Muller again got eaten up in the fifth inning when a two run home run put Buffalo on top for good.\nGame two was a bit better for Gwinnett in that they at least were able to string their baserunners together from multiple players to score enough runs to win. After three innings of futility Delino DeShields led off in the fourth with a walk which was quickly followed by a single from Hernan Perez. This brought up the red-hot Taylor Motter who stayed streaking when he cranked his second home run of the day to put the Stripers up 3-0. Unfortunately for the Stripers this coincided with the end of the line for Mike Soroka. Soroka retired nine of the first ten batters he faced in the game but the second time through the lineup was unkind to him and in the fourth inning he allowed three runs before recording an out. He managed to settle down and get out of it with a tie still in play and Gwinnett was able to pick him up later in the game. Motter drove in every single Gwinnett run during the double header, and the final one didn’t come via the long ball. He lined a sixth inning single to score DeShields and give Gwinnett a lead they did not relinquish. Michael Tonkin shut down the game with a perfect ninth inning to give the Stripers their first win of the series. \nNext Game: 9/10 @ (69-63) Buffalo Bisons @ 6:05 PM ET\n\n(59-69) Mississippi Braves 3, (60-67) Biloxi Shuckers 8\nBox Score\n\nCody Milligan, 2B: 1-4, BB, 2 SB .293/.368/.347\nDrew Lugbauer, 1B: 1-4, HR, BB, 2 RBI, .213/.333/.448\nJustyn-Henry Malloy, LF: 3-5, RBI, .291/.415/.448\nAlan Rangel, SP: 3.1 IP, 9 H, 8 R, 8 ER, 1 BB, 3 K, 5.45 ERA\nIndigo Diaz, RP:  1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 3.09 ERA\n\nMississippi has no claim to a good evening, but one player did reach an important milestone in Friday evening’s game. The Braves offense struggled early and found themselves down 8-0 after four innings making the rest of the game mostly just procedural. Drew Lugbauer finally got Mississippi on the board in the sixth inning with a two run home run, his 27th of the season. That blast sets a new single season record for Mississippi, though unfortunately it proved to be a meaningless play in the scheme of the game. Justyn-Henry Malloy drove home Cody Milligan in the seventh inning for the third run of the game and Mississippi went down quickly after that.\nAlan Rangel will not want to remember this game, as he got absolutely pounded to the tune of eight runs. It wasn’t one particular bad inning for Rangel either, he just couldn’t find it all game and allowed three runs as part of an eight-run outing. The bullpen for Mississippi was absolutely fantastic however, and over 4 2⁄3 innings combined didn’t allow a single hit. This started with AJ Puckett, who struck out a game-high three batters in 1 2⁄3 perfect innings immediately in relief of Rangel. Lisandro Santos was the only one who didn’t manage a strikeout in his scoreless sixth inning, and he was followed by Justin Maese and Indigo Diaz each taking innings. \nNext Game: 9/10 @ (60-67) Biloxi Shuckers @ 7:35 PM ET\n\n(73-54) Rome Braves 5, (66-64) Hickory Crawdads 4\nBox Score\n\nKeshawn Ogans, 2B: 1-4 .211/.304/.263\nCal Conley, SS: 1-3, 2B, BB, .260/.337/.429\nKadon Morton, CF: 1-3, HR, 4 RBI, .167/.231/.417\nJJ Niekro, SP: 5 IP, 4 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 2 BB, 4 K, 4.88 ERA\nRolddy Munoz, RP: 1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, 6.23 ERA\n\nRome only scored in one inning, but that big fourth was enough to lift them to a win over Hickory and clinch the South Division title for the second half. After falling behind 1-0 after three innings Rome got it started thanks to Geraldo Quintero, who was hit by a pitch to spark the rally. Keshawn Ogans then reached on a bunt single and Adam Zebrowski tied the game on a sacrifice fly. A walk and an error then loaded the bases, which brought up Kadon Morton who has struggled since his promotion to Rome. This time however he saw one pitch and turned on it for a grand slam to give Rome a commanding 5-1 lead. This was Morton’s first home run in a Rome uniform and his seventh in his past 22 games across two levels. Rome only had one other hit in the rest of the game, so there was not much of intrigue outside of Morton’s blast. \nJJ Niekro put together a solid outing for the Braves, dancing around a handful of trouble spots to deliver a one run outing over five innings. Niekro faced runners on second and third in the first inning with only one out, but got a clutch strikeout and then a ground out to escape unharmed. Hickory got to Niekro on an RBI double in the third inning but otherwised managed little success. The bullpen was a bit of a different story. Rolddy Munoz shut things down in the sixth inning but Miguel Pena allowed three hits in the sixth inning before being pulled from the game with only one out. Benjamin Dum stranded both of the runners Pena left to him to keep the game at 5-2 and Grant Holmes pitched a scoreless eighth inning to give the ball to close Austin Smith for the ninth. Smith made things far to interesting when a two run home run got the lead down to one run. Needing just one out he struggled to shut the door and a single and fielding error put the tying run in scoring position. Finally Smith was able to get the finally out and seal a Rome win. \nNext Game: 9/10 @ (66-64) Hickory Crawdads @ 7:00 PM ET\n\n(68-61) Augusta GreenJackets 6, (57-73) Kannapolis Cannonballers 1\nBox Score\n\nDavid McCabe, 3B: 1-3, 2B, BB, RBI, .242/.336/.326\nEJ Exposito, 2B: 2-4, 2B, .224/.371/.365\nIgnacio Alvarez, SS: 0-2, 3 BB, .279/.492/.372\nOwen Murphy, SP: 4 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 5 K, 7.71 ERA\nRob Griswold, RP: 1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K, 4.12 ERA\n\nBig innings were the theme in Friday’s wins and Augusta gave us another one with a late rally to take a win over Kannapolis. Both teams were locked in a scoreless battle through six innings until Ethan Workinger cracked an RBI double to score David McCabe and give Augusta a lead. This lead lasted all of half an inning as Kannapolis was able to tie in the bottom of the seventh inning. In classic GreenJackets fashion they just waited around for the other team to mess up, and in the eighth inning that began with a hit batter and two walks to load the bases with no outs. McCabe then drew an RBI walk and Augusta was once again in the lead. Noah Williams was hit by a pitch to force home a second run all without the GreenJackets putting a ball in play in the inning. A balk, a fielding error, and a sacrifice fly scored three more runs in the inning and Augusta somehow managed a five run inning without a single hit. \nOwen Murphy showed off why he was Atlanta’s first round pick with his best performance as a professional. Over four innings Murphy didn’t allow a single hit while striking out five and getting through it all on just 47 pitches. Murphy’s only blemish was a two-out walk in the second inning and he now has 10 strikeouts in seven innings with Augusta. Rainery Rodriguez got the ball for an extended relief outing and he too was brilliant with four innings and only one run allowed. Rodriguez kept the no-hitter going for two more innings but consecutive hits led off the seventh and put Augusta in their only real trouble of the game. A sacrifice fly scored a run and tied the game but Rodriguez kept the game there and skated through the eighth inning. Rob Griswold got the ball to close it out and was perfect to clinch an Augusta win.\nNext Game: 9/10 @ (57-73) Kannapolis Cannonballers @ 7:00 PM ET",

        "description": "The annual Selby Avenue JazzFest is being held on Saturday in St. Paul. Each year the event features a variety of genres from jazz, Latin, R&amp;B, neo soul and reggae.Longtime organizer Mychael Wright says Rondo residents look forward to hearing the music each year and coming together as a community. “The glue is what keeps us together and I keep the pulse of my community close,” Wright said. “We hear them throughout the year and what is going on in society and just try to be uplifting as much as we can.”Bands include the Erica West Band, Walker West Music Academy, Pavel Jany’s World Jazz Collegium Sextet, the Minnesota State Band and the Selby Avenue Brass Band. Lynval Jackson and The International Reggae All Stars will highlight the festival at the end of the night. Wright says community members play a key role in creating the lineup for the jazz festival. While he says the event features a non-traditional lineup, it’s what makes the Selby Avenue Jazz Festival unique. “I listen to folks from the outside and try to make them feel that they have a part in this because they do.” Wright said. “Watching the faces of the people is what is key to me backstage and if they’re smiling, nodding or enjoying the music. We try to start at a low key and build up to a crescendo to keep them coming back next year.”Each year Wright says a big focus of the jazz festival is making sure the event addresses the community’s needs. The Selby Avenue JazzFest will also feature a family fun zone, health and wellness village and put a spotlight on local businesses from the neighborhood - who Wright says have worked hard to make Selby Avenue a destination place. “Selby isn’t what it used to be and it’s come a long way,” Wright said. “This gives our vendors an opportunity to have a better holiday than if they had not come together, show their wares, cook their food and have all the different personalities that we have at the jazz festival.”Having run the Selby Avenue JazzFest for over two decades, Wright says the neighborhood’s tight-knit community has kept it going strong. He is now looking to pass on the event to the next generation and believes community members will take the lead running the jazz festival for years to come.“I would like to see it continue for another 20-plus years and I think someone will step up,” Wright said. “What this does is keep our community relevant and in the spotlight each year.”The Selby Avenue JazzFest takes place at the intersection of Selby and Milton Avenues. ",

        "description": "Photo by Michael Reaves/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Cubs go for two straight over the visitors from San Francisco. Saturday notes...\n\n\nATTENDANCE WATCH: Through Friday, the Cubs have announced 2,274,314 tickets sold through 70 dates, an average of 32,490 per date. They must average 29,608 tickets sold for the 11 remaining dates to have 2.6 million for the season. The last time the Cubs announced fewer than 2.6 million tickets sold in a full-capacity season (2020 and 2021 excluded) was 1997.\n\nNICO WATCH: Nico Hoerner, last 15 games since August 24: .298/.344/.509 (17-for-57), two doubles, two triples, two home runs, four stolen bases. His steal Friday was his 18th, the most for any Cub since Javier Báez had 34 in 2018.\n\nRELIEVERS, GOOD AND BAD: Cubs relievers lead MLB in strikeouts with 616, far ahead of the second-best Twins (597). But... they are third-worst in walks (242). Only Pirates (246) and Royals (253) relievers have walked more.\n\nNOT WINNING THE CLOSE ONES: Friday was the Cubs’ 77th game of 2022 decided by two or fewer runs, the most in the major leagues. The Cubs are 19-25 in games decided by one run and 15-18 in games decided by two runs.\n\nHere are today’s particulars.\nCubs lineup:\n\n\nHere is today's #Cubs starting lineup against the Giants. pic.twitter.com/oncpNaKgUU— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Giants lineup was not available at posting time. Please check the BCB Twitter feed for the Giants lineup.\nMarcus Stroman, RHP vs. Logan Webb, RHP\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\nMarcus Stroman in 11 starts since returning from the injured list: 2.49 ERA, 1.125 WHIP. That’s really good! Here’s hoping he can finish the year strong.\nOne of those 11 starts was against the Giants, July 29 in San Francisco. He threw six innings and allowed eight hits, but no runs. \nThere’s that thing this year where Stroman has not thrown well in Wrigley Field. Let’s hope he can break that bad string this afternoon.\nLogan Webb was really good for last year’s Giants, who won the NL West. He’s been even better this year, but the Giants... haven’t.\nWebb last faced the Cubs September 12, 2021 at Wrigley Field, where he threw six innings and allowed two runs. Funny thing, even though that was after last year’s selloff, nine of the 14 Cubs who played in that game are either on the injured list or no longer with the team. Lots of Cubs turnover lately.\nThat’s Webb’s only career start against the Cubs. After a rough start he’s been quite consistent for the last three months or so.\n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \nToday’s game is on Marquee Sports Network. Here’s a list of providers currently carrying Marquee.\nHere is the complete MLB.com Mediacenter for today.\nMLB.com Gameday\nBaseball-reference.com game preview\nPlease visit our SB Nation Giants site McCovey Chronicles. If you do go there to interact with Giants fans, please be respectful, abide by their individual site rules and serve as a good representation of Cub fans in general and BCB in particular.\nThe 2022 Game Thread procedure will be like last year’s, similar to what we’ve used for Spring Training.\nYou’ll find the game preview posted separately on the front page two hours before game time (90 minutes for some early day games following night games).\nAt the same time, a StoryStream containing the preview will also post on the front page, titled “Cubs vs. (Team) (Day of week/date) game threads.” It will contain every post related to that particular game, including the First Pitch Thread and the overflow thread, as well as the recap when it’s published. The recap will also live on the front page as a separate post.\nYou will also be able to find the preview, First Pitch Thread and the overflow thread in the box marked “Chicago Cubs Game Threads” at the bottom of the front page (you can also find them in this section link). The StoryStream for each game can also be found in that section.\nThe First Pitch thread will post at five minutes before game time, then an overflow thread at 90 minutes after the scheduled game time.\nDiscuss amongst yourselves.",

        "description": "The new monarch is quick to quote the playwright, but given the bard’s genius with simple language, who wouldn’t?Why is the apt phrase so often one from Shakespeare? King Charles’s address to the nation has been praised for its emotional authenticity and fitting use of moving words from Hamlet. They are spoken over the dying Danish prince by his friend Horatio, who bids a fond farewell: “Good night, sweet prince, and flights of angels sing thee to thy rest.”Some television viewers recognised the lines not from the classic tragedy, but from an episode of Blackadder. Ben Elton, who co-wrote the TV show, adores Shakespeare, proving his devotion with the sitcom and stage play Upstart Crow and his film All is True, starring Kenneth Branagh as the Bard.

Photograph by Gretchen Berger.\nBy Carol Tannenhauser\nOn Thursday, WSR announced a four-day donation drive to secure essential items for the asylum seekers who have been &#8220;shipped&#8221; to New York City by the cynical governors of Texas and Arizona.\nWell, NYC has proven itself to be a true &#8220;sanctuary city,&#8221; finding shelter and food for more than 7,000 people in the city homeless shelter system. One shelter is on the Upper West Side, and many of its children are already enrolled in and attending school at PS 145, on West 105th Street, where the donation drive was held.\nNow, school officials are saying, Enough, Basta, Dayenu! They are overwhelmed with donations and must regroup.\n“Due to the overwhelming response thanks to the great publicity from the West Side Rag and Council Members Gale Brewer and Shaun Abreu, we have more than we are able to handle and we are unable to take more items,&#8221; wrote Lauren Balaban, VP Fundraising, PS145 PTA. &#8220;Sunday will be a sort and organize day. Please reach out to Volunteers of America for information about monetary and other donations. Thank you for all your incredible support.”\nThanks to Rich Robbins for the tip.",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Yankees and Rays square off in this early Saturday matchup. Not that long ago, this run of three separate series in less than a month against the Tampa Bay Rays felt like a very good opportunity for the Yankees to firmly derail the season of a division rival who’s been a thorn in its side in recent memory.\nHowever, the Yankees’ second-half performance has left disappointing territory about 10 losses ago, this collapse has now put in jeopardy a division title that felt like a mere formality in the middle part of the year.\nIf the Rays win today, then Tampa will have the chance to catch the Yankees on the losing column tomorrow. As of right now, the Rays have three fewer games than the Yankees, sitting in second place with a 78-58 record, while the Yanks are at 83-56 — under four games ahead for the first time since May 9th.\nThe Yankees will send out right-hander Jameson Taillon in search of a repeat performance of his May masterpiece in Tampa Bay. Taillon had what likely could be described as the best outing of his career tossing eight innings of scoreless ball, allowing only a pair of hits, no walks, and striking out five.\nOld acquaintance Corey Kluber will make his fifth start of 2022 against his former team, and if history is any indicator, things are going to be rather dicey. The two-time Cy Young Award winner has allowed only 3 earned runs in 25 innings against the Yankees. New York went down meekly at Kluber’s hands just last week, when he threw seven shutout innings of two-hit ball with no walks in a 2-1 victory.\nJosh Donaldson is back from the paternity list and in the Yankees’ lineup today, where Giancarlo Stanton also makes his first start since Monday. Donaldson’s return unfortunately means — in the Yankees’ eyes anyway — that Oswald Peraza must head to the bench with Isiah Kiner-Falefa back at shortstop. In better bench news, Aaron Hicks takes a seat as well, as they’ll roll out a starting outfield of Miguel Andújar, Aaron Judge, and Oswaldo Cabrera.\nHow to watch\nLocation: Yankee Stadium — Bronx, NY\nFirst pitch: 1:05 pm ET\nTV broadcast: YES Network, Bally Sports Sun, MLB Network (out-of-market only)\nRadio broadcast: WFAN 660/101.9, WADO 1380\nOnline stream: MLB.tv\nFor updates, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, and like us on Facebook.\n\n\nSaturday Matinee. #RepBX Presented by @Hilton pic.twitter.com/6PewSfTlpb— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\n#Rays lineup vs. #Yankees: pic.twitter.com/QedOH0S9ML— Marc Topkin (@TBTimes_Rays) September 10, 2022",

George Valera even homered. I’m not lying about this. I swear to you, there is video evidence and somebody even tweeted it out. \n\n\nValera smash. pic.twitter.com/fEto2sxfpZ— Columbus Clippers (@CLBClippers) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nSadly, the Clippers also grounded into two double plays and stranded six runners. Brennan and Valera paced the offense with three and two hits, respectively. Valera added a walk.\nTanner Tully allowed six runs in five innings. Despite a three-run rally in the top of the ninth, the Clippers could not close the gap. Recently-promoted Carlos Vargas tossed two innings and allowed a run. \nHere’s kinda why baseball is way cooler than most other sports, though: All of his outs came by strikeout, and the only hit he allowed was a solo home run. It’s the eighth home run Vargas has allowed as a professional. Eight, in 141.1 IP total. Not too shabby.\nIn other words, sometimes you give up a home run in the middle of an otherwise dominant performance. George Carlin sneezed during a monologue once, you know?\nAkron RubberDucks 5, Harrisburg Senators 0\nBox Score · RubberDucks improve to 74-56\nDoug Nikhazy woke up effectively wild yesterday.\nIn 4.2 IP, Nikhazy walked six batters and struck out nine. He allowed one hit. \nIt’s about the runs.\nAnd so the RubberDucks moved their relievers — yes, their humble relievers — directly into the central cone. Shutout, fools. \nThey allowed a single hit in the process and managed to strand ten runners on base. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a box score quite like this.\nRubberDucks batters knocked in seven hits. Daniel Schneemann did not get a hit but drew two walks, stole a base, and scored. \nIt’s. About. The. Runs. \n\n\n  U Later! @jjrodz55 launches the first pitch of the inning to put us on top!TOP 4: Akron 1 | Harrisburg 0 pic.twitter.com/3rAkTAm7wM— Akron RubberDucks (@AkronRubberDuck) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nThere it is.\nLake County Captains 6, Fort Wayne TinCaps 5\nBox Score · Captains improve to 75-53\nBefore we do anything else, why does this apple look like Kirk Douglas?\n  \n        \n  \nNow that we have that out of the way, we can jump right to the bottom of the ninth inning.\nAlexfri Planez dug in with the Captains down two. He deposited a 1-2 pitch into the seats to cut the deficit in half. Petey Halpin and Connor Kokx both singled. Cesar Idrogo poked an infield single to score Halpin from third. Micael Ramirez lined out to the left fielder, but no fear — he was loosening the lid, that’s all. Yordys Valdez followed his lead, and this time the liner found grass. Connor Kokx touched home to complete a three-run bottom of the ninth with a glorious walk-off.\n\n\nCOMEBACK CAPTAINS!!!@valdes_yordys provides an RBI single to complete a three-run bottom of the ninth!#AllHandsOnDeck pic.twitter.com/RTcL1UmrmR— Picantes De Lake County (@LCCaptains) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nStupid sexy (?!) apples.\nLynchburg Hillcats 3, Fayetteville Woodpeckers 4 \nBox Score · Hillcats fall to 63-67\nLynchburg eats a lot of baseballs. In last night’s contest they drew eight walks with five hits. Most of the scoring came early, and the two teams traveled to extras deadlocked at three. It all ended when Garret McGowan stroked a double (either ground-rule or automatic; you can never be sure from just a box score). As a result, Ryan Wrobleski scored. \nOne the mound, Juan Zapata worked six innings of three-run baseball, striking out five with no walks and seven hits. Neat. Tidy. Responsible. QUALITY. \nDayan Frias led the charge offensively with two walks and a hit, but Jake Fox wins on style points for drawing an RBI-walk.",

        "description": "The Giants have placed right-hander Dominic Leone on release waivers, per Evan Webeck of the San Jose Mercury News.\nLeone, 30, has had some good seasons and some not-so-good seasons in his career, spending time with Seattle, Arizona, Toronto, St. Louis and Cleveland, prior to signing a minor league deal with the Giants in December of 2020. Leone got called up to the big leagues in June of 2021 and was very strong the rest of the way. He registered a 1.51 ERA over 53 2/3 innings with a 22.8% strikeout rate, 10% walk rate and 47.5% ground ball rate.\nBased on that strong campaign, the Giants retained Leone via arbitration, agreeing to a $2.25MM salary. Everything seemed to be going fine for a while, with Leone sitting on a 2.45 ERA in early July. However, he put up a 6.30 ERA since July 5, pushing his season-long mark to 4.01.\nLeone was placed on the 15-day injured list yesterday due to elbow inflammation, which perhaps explains his diminished results in recent weeks. With just over three weeks remaining in the season, he wasn&#8217;t likely to make a meaningful contribution down the stretch, even if he returned after a minimum stay on the IL. It seems the Giants will nudge him off the roster and give him a headstart on free agency, which he was bound for this winter anyway. By doing so, the club will clear a spot on their 40-man roster. Given Leone&#8217;s injury and salary, he&#8217;s sure to clear release waivers. At that point, he would be free to sign with any team, though he wouldn&#8217;t be able to pitch in the postseason, even if he is healthy. Teams can only brings players that were in their organization prior to September 1 onto their playoff rosters.",

He draws the line at actual clothing, however. “Fashion is someone else’s art,” he says. “I have ideas of objects worn as if they are clothes, but not actual clothing.

        "description": "Elizabeth II got on well with PMs of widely differing politics and backgrounds and played a key role in the background of British politicsFor seven decades, she bore intimate witness to the shifting of power around the globe. Coming to the throne in the distant era of Stalin’s Russia, Elizabeth II reigned through wars cold and hot and through sweeping economic change. She presided over Britain’s retreat from empire and its emergence as a modern networked power, but also its struggle to forge a post-Brexit identity and the beginning of a painful reckoning with colonialism. With her goes a unique institutional memory, a reservoir of insights shared with 15 prime ministers.The relationship between constitutional monarch and elected politician is an odd one – part bowing-and-scraping deference, part curious intimacy. Tony Blair said she was the one person to whom he spoke freely, knowing it wouldn’t leak, and the Queen herself once described her function as “a sort of sponge”, soaking up confidences. But it also, she added, occasionally involved offering governments a different point of view: ‘perhaps they hadn’t seen it from that angle’. She was a mistress of soft power, knowing when to project full regal majesty and when to play kindly grandmother, and a unique diplomatic resource. At times she could make Britain’s case to a foreign head of state better than any elected politician. (Contrast Emmanuel Macron’s spiky relationship with Liz Truss and the genuine warmth of the French president’s tribute to the Queen.) Never party political, she was nonetheless core to the body politic, and her relationships with successive prime ministers help tell a story of what Britain has become. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Stacy Revere/Getty Images\n    \n\n  That’s just about set in stone. Yes, there are still 25 or so games remaining in this, the 2022 Cincinnati Reds season. No, there are not abundant other options for the role I referenced in the title of this post.\nThese two truths I cannot deny. Neither, though, can run counter to what we’ve seen from Reds rookie Nick Lodolo of late, a run of form not just impressive given the dearth of competition from his own roster, but relative to the best pitchers this game has to offer anywhere.\nFriday’s outing against the Milwaukee Brewers was both his most recent and most dominant, a 107 pitch masterpiece in which he rolled through a lineup with playoff aspirations while on his opponent’s home field. He cleared 8.0 IP, struck out 11, issued nary a walk in an homage to the reputation of zone mastery he owned when drafted so highly out of Texas Christian University, and in the process assumed the role of lead fish in this new school of youngsters the Reds have put together mid-rebuild.\nDating back to July 25th, Lodolo has made 9 starts at the big league level. 88 MLB pitchers have logged at least 40.0 IP in that time, with Lodolo’s 54.2 the 5th most among his peers. His 10.54 K/9 in that span ranks 13th, sandwiched between old friend Luis Castillo (10.55) and fellow uberookie George Kirby (10.23) on the leaderboard. His 3.09 FIP actually bests Castillo (3.15) in that time, while the 1.5 fWAR he’s accrued ranks in a tie for 12th with Kevin Gausman, among others.\nIt’s a limited sample, yes. It’s a sample that also doesn’t include starts against the mighty Dodgers, or Aaron Judge, or the devil magic in St. Louis. It does include multiple starts against the Milwaukee Brewers, at least, and a pair of starts against a Philadelphia Phillies club who was admittedly devoid of Bryce Harper at the time. Those are the kinds of mitigating factors that might make what we’ve seen from a young pitcher in a very short time hard to truly trust beyond just this short period, but this young pitcher is by no means one who simply popped up and excelled.\nWith all due respect to Connor Overton, for example, this is not Connor Overton. This is a player twice selected in the 1st round of a Major League Baseball Draft, most recently by the Reds as the first pitcher off the board during the 2019 edition. He’s dominated when given the chance (and the games) at the minor league level, and has been consistently ranked among the best pitching prospects in the game throughout his progression to the Reds. That he’s hit the ground running during this excellent stretch is no phantasm, it’s exactly what Lodolo was expected to be as the purportedly polished, fast-moving pitching prospect when first selected.\nThat his emergence has been right on time might be the only surprise around these parts, given that so seldom has that been the case with anything the Reds have tried to do for years. Injuries, underperformance, and the like have long kicked cans further down the road for many promising youngsters around these parts, and 2022 has been particularly brutal for almost every other potential breakout on what remains of the Reds roster. Tyler Stephenson was hit by it a half-dozen times, as was Jonathan India with his hamstring issues, while Jose Barrero is still bailing water out of his holey canoe. We’ve missed months of Hunter Greene (when he wasn’t struggling), while Graham Ashcraft’s shutdown was nearly as quick as his rapid emergence.\nLodolo, though, has been one of the few who has actually seemed to get better and better by the pitch all year, and now looks poised to be the beacon for the pitching staff for both the long, and near terms. That normally starts with Game 1 of each season, by the way, and he’s inching ever closer to cementing that honor for the 2023 season.",

        "description": "The Salvadorian poet on his journey to the US as a nine-year-old, the exciting literature coming from his homeland – and why he is indebted to Dave EggersJavier Zamora was born in El Salvador in 1990. Both his parents emigrated to the US before he turned five. At the age of just nine, Zamora undertook a treacherous journey by land and sea to join them in California – events recalled in his debut poetry collection, Unaccompanied, and now in his memoir, Solito, described by Dave Eggers as “a riveting tale of perseverance and the lengths humans will go to help each other in times of struggle”. A graduate of the creative writing programme at New York University and a Wallace Stegner fellow at Stanford University, California, Zamora lives with his wife in Tucson, Arizona.What prompted you to write this book?A lot of things, but mainly the weight of the trauma that I carried for so many years. My book of poems begins to touch on these themes, but I was lying to myself that writing poetry about something so traumatic was enough. I began to write this book during Donald Trump’s America, when everybody was talking about immigration. In 2017, when we had the Central American child crisis at the border, it seemed it was the first time Americans realised that there had been child migrants. It angered me that they didn’t realise it had been occurring for decades, and I was part of that. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Russia’s front line troops have fled their positions in Ukraine’s northeastern Kharkiv region as Ukrainian soldiers on Saturday forged ahead with a blitzkrieg to liberate occupied territories. \n\n\n\nOver the past days, Ukrainian troops have made unexpectedly rapid gains in a counteroffensive to the east of the city of Kharkiv, attacking key strategic towns such as Balakliia, Kupiansk and Izyum, which are vital to supply and logistics for Russian forces based in the eastern Donbas region. After several weeks in which the conflict appeared to be heading for a stalemate over winter, the NATO-armed Ukrainians are now seeking to seize the momentum, with a two-pronged attack in Kharkiv to the east and Kherson to the south. \n\n\n\nRussia&#8217;s defense ministry sought to put a brave face on the Ukrainian successes in Kharkiv and suggested the Russian retreat conformed with the goals of President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s notorious &#8220;special military operation.&#8221;\n\n\n\nAccording to Major General Igor Konashenkov, Russian soldiers “located in the areas” of Izyum and Balakliia, liberated by Ukrainian troops on Friday, “have been regrouped and transferred” to the neighbouring Donetsk region in order to “increase efforts in the Donetsk direction.”\n\n\n\n&#8220;In order to prevent damage to Russian troops, powerful fire was inflicted on the enemy using aviation, missiles and artillery,&#8221; he added.\n\n\n\nPutin himself has maintained a conspicuous silence on the military setbacks, even though news of the retreats are starting to filter onto state media. Somewhat surreally, Putin took part in the inauguration of a giant Ferris wheel on Saturday to celebrate the anniversary of the city of Moscow. \n\n\n\nHe made only passing reference to the Ukraine conflict in his speech, noting that the events were attended by &#8220;servicemen fighting for a peaceful life in the Donbas, […] families, of those our comrades-in-arms, who died, gave their lives for Russia.&#8221;Usually loyal Russian military pundits — and even one official — have started querying the competence of those leading the Ukraine war. Daniil Bezsonov, deputy information minister for the Moscow-backed Donetsk People’s Republic, said that the retreat from Izyum and other settlements around Kharkiv was “of course &#8230; the result of mistakes made by the high command.”Moscow was forced to withdraw its forces in order to avoid the encirclement of its large military group based in Izyum and the vicinity.The current counteroffensive is the most rapid change in the front line in Ukraine since Russian troops abandoned their siege of Kyiv and were forced to withdraw from around the capital and northern Ukraine in early March.On Friday afternoon, the first footage apparently recorded by Ukrainian soldiers appeared from the outskirts of Izyum. A short video featured a Ukrainian flag being raised over a check point, next to a street sign with the city’s name.\n\n\n\nA couple of hours prior to that, Ukrainian sources reported on the recapture of the Russia-occupied town of Kupiansk, a major railway junction near the border with Russia.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, Ukraine’s main security service SBU published photos of a group of soldiers from a special military unit in the town.\n\n\n\nOleg Nikolenko, a spokesman for Ukraine&#8217;s foreign ministry, tweeted a photo apparently taken on Kupiansk’s main square with a group of soldiers holding a Ukrainian flag. “Ukrainian troops are advancing in eastern Ukraine, liberating more cities and villages. Their courage, coupled with Western military support, brings astonishing results,” he said. “It’s crucial to keep sending arms to Ukraine.”\n\n\n\nHowever, some Russian military social media channels are reporting that Russian troops have only been withdrawn from the part of Kupiansk perched on the west bank of the Oskil river, which divides the town into two parts.\n\n\n\nIgor Girkin, one of the leaders of the pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine in 2014-2015, said that the Russian army faces “an acute operational crisis in a wide sector of the front, which has already escalated into a major defeat.”\n\n\n\n“Now, all that is left for our side [Russia] is to consider how to prevent further setbacks and the escalation of an operational defeat into a strategic one,” he said. He added that Ukraine had already won “the battle for initiative.&#8221;\n\n\n\nWhile attention is largely focused on Ukraine&#8217;s lightning advances to the east, the armed forces are also clawing back land in the south toward the Black Sea port of Kherson. \n\n\n\nNatalia Humeniuk, spokesperson for the Ukrainian forces in the south, was quoted by local media saying said that troops had advanced between &#8220;two to several dozen kilometers&#8221; on the southern front.",

        "description": "Robert Zemeckis has always been a director fascinated by avant-garde technology. His biggest films of the ’80s and ’90s—Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Back to the Future, Forrest Gump—were all revolutionary in their use of visual effects and CGI. In the 2000s, he dove into the nascent field of motion capture to produce the animated movies The Polar Express, Beowulf, and A Christmas Carol. But as Zemeckis has tried to stay on the cutting edge, he seems to have grown less interested in some of the building blocks of good cinema, such as story originality and stakes, interesting characters, and the use of physical cameras and sets. Which explains how we got Disney’s Pinocchio.No, not the classic 1940 animation, which still has the capacity to delight and terrify young viewers many decades later. Zemeckis’s Pinocchio, now available to stream on Disney+, is a live-action remake, and a largely faithful one. But instead of capturing the old-school charm of the original, the new film looks as dead-eyed as one of Zemeckis’s motion-capture characters, as it recites the familiar fable of the puppet who wanted to be a boy. Zemeckis certainly remains good at running a production that uses expensive-looking CGI. The actual narrative behind those visuals, however, seems to have vanished.Part of the blame lies with Disney. The studio has been pushing a never-ending spate of live-action remakes, with little regard for whether it’s found a particularly new take—zombified, marketable nostalgia, presented with a slick modern sheen. Some of the films, such as Tim Burton’s Dumbo and the Maleficent movies, made an effort to depart from their source material, but most merely trudge through the same beats audiences will remember from childhood, only this time featuring a celebrity such as Will Smith or Emma Watson. Pinocchio very much takes the latter approach. Its major plot points echo the 1940 film’s. Ironically, if Zemeckis had reached even further back, to Carlo Collodi’s original Italian novel from 1883, he may have found a fresher twist. That transfixing moral screed subjects its puppet protagonist to untold horrors before he achieves his goal of becoming a “real boy.”Walt Disney was drawn to Collodi’s book but perhaps wisely realized that its rougher edges needed to be sanded down. So in his film adaptation, when the kindly woodworker Geppetto creates his puppet son, Pinocchio does not kick him in the nose and run away, and when a wise cricket advises Pinocchio on good behavior, he is not immediately murdered with a hammer. Still, the 1940 Pinocchio does have a mischievous streak, along with his famed penchant for untruth. And the consequences he faces strike fear into the heart of the viewer; the sequence in which Pinocchio and his friend Lampwick start turning into donkeys remains one of the most chilling things Disney has ever produced.[Read: The 10 must-watch indie films of the summer]Zemeckis’s version removes every last hint of misbehavior or menace. His Pinocchio looks just like Walt’s (complete with yellow cap) but is simply guileless, a wide-eyed innocent failing to navigate a world of hucksters and thieves. Geppetto, played by a cheerful but checked-out Tom Hanks, sends him off to school and then vanishes from the movie until its conclusion. With him gone, almost everything else onscreen is a CGI creation; much like other “live-action” remakes The Jungle Book and The Lion King, Pinocchio has barely any living action in it at all.Instead, Pinocchio (voiced by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth) encounters a computerized Jiminy Cricket (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a chipper seagull named Sofia (Lorraine Bracco), and the conniving fox Honest John (Keegan-Michael Key), whose main ambition is to swindle the puppet and lead him astray. Pinocchio’s flirtations with a career in the circus, or a life of iniquity with Lampwick, are the result of nothing more than pure naivete. Collodi’s novel moralizes about children’s need to obey their parents and follow society’s rules. Disney’s original film charts the expanding maturity of its protagonist. Zemeckis seems animated by neither of these impulses.After his early-2000s trio of motion-capture-animation films that garnered attention but lacked substance, Zemeckis enjoyed a run of visually experimental projects: Flight, The Walk, Allied, and Welcome to Marwen. None was an unqualified success, and Marwen is a particularly strange fiasco, but all were grown-up dramas with a genuine sense of humanity and sparkling performances. Zemeckis seemed to be returning as one of Hollywood’s innovators. But Pinocchio, combined with his dreadful remake of The Witches in 2020, suggests that the director, having received mixed results for risky efforts, has swerved into lazier territory. There has to be a better use of his, and his audience’s, time than making more lethargic robots.",

        "description": "We need to support Democrat Melissa Cerrato\n\n\n\nTodd Stephens has been representing the 151st Legislative District for a long time. Each time it has been a relatively easy campaign for him.  \n\n\n\nBut this time it will be different.&nbsp;You see, Todd Stephens is a Republican.&nbsp;Republicans are now the party taking away long-standing rights.&nbsp;They are the party allowing government to decide a woman’s private healthcare concerns yet they tell us wearing a mask to help stop COVID is a personal decision.&nbsp;They are the party that calls climate change a hoax as our weather extremes are more apparent every day &#8211; Hurricane Ida anyone?&nbsp;They are the party telling us Christianity is the only true religion.They are the party banning books in schools and libraries that might allow a gay or trans child to feel heard and validated.&nbsp;They are the party that allows race to be an issue and not addressed.They are the party that allows gun sales to come before the safety of our children.They are the party that has supported and not held accountable a twice impeached ex-president who, by the way, is also now under investigation by the FBI.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor all of the above reasons we need to support Democrat Melissa Cerrato for the House of Representatives 151st District.\n\n\n\nWe have too much to lose if we don&#8217;t.  \n\n\n\nDani Richards, Horsham \n\n\n\nVote to Preserve our Democracy\n\n\n\nThe Republican-led state legislature is hard at work – not passing legislation that would benefit Pennsylvanians but proposing amendments to the state Constitution (in SB 106) that would dramatically move power from the people to the legislature and political parties.\n\n\n\nAs described by the League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania – an organization without ties to any political party or candidate – SB 106 shows the breakdown of the legislative process in Harrisburg. It was passed (by Pennsylvania’s Senate and House of Representatives) after considerable backroom dealing: manipulated procedural rules, no public hearings, and little opportunity for the public to participate or even know what was happening.\n\n\n\nOf particular concern, voters would be asked to:\n\n\n\nChange the voting age to 21, in direct violation of the 26th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; and to affirm a 90-day residency requirement to vote in Pennsylvania, when it is actually 30 days.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDeclare that the state constitution does not grant any right relating to abortion.\n\n\n\nAdding insult to injury, these amendments will likely be on the ballot with little notice and no educational materials. In the past, amendments have appeared on off-year primary ballots, with votes cast by fewer than 25% of registered voters.\n\n\n\nBut we can prevent this takeover. We can vote for state legislators who will honor their commitment to the rule of law and their constituents. Vote for Democrats. Vote as if your rights depend on it, because they do!\n\n\n\nMary Bruce Serene, State College\n\n\n\n\nThe @BucksCoBeacon’s Future Is In Your Hands | We need your financial support in order to grow this #BucksCounty #PA01 progressive media project for the long haul.

And state Rep Todd Polinchock signed on to this scheme. When the insurrection didn&#8217;t work, Mastriano set out to run for governor with a laundry list of &#8220;To Dos&#8221; to get Trump back in The White House. As a state Senator, he pushed through legislation that allowed poll watchers to travel to other counties to oversee the voting. He pushed &#8220;open-carry&#8221; gun legislation so that these poll watchers could be as intimidating as possible. And Rep. Todd Polinchock has been in lockstep. He proposed the purging of the voter registration lists, forcing everyone in the state to re-register. He proposed IDs as a prerequisite to vote, even though it is well accepted that those most likely not to have IDs&#8211;the poor and elderly&#8211;would be most likely to be disenfranchised. He promised to curtail if not eliminate altogether mail-in voting. He promised to appoint a Secretary of State, whose office is charged with running elections, who is an election-denier and then at a rally this summer, told the crowd that despite the vote count, he will submit a slate of electors to Congress in 2024, just as he did in 2020, thus ensuring a Trump &#8220;victory.&#8221; Make no mistake about it, in this election Democracy is on the ballot. Doug Mastriano is a clear and present danger to democracy itself as are his enablers like Todd Polinchock.\n\n\n\nBill Davis, New Britain\n\n\n\nDespite Historic Accomplishment, Biden Should Not Run in 2024\n\n\n\nIn only twenty months in office, President Biden has amassed an impressive list of achievements.&nbsp; His legislative accomplishments (gun safety, infrastructure, CHIPS,&nbsp; veterans’ benefits, climate change, pandemic relief, and inflation reduction) have presidential historians comparing his scorecard to FDR and LBJ.&nbsp; He directed vaccine distribution, mended fences with allies, coordinated Ukrainian support, lowered gas prices by releasing petroleum reserves, and restored integrity, compassion, and adulthood to the Oval Office.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSuch a record calls for a second term in office. In my opinion, however, he should not seek reelection in 2024, and should announce that decision immediately. \n\n\n\nThe man will turn age 82 shortly after the 2024 election, and 86 before his second term expires in 2029.&nbsp; Many voters will, fairly or not,&nbsp; consider him too old for the office, which could lead to a reelection loss, notwithstanding his impressive accomplishments.\n\n\n\nThere’s an excellent chance that relinquishing the office would improve his approval rating, by demonstrating that he is putting the good of the nation ahead of personal aggrandizement. He would be remembered as the perfect administration-bridger who restored dignity to the White House.  \n\n\n\nAnnouncing at this time could boost his approval and spur Democratic Congressional gains in the upcoming midterms, leading to additional legislative accomplishments in the remainder of his term, such as passing a voting rights bill, additional gun safety and climate change measures, and measures to codify the reproductive rights lost in Dobbs v. Jackson.\n\n\n\nJoe Biden should go down in history as one of our greatest Presidents ever.\n\n\n\nRichard L. London, State College",

        "description": "A former Trump White House lawyer says he thinks there is a “very high” chance that former President Trump will face an indictment.\n\n\n\nTy Cobb, who represented the White House during former special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Trump's 2016 campaign's contacts with Russia, told CBS News’s “The Takeout” podcast that he believes the former president is likely to face legal consequences for actions related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol and his alleged attempts to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n\n\n“I think the president is in serious legal water,” Cobb said in the podcast, released on Friday. “Not so much because of the [Mar-a-Lago] search, but because of the obstructive activity he took in connection with the Jan. 6 proceeding and the attempts to interfere in the election count in Georgia, Arizona, Pennsylvania and perhaps Michigan.”\n\n\n\nCobb also told CBS News that he suspects the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago last month — during which the agency says it recovered numerous classified documents — is related to the Justice Department’s larger investigation into Trump’s actions related to the Jan. 6 attack.\n\n\n\n\"It is about the bigger picture, the Jan. 6 issues, the fake electors, the whole scam with regard to the 'big lie' and the attempts to … cling to the presidency in a desperate fashion,\" Cobb said.\n\n\n\nThe former White House lawyer noted that the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago seemed “unusually large and broad” and was “very comprehensive in terms of the types of documents that the government could take.”\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department and Trump are currently locked in a legal battle over the documents seized from Mar-a-Lago, with a judge earlier this week granting Trump's request for a special master to review the materials recovered during the search. The Justice Department has since appealed that ruling. \n\n\n\nA Friday filing also revealed disagreements between the two parties over how a special master&nbsp;should function in the case, including over which documents should be reviewed and whether executive privilege claims should be considered.\n\n\n\nThat investigation comes as both the Justice Department and a House select committee are investigating the events surrounding the Jan. 6 attack and a Fulton County, Georgia, grand jury is probing Trump's alleged interference into the 2020 election. The former president is also facing separate investigations involving his businesses and tax returns.",

        "description": "Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Cubs made a roster move ahead of today’s game with the Giants.  The Chicago Cubs today announced that infielder Patrick Wisdom has been activated off the injured list. In a related move, infielder Nick Madrigal went on the 10-day IL with a right groin strain.\nWisdom, 31, was placed on the 10-day IL on August 27 (retroactive to the day before) with a sprained left ring finger. This season, Wisdom has been hitting .217/.311/.438 with 22 home runs and 58 RBI. \nMadrigal’s injury comes at an especially poor time, as Madrigal has finally been living up the the hopes that the Cubs had for him at the beginning of the season. After struggling in April, Madrigal missed most of May with a lower back strain and then missed most of June and all of July with a left groin strain. However, the 25-year-old Madrigal hit .300/.378/.338 for the month of August. Overall, Madrigal is hitting .249/.305/.282 with no home runs in seven RBI.",

        "description": "Toronto film festival: The Oscar winner leads a strong ensemble of Black women in a robustly entertaining drama about 19th century female warriorsFor many of us, in and out of film festivals, there can be a desperate crave for the new, especially within the realm of the mainstream. The overwhelming glut of films that offer yet more of the same continue to dominate the marketplace and so when something provides a fresh concept, perspective or setting within big studio framework, it can feel like a thrilling left-turn on a road that too often feels boringly straightforward.The slow crawl of diversity that’s allowed people other than the straight white male majority to lead and usher in big budget stories that have either never been told or have been told through the same standard lens has allowed us to revel in the newness it’s frequently provided. Recently, Dan Trachtenberg’s nifty Predator prequel Prey gave us an almost all-Indigenous American cast and an Indigenous female lead, the first for a franchise film of that scale and one of the many reasons it felt like such a triumph. And here at the Toronto film festival, on the same night that Billy Eichner premiered his gay romantic comedy Bros (the first time a studio has released a film with an all-queer cast), Viola Davis unleashes her “magnum opus”, period epic The Woman King, a rare $50m-budgeted action movie led by Black women.

        "description": "You might be a team of destiny when you promote a random dude from the minors then casually toss him in to save the 9th inning of the biggest game of the year and he does this. Hello, friends,Before I get to the baseball, I wanted to thank everyone again for your patience as I continue to heal from the aftermath of my COVID-19 infection. It&#8217;s now been six weeks since I first tested positive, and two weeks since I started heart medication for COVID-induced POTS. I&#8217;m feeling much better than I was two weeks ago, and a bit better than last week. I drove my car for the first time on Sunday and was able to do things I&#8217;ve always taken for granted, like getting my car washed and going to the post office without feeling like I would pass out or vomit. I felt almost normal on Monday. But then yesterday my headache came back&#8212;and with it the brain fog&#8212;so I wasn&#8217;t able to do much except hydrate and rest. I&#8217;ve been staying at my mom&#8217;s house and I&#8217;ve been pretty down about *waves hands* everything. But one silver lining is getting to spend more consecutive time with my family than I have in maybe decades. If I hadn&#8217;t gotten so sick from COVID, I might not be going to my three-year-old niece&#8217;s twice-weekly dance classes, which have brought me a lightness and joy I can&#8217;t put into words. I&#8217;m going to resume writing about baseball, but I&#8217;ll also do newsletters about my physical and mental health as this saga continues to unfold. I have heard from so many people who are also struggling post-COVID that it&#8217;s honestly staggering. I know how lucky I was to get properly diagnosed and treated as quickly as I was. I know that women (and particularly women of color) are often dismissed by doctors when they seek help for disorders with weird symptoms like mine. Because they are so frustrated and emotional about what is happening to their bodies, these women are often told it&#8217;s all in their heads, dismissed as cranks and sent to shrinks to sort it out. In lieu of burning everything to the ground just thinking about this, I would just like to point out that we are in year three of a devastating global pandemic that has killed a million Americans and infected an estimated 94 million Americans (though both numbers seem low). Pandemics as devastating as COVID-19 almost always cause a large segment of the surviving population to experience lingering, long-term symptoms. Zeynep Tufekci, a long COVID researcher, wrote this in a recent New York Times op-ed:When the influenza pandemic of 1918-19 ended, misery continued.Many who survived became enervated and depressed. They developed tremors and nervous complications. Similar waves of illness had followed the 1889 pandemic, with one report noting thousands &#8220;in debt and unable to work&#8221; and another describing people left &#8220;pale, listless and full of fears.&#8221;The scientists Oliver Sacks and Joel Vilensky warned in 2005 that a future pandemic could bring waves of illness in its aftermath, noting &#8220;a recurring association, since the time of Hippocrates, between influenza epidemics and encephalitis-like diseases&#8221; in their wakes.It&#8217;s clear that so many people are suffering with the lingering effects of this heinous disease. If you fall into that category, you can always respond to me here via email or in my Twitter DMs and I will do my best to reply as soon as I can. Just know you are not alone. And for those of you fortunate enough to be in good health, consider wearing a mask and/or taking other precautions to protect yourself when you go to large events like baseball games. I know we&#8217;re all sick of masks, but I&#8217;d wear a mask forever if it meant never again getting as sick as I was these last six weeks. The Long Game is a reader supported newsletter. Both free and paid versions are available. The best way to support me and my work as I recover from this illness is by taking out a paid subscription now: Subscribe nowNow for some housekeeping: Today at 4 PM PT/ 7 PM ET I will be offering a live community discussion chat during the Dodgers vs. Mets game for all paid subscribers. Today&#8217;s a great day to take the plunge and become a paying subscriber if you love the Dodgers or Mets! We will watch the best team in baseball try to solve Jacob deGrom (or at least drive up his pitch count so someone else is forced to pitch the 7th and 8th) in what will surely be a playoff matchup preview. So, subscribe and join us today! We have fun! :)We will also have another chat this Sunday night at 4 PM PT/7 PM ET that will be Dodgers vs. Padres. I know, I know. The Dodgers are getting a lot of love from national TV and in these parts, obviously&#8230; but look at them! They&#8217;re 90-38! Speaking of the team that is 90-38, I thought I had seen it all with this year&#8217;s Dodger squad until Tuesday night, when I witnessed two men who were not even on the roster 24 hours ago record the win (Heath Hembree) and the save (Jake Reed). Both were promoted from Triple-A hours before the game to help replenish the Dodgers&#8217; ailing pitching staff, which is still chugging right along despite losing ace Walker Buehler for the season, Hall of Famer Clayton Kershaw for months and top reliever Blake Treinen for basically the season. The latest bad news? Over the weekend the Dodgers placed NL ERA leader Tony Gonsolin on the IL with a right forearm strain. And while the team insists Gonsolin will miss only &#8220;a few starts,&#8221; that&#8217;s the same injury that leads to Tommy John surgery, which Dustin May just returned from after missing over a year, and which Walker Buehler just underwent for the second time.On the surface, losing Gonsolin at this point in the season&#8212;when it&#8217;s too late to trade for help&#8212;would appear to be an insurmountable issue in the Dodgers&#8217; quest to win a championship. But with the way this offense is producing? I&#8217;m not sure it matters.The Dodgers lead all of MLB in batting average, on-base percentage and slugging. Their team OPS (.790) is 29 points higher than the second-best offense (Atlanta, .761). It&#8217;s hard to describe how dominant the Dodgers have been this season to those who don&#8217;t watch them every day, but I&#8217;ll try. They have outscored opponents by 287 runs. That means they have been, on average, 2.24 runs per game better than their opponent.The 1998 Yankees are considered to be one of the best, if not the best team of the past 30 years. They finished the season with a 114-48 record, and a run differential of +309. That means that the Yankees were, on average, 1.90 runs per game better than their opponent every night. The 2022 Dodgers have been 2.24 runs per game better.There are 34 games left in the regular season. For the Dodgers to break their all-time franchise win record of 106 (set in 2019 and tied in 2021), they will need to go 17-17. The Dodgers are currently on pace to win 114 games. The all-time MLB record for wins by a team in a season is 116, which was set by the Seattle Mariners in 2001. To break that mark, the Dodgers will need to go 27-7. A run like that is not out of the question, except that Andrew Friedman and Dave Roberts don&#8217;t seem to care about it very much. If they did, they would not have employed Hembree and Reed in the highest leverage innings of their biggest game of the year so far on Tuesday night. I&#8217;m calling Tuesday night the biggest game of the year, because the Mets have the best starting pitching this white-hot Dodger offense has faced all season and I believe they are the only National League team that can beat L.A. in a seven-game series in October.But Tuesday night&#8217;s game was only the biggest game of the year for 24 hours, because Wednesday night they will go up against a dude who can win an entire playoff series by himself in Jacob deGrom. Sure, the Mets&#8217; lineup isn&#8217;t as deep as the Dodgers&#8217;. Francisco Lindor is nasty and Pete Alonso is a dinger machine, but New York&#8217;s top three hitters do not stack up to the Dodgers&#8217; big three of Mookie Betts, Trea Turner and Freddie Freeman. That Max Muncy has returned to form, and Gavin Lux and Will Smith are both playing like All-Stars makes the Dodger lineup an absolute horror show for any pitcher&#8212;except maybe deGrom.It&#8217;s no secret that deGrom is the best pitcher in baseball when he&#8217;s healthy. But what makes his matchup with the Dodgers so exciting is that he dominates hitters the same way the Dodgers offense has obliterated the field. That is to say that If Jacob deGrom were a baseball team, he&#8217;d be on pace for 114 wins every season. In a seven-game series in the NLCS against the Dodgers, deGrom would pitch twice. And in what should terrify Dodger fans, Max Scherzer would also get to pitch twice. The Mets wouldn&#8217;t even need another pitcher to record a single win to knock the Dodgers out. Of course, the Dodgers would have to advance past the first round to even get to that point, which the 2001 Mariners couldn&#8217;t do, and the franchise-win-record-setting 2019 Dodgers couldn&#8217;t do, either. Still, that 2019 Dodger team had a horrendous first-round matchup in the Washington Nationals, who got to pitch Scherzer once and Stephen Strasburg twice (the Dodgers lost all those games).If the Mets and Dodgers finish with the top two records in the National League (which looks likely, though the Braves trail the Mets by just three games), then New York and Los Angeles would not meet until the seven-game NLCS, disallowing the possibility that the Dodgers would have to face deGrom and Scherzer three (or even four!) times in a five-game series, which I think would give the Mets a slight edge. As someone who has lived in both New York and Los Angeles, I know I&#8217;m rooting for this NLCS to happen. Even if the Mets might be the Dodgers&#8217; kryptonite.",

(Photo by David McNew/Getty Images)Hi friends-I wasn&#8217;t planning on turning this newsletter into a weekly update of how I&#8217;m doing medically, but that&#8217;s where we are for the time being. I thought I&#8217;d feel well enough to write about the Yankees and Dodgers and Mets and Cardinals and Orioles and Blue Jays and Padres and Braves and more this week, but amid doctor&#8217;s appointments and fighting with my insurance company, caring for my dog, taking slow walks, brushing my teeth, and showering, the only energy I had left was for napping. I never used to be much of a napper. Now? I sleep from about 9pm to 7 am, then again from 11 am to 3 pm. And I only get up at 3 because Georgie (my dog) has decided he will left me nap for three hours&#8212;but he draws the line at four.Here&#8217;s where things stand right now: my cardiologist gave me a seven day sample of a heart medication called Corlanor a week ago to see how I liked it. And oh, I liked it. While I am still exhausted, I feel steady on my feet. The light-headedness and the brain fog and the nausea are gone. On short walks my heart rate no longer spikes to the point where I feel like I might throw up. Corlanor was originally developed to treat heart failure (which I do not have). But after so many people started developing POTS (which I do have) post-Covid, somebody had the bright idea to throw Corlanor at it to see if it helped people with POTS get out of bed. It did.So, all good, right? I got a diagnosis quickly.The vomiting stopped.The spinning stoppedI could remember enough words to do a Wordle puzzle without throwing my phone across the yard in frustration.I&#8217;m no longer at risk for blacking out from my blood pressure dropping like a semi truck off Niagara falls when I stand up, which means I have been able to be alone and I can now drive a car at short distances. I went to the library and checked out two books. All good, right? Well, here&#8217;s the problem. I went to fill my Corlanor script at CVS on Wednesday and they told me my insurance company doesn&#8217;t cover it. The out-of-pocket cost for a month&#8217;s worth of the drug? $600. I took a deep breath.A twitter user told me these manufacturer&#8217;s really want you to take their drugs, so they offer what&#8217;s called a co-pay card&#8212;even for those who don&#8217;t show dire financial need (read: are homeless). You just have to be paying for a private insurance PPO which I do (to the tune of $700 per month). I applied for the Corlanor co-pay card and was approved. I printed it out and went back to CVS. The lady behind the counter looked at me like I had four heads.&#8220;You need to go through your insurance first for this to work,&#8221; she said.&#8220;OK but we just tried to run it through my insurance and they said they don&#8217;t cover it,&#8221; I said, my face contorting into a sweaty question mark.&#8220;Have your doctor call your insurance company and pre-authorize it and then we can see if they approve it or deny it and we can go from there.\"Pre-authorize? Isn&#8217;t my doctor prescribing me a heart failure medication in writing a pretty formal authorization that I might need it? I guess not!This is a reader-supported independent newsletter. Both free and paid versions are available. The best way to support me and my work (and my medical bills) is by taking out a paid subscription now. But, hey, even free subscriptions help! And we do have a lot of fun here. In addition to our Monday night creativity chats and our Sunday night baseball chats, I&#8217;m also planning to add a monthly book club soon for paid subscribers!Subscribe nowSo after the CVS debacle, I went back to my cardiologist for an echocardiogram on Wednesday, and I told the lady in the office who deals with medication about my Corlanor plight. I asked her if she had any more free samples. She looked in the cabinets and said she did not, with less compassion in her voice than I regularly hear from Starbucks baristas when they tell me they&#8217;re out of bacon and gouda breakfast sandwiches. Something about the easy breezy way this heart medication lady told me that she was out of the drug that was keeping me functional in society, and that I was basically fucked, caused me to burst into tears.I told her what the CVS pharmacist told me, that I needed my doctor to contact my insurance company and pre-authorize the drug. &#8220;Oh, of course,&#8221; she said. &#8220;That will be a $75, and they&#8217;ll ring you up at the front.&#8221; Uh, what? It sounded crazy. But I was already in tears and had no energy to ask why on earth any good doctor would further gouge a sick person.My cardiologist wasn&#8217;t in, so the woman who handles the medication told me she would have to wait to ask him if I could go without the meds for a few days or if he would switch me to another (cheaper) med. I must have been crying pretty hard because my mom (who was with me, because she has been driving me everywhere, because I now have a heart condition from Covid-19 that makes me too exhausted to drive and also vulnerable to passing out and hitting my head) decided to go back there and have a word with the medicine lady.  My mom was nice to the woman, but didn&#8217;t get any further than I did, except that she retained the information listed in the first sentence of this paragraph when I could not because I was crying too hard into my n-95 mask.A word about crying here. It turns out when you are as sick as you&#8217;ve ever been in your life, and you are worried you might not ever be well again, and then you think you are beginning to get your life back, anybody who delivers you a setback&#8212;no matter how small&#8212;and acts blas&#233; about it, becomes your mortal enemy. My mortal enemy&#8212;who is actually totally nice, by the way, I think&#8212; called me later in the afternoon and told me that the doctor does not want me to skip a pill, or switch to another medication. She suggested I go back to CVS and see if I can pay for a week&#8217;s worth of pills out of pocket instead of the full month while my doctor and the insurance company fight this out.The lady at CVS (an actual angel) saw how much I was paying for a week&#8217;s worth of pills and looked like she was about to faint. So she pulled up some app called Good RX to comparison shop seven day&#8217;s worth of my drug at every local pharmacy. &#8220;Well it&#8217;s $2.19 cheaper at Costco but that&#8217;s 4 miles away so probably not worth the gas,&#8221; she said. An angel. And I wasn&#8217;t making my mom drive me to Costco anyway because we were both too tired. So I agreed to pay $150 for 14 pills, which will (hopefully!) arrive on a truck at 11 am today because CVS didn&#8217;t have them in stock. I&#8217;m supposed to take them twice a day and I haven&#8217;t had any in 24 hours so I&#8217;m a bit loopy as I type this but it needed to be written.am not a special snowflake. I recognize my privilege. I am able to afford to pay $700 a month for a health care plan, even if it doesn&#8217;t cover what the drug I need to function right now. I have a mom who is retired and willing to take care of me and drive me to a sad carnival of medical appointments all over Los Angeles where no doctor validates parking. I don&#8217;t have a case of POTS so bad that I&#8217;m bedridden. I haven&#8217;t been disabled by this scourge for years and years and years. I didn&#8217;t die of Covid or wind up on a ventilator. Unlike millions of Americans, I don&#8217;t have to choose between medicine and food. My mental health is hanging by a thread, but I&#8217;ve been in therapy so long that I at least have basic tools to survive the day to day (e.g. I know what a panic attack is and how to breathe through it).I&#8217;m writing this post because it&#8217;s absolutely  INSANE that a sick person in the richest country in the world has to jump through all these hoops to get life altering (and in millions of cases) life-saving medications because our health care system is so broken. We are the only first-world country that does this to its citizens. A twitter user from LA who helped me get diagnosed with POTS because his wife developed it post&#8212;Covid actually moved to Australia (she&#8217;s Australian) because their medical bills in the states would have bankrupt them here. She&#8217;s on Corlanor. It costs $39 a month there. My good friend from Belgium figured that if she got the medication there (60 euros) and used miles to fly round trip to LA to give it to me, I would save $440. I may wind up having to get my drug from Canada, where it is also $60 a month.This price gouging is especially brutal given the recent windfall my insurance company, Anthem, enjoyed. It reported $1 billion in profits in the fourth quarter of 2021, largely due to so many people signing up for coverage during the pandemic. It would stand to reason that millions of people now need extra medical care they did not require before due to the fact that we are in year three of a global pandemic. Anyhem could certainly afford to give me heart medication for a condition caused by that pandemic for free. I pay them $8,400 a year for insurance so that I can access medicine and care when I need it. Well, I need it.  It&#8217;s the least they can do.In 2021, Anthem CEO Gail K. Boudreaux was paid $19,348,241. I&#8217;m guessing she does not have issues obtaining medication she needs, when she needs it. I bet she can get Corlanor for free, because rich people always get free stuff.  The average Anthem employee, however, might be out of luck if they need this drug. Anthem&#8217;s median employee salary is just $51,000 a year, which doesn&#8217;t buy a lot of gasoline to drive around town comparison shopping a $600 bottle of heart medication her company won&#8217;t cover.People who love me are telling me not to take on this fight right now while I&#8217;m still so sick, and that instead I should just focus on getting better. That&#8217;s a fair point. But I have to put my anger somewhere and I owed you guys an update anyway. Plus if I&#8217;m not going to use the platform I have to bring attention to how broken our health care system is, then what&#8217;s the point of having any platform at all? If you are interested in reading about the government&#8217;s massive failure in researching the effects of long covid and what a catastrophic burden it will put on all our systems, Zeynep Tufecki has an excellent substack post here. And she also wrote a wonderful NYT Opinion post yesterday here: But solving this puzzle could be revolutionary, unlocking the door to understanding many conditions that cause much human suffering.The 1971 National Cancer Act changed the way scientists deal with disease, pouring money into prevention, detection and research.Scientists battling debilitating, chronic conditions like long Covid and other postviral conditions deserve this sort of commitment in leadership, funding and recruitment to get the best minds in the fight.We need a National Institute for Postviral Conditions, similar to the National Cancer Institute, to oversee and integrate research. Neither academia &#8212; prone to silos and drawn to work that leads to notable publications, which can leave important questions underexplored &#8212; nor the private sector &#8212; focused on profits &#8212; is up to the task alone.With such an initiative, we could honestly tell so many looking for answers that help is on the way.I really hope we do pour billions of dollars into studying our collective health post-Covid. But as with everything else related to this virus, something tells me that the people who never even bothered to acknowledge that Covid-19 was anything more than the flu are driving public policy decisions now, too bored with the disease to keep talking about it, and too callous to give a shit about the millions who died and the millions more who are and will become disabled because of it.I hope I&#8217;m wrong.Thank you for reading The Long Game.

        "description": "The Cedars Sinai ER valet where I sat on a bench for 6 hours in the heat, twice, while waiting to be treated for complications caused by Covid-19. ((Photo by APU GOMES/AFP via Getty Images)Hi friends-At some point I might write a longer post about the medical trauma I&#8217;ve endured over the past month, but I&#8217;m not ready to do that today. However, I couldn&#8217;t just return to my happy little newsletter without offering at least the Cliff&#8217;s Notes version of why I&#8217;ve been mostly AWOL since I first tested positive for Covid-19 on July 22. Basically, despite being double vaccinated, boosted, and taking Paxlovid three days into infection, my cardiologist (I have a cardiologist now because of this mess!) says I appear to have won the Covid lottery. After ten days of feeling the horrible flu like symptoms everyone else with Covid gets, things started to improve, then got rapidly worse. I couldn&#8217;t stand up without vomiting. The world was spinning off its axis. I couldn&#8217;t look at computer screens, my phone, or a television without feeling like I was going to pass out. Sometimes my vision would go black for no reason at all. Walking unassisted was not possible. Being alone was not possible.In the span of four days I went to urgent care, the ER, my ENT, and the ER again (because I vomited uncontrollably in my ENT&#8217;s office and he said I looked 110 years old and needed to be hospitalized immediately). I&#8217;ve been incredibly blessed with excellent health my whole life, and I&#8217;ve always been aware of how fortunate that makes me. I&#8217;ve lived five minutes from the Cedars ER for 11 years and I&#8217;ve never seen the inside of it as a patient. Two different times last weekend I thought I was going to die, and sobbed while I held nurses hands. (I was never close to dying. They ruled out a stroke, a blood clot, and an aneurysm. My lungs showed no evidence of disease. My blood tests indicated I might live to be 100). Yet everything was spinning and I couldn&#8217;t stop vomiting. They thought it was vertigo (no). They put me on an antibiotic for a sinus infection (no). To stop the vomiting the second time I was in the ER, they gave me IV benadryl (good!) and IV reglan (so horrible I screamed and almost ripped the IV out and had to be held down).Then they sent me home, and told me to hydrate, having found nothing wrong.This is a reader supported newsletter. Both free and paid versions exist. The best way to support me and my work (and my medical bills) is by taking out a paid subscription now:Subscribe nowI went to my primary care physician. He noticed that when I went from sitting to standing my blood pressure plummeted. He referred me to a cardiologist.Finally, yesterday I received a diagnosis from that cardiologist of POTS like syndrome. Basically, Covid wreaked havoc on my autonomic nervous system&#8212;the part of all our bodies that is responsible for taste and smell. It&#8217;s also in charge of regulating heart rate. My little internal pacemaker apparently doesn&#8217;t work right now. When I stood up in the cardiologist&#8217;s office yesterday, my heart rate jumped from 80 (already high for me) to 128 (uh..what?). That&#8217;s just standing, not moving. I got dizzy again and held on to his hand.So now, because of Covid-19, I&#8217;m on heart medication. It&#8217;s pretty terrifying. But here&#8217;s the good news: my doctor says this situation will &#8220;most definitely&#8221; resolve itself, since I did not have POTS pre-Covid. He seemed very confident, like, Michael Jordan Game 6 confident. I suffer from anxiety, so I am not as confident. Still, I have been feeling a little better and stronger each day. I started the medication yesterday. I go back in a week. Then I go back a few weeks after that. Then we see if the drug is working for me and I stay on it, or we up the dose. I have a free sample of it now (yay!) but I&#8217;ve been told it&#8217;s quite expensive to fill (ugh) so that&#8217;s a potential whole other nightmare. It&#8217;s called Corlanor and it&#8217;s primarily used for heart failure (which I most definitely do not have). But studies have shown it can provide tremendous relief for people with POTS . So I am holding on to that, and thanking my lucky stars because even though I am scared this could have been so much worse. I&#8217;m also supposed to drink 2 liters of salt water a day. (no joke).Cedars Sinai billed my insurance company $22,050.83 for my first ER visit (LMAO). I am responsible for $1,782.10 (LMAO), and I&#8217;ve now apparently hit my yearly &#8220;in-network&#8221; deductible. But I know my insurance company will figure out a way to charge me just as much for my second ER visit, and probably my urgent care visit, and also the doctor visit, the physical therapy visit, and the cardiology visit this all took to get properly diagnosed. I should have prefaced all this by saying that even though I&#8217;m in excellent health, I pay through the nose for a top tier health care plan so that I don&#8217;t go bankrupt if something like this happens to me. The American health care system is broken. We are the only first-world country that punishes sick and injured people with insurmountable debt because they have the misfortune of being sick and injured.  My Medicare for All zealotry was already a 15/10 but it&#8217;s been pushed to a 5000/10 after this incident. The disability community has been leading the way in fighting our elected officials for change, often sacrificing their own bodies to demand we evolve past our barbaric health care system and into a sane one where non-rich people can actually access the physical and mental health care they need to exist in the world. The least us able bodied people can do is join their righteous fight, while continuing to let them lead the way.I&#8217;m sure some anti-vaxx wing nuts are going to seize on this post as evidence that the Covid vaccines don&#8217;t work. I have two things to say to that: 1. Unless you are an infectious disease expert, sit the fuck down. No one cares about your opinion.  And 2. It&#8217;s possible that were I not vaccinated I would be dead or on a ventilator. I was sick for a month. But now I am able to sit upright and write this post. I am able to walk my dog. I am fortunate enough that I will be okay.I had no adverse reactions to the vaccine shots, and I will happily take the next booster when it comes out. I stayed safe from Covid for 2.5 years. I was exposed to the virus at the 2022 All-Star game at Dodger Stadium. I was not wearing a mask because the event was outside. I will wear now wear a mask to all group settings&#8212;indoor our outdoor&#8212;until this is over. I hope you will continue to live full lives while also minimizing your risk of catching this disease as much as possible. If this can happen to me, it can happen to anyone.I got sicker than I've ever been in my life or ever hope to be again. And now I&#8217;m recovering, I hope. Here is an excellent recent study from the Washington State Department of Health showing that people of all age groups are orders of magnitude more likely to catch the virus, become hospitalized, or die from it, if they are not vaccinated. Please get vaccinated.I will also note that the people who say the vaccines don&#8217;t work are the same people who say Covid is just &#8220;the flu&#8221; and we should not have shut down society to stop people from getting sick. (Even though we never fully committed to doing that). So if you&#8217;re going to use my case as a way to dunk on the scientific community, you are going to have to pick a lane. If you say &#8220;the vaccines don&#8217;t work because you got really sick!&#8221; you are acknowledging that this virus makes people really sick, and that perhaps we should be taking Herculean measures to stop its spread.Anyway, if you are a paid subscriber to this newsletter, please accept my deepest gratitude.

        "description": "We&#8217;ll miss you forever, Vin (Photo by Brian Rothmuller/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images)Vin Scully died today at age 94.Vin Scully was the greatest broadcaster in the history of sports. And for Dodger fans, for 67 seasons, he was ours. He was great at what he did, but everyone knows that. Everyone has heard the most famous call in baseball history, when a gimpy Kirk Gibson hobbled up to pinch-hit in the ninth inning of Game 1 of the 1988 World Series. &#8220;And look who&#8217;s coming up!&#8221; Scully said, as the sold-out Dodger Stadium crowd roared. &#8220;All year long they looked to him to light the fire, and all year long he answered the demands, until he was physically unable to start tonight. With TWO bad legs. A bad left hamstring, and the swollen right knee. And with two out, you talk about the roll of the dice, this is it!&#8221;Gibson, of course, would go on to hit a miracle home run off the mighty A&#8217;s closer Dennis Eckersley, to propel the underdog Dodgers to a Game 1 win, and, ultimately, a World Series championship over an Oakland team they had no business beating.&#8220;High fly ball into right field! She is GONE!!!&#8221; Scully cried as Gibson whacked the ball over the fence and into the bleachers. And then in pure Scully fashion, he let the moment breathe without saying a word as Gibson rounded the bases, just so the viewer could take in the sounds of the euphoric home crowd uninterrupted by any mere mortal&#8217;s narration. &#8220;In a year that has been so improbable,&#8221; Scully continued after Gibson touched home plate and began celebrating with teammates, &#8220;the impossible has happened!&#8221;And truly, as I sit here trying to find the words to say about Scully, it feels impossible he is no longer here. He is the reason I fell in love with baseball. He is the reason I stayed connected to Los Angeles when I moved to New York after college and fell in love with it and thought I would never return home. He is the reason millions of us knew that loving the Dodgers meant placing your heart in the hands of &#8220;Dem Bums&#8221; but going ahead and doing it anyway.The first time I ever met Vin, I heard him singing before I even saw him. He loved to sing his favorite songs, show tunes mostly, from favorites like Music Man. It will come as no surprise to those who listened to him on the radio every night that he had a wonderful singing voice. It took me years to muster saying more than just &#8220;hello&#8221; to him in the hallways. The first time he called me by my name I must have called 10 people and told them about it.By the time I came around, in 2007 or so, his beloved wife, Sandi, was always with him at the stadium. We were frequently two of the only women in the press box, and Vin knew that. A true gentleman, he would always hold the door open to the press box dining room for any woman he saw. He was all grace and class, the exact same person in real life as he was on the air. He was a kind and genteel human in an era that seems way too short on those kinds of people.This is a reader supported newsletter. Both free and paid versions are available. The best way to support me and my work is by taking out a paid subscription now:Subscribe nowHe would eat dinner before every night game in a small room with the other broadcasters, while us writers sat in the main dining room. Often, when he was done eating, he would come and sit with us and ask how we were doing, what we thought about so-and-so player, and what was happening around the league. Mostly we wanted to be quiet and let him talk. He was the best storyteller, but you already knew that. He grew up a Giants fan and idolized Mel Ott as a child. He talked about what it was like watching Ott roam the enormous Polo Grounds in New York, and made sure we all knew about Ott&#8217;s large right leg kick in the batter&#8217;s box. He would imitate Ott&#8217;s swing, but later said in a broadcast that &#8220;something happened when I swung the bat, that did not do what Mel Ott did.\"&nbsp;Since Scully pretty much saw everyone who ever played the game, I once asked him who he thought was the best. &#8220;Willie Mays,&#8221; he said without hesitation. &#8220;It has to be Willie Mays.&#8221; My favorite story Scully told was about the time Jackie Robinson challenged him to a race on ice skates. Robinson had never ice skated before, and possibly never even seen snow, but that was beside the point. To Scully&#8217;s lifelong amusement, Robinson simply treated the skates like track spikes and sprinted down the ice.But anyone can tell a story about hanging out with an extremely famous person and sound cool. What made Scully the greatest broadcaster to ever do it was the way he brought the same sweetness, wit and enthusiasm to spinning yarns about players whose big-league careers might only last one night. &#8220;Paco Rodriguez&#8217;s real name is Steven,&#8221; he once said of a Dodger rookie reliever. &#8220;But only his mother calls him that.&#8221;His humility was another key to his greatness. &#8220;My career is talking about the accomplishments of others,&#8221; he said in a press conference at Dodger Stadium near the end of his career. &#8220;I haven&#8217;t accomplished anything. Some days are okay. Some days I get in the car and say, &#8216;You stink.&#8217;&#8221;There were two things that bothered him about baseball. The first thing was that first and third base coaches did nor wear earflaps on their helmets. The second was that Gil Hodges was not in the Baseball Hall of Fame. Base coaches may still not wear earflaps, but Hodges was finally enshrined in Cooperstown nine days ago. I&#8217;ll forever be grateful that Scully was still alive to see it.The loss of Vin Scully is devastating to the city of Los Angeles, and to the world. He was as embedded in the fabric of this city as any person who ever set foot in it, and his voice will echo through Chavez Ravine forever.Thank you, Vin. Thank you.If you enjoyed this post, please share with your friends:Share",

        "description": "Look who&#8217;s one! (Photo by Lambert/Getty Images)Hello dear ones-First off, thank you for all your well wishes since I contracted Covid-19 last week. I have no underlying health issues and had no reason to think I would get this sick&#8212;but this virus does not discriminate. It&#8217;s only today, nine days after testing positive, that I&#8217;m able to sit upright and look at a computer screen without wanting to vomit. (Gross!). I am confident I&#8217;m on the mend now, even if the recovery is progressing much slower than I would like. I have never been this sick, but I am so grateful I didn&#8217;t wind up hospitalized or worse. Thank you again to everyone who has reached out. I have read all your notes of encouragement even if I haven&#8217;t been able to respond. &lt;3We will be back up and running with our Sunday Night Baseball live discussion thread for paid subscribers tomorrow at 4 PM PT/ 7 PM ET for Cubs vs. Giants, two teams playing absolutely thrilling baseball right now. Catch the fever! (But not literally. Please do not catch what I have). If you&#8217;d like to become a paid subscriber to come hang out with us, you can sign up here:Subscribe nowI&#8217;m writing to you guys today to thank you for your support of The Long Game. One year ago this week I left my traditional media job to launch this site. It was terrifying, to be honest, but it was also a change I needed to make. And I&#8217;m so glad I did.Being my own boss allows me to continue to be 100 percent authentically me. I don&#8217;t have to write things I don&#8217;t want to write in service of a corporate agenda set by someone who doesn&#8217;t understand how human beings work. I don&#8217;t have to worry I may tweet something like &#8220;women deserve rights&#8221; and get put in some kind of Twitter penalty box by HR (it&#8217;s happened!). I can take the time to process complex stories and write with nuance instead of having to immediately file a hot take to fill a cadence quota. In short, I can do the kind of writing and build the kind of troll-free, positive sports community I&#8217;ve always wanted to, but never could before.You guys have made that possible.I know that the Substack model can be confusing because paying for subscriptions to read specific writers (instead of subscribing to traditional newspapers or magazines) is a relatively new concept. I&#8217;ve tried to keep as many of my articles free as I possibly can because I&#8217;m sensitive to how bills can add up. I&#8217;m a writer. I know what it&#8217;s like to live paycheck to paycheck. If you have taken the time to sign up for this site&#8212;even the free version&#8212;you are helping me live my dream. I can&#8217;t ever thank you enough. To my paid subscribers: You are quite literally keeping the lights on as well as paying for the roof over my head. You took the leap along with me and kept on reading as I figured out what worked. You are the reason why there will be a Year 2 of The Long Game. I hope I have created enough value for you to continue to stick with me. I&#8217;ve tried a lot of different things this year&#8212;from writing about baseball every day in October to opening up about my own mental health struggles. I&#8217;ve led creativity Zoom workshops and baseball discussion threads and taken you on stadium food tours (these will resume once my Covid clears up!). I know you have a lot of choices when it comes to how you spend your hard-earned money, and I&#8217;m grateful and humbled that so many of you have chosen to support me with it. And I hope you have enjoyed the community we&#8217;re building. It&#8217;s only going to get better and stronger from here.To my free subscribers: A lot of you are new this week, so, welcome! Feel free to test-drive this newsletter for a while before you decide to buy. You will receive at least one free post per week. In a perfect world, I would keep all my work free forever and never ask for you to pay to read me. But the reality is I can&#8217;t. The cost of becoming a paid subscriber is equivalent to about one grande Starbucks latte a month&#8212;but it makes a world of difference to me. You are literally creating a job in a landscape where journalism jobs are vanishing at a terrifying rate. If you simply cannot afford a subscription (again, been there!) you can also help me out by telling your friends about this site. Being a woman who writes about sports can be terribly isolating and scary, even though I&#8217;ve been doing it for 15 years. With each new person who signs up to read The Long Game, I feel less and less alone.This coming year I will be experimenting with more Zooms, podcasts and player interviews. I will continue to write about the Dodgers, but I&#8217;m also going to cover all the MLB playoff teams down the stretch. I&#8217;ll continue to write about mental health, and I may even summon the courage to start writing about my soccer fandom (now progressing from infancy to toddlerhood!). And there will be more content about George, my totally lovable but completely insane yearling rescue pup (who is currently away at finishing school learning how to, uh, become the best version of his crazy self).If you&#8217;re not a paying subscriber and you would like to sign up for additional posts and get access to our live discussion threads and Zooms, here&#8217;s how:Subscribe nowIf you&#8217;re already a paying subscriber, please know that you have my eternal gratitude. I would give a firm hug to everyone who decides to renew this week if I weren&#8217;t still contagious. You all are making this possible.I love you and I thank you. Here&#8217;s to year two! -Molly",

        "description": "It&#8217;s been a rough few years. Yesterday reminded me of why I love baseball. (Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images)LOS ANGELES &#8212; I&#8217;ve gotta be honest: I&#8217;m not used to writing about something going right during Rob Manfred&#8217;s tenure as commissioner of MLB. Under his watch, we&#8217;ve witnessed a team cheat its way to a World Series title without any of its players getting punished. We learned that the baseballs were juiced, then deadened, then juiced again (though no one will explain to us when or why or how this happened.) We sat through an ugly lockout that nearly derailed the 2022 season. We heard Manfred describe the World Series trophy as merely &#8220;a piece of metal,&#8221; while insisting that minor league baseball players are paid a living wage. (Ed note: They&#8217;re not. Sixty-percent of them earn less than the national federal poverty line). We&#8217;ve rallied around the idea that in order for the league to survive despite a dwindling interest from Gen Z, we all need to do a better job promoting and celebrating the sport&#8217;s exciting young stars. Then we watched as Manfred put the game showcasing MLB&#8217;s most exciting minor league players last Saturday on Peacock:Molly Knight @molly_knightWhy on EARTH is the MLB Futures game on a streaming service no one gets? Why do the people who run baseball hate it so much?!?!?? &#128545;July 16th 2022513 Retweets9,651 LikesObviously, I&#8217;ve never been a Rob Manfred gal. Which is why it&#8217;s important for me to give credit where credit is due today. Because the All-Star Game? Was. Awesome. Of course, part of that awesomeness was the Dodgers fully leaning into their rich history by celebrating franchise icons Jackie Robinson, Fernando Valenzuela, and their legendary Spanish play-by-play announcer Jamie Jarr&#237;n. The Dodgers know how to do pomp as well as any franchise in American pro sports. Who else would casually bring out Denzel Washington (!) to honor Robinson pre-game (I cried), and then tap Tony Award-winning (and Pitch Perfect star) Ben Platt to sing the anthem (he was amazing).But the Dodgers could only take this event so far. A big part of why it ruled came down to Manfred. He was the one who decided Miguel Cabrera and Albert Pujols should be All-Stars this year, and put them on the team. For as long as I live I will never forget watching every player from both teams encircle Pujols during the Home Run Derby to celebrate him and pay their respects to one of the greatest to ever do it:Jose Antonio Mena @jmena26Eso se llama respeto, algo que no se compra, se gana. Grande Albert Pujols &#127465;&#127476;&#127465;&#127476; July 19th 202268 Retweets584 LikesThe main thing baseball has going for it over every other sport is its singular obsession with its own history. Albert Pujols is only the fourth player to ever amass 3,000 hits while whacking 600 home runs. It was awesome to see everyone in the sport pay homage while he&#8217;s still an active player. It got me thinking about Stan Musial and Ted Williams and other all-time greats who were honored at All-Star Games near the end of their lives, and how bittersweet it was to see these elite athletes in their senescence, a somewhat painful reminder that even the gods among us can&#8217;t stave off the ravages of Father Time. I also thought about Roy Halladay who never got this moment because he didn&#8217;t live long enough. A generation of young pitchers grew up idolizing him, and I only wish there were some way we could go back in time and give him a moment like what Pujols got before he died. The list of people enshrined in the Hall of Fame posthumously is staggering. Watching Pujols receive his flowers was another reminder that need to tell the people we love that we love them as often as we can while they are still here. Pujols would not have been selected to this year&#8217;s squad had Manfred not intervened, and his inclusion in the Home Run Derby gave me my second-favorite MLB story of the year, after our dear sweet Joc Pederson getting slapped for doing absolutely nothing wrong.This is a reader-supported newsletter. Both free and paid versions are available. The best way to support me and my work (and never miss anything!) is to become a paid subscriber now:Subscribe nowI took in this All-Star-Game as a fan from the rightfield loge in Dodger Stadium, aka the seats where people fought like they were in the Hunger Games for the baseballs Aaron Judge tossed into the stands after he warmed up between innings. Walking around the stadium, it felt like the biggest baseball nerd convention imaginable. So many people were wearing personalized jerseys with inside jokes only fans of the same team would understand. And if you happened to run into, say, five or more people wearing the shirsey of one of the all-stars on the field, there was a ninety-percent chance the people in question were the player&#8217;s immediate family members. (While in line for a large coke zero that cost $16.99 plus tax, I&#8217;m pretty sure I told Ty France&#8217;s wife and his mom how delighted I was when he finally made the team. They appreciated it). I cheered when Guardians&#8217; second baseman Andr&#233;s Jim&#233;nez leaped to catch a line drive, then whipped the ball behind his back to second base to complete a double play.My jaw dropped when I saw Emmanuel Clase throw a baseball in-person for the first time. I&#8217;ve seen hundreds of relief pitchers toe the rubber at Dodger Stadium, and at least one (Mariano Rivera) is in the Hall of Fame. Clase&#8217;s stuff last night was as good as any of them. His inning was worth the price of admission.And of course, I loved watching Clayton Kershaw finally&#8212;finally!!&#8212;get the chance to start an ASG on his ninth try. I don&#8217;t think there is any question that the Marlins&#8217; Sandy Alcantara is the best starting pitcher in baseball right now (at least until Jacob deGrom comes back). So I ask all salty Marlins fans to imagine how frustrated they would feel if Alcantara put up these numbers for 15 years and never earned the honor of starting, because that&#8217;s how Dodger fans have felt watching Kershaw get snubbed, over and over and over again. Shohei Ohtani saying he was going to swing at Kershaw&#8217;s first pitch and then doing it and collecting a hit? Amazing. Kershaw promptly picking him off first base then striking out Aaron Judge? Art. Since I wasn&#8217;t watching at home, I missed Alek Manoah being mic&#8217;d up, but my guy Joe Posnanski is all over how awesome it was. I did happen to see the replay of Nestor Cortes Jr. talking to his catcher, Jose Trevino, during an at-bat, and it was epic:Codify @CodifyBaseballYes, the pitcher and the catcher are talking to each other to strategize how they attack the hitters and I can't believe how much I love this.\nJuly 20th 2022996 Retweets11,602 LikesAlso epic?

Forty-percent of those outs being strikeouts is, uh, not great. The league will attempt to induce more action by banning defensive shifts, but something must be done to give hitters a greater advantage of even putting the ball in play, because the pitchers have all the power now. Some have suggested making home plate smaller, and I think I&#8217;ll need to mull that over several glasses of Pinot Noir before forming my opinion, because it sounds like a scary thing that could also be the correct thing? Regardless. For one night, the most beautiful game in the most beautiful stadium was perfect. Even if a Dodger took the loss.",

(Photo by Dilip Vishwanat/Getty Images)It&#8217;s taken me a while to write about this because, quite frankly, it&#8217;s one of the more bizarre baseball stories I can remember. When Freddie Freeman signed with the Dodgers in March for six years and $162 million, it looked like a win for both sides. In Freeman, the Dodgers got the best left-handed bat on the free-agent market to replace the excellent left-handed bat they lost to the Rangers in Corey Seager. In the Dodgers, Freeman got the chance to sign with a championship contending team not far from where he grew up, and for more money and years than what the Atlanta Braves&#8212;the only team he&#8217;d ever played for&#8212;had offered him. During his first three months with the Dodgers, the 32-year-old first baseman has hit the ball hard, over and over and over again. He ranks second in the NL with a .320 batting average, and third with a .398 on-base percentage. According to FanGraphs, he&#8217;s the seventh-best position player in all of baseball, worth 4.1 wins over replacement. He&#8217;s coming off a four-game stretch in which he went 13-for-16 with 2 homers, 2 walks, and a hit by pitch. He&#8217;s been such a success with Dodger fans that they chant &#8220;Freddie! Freddie! Freddie!&#8221; nearly every time he steps up to bat, at both home and away games. This is a reader supported newsletter. Both free and paid versions are available. The best way to support me and my work is by taking out a paid subscription now:Subscribe nowAnd who can blame them? Freeman has been the best hitter on the best offense in the National League. He has picked up the slack while Max Muncy and Cody Bellinger have sputtered. His steady bat ensured the Dodgers didn&#8217;t lose ground in the NL West when star leadoff hitter Mookie Betts was sidelined with a cracked rib.  The Dodgers have been hammered by injuries this season unlike anything they&#8217;ve ever experienced during their past decade of dominance. Ace Walker Buehler will be out until late summer, if he returns at all. Clayton Kershaw, Andrew Heaney and half the bullpen have also spent significant time on the injured list. Muncy looks like he never fully recovered from tearing his UCL last fall. None of this has mattered. The Dodgers are 58-30, and have built up a 9.5-game lead over the San Diego Padres heading into the final weekend before the All-Star break. Freeman is a huge part of why.And yet. The drama surrounding his signing with the Dodgers is still so nuts that his now former agent, Casey Close, sued a radio host over this tweet about it yesterday:Doug Gottlieb @GottliebShowCasey Close never told Freddie Freeman about the Braves final offer, that is why Freeman fired him. He found out in Atlanta this weekend. It isn&#8217;t that rare to have happen in MLB, but it happened - Close knew Freddie would have taken the ATL dealJune 29th 20223,582 Retweets25,089 LikesIn Gottlieb&#8217;s version of how Freeman wound up a Dodger, the Braves made one last push to sign their franchise player, but Close never presented it to Freeman. This tweet was offered as an explanation for why Freeman could not stop crying publicly when he returned to Atlanta for the first time to play a series there as a member of the visiting team last month. Freeman fired Close after that series, an indication that, regardless of how and why he ended up a Dodger, he was upset about how everything went down.In his lawsuit, Close disputed Gottlieb&#8217;s tweet that he never told Freeman about the Braves&#8217; final offer, and laid out a timeline of his negotiations with the team.Here&#8217;s Bill Shaikin of the L.A. Times with the numbers Close provided in the lawsuit:Bill Shaikin @BillShaikinBraves' offers to Freeman:\nMarch 29, 2021: 5/110\nAug. 1, 2021: 5/125\nAug. 4, 2021: 5/135\n\nAll rejected by Freeman, and no other offer ever presented by Braves, according to suit.July 14th 202237 Retweets85 LikesSo if Close is telling the truth, the Braves never made a formal offer to their franchise player last offseason. Close is now suing Gottlieb because he says Gottlieb&#8217;s tweet may wind up costing him tens of millions of dollars in agent commissions due to his damaged reputation. Close said that in the wake of Gottlieb&#8217;s tweet, he has also received death threats from Braves&#8217; fans. I have no idea what the Braves offered Freeman or when. We reporters are rarely privy to all the details of mammoth contract negotiations, which makes this lawsuit potentially a rare window into how the free-agent sausage is made. But looking at all this from the outside, it seemed strange to me that Freeman, who so clearly and desperately wanted to stay in Atlanta, would be a member of any other team if the feeling had been mutual. Even before we saw the numbers and the timeline that Close filed in his lawsuit, it sure seemed like Close&#8217;s version of events was the closest to the truth. It&#8217;s well within Freeman&#8217;s rights to fire his agent for any number of reasons, including that he didn&#8217;t like the way the negotiations&#8212;or lack thereof&#8212;went down. And given his tears in Atlanta, it&#8217;s obvious Freeman was traumatized by the free agency process.  The plot thickened when Freeman&#8217;s teammate Clayton Kershaw, also a Close client, told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that he hoped the Dodgers weren&#8217;t just a consolation prize for Freeman. &#8220;He&#8217;s obviously been a big contributor for our team, Kershaw said. &#8220;And I hope we&#8217;re not second fiddle. It&#8217;s a pretty special team over here, too. I think whenever he gets comfortable over here, he&#8217;ll really enjoy it.&#8221;Kershaw and Freeman have since spoken about Kershaw&#8217;s comments, and the issue appears to be squashed (at least publicly). I didn&#8217;t write about Kershaw&#8217;s comments at the time because I was trying to better understand both of their perspectives before I formed an opinion. Now I think they are both correct in their feelings: Freeman for being upset that the Braves let him go, and Kershaw for being frustrated at the idea that Freeman might not grow to love his new team enough move on. These are human beings, after all, with dreams and triggers and egos and emotions, playing under a microscope. I loved that Freeman felt secure enough in himself to be a man who cries publicly when his emotions overcame him. Crying is healthy, and who wouldn&#8217;t feel like a hot mess running into their first love right after being broken up with? (Been there!) Stoicism is overrated. But because Freeman was so upset he couldn&#8217;t stop sobbing before his press conference even started, I worried that his trauma would become A Thing that could permeate into the Dodgers&#8217; clubhouse and taint everything else.The opposite has happened. While Freeman&#8217;s former agent was suing Gottlieb over this whole mess, Freeman was standing in the batter&#8217;s box at Busch Stadium in St. Louis looking like a hitter who was absolutely impossible to retire.Here&#8217;s St. Louis Post-Dispatch Cardinals&#8217; beat writer Derrick Goold:#stlcards to get Freddie Freeman out for the first time.\\n\\n#Dodgers #MLB #Cardinals&quot;,&quot;username&quot;:&quot;dgoold&quot;,&quot;name&quot;:&quot;Derrick Goold&quot;,&quot;date&quot;:&quot;Thu Jul 14 02:44:08 +0000 2022&quot;,&quot;photos&quot;:[],&quot;quoted_tweet&quot;:{},&quot;retweet_count&quot;:7,&quot;like_count&quot;:108,&quot;expanded_url&quot;:{},&quot;video_url&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true}\">Derrick Goold @dgooldThis seems to be the best time this week for the #stlcards to get Freddie Freeman out for the first time.\n\n#Dodgers #MLB #CardinalsJuly 14th 20227 Retweets108 LikesDerrick Goold @dgooldOr not.

This is a man who endured such a nasty case of COVID-19 back in 2020 that he prayed for his life, then he won the NL MVP months later.  If he&#8217;s still upset with the Braves and/or Close, his play hasn&#8217;t been impacted by it at all. In fact, all the drama seems to have made him better: Freeman has raised his OPS by 40 points since that messy weekend in Atlanta, and the Dodgers have gone 13-4 in that span. Maybe this is the hitter he always is, regardless of what&#8217;s happening off the field. Regardless, his ability to rake the pain away has been an unbelievable sight to behold. If this is how good he is when he&#8217;s sad, what will he do at the plate when he&#8217;s happy? I have no idea. I just know that regardless of whether the Dodgers were Freeman&#8217;s consolation prize or not, with the way he&#8217;s been playing he&#8217;s been worth every penny.

        "description": "LONDON — The six living former British prime ministers gathered for the rarest of ceremonies in London on Saturday to witness King Charles III be formally proclaimed the country’s new monarch.\n\n\n\nDuring a sombre meeting of the Accession Council, the new king said he was “deeply aware” of “the duties and heavy responsibilities of sovereignty” which have now passed to him from his late mother Queen Elizabeth II.\n\n\n\n“In taking up these responsibilities, I shall strive to follow the inspiring example I have been set in upholding constitutional government, and to seek the peace, harmony and prosperity of the peoples of these islands, of the Commonwealth realms and territories throughout the world,” he told a packed room of senior politicians and other dignitaries at St James’s Palace.\n\n\n\nAlthough Charles became king the moment his mother died Thursday, according to centuries-old British convention an Accession Council must meet to formally declare his coming to the throne. It last met in 1952. This year, the whole event was televised for the first time.\n\n\n\nThe historic occasion brought together Conservative and Labour ex-premiers John Major, Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson, as well as current Prime Minister Liz Truss. They were joined by past and present Cabinet ministers, the former Archbishops of Canterbury and York, Queen Camilla, and the king’s oldest son and heir William.\n\n\n\nAlso among the counsellors was former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, who lost his Sheffield seat in 2017 and is now president of global affairs at tech giant Meta, and the current and former Scottish First Ministers Nicola Sturgeon and Alex Salmond.\n\n\n\nThe historic ceremony was led by Lord President of the Council Penny Mordaunt, who was only handed the job in Tuesday night’s Cabinet reshuffle by new PM Truss.\n\n\n\nDuring the first part of the ceremony, Clerk of the Privy Council Richard Tilbrook read the proclamation confirming Charles as Britain’s “only lawful and rightful liege lord.” The clerk then declared: “God save the king,” and more than 200 counsellors repeated the famous phrase.\n\n\n\nIn the second part of the meeting, the king made his address and took the oath to preserve the Church of Scotland, where powers of state and church are split. William, the new prince of Wales, also signed the oath.\n\n\n\nOutside, a crowd of thousands sang the chorus of the — now reworded — national anthem and gave three cheers for the new monarch.\n\n\n\nBigger crowds waited for Charles III outside Buckingham Palace, where he arrived after the ceremony in his state Rolls Royce to host an audience with Truss, members of her Cabinet and opposition leaders.\n\n\n\nPrince William also paid his first public tribute to the queen, whom he said was by his side at his happiest and saddest moments. “I knew this day would come, but it will be some time before the reality of life without grannie will truly feel real,” he said.\n\n\n\nOn Saturday afternoon, other members of the royal family, including the king’s three siblings and their children, attended a prayer service at Crathie Kirk, near Balmoral, where the queen’s body remains. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn parliament, senior MPs and members of the government including Truss, House of Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle and Labour’s longest-serving female MP Harriet Harman, pledged their allegiance to the new king, with more expected to do so at a later date.\n\n\n\nThe program of commemorative events will continue Sunday afternoon, when the king will receive the realm high commissioners and Foreign Secretary James Cleverly in representation of the U.K. government.\n\n\n\nThe queen’s coffin will be taken by road to the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh Sunday at a slow pace to allow mourners to pay their respects, according to a senior palace official. \n\n\n\nOn Monday, the coffin will be taken in procession to St Giles’s Cathedral, Edinburgh, where it will lie until Tuesday, before being flown to London, where it will lie in state for four days in Westminster Hall from Wednesday until the morning of her state funeral on September 19. During these days thousands of people are expected to visit parliament to bid farewell to the late monarch.\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Truss will attend the presentation of addresses in Westminster Hall, and will join King Charles III as he leads the national mourning across the U.K., with services in Scotland that same afternoon, in Northern Ireland Tuesday, and in Wales on Friday.",

        "description": "Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  I’ve lost count of how many times I’ve said the Dodgers are using September to sort out their plans in October. Most of that had to do with the pitchers, with seven potential postseason contributors currently on the injured list and in various stages of working their way back.\nBut there’s still some sorting out to do on the position-player side, too. The roster is pretty much set, with the current 14 active players the group from which 13 playoff roster spots will be filled. If anyone else currently in the minors had a chance for October — like Edwin Ríos or James Outman — they would have been called up while Gavin Lux was on the injured list, instead of Lux waiting out his return from neck stiffness while also active.\n Within those playoff-bound players, divvying up playing time is still to be decided for a few. We can look at how these four players have been used to see how things are trending.\nOver the last two weeks, 13 total games:\n\nJoey Gallo: 11 starts, 37 plate appearances, .121/.216/.242\nChris Taylor: 9 starts, 37 PA, .133/.297/.167\nCody Bellinger: 9 starts, 33 PA, .036/.182/.036\nTrayce Thompson: 7 starts, 34 PA, .207/.324/.586\n\nThose four accounted for all but one start in left field and center field during that span, plus a few fill-in starts in right field, and Taylor starting six times at second base with Lux out.\nAll but Thompson have been terrible at the plate over those last two weeks, with expected numbers to match:\n\nGallo .174/.263/.330\nTaylor .145/.306/.250\nBellinger .087/.226/.106\nThompson .197/.315/.441\n\nThis is a flawed quartet, and a group that strikes out more than almost anyone. Among the 339 major leaguers with at least 190 plate appearances on the season, Gallo has the third-highest strikeout rate (39.2 percent), Thompson is sixth (37.2 percent), and Taylor is ninth (36 percent). Bellinger strikes out the least of the bunch, at 27.6 percent, but when he puts his bat to the ball he’s not doing much at all, hitting just .197/.259/.378, a 78 wRC+.\nTaylor’s strikeout rate since returning from the injured list is higher (37.6 percent), and he’s hitting just .161/.267/.276, a 59 wRC+.\nGallo since joining the Dodgers is hitting .191/.304/.441, a 111 wRC+. He’s been extremely platooned, batting just five times against left-handed pitching.\nThompson, who joined the Dodgers in June, is hitting .281/.371/.556, a 159 wRC+ that ranks 16th in the majors during that time. The strikeouts are troubling, but the quality of contact is great, with an expected line of .263/.357/.508. \nHe’s started only 38 of 72 games with Los Angeles. \nYou could argue Thompson is succeeding because the Dodgers have put him in a better position to succeed with more favorable matchups. That might be true, but the right-handed Thompson is hitting right-handed pitching better than anyone on the team, .341/.439/.610, a 207 wRC+ against them.\nThompson can play all three outfield positions, has hit well for nearly three months, and is one of the best power hitters on the team.\nIt’s pretty clear at this point that Thompson deserves more playing time. He’s earned it.",

        "description": "(NEXSTAR) – It was fun while it lasted, Chipotle fans.\n\n\n\nChipotle has confirmed that guests will no longer be able to take advantage of an online “hack” that gained popularity on social media, as it resulted in a “poor experience” for employees and customers in the restaurants.\n\n\n\nUsers who had partaken in the “hack,” as it was referred to on social media, had instructed their followers to use Chipotle’s online ordering platforms to place an order for a single taco with all of the free toppings on the side, along with a tortilla. By doing so, many users claimed they could construct what essentially amounted to an entire burrito (or burrito bowl) for around $3 and change.\n\n\n\nWhen ordered the traditional way, burritos generally cost upwards of $9, depending on proteins and add-ons, according to the Chipotle website.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tChipotle testing new ‘fiery’ chicken item at nearly 100 locations\t\n\n\n\n\nAs first reported by Insider, Chipotle disabled the online option to order a single taco earlier this week.\n\n\n\n“Guests are currently unable to order a single taco from our online ordering systems,” said Laurie Schalow, the chief corporate affairs officer for Chipotle, in a statement shared with Nexstar. “While we have long embraced customizations and even released our own hack menu, the current social media trend is resulting in a poor experience for our food, our employees and our customers waiting for orders.”\n\n\n\nWorkers at several Chipotle locations across the U.S. told Insider that having to fulfill these orders would slow down the entire restaurant. The item itself also wasted more packaging and single-use plastic cups than a traditional burrito order.\n\n\n\nOne manager, from Ohio, even told Insider that customers would get “aggressive” with employees when they were given the appropriate-sized sides for a taco (rather than the larger sides provided in burrito orders), even though they were technically only entitled to the smaller taco-sized portions.\n\n\n\n\"It was just annoying for everyone,\" she said, in part, in a statement to Insider.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSouth Dakota names viral ‘corn kid’ its official ‘corn-bassador’\t\n\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Schalow indicated in her statement that Chipotle isn't against all menu \"hacks\" on social media, pointing to three that Chipotle itself shared on TikTok in 2020. But each of these “hacks” — for ordering nachos, a taco salad or a seven-layer dip — were aimed at helping customers create off-menu items, rather than cheaper versions of current menu items.\n\n\n\nChipotle customers who still wish to order tacos, meanwhile, can still do so in-person, Schalow told Nexstar.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3636241-three-ways-russian-business-leaders-can-avoid-western-sanctions/",
        "description": "Western sanctions are ensnaring more Russian business leaders, some of whom say they are unjustly targeted. Can those in the private sector reduce their risks of being designated? Perhaps, if they make difficult choices.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, most wealthy Russians were quiet about the invasion of Ukraine and illegal annexation of Crimea. Some in the West saw silence as complicity. Moscow’s renewed war fuels stronger concern. Questions are asked about how Russian business leaders weigh the value of loyalty to the Kremlin versus longer-term or global interests that may differ. And what about the civic responsibilities of business leaders?\n\n\n\nWealthy Russians enjoy Western benefits, from secure banking to quality schooling to safe living and vacations in Europe. But some in the West may see them as less than courageous for not opposing Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and the massacre of civilians.\n\n\n\nThis disquiet&nbsp;helps strengthen consensus Western support for sanctions, which can have powerful effects in capital-starved Russia. Businesses may be cut-off from Western capital markets for new equity or loan financing. For many this may not have an immediate effect, but in the mid- and long-term, such access could be vital.\n\n\n\nSome might say the U.S. has been slow to sanction individuals. In March 2014, President Obama authorized sanctions on “individuals …&nbsp;responsible for violating” Ukraine’s&nbsp;sovereignty and territorial integrity or “stealing assets” of its people. Early sanctions targeted several officials and two&nbsp;former KGB&nbsp;cronies&nbsp;of&nbsp;President Vladimir Putin who run state companies, Rosneft CEO Igor Sechin and Rostec CEO Sergei Chemezov.\n\n\n\nAs the simmering conflict in eastern Ukraine dragged on, U.S. patience wore thinner. In April 2018, the U.S. began sanctioning&nbsp;private sector&nbsp;business leaders. The first were Oleg Deripaska, owner of aluminum and motor vehicle companies, and Viktor Vekselberg, owner of a conglomerate that includes aluminum, oil, energy,&nbsp;telecoms and other assets. A leaked U.S. diplomatic message had called Deripaska&nbsp;“among&nbsp;2-3 oligarchs“ to whom Putin often turns. But Vekselberg was not seen as so close to the Russian president, a hint that U.S. sanctions policy might cast a wider net.\n\n\n\nIn this vein, last March the U.S. unveiled an “expansive list” of targets: “elites and family members” who back Putin … or “enriched themselves at the expense of the Russian people … elevated family members to high-ranking positions … (or) sit atop Russia’s largest companies and … provide resources” to support the Ukraine invasion.\n\n\n\nIn July, the U.S. singled out three&nbsp;private sector business&nbsp;leaders: Andrey&nbsp;Melnichenko, who owned&nbsp;the EuroChem fertilizer and SUEK coal companies, Alexander&nbsp;Ponomarenko, board chair of Russia’s largest airport, and Dmitry&nbsp;Pumpyansky, a pipe and railroad equipment manufacturer.\n\n\n\nMore Russian business leaders may be sanctioned not for a specific cause. Rather, they could be caught up in what is becoming general economic warfare. As a result, business leaders may be less able to assess risks of being sanctioned, but they might still be able to reduce them. Here’s how.\n\n\n\nCriticize the war.&nbsp;Some business leaders have. In February, banker Mikhail Fridman said&nbsp;war could “never be the answer,” Deripaska urged negotiations “as soon as possible” and steel magnate Aleksey Mordashev said it was&nbsp;“terrible” that Ukrainians and Russians were dying.&nbsp;In March, global steel owner Vladimir Lisin said lives lost were “impossible to justify.” In April, Oleg Tinkov, a top banker, said “we are&nbsp;against this war.” He&nbsp;was soon forced to sell his bank at a heavy discount.\n\n\n\nBlame the Kremlin. Criticizing the war may not be enough. Notwithstanding Mordashev’s criticism, the U.S. and the European Union have sanctioned him. Business leaders might be bolder if riskier. They could blame Russian authorities or decline to support the war effort. No prominent business leader seems to have done so. Tinkov’s punishment may be a deterrent.\n\n\n\nAssist Ukraine. Russian business leaders might look for ways to aid Ukraine or its people. They or their companies could support Ukrainian refugees. They might cease collecting on Ukrainian debts. They could help in countries that suffer collateral damage from sanctions, such as those in Central Asia.\n\n\n\nSome Russian business leaders may think they are stranded in a perfect storm. The Kremlin demands loyalty, but its war has destroyed unprecedented business value. Military setbacks and economic decline could weaken the grip of Kremlin leaders or spark change. If new leaders came to power, they might seek economic relief through better Western ties, but sanctioned companies could lose ground. If a peace settlement were to emerge, sanctioned businesses could forfeit more of their assets in the West to help fund Ukrainian recovery.\n\n\n\nRussian business leaders have obligations to employees, owners, suppliers and customers. They must make reasonable efforts to protect those interests. Although business leaders may fear Kremlin power, they may also realize that Russia’s war, isolation and economic erosion pose rising threats to their businesses. The choice is theirs to make.\n\n\n\nWilliam&nbsp;Courtney&nbsp;is an adjunct senior fellow at the nonprofit, nonpartisan RAND Corporation and was U.S. ambassador to Kazakhstan and Georgia.

        "description": "Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Pablo López and Carlos Carrasco will start Saturday’s Marlins vs. Mets game at LoanDepot Park. Full lineups and game notes in here. Welcome to Saturday’s Marlins (57-80, -90 RD) vs. Mets (87-52, +126 RD) game thread. LoanDepot Park is celebrating Colombian heritage tonight. The Marlins will wear their red Sugar Kings uniforms for the eighth time this season.\n\n\n\nUse this Fish Picks link prior to every Marlins series to submit your predictions. The eighth inning of the contest has just begun and it runs through September 15. \n\nMets Starting Lineup\n\n CF Brandon Nimmo (125 wRC+ this season, 123 wRC+ over last 30 days) \nSS Francisco Lindor (124, 96)\n2B Jeff McNeil (136, 145)\n1B Pete Alonso (135, 80)\nRF Tyler Naquin (107, 80)\nLF Mark Canha (130, 173)\nDH Daniel Vogelbach (121, 86)\n3B Eduardo Escobar (95, 165)\nC James McCann (63, 79)\n\nRHP Carlos Carrasco (100 ERA+ this season, career 110 ERA+) \n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n      Carrasco’s 2022 pitch distribution and Statcast percentile rankings\n  \n\nNotes: Lindor has hit especially well against Marlins pitching in 2022, slashing .328/.388/.689 with 10 extra-base hits and 17 runs batted in (15 games)...Old friend Starling Marte has been out since Tuesday with a fractured finger. I’d call his availability for this series questionable at best...Nimmo (.864 OPS in 22 PA) and Alonso (.600 OPS in 18 PA) have the most head-to-head history with Pablo López among active Mets players.\n\nMarlins Game Notes\n\n\nMarlins Starting Lineup\n\nLF Jon Berti (106 wRC+ this season, 69 wRC+ over last 30 days)\n3B Brian Anderson (95, 59)\n2B Joey Wendle (82, 75)\nDH Garrett Cooper (108, 73)\nRF Avisaíl García (68, 65) \nCF JJ Bleday (95, 76)\nSS Miguel Rojas (69, 42) \nC Jacob Stallings (69, 125) \n1B Lewin Díaz (48, 75) \n\nRHP Pablo López (111 ERA+ this season, career 107 ERA+) \n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n      López’s 2022 pitch distribution and Statcast percentile rankings \n  \n\nLineup Changes from Previous Game: Bleday, Díaz, Stallings and Wendle in, Bryan De La Cruz, Jerar Encarnación, Nick Fortes and Charles Leblanc out; Berti switches form 2B to LF, Anderson switches from RF to 3B, Cooper switches from 1B to DH, García switches from DH to RF\nAdditional Notes: Berti is starting in the outfield for the first time since July 12...It’s been an amazing week for Cooper, going 8-for-15 with no strikeouts in 17 plate appearances...Every pitcher in the Marlins bullpen should be available with the possible exception of Dylan Floro, who pitched each of the last two days.\n\nHow to Watch/Listen/Follow\nFirst pitch is scheduled for 6:10 p.m. ET. Watch on Bally Sports Florida or listen to the radio broadcast on Fox Sports 940 Miami. Out-of-market fans can stream the game on MLB.TV.\nAlex Krutchik and Kevin Barral are representing Fish Stripes at LoanDepot Park as a credentialed reporter.

        "description": "Michael McLoone-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Reds put up five runs in first and 17 hits overall Box Score\nIt wasn’t a good Friday night for the Brewers pitching staff. They gave up eight runs and 17 hits as the Brewers were behind the whole night as they took an 8-2 loss to the Reds.\nThe Reds jumped on starter Jason Alexander right away. On the third pitch of the game, TJ Friedl homered to put the Reds up 1-0. From there, it just continued to spiral down. It wasn’t until the seventh Reds batter that the Brewers finally recorded an out, and even that was a run-scoring double play. The Reds batted around in the first, and they were ahead 5-0 after one inning.\nAlexander settled down after that and didn’t allow any more runs, but from there it was more about eating innings to keep the bullpen from being used up. Alexander finished the day with five runs and nine hits allowed, along with four strikeouts and one walk.\nThe Brewers did score a couple of runs to keep the game competitive. In the third, Luis Urias singled to lead off the inning. Two batters later, Tyrone Taylor hit his 16th home run of the season to make it a 5-2 game. That was all Reds starter Nick Lodolo allowed in the game. He allowed the two runs on five hits and struck out eleven.\nThe Brewers bullpen did keep it close the next few innings, as Justin Topa and Luis Perdomo had scoreless appearances (though Topa did allow four hits). Unforunately, any chance for a comeback was erased in the ninth. Brent Suter allowed four hits in the inning, two of them going for home runs that gave the Reds another three runs. After that, the Brewers went down in order in the ninth to end the game.\nThe Brewers will try to rebound on Saturday night with Adrian Houser on the mound. He will face former Brewer Chase Anderson in the start. First pitch is at 6:15 PM, and it will be on Bally Sports Wisconsin and the Brewers Radio Network.",

        "description": "Photo by Brett Davis/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Cy Young Award candidate Max Fried will face off against incredibly good younger George Kirby in a fantastic pitching matchup. Good day, everyone! I am pleased to remind you that when you read this, the Braves will be in sole, uncontested first place in the NL East, carrying an 0.5-game lead over the New York Mets? How did they get there? A homer-rific 6-4 win over the Seattle Mariners, while the Mets flopped against the Marlins. While the Braves have their first uncontested lead all season, the race is still on: there are 24 games to go, and while the Mets get to face Pablo Lopez and the Marlins tonight, the Braves will have another tough test of their own: George Kirby.\nThe Mariners’ first-round pick in the 2019 Rule IV amateur draft, Kirby has racked up a plentiful 2.4 fWAR in just 105 2⁄3 innings, with an 86/79/81 line overall. That line, though, is a composite of some June struggles and what he’s done since. Kirby gave up four homers in his last start of June. After that, he has allowed zero homers and just seven walks in 10 starts, while striking out 60. In those 10 tries, in terms of non-ERA, he hasn’t even had a bad start: his highest FIP in a start in that span was 2.11, and his highest xFIP was 3.90. In his most recent outing, Kirby was forced out by a long rain delay after a 2/0 K/BB ratio and a lone run scoring across three frames. \nHow does he the 24-year-old right-hander do it? Largely with a 95-96 mph fastball he throws about half the time. The pitch lacks any on-paper remarkable spin, movement, or location, but has a pretty good vertical approach angle (VAA) and therefore appears to be relatively hard square up. Kirby continues to assault batters with it across a variety of counts, including two-strike counts, which tends to throw batters for a loop. In addition to that, he throws a cutter/slider (which really does tend to be a slider-ish cutter sometimes, and a slider other times) and a curveball, none of which really glimmer the way his fastball does, as well as mixing in a sinker and changeup here and there. My guess is that Kirby’s success is driven in part by hitters being very surprised with a procession of two-strike fastballs, but alternative theories are welcome!\nFortunately for the Braves, though, they have the luxury of sending the scintillating Max Fried to the hill to oppose Kirby. Fried, well, you know about Fried. He’s third in the NL and fourth in MLB in fWAR, and has a 71/76/79 line that’s not even that much worse than Kirby’s amazing last 10 starts. By ERA/FIP/xFIP, Fried has 3/2/1 starts above 4.50 and 5/4/2 above 4.00 all season. He has a 27/4 K/BB ratio over his last five starts, and fired five hitless frames against the Marlins last time out before, like Kirby, being forced out by rain. \nBoth Fried and Kirby have been incredibly stingy with the longball this year, which sets up an intriguing duel between two teams who hit seven homers to score nine of the ten total runs plated in last night’s game. This could be a close one, but it could also be decided by which team the HR/FB gods favor in this one.\n\nGame Info\nAtlanta Braves @ Seattle Mariners\nSaturday, September 10, 2022\n9:10 pm EDT\nT-Mobile Park, Seattle, WA\nTV: Bally Sports Southeast\nRadio: 680 AM/93.7 FM The Fan\nXM Radio: Online / Ch. 89",

        "description": "A Minneapolis man has been charged with three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder in a weekend shooting that left three people dead and two wounded, according to a criminal complaint made public Friday.Authorities say 41-year-old Antonio Dupree Wright walked into a duplex in St. Paul’s Payne-Phalen neighborhood through the back door on Sept. 4, raised a gun, and started shooting the people inside. According to a probable cause statement, he first shot 44-year-old Maisha Spaulding in the head as she sat on a couch. He then shot 33-year-old Angelica Gonzales in the face and shot 42-year-old Cory Freeman as he tried to run away. All three died.Wright, who was wearing a ski mask, kept shooting others in the duplex, prosecutors said. A man and woman were found outside with gunshot wounds, and another man had rolled under a couch during the attack and survived, according to the complaint.One of the men who survived, identified as SA, said Wright is a heroin dealer who has been paranoid and believed he was being tracked by federal authorities. SA told police that Wright has a connection to the Vice Lords and to Chicago, and thought the people he shot were snitching on him, according to a statement of probable cause.Prosecutors say Wright is in custody in Chicago, where he was arrested Wednesday, and will make his first appearance in Ramsey County District Court after he is extradited to Minnesota. It was not immediately clear if Wright had an attorney to comment on his behalf.Wright is also charged in Ramsey County with kidnapping and attempted murder from an incident two days prior in which he allegedly put a gun to the head of a man he thought had snitched on him after the man overheard Wright discussing a murder, the complaint says. In that case, Wright allegedly shot the man four times when the man fled.Wright has eight prior felony convictions, including for third-degree assault, armed robbery and cocaine possession, prosecutors said. At the time of the shootings, Wright was under supervision following his release from prison for a drug case, according to a state Department of Corrections record.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/mets-to-promote-mark-vientos.html",
        "description": "The Mets are set to call up infield prospect Mark Vientos, according to Jon Heyman of the New York Post. Vientos is already on New York&#8217;s 40-man roster, having been selected in November of 2021 to protect him from the Rule 5 draft that eventually was canceled by the lockout. That means the club will only need to open a spot on the active roster in terms of corresponding moves.\nVientos, 22, was a second-round pick of the Mets, getting selected 59th overall in 2017. He got into some rookie ball games that year and fared well, despite still just being 17 years old. Going into 2018, Baseball America ranked him as the #6 prospect in the Mets system. Since then, Vientos has been creeping up the minor league ladder, largely holding steady in the 4-6 range in the organization, per BA&#8217;s rankings.\nAfter the pandemic wiped out the minors in 2020, Vientos got assigned to Double-A in 2021. In 72 games with the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, he hit 22 home runs and produced an overall batting line of .281/.346/.580. He also struck out in 28.4% of his plate appearances, but it was still impressive enough for Vientos to get a call-up to Triple-A in September.\nHe returned to the Syracuse Mets here in 2022, getting into 101 games so far on the season. He&#8217;s hit another 24 home runs and slashed .280/.358/.519. He&#8217;s still going down on strikes at a high rate, with a 28.6% mark for the year. Nonetheless, his overall production with the bat has been 29% better than league average, as evidenced by his 129 wRC+. He&#8217;ll now get a chance to bring some of that tremendous power up to the big leagues with him. He&#8217;ll be making his MLB debut as soon as he gets into a game.\nAlthough Vientos has played some first base this season, he&#8217;s primarily been slotted in at third, which is probably where he&#8217;s most likely to take the field since Pete Alonso has first base covered. The Mets already tried promoting a prospect to cover third when they brought up Bretty Baty. Unfortunately, he had to undergo thumb surgery and might be done for the season. He and Luis Guillorme are both on the injured list at the moment, though Guillorme is rehabbing and could return soon. With those two on the shelf, Eduardo Escobar has been at the hot corner. He&#8217;s been hot lately but still below average on the season overall, slashing .231/.282/.408, wRC+ of 95.\nThere&#8217;s also the possibility of Vientos being deployed as a designated hitter, where the Mets have been using a platoon of Daniel Vogelbach and Darin Ruf. The left-handed-hitting Vogelbach is doing fine but Ruf is struggling with his part of the deal. Since being acquired from the Giants, he&#8217;s hitting just .156/.200/.222. Since Vientos is right-handed, he could take some at-bats away from Ruf. However he&#8217;s deployed, the Mets will be hoping Vientos provides a spark to help them in a divisional race that has tightened significantly of late. They had a 10 1/2 game lead in the NL East in early June but have since been passed by a surging Atlanta club that is now half a game ahead.",

        "description": "Catching up on some players who were recently designated for assignment&#8230;\nLatest Moves\n\nThe Pirates outrighted left-hander Cam Vieaux and infielder Josh VanMeter to Triple-A after the duo each cleared waivers, according to John Dreker of Pirates Prospects (Twitter link).  Vieaux and VanMeter were each designated for assignment earlier this week.  VanMeter hit .187/.266/.292 over 192 PA with Pittsburgh this season, while playing all over the field as a defensive fill-in.  Vieaux made his MLB debut this year, with a 10.38 ERA over 8 2/3 innings in his first taste of big league action.\nThe Yankees announced that right-hander Luke Bard has been outrighted to Triple-A.  Since this isn&#8217;t the first time Bard has been outrighted in his career, he can opt for free agency rather than accept the Triple-A assignment.  The righty pitched one game in the pinstripes after being claimed off waivers from the Rays in early August, and for the 2022 season in total, Bard has a 1.80 ERA over 15 innings with Tampa Bay and New York.\n\nEarlier Today\n\nThe Orioles announced that infielder Jonathan Araúz cleared outright waivers and has been assigned to Triple-A Norfolk. He was claimed off waivers from the Red Sox in June and has gotten into 15 games at the big league level this year between the two clubs. The 24-year-old hit just .132/.150/.211 in that time but provided defensive versatility by playing second base, third base and shortstop. In 35 Triple-A games this year, he&#8217;s hit .192/.264/.238. Since this is the first outright of his career and he has less than three years of MLB service time, he won&#8217;t have the right to reject the assignment and become a free agent.\nThe Mets outrighted right-hander Adonis Medina, according to his transactions tracker at MLB.com. Medina, 25, was acquired from the Pirates in April for cash considerations and has been tossed between Triple-A and the majors all year long. In 23 2/3 MLB innings, he has a 6.08 ERA, 15.5% strikeout rate and 5.5% walk rate. In 26 2/3 innings for Syracuse, he has a much better 3.71 ERA and 20.2% strikeout rate, though a much higher walk rate of 12.1%. This is the first outright of his career and he has less than three years of MLB service time, meaning he will have to accept the outright assignment to Syracuse.\nThe Cubs sent right-hander Kervin Castro outright to Triple-A Iowa, according to his transactions tracker at MLB.com. The 23-year-old began the season with the Giants but went to the Cubs on a waiver claim in August. Between the two clubs, he&#8217;s thrown 12 1/3 MLB innings this year, but with a 10.22 ERA and 12.3% walk rate. In 34 2/3 Triple-A innings between the two organizations, he has a 5.19 ERA with a 16% walk rate. He has less than three years of MLB service time and this is his first career outright, meaning he will not be eligible to reject this assignment.\nThe Twins sent right-hander Jake Jewell outright to Triple-A St. Paul, according to his transactions tracker at MLB.com. The 29-year-old began the year with the Guardians on a minor league deal, getting selected to the big league roster in August but getting optioned before appearing in a game. He lasted just over a week on the 40-man roster before getting designated for assignment and landing with Minnesota on waivers. In 48 2/3 Triple-A innings between the two organizations, he has a 3.14 ERA, 25.9% strikeout rate and 8.8% walk rate. Unlike the others on this list, he has been previously outrighted in his career. That gives him the right to reject this assignment and elect free agency, though it&#8217;s unclear at this point if he has done so.",

Happy Saturday, folks! The White Sox are on a roll as of late, with last night’s ninth inning comeback giving them a win in eight of their last 10 games, all coming under the watchful eye of interim manager Miguel Cairo. They come in to today hoping to take a third game in this four-game series with the Athletics.\n\n\nUnder Acting Manager Miguel Cairo, the White Sox are 8-3 with a MLB-best +31 run differential over that span.— Christopher Kamka (@ckamka) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nLance Lynn is on the bump for the Sox. Starting his 17th game this season, he currently holds a 5-5 record with a 4.34 ERA and 102 strikeouts on the season.

        "description": "Twelve Republican representatives in a letter dated Thursday urged the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee to prioritize a bill funding a program that provides medical care for survivors of and responders to the 9/11 attacks, in light of an “impending funding shortfall” the program is facing.\n\n\n\n“As you are aware, the World Trade Center Health Program (WTCHP) is facing an impending funding shortfall due to a rise in medical costs and cancer rates over the last three years,” the lawmakers wrote to Rep. Frank Pallone Jr. (D-N.J.).\n\n\n\nThey continued, citing an article by the New York Daily News: “WTCHP is rapidly approaching a deficit in funding that will force the program to have to ratchet down spending and bar any new sick responders or survivors by October 2024.”\n\n\n\nThursday’s letter followed up on another letter sent by the same group of representatives in July asking for Pallone’s bipartisan cooperation on the 9/11 Responder and Survivor Health Funding Correction Act.\n\n\n\nThe bill, H.R. 4965, would bolster the WTCHP, a federal program that monitors the health of survivors and provides them with care for health conditions related to the 2001 attacks.\n\n\n\nIt would also establish a research program to determine the effects of the attacks on those who were 21 years old or younger when they occurred.\n\n\n\n“H.R. 4965 not only addresses the current funding shortfall directly, but also ensures adequate funding for years to come,” wrote the 12 Republicans.\n\n\n\nThe lawmakers called on Pallone to allow for a full committee markup of the bill during the upcoming legislative period.\n\n\n\n“If Congress does not quickly address this impending crisis, then the men and women who put their lives on the line and who survived the 9/11 terrorist attacks will lose health coverage to treat the physical and mental illnesses that they sustained on that fateful day,” they wrote, noting that no action had been taken since the letter sent in July “despite broad bipartisan support and the looming funding deficit.”\n\n\n\nThe lawmakers who signed the letter are Reps. Andrew Garbarino (N.Y.), Lee Zeldin (N.Y.), John Katko (N.Y.), Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), Chris Jacobs (N.Y.), Claudia Tenney (N.Y.), Nicole Malliotakis (N.Y.), Elise Stefanik (N.Y.), Dan Meuser (Pa.), David Joyce (Ohio), Jefferson Van Drew (N.J.) and Rodney Davis (Ill.).\n\n\n\n“Congress has a responsibility to uphold our promises. We implore you not to turn a blind eye to the hardship 9/11 responders and survivors are facing and urge you to move this critical legislation forward without further delay,” they concluded.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;Large swaths of California experienced triple-digit temperatures since the unprecedented September heat wave kicked off just before Labor Day Weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and the state’s grid operator, the California Independent System Operator (ISO), urged residents to help conserve power for more than a week by keeping thermostats at 78 degrees or higher and to avoid using major appliances or charging electric vehicles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite avoiding rolling blackouts, Newsom and the state’s grid operator were hit with criticism from some Republican lawmakers and organizations who characterized the power situation as a failure of progressive policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA record-smashing heat wave that blanketed much of California this week is presenting a new challenge to Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) just as talk picks up about the possibility he could run for the White House in 2024. \n\n\n\nCalifornia and Newsom passed an initial test — keeping the lights and power on despite triple-digit temperatures covering much of the state that pushed the state's electrical grid to its limits. \n\n\n\nBut that didn't stop Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), another potential presidential contender who Newsom has used as a GOP foil this summer, fro taking a shot. \n\n\n\n“I hear a lot of people chirping about Florida from California. They’re so worried about Florida. They can’t even keep the power on in California, are you kidding me?” DeSantis said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublicans also hit Newsom on the state’s plan to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars by 2035. Noting the California Independent System’s plea for state residents to avoid charging electric cars at certain peak hours.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I kind of feel like they’re holding things together with bandaids right now. They just extended the Diable nuclear power plant as well. I think that was a common sense thing that they needed to do. So I think they’re trying to keep it all together, but it’s really a lot of misplaced investment over decades and over reliance on wind and solar, in particular, that’s kind of led to this situation,” Derrick Morgan, vice president of conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, told Changing America.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think it’s a cautionary tale that pursuing policies that are in the Green New Deal, or going along that continuum, can be a real danger,” Morgan added.\n\n\n\nNewsom in recent days has pushed back against his critics, arguing the state has never seen such extreme heat for such an extended period of time. \n\n\n\nHe said Wednesday the state will need to keep improving efforts to deal with climate change, but argued actions the state has taken in the last two years, including increasing battery storage and extending lifetimes of backup generators, is what kept the power on.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Had we not done what we’ve done in the last two years we would have had rolling blackouts over the last week,” Newsom said Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week's near crisis highlighted California’s delicate balancing act of phasing out fossil fuels while keeping the grid reliably functioning in the face of extreme weather events that demand more power.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state saw temperature records broken in cities stretching from the Bay Area to south of Los Angeles. Sacramento hit 116 degrees Fahrenheit Tuesday, breaking the previous all-time record high of 114 set in 1925.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state only narrowly averted ordering rolling blackouts Tuesday, a method involving cutting power to some areas to save energy for others, during the most intense phase of the heat wave as Californians heeded call sto cut back on power use. The state was also forced to activate generators fueled by natural gas. ISO reported statewide power demand hit 52,061 megawatts, a record for California.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCalifornia has taken some of the most aggressive actions in the country to cut out its reliance on fossil fuels and ramp up the use of renewable energy such as wind and solar. Those steps, to a degree, have elevated Newsom on the political stage as Democrats look for political leaders on climate change. \n\n\n\nBut the problems are also fodder for Republicans to use to tarnish Newsom and his policies. \n\n\n\nCalifornia Assembly Republican Leader James Gallagher said the risk of rolling blackouts is a result of failed Democratic policies and said the state was “lucky” to get through Tuesday without ordered blackouts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state has laid out plans to get all of its power from renewable sources by 2045, an ambitious goal as electricity demand is expected to increase and heat waves are forecast to hit with more frequency and intensity. Utilities are working to scale up renewable energy sources as well as battery storage for use when the sun is down.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to ISO CEO and President Elliot Mainzer, California put nearly 8,000 megawatts of clean energy resources on the grid in the last two years, including more than 3,300 megawatts of lithium-ion batteries.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMichael Colvin, director of the California Energy Program at the Environmental Defense Fund, credited California’s fleet of battery storage with helping to avert blackouts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There are two reasons in particular why we were able to avoid rolling blackouts, because it got very close. The first one was that California customers themselves showed up,” Colvin said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The second hero of the story in my opinion is what I would call virtual power plants, or the battery storage facilities.”\n\n\n\nIt's far from clear Newsom will run for president — especially since President Biden is still planning to do so. \n\n\n\nBut Biden's age — he would turn 81 weeks after election day in 2024 — and his low approval ratings have raised questions about whether he'd change his mind. If Biden opts out, it's likely to lead to a wide-open race that would almost certainly include Vice President Kamala Harris, another Californian.\n\n\n\nNewsom drew attention over the summer when he ran a television ad in Florida that urged state residents to come to California. \n\n\n\n“Freedom, it’s under attack in your state. Republican leaders, they’re banning books, making it harder to vote, restricting speech in classrooms, even criminalizing women and doctors,” Newsom said in the ad, which carried images of both DeSantis and former President Trump. \n\n\n\n“I urge all of you living in Florida to join the fight. Or join us in California, where we still believe in freedom — freedom of speech, freedom to choose, freedom from hate and the freedom to love.” \n\n\n\nNewsom's office did not respond to a request for comment for this story.\n\n\n\nColvin, who focuses on strategies to transition California to clean energy, said the recent heat wave is unusual as it impacted the majority of the state for a prolonged period of time. He says there’s typically more flexibility during heat waves as power can be redirected for air conditioning to different regions that need it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“California knows how to handle a hot day. We have plenty of power to be able to do that. But just like people, the electric grid itself needs to cool off, you end up running into operational problems and failures if you have multiple hot days in a row with no sort of night time relief to try and cool some things off,” he added.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Queen Elizabeth II’s funeral will be held at Westminster Abbey on Sept. 19, after members of the public are given an opportunity to pay their respects as she lies in state in Edinburgh and London, the royal family announced Saturday. \n\n\n\nBuckingham Palace said in a statement that the queen’s coffin is at her summer residence, Balmoral Castle, in Scotland, where she died on Thursday at the age of 96. The coffin will travel to Edinburgh on Sunday to lie in the Palace of Holyroodhouse, the British monarch’s official residence in Scotland.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA procession will form on the forecourt of the palace on Monday to escort the coffin to St. Giles’ Cathedral. King Charles III and the royal family will take part in the procession and then attend a service to receive the coffin.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe queen’s coffin will lie in the cathedral until Tuesday, allowing the people of Scotland to come and pay their respects to her.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Royal Air Force aircraft will fly the coffin from Edinburgh Airport to RAF Northolt, a Royal Air Force station in west London, on Tuesday afternoon. The coffin will then be taken to Buckingham Palace.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA procession will take it from the palace to the Palace of Westminster, where the houses of Parliament meet, on Wednesday. The archbishop of Canterbury will conduct a short service as the coffin reaches Westminster, which the king and members of the royal family will also attend.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe queen will lie in state there, allowing the public the visit, for four days until the state funeral. The coffin will be taken from the Palace of Westminster to Westminster Abbey on the morning of the funeral.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter the funeral concludes, the coffin will travel in a procession from Westminster Abbey to Wellington Arch to Windsor Castle. It will then travel to St. George’s Chapel within the castle for a committal service. \n\n\n\nThe plan for the steps to take following the queen’s death, known as Operation London Bridge, has been in place for decades. Buckingham Palace is putting into effect an alternative known as Operation Unicorn, the contingency plan for London Bridge in the event that the queen died in Scotland instead of England.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Biden has confirmed that he plans to attend the queen’s funeral.",

        "description": "For a century, Americans have seen&nbsp;yearly increases&nbsp;in life expectancy at birth; such that we have taken it for granted that every generation will live longer than the ones before. Yet, as the latest data in 2022 reveal, we are experiencing persistent&nbsp;decreases in life expectancy, reaching levels not seen since 1996.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 is partly to blame, with&nbsp;over 1 million&nbsp;COVID-related deaths having occurred over the past two years in the U.S. However, life expectancy at birth in the U.S. has been stagnating in the range of 78 years for over a decade. Furthermore, even during the pandemic years, more people have died from&nbsp;heart attacks and cancers&nbsp;than from COVID. It would, thus, be optimistic to assume that the newly recorded losses in survival are simply an aberration due to the unexpected arrival of a new and deadly infectious pathogen.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore starkly,&nbsp;since 2008, driven by increases in midlife mortality, and caused by several preventable conditions, all race/ethnic groups (although, starting in some groups first) have experienced decreasing life expectancy well before COVID. By contrast, the major decreases in life expectancy of the 20th century were preceded by, and followed by, major improvements in life expectancy. For example, life expectancy fell by almost 12 years&nbsp;in 1918, but increased by 14 years, to unprecedentedly high levels, the following year;&nbsp;similar recoveries&nbsp;were seen after decreases in life expectancy of about 2 years during both world wars.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA common misperception is that a decreasing life expectancy at birth is the result of older adults not living to even older ages. However, life expectancy at birth is not just about older adults. In fact, the largest contributing factor is the survival of children and young people; thus, when we observe decreasing life expectancy, it represents increasing premature mortality, a lot of which is preventable.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile vaccines are already preventing COVID-related mortality, there is no vaccine to prevent premature mortality associated with limited access to health care, policy failures to prevent gun deaths and maternal mortality, or social disparities that exacerbate cardio-metabolic and psychosocial conditions such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, overdose and suicides.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiology does not operate in a vacuum. The social and political contexts matter. Life expectancy varies by more than 20 years across counties in the United States, with the least healthy counties experiencing life expectancies comparable with some of the poorest countries globally. There is an almost eight- to nine-fold difference between the least and most healthy counties in the United States for life expectancy, cardiovascular mortality, diabetes incidence and the prevalence of opioid use, and much of this variation is explained by social, economic and local contextual factors.  \n\n\n\nCuriously, health spending accounts for nearly&nbsp;18 percent&nbsp;of the U.S. gross domestic product, almost&nbsp;two and a half times&nbsp;the average spent by peer Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) member countries; still, the United States figures&nbsp;among the lowest&nbsp;in numerous health indicators. This may be because, in social spending, the U.S. is&nbsp;among the lowest&nbsp;across OECD nations. Inadequate social spending limits equitable access to services that are needed for health, such as high-quality education, health care, public transportation and nutrition.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA major opportunity we have missed to promote improvements in life expectancy in the past decade is the narrow biomedical research focus on individual-level medicine alone, without adequate consideration of the powerful social determinants of health. For example, although the U.S. is preeminent in science and contributes to 50 percent of global spending on health research, the vast majority of health research investments target subcellular biology, bioinformatics and technology. While these investments advance knowledge, this focus also promotes expensive therapies with marginal benefits when pursued in isolation without an equal emphasis on research and solutions focused on the social, economic and political influences on health and local contexts.  \n\n\n\nThe United States is the only high-income nation to be experiencing a persistent decline in life expectancy for over a decade, now accelerated by the COVID pandemic. Confronting this adverse trend will require the acknowledgment of the systemic fault lines that favor narrow biomedical approaches over social determinants of health; prioritizing chronic noncommunicable diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, cancers and mental health and a new alignment of approaches, priorities and investments to address the complex role of biological and societal factors on health in a balanced manner.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nK.M.

        "description": "You may very well be familiar with Google&#8217;s magic eraser tool that made its entrance with Photos and the Pixel line of devices, but did you know that the technology is not exclusive to the search giant? That&#8217;s right, others have created the same tools both before and after Google in an effort to push AI forward and provide users with a way to magically remove unwanted objects from photos.\n\n\n\nToday, I happened upon a website aptly named &#8220;Magiceraser.io&#8220;, and after giving it a shot, I realized that it was quite good compared to others I&#8217;ve tinkered with in the past. I should also mention that this is in no way sponsored, and I just Googled for magic eraser tools and liked what I found. I first stumbled across this article by MakeUseOf, which covered five alternatives to Google&#8217;s own Magic Eraser feature, and didn&#8217;t like most of the tools found within.\n\n\n\nThings like Snapseed &#8211; Google&#8217;s own Android app for photo editing &#8211; were fantastic, but others such as TouchRetouch and &#8220;Cleanup.pictures&#8221; that were covered tended to leave an ugly shadow on the table after the fruits and vegetables were erased (this is the example the author gave).\n\n\n\nWith Magiceraser.io, I didn&#8217;t have that problem nearly as much, giving me the sense that it&#8217;s a lot more like the eraser found on the Pixel than I had initially thought. It&#8217;s by no means perfect, but if you take a look at the video below, you&#8217;ll see that it took out these Pixel Buds and the red YouTube journal with no problems, all while mostly preserving the edge of the Chromebook and the wood grain texture.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, something like Lightroom for Android would obviously be more ideal for these types of edits, but for a quick, on-the-fly item removal if you can&#8217;t be bothered to install an app for infrequent use cases, visiting a website or &#8220;web application&#8221; makes things easier.\n\n\n\nIf you do decide to try it out, I would highly recommend you toss it into your Chromebook&#8217;s app launcher by turning it into an icon with just a few clicks. This way, it&#8217;s immediately accessible, and you can even pin it to your device shelf if you&#8217;d like!\n\n\n\nMagiceraser.io requires no signup and is completely free to use for basic edits, but for some reason, it limits your ability to edit in high resolution unless you cough up $9.99 USD per month. For me, it makes absolutely no sense to pay a monthly subscription fee for something so trivial and novel unless you find yourself using it a ton. In such instances, you&#8217;d probably opt for something more official, branded, and powerful. I guess everyone and their mom has to have a subscription nowadays though, and the world is bent on drowning you in subscriptions, so I&#8217;m not surprised. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorse still, they have an annual charge, meaning that while you spend $7.99 USD per month instead if you pay it all up front, it will cost you $95.98 per year to remove things from images! This just makes me question how out of touch with the consumer and their pockets many developers truly are. Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, but no one in their right mind would spend that much on such a tool unless their job depended on it, which &#8211; again, brings us back to the fact that such a person would just pay for something else with more functionality.\n\n\n\nStill, this tool is really good at what it does, and it&#8217;s at least worth playing around with, so stick to the free tier. Just drag and drop an image into the homepage, or click the upload box to add your own image. Oh, and the company &#8211; &#8220;aarzoo, Inc.&#8221; also has a BackgroundEraser.io website that lets you quickly cut out images from their backgrounds too, saving you the step of opening up a more established tool. It does a nice job at feathering the image in a realistic way, and you can slap a new color background behind the image once you&#8217;re done. Let me know in the comments if you have other magic eraser tools you&#8217;d like for me to cover or explore, as I love spending time discovering new web apps to cover.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Dave Nelson-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Vinnie’s back, baby! Vinnie Pasquantino came back from the injured list last night and all he did was pick up right where he left off with another double. He slots back into the lineup again this afternoon as the cleanup hitter. Here’s hoping he can hold that position for years to come.\nIn other lineup analysis, Hunter Dozier gets his second game off in three days. Hunter hasn’t hit a home run since July 31st and has an abysmal 21 wRC+ over that time period. He has one hit in the month of September. That’s the only time he’s reached base in his last 28 plate appearances. He’s pretty much become Omar Infante but slower and worse at defense.\nSomeone getting the day off that’s a little more disappointing is Nate Eaton. I know he slumped for a while, but even including that period he’s got the fourth-highest wRC+ among players with at least 10 plate appearances since his first true promotion on August 8. He’s been better than MJ Melendez, Michael A. Taylor, and even Bobby Witt Jr. who has quietly been slumping for the past month. Not to rag on the guy, but Hunter Dozier has been worth -0.9 fWAR over that same period thanks to his own, much louder slump.\nJonathan Heasley will take the mound for KC, today for his second straight Saturday start. It is also his second straight start against the Tigers. He’s probably going to need to hit his spots better this time if he doesn’t want to endure a repeat of last night’s performance. Last week he pitched seven innings and allowed only two runs which sounds good, but his Game Score was a mere 51 because he was constantly pitching around baserunners and not getting any strikeouts. That’s what we call a lucky day. It would be silly to look for the same luck to happen in back-to-back starts against the same opponent.\nLineups\n\n\nHere's how we will take the field behind Jonathan Heasley as we look to even the series with the Tigers.REMINDER: First pitch for today's game has been moved to 3:10 p.m. CT.#TogetherRoyal pic.twitter.com/lXnoWN8it4— Kansas City Royals (@Royals) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nGoing for the series win at 4:10 ET. pic.twitter.com/SNm1ZQiabQ— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 10, 2022",

        "description": "Sen. Ted. Cruz (R-TX) told the Washington Examiner that it’s “idiotic” for Republicans to pretend Donald Trump is irrelevant when making plans for a 2024 presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nSaid Cruz: “There are a lot of candidates out there feeling their oats and boasting, ‘I’m running no matter what. I don’t care what Donald Trump says.’ Anyone who says that is lying. That’s an idiotic statement for someone to make who’s actually thinking about running.”\n\n\n\nHe added: “The whole world will change depending on what Donald Trump decides. That’s true for every candidate. That’s true of every potential candidate.”",

Biden is scheduled to attend the keystone event celebrating Hispanic Heritage Month in Washington, The Hill has learned.\n\n\n\nOrganized by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus Institute (CHCI), the Annual Awards Gala hosts a who's who of Latinos in politics, culture and advocacy.\n\n\n\nBiden's attendance at the 45th annual gala is the first by a president since former President Obama delivered an address at the 39th edition in 2016.\n\n\n\n\"It's an example of the commitment of our nation's highest ranking leaders to our community and desire to engage with us directly – to speak to us, to hear from us, to learn about our needs and desires,\" said Marco Davis, the CEO of CHCI.\n\n\n\nFrom 1979 to 2016, every sitting president was invited to address the gala, and only former President George H.W. Bush was unable to attend during his time in office.\n\n\n\nBut in 2017, CHCI broke with tradition and didn't invite former President Trump after he pardoned Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio and announced a plan to wind down the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program.\n\n\n\nCHCI's main function is to train young Hispanics who want to work in government, and its intern classes usually include a number of DACA beneficiaries.\n\n\n\n“The president was not invited this year based on his slanderous comments and strongly disagreeable actions for the Latino community in the United States,” then-CHCI Chair Rep. Joaquin Castro (D-Texas) said at the time.\n\n\n\nTrump also did not attend or address the following galas, and the coronavirus pandemic forced CHCI to take the event online in 2020 and 2021.\n\n\n\nBiden participated twice as a keynote speaker in the virtual editions, sending video messages as the Democratic presidential nominee in 2020, and as president for the 2021 gala.\n\n\n\n\"When we were virtual it was definitely a very different experience. I will say that the president did send a video message that we were able to air when we were virtual last fall, so technically he participated … but him being [there] in person is a very different thing,\" said Davis.\n\n\n\nThe gala's return is a boon for Beltway Hispanics, who sometimes refer to the event as \"Latino Prom\" or \"Brown Prom,\" in reference to the White House correspondents' dinner tongue-in-cheek moniker of \"Nerd Prom.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlthough CHCI and its parent institution, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, are nonpartisan, both groups are more closely associated with Democrats.\n\n\n\nStill, the CHCI gala has historically brought together Democratic, Republican and unaffiliated Hispanics with an interest in political leadership.\n\n\n\nThe 2022 event will posthumously honor Celia Cruz, the famed Cuban American singer, with the 2022 Medallion of Excellence Award. Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra will receive the 2022 American Dream Medallion Award.\n\n\n\nAlso receiving awards will be retiring Reps. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-Calif.) and Albio Sires (D-N.J.), Associate Judge of the Superior Court of the District of Columbia Kenia Seoane López, and Marvin Figueroa, a CHCI alumnus who heads the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office of Intergovernmental and External Affairs.\n\n\n\nHispanic Heritage Month kicks off on Sept. 15, Mexican Independence Day, and runs through Oct. 15.",

        "description": "Peggy — a patient of Dr. Kahn — requires an oxygen concentrator, ventilator, and nebulizer in her home, critically important medical equipment. For people like Peggy who rely on specialized medical equipment for life support, having utility service disconnected can be life-threatening. While she struggles to make ends meet, her utility bill is always the highest priority. Living without oxygen or a ventilator is simply not an option.\n\n\n\nEvery year, millions of households are disconnected from utility service because they are unable to afford their monthly bills. Although utility shutoffs can be harmful for any household, they are especially dangerous for medically vulnerable individuals like Peggy. In some cases, disconnections due to bill non-payment have led to serious injury or death.\n\n\n\nTo avoid such tragic outcomes, most states offer some sort of protection against shutoffs for medically vulnerable individuals. However, a recent 50-state survey by the National Consumer Law Center (NCLC) found that “many of the existing state laws and regulations are overly narrow, create protections that are difficult to access and not widely known, or provide for an overly short period of protection.”\n\n\n\nRecently disclosed data on Michigan’s medical protection programs provides a rare look into some of the challenges with existing programs. Michigan provides two types of protections for medically vulnerable people. So-called “critical care customers” — those who rely on life-supporting medical equipment and for whom loss of service would be “immediately life-threatening” — can apply for protection from utility shutoffs on an annual basis. Those who don’t meet the critical care criteria can still apply for a “medical emergency” exemption if they have a condition that would be aggravated by loss of service. This exemption lasts for a mere 21 days, however, and each person may receive protection only 3 times each year.\n\n\n\nFor both programs, the applicant must produce a signed certification from a health care professional. However, the decision whether to approve the application is ultimately made by the utility company. Moreover, key terms such as “immediately life threatening” are not defined, opening the possibility that utilities could interpret the rules restrictively.\n\n\n\nIn July, a working group run by Michigan’s utility regulator released data on implementation of the programs — and the numbers are alarming. DTE, an electric and gas company serving around 2.3 million customers in the Detroit area, rejected close to 70 percent of applications for the medical emergency program between 2019 and 2021. Consumers Energy, which serves around 6.7 million customers in the state, rejected around 1 in 3 applications over the same period.\n\n\n\nDenial rates for the critical care program were more evenly matched but still troublingly high, with both companies rejecting around 35 percent of people seeking protection in 2021.\n\n\n\nWhile it is not clear from the data why so many people in Michigan are being denied protection, it is ultimately beside the point. When decisions regarding medical protections are made by entities other than a health care provider with the best interest of the patient in mind, unnecessary suffering can result.\n\n\n\nCommon-sense reforms can significantly improve medical protection programs like those in Michigan, saving lives. First and foremost, medical professionals should be solely responsible for determining whether a person’s condition puts them at risk from a shutoff. In other words, a medical professional’s certification that a person meets the criteria should be dispositive.\n\n\n\nIf a dispute does arise, the utility should be required to formally contest the application before the utility regulator. If the company substantially challenges the customer’s physician, it should be required to present testimony from an independent third-party medical expert. This approach would shift the burden to the utility to justify denials, easing the pressure on the person experiencing medical difficulties.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOther best practices identified in the NCLC report can further improve these programs. For example, application forms should be short, easy to understand and fill out, and available in multiple languages. More and higher-quality data reporting, ideally by zip code, is also critical to understand what is happening and why.\n\n\n\nRegulators and utilities could also explore ways to automate enrollment — for example, by coordinating with health care providers to provide automatic protection to patients that receive life-supporting medical equipment.\n\n\n\nIn addition, utilities and regulators should consider ways to address any debt that accumulates while people are enrolled. Although medical protection programs eliminate the immediate threat of a shutoff, monthly charges continue to accrue during the protection period. If the household falls behind on payments, debt can accumulate to unmanageable levels. That problem requires other solutions, like offering discounted energy rates for customers with home medical equipment or providing pathways out of debt through debt write-off programs.\n\n\n\nFor medically vulnerable individuals like Peggy, continuous access to utility service can be a matter of life and death. With the increasing complexity of medical equipment and the movement to shift healthcare to a home setting, we anticipate that the need for medical protections will grow significantly over time. Ensuring continuous access to utility service in these circumstances is not only a matter of sound public health but also basic human rights.\n\n\n\nSam Whillans is the co-director of the Yale Environmental Protection Clinic at Yale Law School and a fellow at the Natural Resources Defense Council.

        "description": "Tanner Morgan passed for 287 yards and a score over 2½ quarters and had one of Minnesota&#x27;s seven rushing touchdowns in a 62-10 victory over Western Illinois on Saturday.Mohamed Ibrahim (23 carries for 130 yards) and Trey Potts (10 carries for 79 yards) kept their comeback from injuries going strong with two scores apiece on the ground for the Gophers (2-0), whose 679 total yards were the third most in program history.Morgan went 14 for 18 passing without a turnover before yielding to backups Athan Kaliakmanis and Cole Kramer for the bulk of the second half. The Gophers posted their highest score in head coach P.J. Fleck&#x27;s six seasons and their most since a 63-26 victory over Indiana in 2006.Goldy Gopher&#x27;s customary commitment to one pushup per point became quite the struggle after the final touchdown, a 30-yard run by reserve Preston Jelen for his first career score. The furry mascot&#x27;s costume-covered arms barely squeezed out the last couple of repetitions while the students who remained in the stadium at that point boisterously cheered him on.Morgan had his most passing yards since the late-season loss to Wisconsin in 2019. He hit fellow sixth-year standout Chris Autman-Bell five times for 118 yards and tight end Brevyn Spann-Ford for a 45-yard touchdown while crisply spreading the ball all over the field on deep posts, quick outs and of course his trademark slants.After a quick kick by Western Illinois quarterback Nick Davenport that produced a 64-yard punt in the second quarter, Morgan went 3 for 3 for 88 yards — all to Autman-Bell — on a 96-yard scoring drive that made it 28-3.Davenport&#x27;s 33-yard pass to Naseim Brantley for the Leathernecks (0-2) with 4:26 left marked the first touchdown given up by the Gophers this year. They beat New Mexico State 38-0 last week.The Gophers gave the Leathernecks a golden opportunity to stay close for a little bit. Michael Brown-Stephens lost a fumble after a short reception on the second snap of the game, when the ball was forced out by nose tackle Tre Henry and recovered at the Minnesota 45.Western Illinois failed to move the chains, though, and Ogala’s swing pass to Jafar Armstrong on fourth and 3 was smothered by safety Jordan Howden for a 2-yard loss.Howden later had a diving interception among the highlights for Minnesota&#x27;s defense, which limited the Leathernecks to 35 yards on 19 rushing attempts.The Gophers, who beat Western Illinois 29-12 in 2013 in the only previous meeting, are 61-4 all-time against teams currently in the FCS. Their last such loss was to North Dakota State in 2011. Last week in Missouri Valley-Big Ten matchups, Iowa beat South Dakota State 7-3 and Wisconsin beat Illinois State 38-0.Up nextWestern Illinois plays Southern Utah next Saturday in its home opener and last non-conference game.Minnesota hosts Colorado next Saturday. The Gophers beat the Buffaloes 30-0 on the road last season and held them to 63 total yards on 45 plays.",

        "description": "Dennis Schneidler-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Believe it or not, the much-maligned Yankees offense had a big day. The Yankees’ offense came into today’s game carrying the most pressure it had all season long. A potential defeat would leave the Rays with the opportunity to tie the Yankees in the loss column with a win tomorrow to sweep, which would be disastrous to say the least. \nLuckily, the offense responded with its best performance in a while, smashing in Corey Kluber to make up for its failures against him in the other four matchups between the two this season. Aaron Judge came up to bat twice in the first inning, and by the end of the frame, the Yankees needed only to not screw everything up in order to come out victorious in this one, as they put up a crooked number (six runs) to open it all up.\nOften in sports, narratives are almost predetermined — baseball is no stranger to this trend. One can easily guess what will be said about a certain occurrence, and how it will be treated. The franchise icon who returns to his hometown and struggles? Well, maybe the moment was too big for him. The rookie who goes on a tear in October ? He is playing without fear, and maybe not even the proper perspective of the size of that moment.\nThe actual reasons behind these events often remain a mystery. It’s simply easier to go with the narrative that’s being pushed for various reasons because it fits, it’s neat, and it may be true very well. To wit, a current backend starter had dominated the Yankees to a degree in 2022 that didn’t match his current skill set, nor his overall performance on the season.\nKluber is a two-time Cy Young award winner, and one of the best pitchers to put on the Cleveland uniform, but as of today in 2022 and for awhile now, he’s been far from the talent he was at his prime. The three-time All-Star is by all accounts a backend starter who will eat up innings with moderate success, and a fine one at that.\nKluber came into this Saturday game with 25 extremely successful innings against the Yankees on the campaign. The veteran right-hander tossed a quality start in each of his four outings versus his former team and was coming off probably his best game of the season, when he tossed seven frames of two-hit ball, with no earned runs and no walks just last weekend — all against these very same Yankees back at Tropicana Field.\nA successful Kluber outing today would have ensured a continuation of the storyline that he owns the Yankees’ lineup, and despite their best efforts, that they can’t figure him out. A disastrous Kluber start would set the table for a recap emphasizing that the Yankees were due, as looking at his 2022 campaign, Kluber had clearly been pitching beyond his capabilities against his former team. Why or how it happened doesn’t really matter, and it’s tough to know. However, if Kluber’s previous four-start run against the Yankees represented a positive outlier for him, today’s outing went in the polar opposite.\nThe Yankees became the first team this season to start a game with not one, not three, not five, but seven consecutive hits. The last time this had happened with the Yanks was in September 1990. The team erupted and Kluber failed to escape the first inning.\n\nAmusingly, this rally exclusively involved singles, as Aaron Judge, Giancarlo Stanton, Gleyber Torres, Josh Donaldson, Oswaldo Cabrera, Miguel Andújar, and Isiah Kiner-Falefa played pepper with the Rays’ defense. Before an out was recorded, it was 4-0, and after Cabrera scored on a fielder’s choice, Judge’s second single of the frame became the knockout blow. It ended up being the shortest outing of Kluber’s terrific career.\nThis 6-0 start was an uncharacteristic path to runs, even for the successful parts of the Yankees’ 2022 season. To be fair, Donaldson barely missed a home run with a shot off the top of the wall that bounced back towards the field of play, and because both runners held up, it was ultimately only a single.\nDonaldson was dead-set on hitting one out though, and managed to do so in his next at-bat, putting the Yankees up 7-0 at the time:\n\nAs the cherry on top with a position player on the mound for Tampa, Stanton got back on the board with his first long ball since July 15th, a majestic fly that clanged off the left-field foul pole. Despite the drought, it was his 25th of the season and the 372nd of his career.\n\nOn the pitching side of things for New York, Jameson Taillon was in cruise control off to a big early lead. He finished his afternoon with 7.1 strong innings of three-run ball, striking out eight and allowing only a walk and six hits. With the focus on the offense, it was an unsung afternoon for the right-hander, but he did his job and gave Aaron Boone some length as well.\nThe league leader in home runs hasn’t hit one as of late, but Aaron Judge simply continues to do Aaron Judge things. No. 99 is the first Yankee since Mickey Mantle in 1957 to reach base safely at least three times per game, over a seven-game span.\nDon’t look now, but Judge is making a run at the triple crown, as he already has home runs and RBI locked up, and his average is at .307 at the end of today’s game, only 11 percentage points behind AL leader Xander Bogaerts, and fourth overall, trailing Luis Arraez (.313) and José Abreu (.308) as well.\nThe Yankees are back to 4.5 games ahead of the Rays with a magic number of 20. They’ll go for the series victory tomorrow, though because of Tuesday’s rainout messing their rotation up, they’ll have to use Domingo Germán on short rest with the bullpen (and perhaps Clarke Schmidt, who threw 45 pitches on Thursday) backing him up. First pitch will be at 1:35pm ET.\nBox Score",

        "description": "The Mets have placed Starling Marte on the 10-day injured list, with the placement backdated to September 6.  Marte&#8217;s IL stint opens a roster spot for prospect Mark Vientos, whose promotion was reported earlier today.\nMarte hasn&#8217;t played since Tuesday, when he suffered a partial, non-displaced fracture in his right middle finger after being hit by a pitch by Pirates righty Mitch Keller.  New York delayed in placing Marte on the IL in the hopes that he could recover enough to return to the lineup without an extended absence, but Marte still seemed very limited in terms of baseball activities.  Newsday&#8217;s Tim Healey wrote prior to Friday&#8217;s game, Marte only &#8220;participated lightly in pregame drills&#8221; without any throwing or swinging.\nThe veteran outfielder will now get a full week off to recuperate, though given the nature of the injury, it isn&#8217;t a given that Marte will spend only the minimum amount of time on the injured list.  The Mets surely don&#8217;t want to rush Marte back and risk further injury, which would then possibly put Marte&#8217;s availability for the playoffs in question.  While the Mets are in a tight race with the Braves for the NL East title, the Mets are basically a lock to reach the postseason as at least a wild card team, and Marte will be a big part of any push throughout October.\nThrough 505 plate appearances, Marte is hitting .292/.347/.468 with 16 homers.  This translates to a 134 wRC+, tying the career-best mark Marte posted just last season.  Marte was named to his second All-Star roster earlier this summer.  It has been an immediate impact for Marte in Queens, and the Mets&#8217; four-year, $78MM free agent deal with the outfielder back in November currently looks like one of the winter&#8217;s wisest investments.\nTyler Naquin has taken over in right field in Marte&#8217;s absence, and it seems likely that the left-handed hitting Naquin and the right-handed hitting Darin Ruf will work in a platoon until Marte is able to return.  The two trade deadline acquisitions have pronounced splits over their careers, and for 2022, Naquin is hitting .264/.329/.495 in 228 PA against righties, while Ruf has slashed .224/.329/.455 in 167 PA against southpaws.",

        "description": "Assassin’s Creed Mirage. | Image: Ubisoft\n    \n\n  After a string of leaks, Ubisoft has officially unveiled the next major Assassin’s Creed game. As expected, it’s called Mirage and will shift the time-traveling series to 9th-century Baghdad, where players will take on the role of a budding assassin named Basim. (Fans might remember that name from an appearance in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla; Mirage takes place two decades before that game.)\nNotably, Ubisoft says that the game will get back to the action-adventure roots of the series, which means that the RPG mechanics from more recent games will not be present. Mirage is expected to launch sometime in 2023. Also of note: in an inspired bit of casting, Shohreh Aghdashloo will be voicing the role of Basim’s assassination mentor.\nBut that’s...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "Jordan Lyles and Adley Rutschman will look to power the O’s to another win over the Sawx.  | Jessica Rapfogel-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The O’s will look to chalk up another win against Boston, as they try to hang on to any Wild Card hopes.  Jordan Lyles was supposed to get one of the starts in the doubleheader Monday against the Blue Jays. Due to an illness, that didn’t happen and the Orioles lost both games. Now, with the Birds’ Wild Card hopes seemingly hanging on by a thread, Lyles takes the mound against the Red Sox looking to make a difference. The last time Lyles got the start against Boston, the Orioles' offense exploded in an eventual 15-10 win. Since then the Orioles' offense hasn’t exactly been explosive, averaging just over 3.5 runs per game in the following 19 contests. These offensive woes mean Lyles will likely have to do better tonight than the 5.02 ERA he’s put up against Boston so far in 2022. The good news for Lyles (and O’s fans) is that he gets the start in Camden Yards with Adley Rutschman behind the plate. Lyles ERA on the season is more than two-runs lower at home and is also more than a run lower with Rutschman behind the plate instead of Robinson Chirinos. \nLyles’ opposing pitcher will be veteran Michale Wacha. The 10-year vet got the W his last time out at Camden Yards, going 5.2 innings allowing no runs and striking out four. Throughout that start, Wacha tested the patience of Orioles hitters, as they failed to stay back and drive the soft-throwing righties fastball, cutter, changeup combo. If O’s are to succeed against Wacha, it’ll likely come from Cedric Mullins and Rutschman at the top of the lineup. The two are far and away the best fastball hitters in this Baltimore lineup, while Rutschman has also excelled against cutters. \nThe Orioles haven’t swept a series against the Red Sox at Camden Yards since July of 2015. Any hope this team has of staying in the playoff race seems to hinge on their ability to sweep the Red Sox in this series. The last time Boston came to town, game 2 was where the Orioles lost their chance to sweep. Tonight they’ll look to right that wrong and keep some semblance of pressure on the Blue Jays. \nOrioles Lineup\n\nCedric Mullins (L) CF\nAdley Rutschman (S) C\nAnthony Santander (S) RF\nRyan Mountcastle (R) 1B\nJesús Aguilar (R) DH\nGUNNAR HENDERSON (L) 3B\nRamón Urías (R) 2B\nAustin Hays (R) LF\nJorge Mateo (R) SS\n\nRed Sox Lineup\n\nTommy Pham (R) LF\nAlex Verdugo (L) RF\nXander Bogaerts (R) SS\nRafael Devers (L) 3B\nTrevor Story (R) 2B\nJD Martinez (R) DH\nChristian Arroyo (R) 1B\nEnrique Hernández (R) CF\nKevin Plawecki (R) C",

        "description": "At a White House briefing two days ago, the administration announced this new site. It&#8217;s tailored to city-by-city information about the effects of climate change, and ways communities can prepare.My purpose today is to introduce two new maps that deserve attention.They&#8217;re different in their subjects, scale, approach, and ambition. But each highlights an augmented way of thinking&#8212;and feeling, and learning, and telling&#8212;about our world. Each applies technology in a way others can learn from and apply. And each is just interesting. 1. The sea turtles of Manasota Key.This past week my wife, Deb Fallows, and our Our Towns colleague Michelle Ellia published a &#8220;Story Map&#8221; about the work of members of the &#8220;Turtle Patrol&#8221; of Manasota Key, a 14-mile long scenic beach strip on the Gulf Coast of Florida south of Sarasota. You can read their post about the story map here, which contains links to the story map itself. Here is a screenshot of its opening view:Story mapping technology, developed by our longtime friends and partners at the digital mapping company Esri, is an innovative and lively approach to presenting stories on several levels at once.I am avoiding the better-known but jargony term &#8220;multi-media journalism,&#8221; but that&#8217;s essentially what we&#8217;re talking about. Story maps combine words, pictures, videos, sound, and of course geographic references to depict reality and shape understanding. I wrote a detailed article about story mapping several months ago, and I&#8217;ve long promoted the term &#8220;geo-journalism&#8221; for map-based story-telling. (For the record, Allen Carroll and members of his story mapping team at Esri have advised and supported us in developing these and other maps and in &#8220;geo-journalism&#8221; in general.)One of the easiest ways to grasp the story map approach is to look through this new turtle map by Deb and Michelle. You start at the top, scroll down, and see the sequences of images, words, maps, and ideas. Near its end it includes a 3-minute YouTube video by Robert Kraft of Florida, embedded below. I think that if you start through the story map you&#8217;ll keep going. I think you&#8217;ll want to see the whole YouTube video as well. Please give them a try. (You&#8217;ll notice a charming &#8220;hand of God&#8221; moment at time 1:45-1:55 of the video.)Share2. &#8216;Climate Mapping for Resilience and Adaptation&#8217;&#8212;a brand new public resource.During the summer I wrote about the debut of Heat.gov, a new federally run site that presents crucial information about rising temperatures. Through the map, you could see heat forecasts for this afternoon&#8212;and for 50 years from now. You could see how temperatures were changing on the continental and global scale, and how they were affecting your own community. Two days ago, at a virtual White House briefing, the Administration unveiled a much broader version of a similar approach (also using Esri technology). It has the less catchy if more technically descriptive name Climate Mapping for Resilience or Adaptation, or CMRA. &#8220;Camera, as we call it,&#8221; the head White House climate-policy advisor, David Hayes, said in the briefing. The session also included Richard Spinrad, the head of NOAA; Kate Gallego, mayor of Phoenix; and Daniella Levine Cava, mayor of Miami-Dade County. The easiest way to understand what the CMRA portal does is to prowl around on its site. I cannot recommend that highly enough, for reasons that I&#8217;ll summarize below&#8212;after two screen shots.First, for a real-time alert of inland flooding danger, here is the projected extreme-rainfall accumulation over the next 72 hours as I write. The darkest blue on the map indicates accumulations of more than 10 inches. The red areas indicate active flooding watches, warnings, or other advisories:And, for comparison, here is the current nationwide drought status:Give a gift subscriptionWhat makes this different.We&#8217;ve seen some maps like these before. Here are some things that make this new presentation significant:&#8212;Its sweep and comprehensiveness. Heat.gov was all about the effect of rising temperatures. This new climate portal replicates what, for instance, the National Weather Service has done with weather.gov, in combining in one place many aspects of climate-related changes.1&#8212;Its multiple time scales. You can use this map to see: What is happening right now. What very likely will happen in the coming week. What probably will happen in the coming decade. And what could happen, for better or worse, through the rest of this century, depending on &#8220;high-emission&#8221; or &#8220;low-emission&#8221; scenarios. For example, here are projections of temperature possibilities through the rest of the century for Dallas. The bar graph on the right shows deviations from baseline conditions in Dallas as of 1990.&#8212;Its multiple geographic scales. It starts with the big picture, globally and nationally, and then can focus in wherever you would like. You can get a version of that Dallas chart for any community or county or tribal area in the nation, for any of the climate-effect variables, for any time horizon in this century.&#8212;Its practical orientation. As the mayors and federal officials alike stressed at the briefing, the purpose of the portal is to help communities and states prepare. It depicts where climate effects overlap economic and racial disparities. It gives a sense of which changes are most urgent in which places. Also it catalogs federal programs or grants that might apply to local resilience projects. David Hayes put it this way at the start of the press conference.The administration has designed this climate mapping portal with a single goal in mind. Namely to give our nation's communities&#8230; the tools they need to: Number one, understand the climate impacts that are hitting them today. Number two, the likely climate impacts they will see in the coming decades. And number three, to help prepare their communities and make them more resilient in the face of these severe stresses.The information, Hayes pointed out, was not &#8220;organized by an alphabet soup of federal agencies&#8212;FEMA, HUD, EPA, NOAA, and the rest&#8212;but instead organized around the impacts themselves.&#8221;There are also case studies and tool kits from around the nation on how communities have worked toward resilience. Check out the site to see for yourself. From the Resiliency and Adaptation site, a guide to case studies on communities that are already taking steps to deal with climate risks.We all know from the news that &#8220;the government can&#8217;t do anything&#8221; and &#8220;every president fails, it&#8217;s just a matter of how and when.&#8221; But more people should know about projects like this. Seriously, spend time with this site &#8212; after you look at the turtle map.Think globally; act locally.That&#8217;s the explicit concluding message of the sea-turtle story map. It&#8217;s the implicit premise of this new site on mapping for Resiliency and Adaptation.

        "description": "Sixty-five years ago this month, Dwight Eisenhower gave a national address from the Oval Office about the need to stand up to the &#8220;demagogic extremists&#8221; and &#8220;disorderly mobs&#8221; that were resisting school integration in Little Rock. He took the risk of being &#8220;divisive.&#8221;.(Eisenhower Library photo.)It has now been six days since Joe Biden gave his speech on &#8220;The Continued Battle for the Soul of the Nation,&#8221; at Independence Hall in Philadelphia. The official White House text is here; the C-Span video is here. I&#8217;ve looked at them both again today. My purpose in looking back at the speech is to mention three point-in-time aspects of Biden&#8217;s performance in office that the speech helps illustrate.&#8212;The first is the striking, systematic difference between immediate press and political reaction to what Biden says and does, and later responses. In brief: Biden usually gets panned in the short term for moves that look better later on. &#8212;The second is about a divide in presidential rhetoric that applies to speeches like this one. In brief: presidents who have spoken this bluntly about national crises are usually (not always) later recognized and admired for it. &#8212;The third is about how presidents invoke history in their speeches, and why I personally prefer to hear about &#8220;arcs&#8221; rather than &#8220;inflection points.&#8221;Share1. The predictable cycle of Biden-reaction.Response to most of what Joe Biden has done since taking office has followed a predictable reaction-curve:&#8212;The first wave of response has been mainly skeptical, dismissive, critical, downcast about political effects. Biden unpopular; Dems in disarray. Examples below.  &#8212;Weeks or months later, many of those same &#8220;failures&#8221; and &#8220;missteps&#8221; have drifted out of regular news coverage, as their results have proven less catastrophic than foreseen, or as the administration has recalibrated and improved its policy, which is what administrations are supposed to do.I am not talking here about criticism from the  opposition, whether GOP officials or commentators on Fox. That&#8217;s two-party politics. I am talking mainly about the media&#8217;s role in creating a sense of ongoing governmental dysfunction, inability to cope, one more administration that has already failed even as it is getting underway. Much of  this is through immediate reactions that either are raised-eyebrow cynical, or reduce everything to &#8220;what does this mean for the midterms?&#8221;Here are some examples: Three months ago, runaway inflation and &#8220;prices at the pump&#8221; led every print or broadcast news outlet. Political analysts explained why rising price-per-gallon had an outsized psychological and political effect.Inflation is still a genuine economic worry, and the Fed&#8217;s response has had enormous effects. But gasoline prices have gone down every single day for nearly three months in a row. Somehow we&#8217;re no longer seeing photos of gas-station prices as background for news reports, nor hearing about those psychological and political effects.Almost every part of Biden&#8217;s legislative ambitions was pronounced &#8220;Dead, dead, dead&#8221; six months ago. Manchin; Sinema; McConnell; inflation; impending midterm disaster; Biden&#8217;s latest gaffe &#8212; if one of these obstacles didn&#8217;t stop the bills, the others would. Every TV analyst confirmed this. Now &#8230; things look different. The midterm elections were called as a Republican landslide six months ago. The Democrats were dispirited and despairing. Now, who knows. (One iron law of media is: The Story Has To Change. Perhaps this principle is breaking in Biden&#8217;s favor just now.) Biden&#8217;s comment soon after the Russian invasion of Ukraine that Vladimir Putin was &#8220;a war criminal&#8221; occasioned a week of press discussion about his verbal indiscipline and dangerous gaffes. But in  the conduct of the war and support for Ukraine it had no lasting effect. (Similarly: Biden&#8217;s comments about Taiwan.)Every year, under every U.S. president, we&#8217;ve seen stories about &#8220;crisis in the alliance,&#8221; within NATO or between the US and the EU. But those blocs are more aligned now (except for Brexit) than in decades. This has more to do with Vladimir Putin than with Joe Biden. But it has happened on Biden&#8217;s watch and with his supervision of U.S. policy. Perhaps I&#8217;ve missed them, but I haven&#8217;t seen many stories to that effect. The baby-formula crisis; the container-ship crisis; the &#8220;wrong address for free Covid tests&#8221; crisis; the \"economy feels bad\" crisis; most other crises&#8212;all of these and others are still problems, but most are different from when they dominated the news. (A more complicated example is below.1)  The point of such a list is not that Biden is a &#8220;success&#8221; as president. We don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s ahead. He&#8217;s less than halfway into one term. Rather it is that first-reaction, instant &#8220;take&#8221; press assessment has repeatedly erred in one direction. Try to think of a policy or decision for which Biden got better short-term coverage than he did after analysis had set in. I can&#8217;t think of any. On the contrary: most things Biden has tried or done look better, or less bad, a few weeks later than news coverage deemed possible at the time. How is this connected to the Philadelphia speech? The first-wave coverage was overwhelmingly negative&#8212;about whether the tone was &#8220;political,&#8221; and about the presence of the Marines near the flags in the background, and about &#8220;calling out&#8221; Donald Trump by name.After a while, reaction began shifting to what Biden actually said. Which brings us to &#8230; Give a gift subscription2. The role of presidential bluntness.Any student of rhetoric knows that presidents have at times been harshly direct, and at times benignly oblique, in talking about their political opponents.On one extreme of bluntness, we have Franklin Roosevelt, just before his landslide re-election in 1936, in a famed address at Madison Square Garden. His best-known line from the speech was that &#8220;enemies of peace&#8221; were &#8220;unanimous in their hate for me &#8212; and I welcome their hatred.&#8221; He went on:&#8220;I should like to have it said of my first Administration that in it the forces of selfishness and of lust for power met their match. &#8220;I should like to have it said of my second Administration that in it these forces met their master.&#8221;Seriously, this speech is an incredible stretch of rhetoric, well worth the time to hear or read. You won&#8217;t regret listening to it.In 1963 John F. Kennedy was less blunt but nonetheless clear in a national address about sending troops to enforce desegregation orders in Alabama:&#8220;Those who do nothing are inviting shame as well as violence. Those who act boldly are recognizing right as well as reality.&#8221; Six years earlier, in 1957, Dwight Eisenhower had been blunt in a national address about sending troops to enforce desegregation orders in Little Rock:&#8220;In that city, under the leadership of demagogic extremists, disorderly mobs have deliberately prevented the carrying out of proper orders from a Federal Court&#8230; &#8220;This morning the mob again gathered in front of the Central High School of Little Rock, obviously for the purpose of again preventing the carrying out of the Court&#8217;s order relating to the admission of Negro children to that school.&#8221;Presidents differ, circumstances differ, styles of speech differ. But I contend that the long historical view has been more favorable to leaders who dared speak bluntly about what they viewed as threats to American democratic values, than to those who hesitated or hedged.When Eisenhower hesitated.Here is an example on the &#8220;hesitation&#8221; side: What was Dwight Eisenhower&#8217;s worst moment as a national leader? I contend that it came in his time as a candidate and early in his first term, when the demagogue senator Joseph McCarthy, Republican from Wisconsin, was on his destructive rampage. As early as 1950, Margaret Chase Smith, a freshman Republican from Maine, had taken the Senate floor to give a speech known as the &#8220;Declaration of Conscience.&#8221; In it she warned that the Senate was being turned into &#8220;a forum of hate and character assassination.&#8221; In contemporary terms, you could think of Liz Cheney with her statements on the January 6 committee.And you can think of the silent-or-worse response to Cheney&#8217;s warnings, from her fellow current GOP legislators, as resembling the response to Margaret Chase Smith from most of her fellow Republicans &#8212; including candidate and then president Dwight Eisenhower. More than four years later, in December, 1954, the entire Senate was finally ready to turn on Joe McCarthy, with a resolution of censure. But Eisenhower was notable in keeping his distance from Smith and her &#8220;conscience&#8221; caucus.An excellent essay on the Miller Center&#8217;s &#8220;Age of Eisenhower&#8221; site explains that Eisenhower &#8220;despised&#8221; McCarthy privately&#8212;but kept those views mainly private until the end:Looking at all the evidence, the clearest conclusion is that Eisenhower did not want to confront Joe McCarthy at all. And during 1953, he tried to avoid the whole issue, hoping the Senate would silence the explosive senator. McCarthy was a Republican, after all, and many fellow senators supported him. Ike needed to keep his party unified to pass bills in other areas; battling McCarthy would only stir up a civil war inside the GOP.Again draw your contemporary comparisons. And &#8212; if you are a Republican Senator or other aspirant &#8212; recall that this chapter of the great Dwight Eisenhower&#8217;s life is the one that reflects most poorly on him.Dwight Eisenhower shaking hands with Joe McCarthy, at the Republican convention that made Eisenhower its nominee in 1952. Eisenhower was years behind fellow Republican Margaret Chase Smith in calling McCarthy out. Ike&#8217;s running mate, Richard Nixon, gives a side-eye from the right.  (Getty Images.)Share3. History as &#8216;arc,&#8217; versus history as &#8216;inflection point.&#8217;I&#8217;ll make this one quick. When a speaker wants to signal &#8220;I&#8217;m getting serious now,&#8221; two terms are readily at hand. One is &#8220;inflection point.&#8221; The other is &#8220;arc of the moral universe&#8221; (or sometimes &#8220;arc of history&#8221;), quoting Martin Luther King Jr., who was in turn quoting a 19th-century abolitionist and clergyman named Theodore Parker.Joe Biden has long favored &#8220;inflection point,&#8221; and he used it in this latest speech: &#8220;I believe America is at an inflection point &#8212; one of those moments that determine the shape of everything that&#8217;s to come after.&#8221;For myself&#8212;as a listener, as a writer, as a citizen&#8212;I&#8217;ve always preferred the arc idea. It reinforces the reality that history is re-determined every single day. (This is apart from whether that arc ultimately &#8220;bends toward justice,&#8221; which depends on your time horizon and which we&#8217;d like to believe is true.)Although Biden didn&#8217;t use the term arc, the final five minutes of his speech were all about the history, the justice, the democracy, and the future that his fellow citizens are creating now. Or should be.Tomorrow I&#8217;ll put up one of Substack&#8217;s &#8220;discussion threads&#8221; for elaboration by me, and by subscribers, on these and related points, as part of the expanded &#8220;backstage&#8221; policy I mentioned here. Thanks to all for reading, and for those who choose to join in for more.Subscribe now1The most complicated instance is Biden&#8217;s decision to withdraw from Afghanistan. I started making that part of the current post, and when it got too long I decided to save it for its own online discussion thread. For the moment I highly recommend the one-year-later collection of views about the withdrawal here. For the record, as I&#8217;ve written in the past and will explain further, I think Biden made the right choice. I wish Obama had made the choice earlier. The point for now is: agree or disagree, it was a far more complex, carefully considered, and less immediately political decision than press coverage indicated.",

        "description": "No, this is not Dean Wormer of Animal House. It&#8217;s a 1950s magazine photo captioned &#8220;University Student Doing Homework.&#8221; (Getty Images.) Labor Day is next week, so it is still summer in my book. My theory is that the school year at every level should start after Labor Day, not before. But I&#8217;ll leave that for another time.My topic today is higher education&#8212;what comes after K-12. This post will cover three themes. In each I&#8217;ll suggest a few articles worth reading, some of them brand new and some from the archives. Then I&#8217;ll offer the bigger point I think the articles underscore. Here we go:Share1. Why college rankings matter.It&#8217;s hard to beat the landmark piece on this topic, which came out 22 years ago today. It was by Nicholas Thompson, then a young editor at The Washington Monthly and as it happens now CEO of The Atlantic. The piece was called &#8220;Playing With Numbers,&#8221; and you can read it on The Monthly&#8217;s site. It stands up amazingly well.The one-sentence version of its argument, and of the later articles I&#8217;ll list below, is: What has been good for a particular business has been bad for an entire sector of society.-The business in this case is the college-ranking industry, which was pioneered by US News in the 1980s but has rapidly spread, including to areas like elementary schools and hospitals.-The sector of society is higher education and all affected by it. As I recently summed up the case in an Our Towns  post: The argument in favor of rankings&#8230; is that they would supposedly give students and parents &#8220;more information&#8221; about colleges to consider. In reality, they brought out the worst rather than the best in all participants in the college-admission process: students, families, admissions offices, institutions, the press.&#8212;For families and students, they added one more needless layer of anxiety to an already needlessly stressful process&#8230;&#8212;For institutions, they encouraged cooking-the-books tricks with numbers, to help themselves move a few notches up or down the charts&#8230; How do I know this? For two years I was the editor of US News, and among the reasons I lasted only two years was a showdown with the owner about cleaning up this system.Worse, especially in the early decades&#8230; they reinforced and rewarded pure privilege. Early rankings were based on endowment size, and alumni giving, and &#8220;reputation,&#8221; and other indicators of &#8220;having been born on third base&#8221; and starting out ahead.&#8212;For admissions offices, they encouraged ramping up the applicant pool&#8212;so that the school could reject a higher share of applicants, and therefore seem more &#8220;selective&#8221; and desirable.&#8212;For the press, they directed attention to something that doesn&#8217;t matter&#8212; whether centuries-old schools were supposedly moving &#8220;up&#8221; or &#8220;down&#8221; year by year&#8212;rather than realities of how they worked and whom they helped.You get the idea. But here is a further reading list on the problems and some solutions:The entire brand-new edition of The Washington Monthly&#8217;s college guide. Since 2005 The Monthly has taken its own pioneering step of assessing colleges not by what they have but on what they do for students, communities, and society.  The issue is chock-full of strong pieces.Kevin Carey&#8217;s introduction and overview to The Monthly&#8217;s approach to rankings. Another overview is here. The premise of The Monthly&#8217;s approach is that bad rankings are not going away. Therefore the main remedy is to offset and outnumber them with useful rankings.Paul Glastris&#8217;s back story of how The Monthly first got into the reform-the-rankings business.  Everything I&#8217;ve mentioned so far has been published just this week. Now, from the archives: I did a big Atlantic piece back in 2001 about the way the &#8220;early decision racket&#8221; for college admissions was driven by rankings. I did a related piece in this space last year. A few months ago Colin Diver, former president of Reed College, published a book called Breaking Ranks, about what rankings had done to higher ed and how educators could fight back. You can listen to an interesting podcast with him here. Higher Ed Dive had a recent piece summing up the controversy about Columbia University&#8217;s place in the rankings, and whether it was based on phony data.This list is a start. And here is the short version of the bigger message: a business opportunity has inflicted harm on higher education. Now higher ed is looking for ways to protect itself, and it can use help from the rest of us. The Thinker, 1950s-American college edition. (Getty Images.) Give a gift subscription 2. Why community colleges matter.In the brand-new Monthly college guide, Kevin Carey&#8217;s overview emphasizes why community colleges remain so essential for opening opportunity to Americans, and yet have been so badly battered by the stresses of the pandemic era. In her piece in the same issue called &#8220;Breaking the Cycle of Privilege,&#8221; Laura Colarusso explains how Bunker Hill Community College, in Boston, has devised some answers.Over the past decade, Deb and I have emphasized again and again the ways in which community colleges may be the essential higher-ed institutions for our times. Yes, of course, America&#8217;s great research universities are its crown jewels. Yes, its Land Grant network has been of crucial importance. Yes, its liberal arts schools are underpinnings of democracy and attractions to students from around the world. Yes, its HBCUs have an irreplaceable role in creating opportunity and sustaining culture and tradition. On down the list, yes yes yes. But at this moment, for the strains on this American society, community colleges may be the part of higher ed most in need of attention, concern, and support. I made that case just before the pandemic, after a visit to Michigan and then again after a visit to Ohio. Other pieces Deb and I have done on the theme are indexed here. And please see this site from our friends at Achieving the Dream.The bigger message from these articles: the part of our educational structure that is least-often discussed deserves first-tier notice and support.Share3. Why telling the full American story matters. Or, if a tree falls in the forest &#8230;.  The brand-new college issue of The Monthly has an article by Deb and one by me. Each is based on reporting from Muncie, Indiana, and the role that Ball State University has played there.Deb&#8217;s story is about the way the student-run paper, the century-old Ball State Daily News, has helped fill the gaps created by corporate ownership and contraction of the &#8220;normal&#8221; local press. (The Muncie Star-Press is Gannett-owned, with all that now implies.) My story is about how Ball State University as a whole has taken unprecedented steps to address a crisis in the Muncie Community Schools.I hope you&#8217;ll read each story at The Monthly&#8217;s site. But here is the additional reason I mention them: Three days ago, after our latest reporting through Ohio, I wrote about a range of important civic innovations that practically no one outside of the immediate vicinity had ever heard about. As I said in that piece, I think the barriers to conveying or comprehending positive news, beyond each community&#8217;s borders, have become a significant factor in America&#8217;s troubled public life. People in any one place that is making progress feel more isolated than they need to be, or should.Three years ago, after our first &#8220;look what&#8217;s happening in Muncie!&#8221; trip and report, I commented that news about the city was &#8220;unknown outside Indiana.&#8221; A reader wrote back to say: Outside Indiana? As he put it: &#8220;I live in Indianapolis, and consider myself well-informed, and I hadn&#8217;t heard or read about what&#8217;s going on in Muncie. This is a direct result of the death of local journalism.&#8221; The reality of the country is a balance of its crises and failures, which understandably are the center of national news, and its responses, which can slip from broader view. The danger is that they become trees falling unnoticed in the forest, rather than (to push the metaphor) sources of new growth.The Washington Monthly&#8217;s new issue will give you ideas about problems, but also about solutions. We&#8217;re glad to be part of it, and we hope you will read and learn from it too.Subscribe now",

        "description": "An 1898 print of Sandusky, looking northward. (Library of Congress.)This post is about the challenge of knowing one&#8217;s own country&#8212;a challenge that is almost an impossibility for a country as large, diverse, contradictory, and rapidly changing as the United States. The same of course applies in China, India, Indonesia, Brazil, &#8220;the Arab world,&#8221; and other places.But what Americans &#8220;know&#8221; about this moment for their country seems skewed in ways that are dangerous and destructive&#8212;yet potentially correctable. I hope you will bear this dispatch in mind the next time you hear a report on &#8220;a nation on the cusp of civil war,&#8221; or &#8220;Red and Blue America, with no common ground in between.&#8221;I&#8217;ll start by declaring my premises on three points. Then I&#8217;ll give a list of illustrations from the past seven days that my wife, Deb, and I recently spent in parts of America not usually covered in the news.ShareThree principles:Here are three points that guide what I write about America and the world.1. Keeping contradictory truths in mind.Through the years Deb and I were living in China, it would drive me crazy when experts would opine from afar on what was good or bad about the place. The certainty of their views and the sweep of their theories seemed directly connected to how little they&#8217;d seen of the country, except at some internationalized conference center in Beijing or Shanghai or Sanya.By contrast, most reporters on-scene tried constantly to portray how China was both better and worse than it seemed from afar. Both stronger and weaker, both more likable and more offputting, both more tender and more cruel. And that the main challenge in dealing with it was trying to keep these contradictions in mind. This is one of many reasons it&#8217;s bad for the world that Xi Jinping&#8217;s government is making it so hard for foreign reporters and foreigners in general to be inside China.This principle of contradictory realities does not apply just to China.2. The arc of loss and rebirth&#8212;and how a culture stays &#8216;young&#8217;Through the years I have lived in and studied American history, I&#8217;ve come to believe that the through-line in the nation&#8217;s story is constant loss, and constant creation. The loss and change are certain: Name your decade since the 1620s, and I can name the emergency or tragedy of its times. Name your American family, and its background will include hardship and dislocation. Name your community, and it will have gone through significant ups and downs. For instance: Bend, Oregon, now one of the country&#8217;s most desirable locations, had some of the worst unemployment in the country 30-plus years ago, when the logging and timber industries collapsed. At about the same time, the now-celebrated Greenville, South Carolina, had a textile-based economy. Nearly all of those mills have disappeared, but Greenville has adjusted and prospered.For arc-of-history purposes, the question is always how the creation in any given era balances against the destruction. Who is helped and hurt; how the gains offset the losses; who is able to recover; how to protect those who cannot. Change is a given; adjustment to change is the variable, and the one more within our control.The older people become, the more likely they are to mourn how things &#8220;used to be.&#8221; The younger they are, by the calendar or in spirit, the more likely they are to think about what comes next. When people say that America is a &#8220;young&#8221; country, this is what they mean. Despite having the oldest continuous form of government of any major country, and apart from immigration giving the U.S. a lower median age, what makes America young is an orientation ahead, rather than behind. 3. &#8216;The rest of the country is in trouble. In my town we are working things out.&#8217;Through the decade in which Deb and I have reported on the goods and bads of smaller-town American life, we&#8217;ve become convinced that national media&#8217;s focus on &#8220;heartland&#8221; America mainly as an arena for Red-vs-Blue political showdowns (&#8220;guy in a diner&#8221;) has a profoundly distorting effect. As someone wrote about this problem:An important part of the face of modern America has slipped from people&#8217;s view, in a way that makes a big and destructive difference in the country&#8217;s public and economic life. Despite the economic crises of the preceding decade and the social tensions of which every American is aware, most parts of the United States that we visited have been doing better, in most ways, than most Americans realize. Because many people don&#8217;t know that, they&#8217;re inclined to view any local problems as symptoms of wider disasters, and to dismiss local successes as fortunate anomalies. They feel even angrier about the country&#8217;s challenges than they should, and even more fatalistic about the prospects of dealing with them.As you&#8217;ve guessed, that someone is me, in the introduction to the book Our Towns. I wrote that four years ago; I am here to tell you that Deb and I believe this all the more strongly now than before the pandemic. Because virtually the only thing Americans know about the parts of the country where they don&#8217;t live is the non-stop crisis narrative of national media, they naturally think the country&#8217;s problems are even worse than they are. In the parts of life they experience directly, people can see the goods and bads in perspective, and recognize not just possibilities for progress but encouraging practical steps. It&#8217;s hard to realize that all across the country, people who are never in the news are innovating and progressing in similar ways.Give a gift subscriptionNow let&#8217;s make this specific.Over a seven-day period this month, Deb and I interviewed and met people in six smallish, and very small, towns and villages in northwest Ohio. This is where Deb grew up, on the shores of Lake Erie, and where she considers herself &#8220;from.&#8221; It&#8217;s also an area that, if it ever appears in the national news, is usually in the context of &#8220;despair and division in the heartland,&#8221; the latest Biden approval ratings, what the Vance-Ryan Senate race means for next year&#8217;s legislative agenda, and why Arizona and Nevada have become &#8220;swing states&#8221; but Ohio no longer is.All those things matter.But here are some of the other things that matter but are rarely if ever in the national news, and therefore are not part of general understanding of &#8220;how America is doing.&#8221; Each of these is a place marker for upcoming more detailed reports by Deb and me at the Our Towns site.&#8212;The Community Foundation. Findlay, Ohio, is the county seat of Hancock county, with a city population of more than 40,000. It&#8217;s the regional hub. Over the past three decades, the Findlay-Hancock County Community Foundation, headquartered there, has become a force in regional well-being whose effects can be compared to those of the great Gilded Age philanthropies in Pittsburgh.  (Mellon, Frick, Carnegie, Heinz, etc.) Everywhere we went in the area we saw the Community Foundation&#8217;s imprint. What it has done deserves study and emulation.As far as we can tell, this Community Foundation, which is transforming a region, has not been mentioned in mainstream national news.&#8212;Family Center. One of the Community Foundation&#8217;s projects in Findlay is the &#8220;Family Center,&#8221; in a former large grocery-store building on the north side of town. The insight behind this Center was the importance of combining a range of non-profit services&#8212;medical and dental clinics, housing and homelessness assistance, legal aid, a library, a food pantry and thrift shop, and more&#8212;all in one place. That way, as we heard, families for whom a $20 taxi ride was a decisive barrier could do all their business in one attractive and dignified place.We have not seen anything like this in other cities. It&#8217;s a story worth learning from. Again, as far as we can tell, it has not been featured in the national news. &#8212;Sandusky on all cylinders. Sandusky is the county seat of Erie County, on the lake, and has a population of just over 25,000.More is going on there, in more different areas and directions, than I can even suggest at the moment. I&#8217;ll give just two illustrations.First, we happened to be there at a moment when the national spotlight hit  Sandusky. At an event on the waterfront, a trans-partisan group got together to announce good news on the &#8220;infrastructure unites us all&#8221; front. Rob Portman, the outgoing Republican Senator from Ohio; Marcy Kaptur, the very Democratic Representative from the district; and Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend and now Secretary of Transportation, were on hand to celebrate Sandusky&#8217;s success in winning a competitive $25 million grant for local road, transit, and bike improvements. With (from left) Tom Horsman, city of Sandusky communications manager; Kha Bui, founder of CLAG; and Eric Wobser, city manager of Sandusky. (Photo by Deborah Fallows.)Second, one of the most impressive breweries-and-pubs you will find anyplace in America is in downtown Sandusky, founded by Kha Bui (above), who was born in Saigon, then left as a child on a boat into the South China Sea and spent several years in refugee camps. The brewery is called CLAG, and the adjoining restaurant/pub is called Small Cities. Each time we went near the place, it was packed. Kha Bui&#8217;s idea is to sell certain lines of his beer only at the taphouse and restaurant, so that people will have to come to Sandusky to get it. Again as far as we can tell, they have not been in the national news.&#8212;Sandusky, in perspective. When reporting from &#8220;they&#8217;ve already succeeded&#8221; towns, like Greenville or Bend or Burlington, Vermont, Deb and I often wondered what it would have been like to be there ten years earlier.I think it would be like being in Sandusky now. And this is not even to talk about the school system or the faith community. Or a new branch of Bowling Green State University. Or other aspects we will return to.ShareJon Hart (left) and Joe Wasson, two of the people involved in renewing downtown McComb, Ohio, population 1,600. (Photo by Deborah Fallows.)&#8212;Villages, challenging what you think about small-town Ohio. One of the Community Foundation&#8217;s many projects in Hancock County has been supporting smaller villages&#8217; enrollment in the Community Heart &amp; Soul&#174; process. (Heart &amp; Soul has been a partner and supporter of Our Towns reporting.) The three villages we visited&#8212;village is the technical term&#8212; that had been through this process were really small. Mount Blanchard&#8217;s population is around 500. Arlington&#8217;s, about 1,500. And McComb&#8217;s, about 1,600 &#8212; though it also is home to the largest cookie-and-cracker factory in the country. That will be a story of its own. Yet each of these communities, surrounded by corn and soybean farms, and with a population base smaller than an average city block in New York or Chicago, has engaged in a systematic civic-engagement process to help it identify what its residents most care about, and where it should invest its efforts.Mount Blanchard discovered and rehabilitated old ball-playing fields that had been left neglected. It has better park facilities than most places with 20 times its population. Arlington has attracted young people back to town, and has ambitious retail and restaurant investments. (For instance, Hurdwell.) And in McComb, we met fully 1% of the town&#8217;s total population &#8212; the equivalent of 7,000 people in our current home town of Washington DC &#8212; at a meeting to discuss already-approved plans to build more housing, and in-progress plans for a revived downtown. More on all of these to come. But in all of these tiny communities, we saw counter-examples to the idea that Americans no longer engage with their neighbors.&#8212;Vermilion, which is Deb&#8217;s homeland, has deliberately made the most of its assets, which are a lakeside setting and still-extant traditional architecture. Its streets, shops, and restaurants were jammed when we visited two days ago.&#8216;To arrive where we started.&#8217; Deb Fallows, of Vermilion, in her home town.We didn&#8217;t ask any of these people in any of these places for their views of national politics. But in all of them, from the larger cities to the smallest settlements, people younger and older, Black and white, volunteered their optimism about prospects for their communities. In one of them, a civic leader took us through all the &#8220;used to be&#8221; sites &#8212; the gas station, the grocery store, the hardware store. &#8220;They&#8217;re all gone,&#8221; he said. &#8220;But I know that towns like this are coming back.&#8221; Is this the full American story of these days? Of course not, and no one knows where these village-by-village ambitions will lead. But it is part of the story, And part that is too often left out.Subscribe now",

        "description": "What a summer downpour in the mountains looks like, from 6,000 feet up and several miles away. Over the Appalachians in West Virginia, August 21, 2022. (All photos by Deborah Fallows.)Inside the Sky was the title of my friend William Langewiesche&#8217;s collection of elegant essays about flying, published nearly 25 years ago. I&#8217;m borrowing it in this post, which has two related purposes. One is to offer another instance of a recurring theme: the quiet, disciplined competence of the women and men who coordinate the flow of air traffic through the skies. (Previously on this theme, here and here.) The other is to give some illustrations of how different the view of landscapes and weather is from a few thousand feet up, versus the view from the ground.Subscribe now&#8216;We&#8217;ll keep an eye out for you.&#8217;I&#8217;ll save for another time, not too long from now, what I&#8217;ve learned about the flying world in 25 years of involvement. Much of it involves risk-management and safety. Everyone (sensible) who has ever flown an aircraft thinks about safety all the time. And much of that thought, as in the dispatch today, involves weather, which is the great divider between safe and unsafe flights.Also for upcoming discussion: Half the entrepreneurial energy in aviation these days is aimed toward reducing its environmental damage. Even more is needed. More on this ahead too.For now, an illustrated guide to our most recent &#8220;working&#8221; flight. This past weekend, my wife, Deb, and I traveled from the DC area to northwest Ohio, for small-town reporting here.I&#8217;ll start with a FlightAware track of this trip, which illustrates my point about air-traffic controllers.The thin green line on the map is the path we took from Gaithersburg (GAI), in the DC area, across the Maryland panhandle, then West Virginia, and finally Ohio, to a landing at Findlay airport (FDY).One great FightAware feature is overlaying weather radar on aircraft flight tracks. But their weather-radar depiction raises fascinating point-in-time questions.The flight as a whole took nearly two and a half hours. But the weather image is from one moment in that period&#8212;a moment late in the fight, perhaps just after we&#8217;d landed. Here&#8217;s one reason I think that: The huge area of bad weather shown over central Pennsylvania in this image, far north of DC, was in reality slightly north of the DC area when we took off. We had been waiting it out on the ground. (Aviation people: I was waiting for the ceiling at GAI to be higher than 1000 feet before taking off. It was &#8220;Broken 1,700&#8221; at takeoff time.)And the ominous red-and-yellow storms that seem to cross the plane&#8217;s path in northern Ohio, shown by the yellow arrow, were in reality farther west and south, allowing us more clearance, when we flew by.Still, the image conveys the main point. There was weather to be aware of and avoid.ShareWhat else we saw from the sky.Here are some further points to notice:Seeing a downpour, from cloud level. Please look for the red arrow on the FlightAware map. It is pointing toward a very small, circular red area, meaning heavy rain, at the West Virginia / Pennsylvania border. The picture at the top of this post shows that same downpour, as we passed it off our right wing, in smooth air several miles away.Amid the clouds, but not in them. The whole trip was under &#8220;instrument flight rules,&#8221; which means controllers were telling us which way to head, and when to climb or descend. But only about half of it was in &#8220;actual&#8221; instrument conditions&#8212;meaning that you&#8217;re inside the clouds, and can&#8217;t see anything except gray. For me and I think most people, being inside the clouds is no fun. Often it&#8217;s turbulent; always it requires extra concentration. Therefore, like many other pilots I was hearing on the air-traffic control frequency, I spent much of the flight asking the controllers for deviations right and left to stay out of the the clouds as much as I could. That&#8217;s shown in the jerky path on FlightAware. Here is how it looked from Deb&#8217;s seat in the plane, along the Maryland panhandle over West Virginia, to be amid the clouds but not actually in one:Flying in the rain, but away from the storms. Please notice on the FlightAware chart the broad green-colored areas in Ohio, one between Columbus and Akron, and another between Toledo and Cleveland. Green means &#8220;normal&#8221; rain, not a thunderstorm. While flying through these areas at 4,000 feet we were inside the clouds&#8212;solid gray outside the windows, rain falling on wings and windshield&#8212;but were rarely in turbulence. The sweeping paths of the flight through the green zones reflected the successive &#8220;vectors&#8221; from air traffic controllers designed to keep us away from the serious weather, shown in red and (uh-oh) magenta, but working toward the destination.  We were relying on controllers for right/left adjustments through this period, and they were aware of that. &#8220;I&#8217;ll keep an eye out for you,&#8221; one said as we were near the point shown by the tip of the yellow arrow. And she did. (Again, in real time the bad weather was farther away than it looks, and the clearance margins greater.) On the basis of Pushing Tin or even Airplane! people may have the idea of air traffic controllers being in constant hair-on-fire emergencies. Of course they do handle crises, but to me their routine unflappability is their most notable and admirable trait.Coming out the other side. About 25 miles from our destination, which is close enough that you&#8217;re well into the checklist to land, we suddenly left the clouds behind us. Before us we saw this, looking westward and away from the storms: And a few minutes later, on the ground and looking east toward the stormy sky we had traversed:At the Findlay airport.If the weather had been worse around Washington, we wouldn&#8217;t have taken off. If it had not cleared around Findlay, we would have landed somewhere else. If we&#8217;d needed to divert at any point along the way, we were prepared to do that. We&#8217;ve spent nights in unexpected locations more times than we can count. In small-plane aviation, it is crucial that you never &#8220;have&#8221; to get somewhere.But this is what it looked like, inside the sky, on one trip in which we ended up where we intended.Subscribe now",

        "description": "Samuel Johnson, not a blockhead. (Getty Images.)I&#8217;ll explain this item&#8217;s title and image in a minute. But first, a look back and a look ahead. The purpose of this post is to review what I&#8217;ve learned from a year on Substack, and what I plan to do here next.In early September of last year, I put up the first entry in this site, plus an &#8220;about&#8221; post explaining what I had in mind. That was almost one year ago. It was more than 50 years after my first-ever bylined newspaper articles, in the college paper. It was 50 years after I began my first-ever magazine job, in September 1972, at The Washington Monthly, then a startup. I am delighted that my wife, Deb, and I have a new cover story coming up in the September, 2022, issue of that magazine.Those first Substack &#8220;Breaking the News&#8221;  posts came 25 years after I had published a book, edited by Linda Healey, whose title was also Breaking the News. They came more than 25 years after I&#8217;d begun posting online dispatches at my own personal independent web site (with the help of my friend David Rothman), even before these were called &#8220;blogs.&#8221; Over all these years I&#8217;ve done, apart from a dozen books, thousands of online posts and many hundreds of articles and broadcast commentaries, mainly for The Atlantic but for a range of other places as well. So this past year has been a continuation, but also a change. It&#8217;s a continuation of the work I&#8217;ve always done, in a changed venue. I am writing now to express my thanks to the many people who have given their time, attention, and moral and material support to this new undertaking. I also want to explain what it has meant to me, and what I have in mind for my Substack life.Let&#8217;s talk practicalities.Subscribe nowFrom Samuel Johnson, to David HalberstamAmong the many mentors in journalism I am grateful to, I&#8217;ll mention two from those early years whose advice bears on what I am discussing. They were David McCullough, who died this month after a celebrated book-writing career, and David Halberstam, who died as a passenger in a car crash 15 years ago, still in the midst of his own storied career&#8212;and on his way to give a talk to young journalism students. The two happened to be near contemporaries of each other, born within a few-month range in the early 1930s. Halberstam was in his early 70s when he died; McCullough, in his late 80s.They were both in their early 40s when I met them, and I in my mid 20s. They told me about craft, and writing habits, and story telling.And they also talked about business. Writing was hard, as I already knew, and as they emphasized. The reporting and research is the fun part. But at some point you have to sit down and type. In my experience, what anyone serious about writing likes is having written. The writing life is the best anyone could have. The actual writing part is the challenge.Writers could never know what next year&#8217;s income might be, the two Davids told me. Publishers had more money than writers. So you had to take care to be paid. Find a good agent! Which I am lucky to have done, first with the late Wendy Weil, and in the past decade with our friend Rafe Sagalyn.Of course both McCullough and Halberstam were reliably best-selling authors, among the most financially secure of anyone in the field. But still they said: choosing to be a writer meant choosing not to have a steady, predictable job or business base.&#8220;This is the life we have chosen!&#8221; has been a standard Fallows-household joke when nerves were frayed or money was low. &#8220;This is the life you have chosen,&#8221; Deb would reply&#8212;half-seriously. Obviously it is the life we have chosen, in which she has flourished as a reporter and writer. On this path we together have been fortunate in ways far beyond what we could have expected, and that we try to be aware of every day.But this early guidance was the context for my often thinking of the famed line from Samuel Johnson, as rendered in Boswell&#8217;s Life: &#8220;No man but a blockhead ever wrote, except for money.&#8221;Of course Samuel Johnson was right&#8212;because of the perils of the business and the difficulty of the task.And of course Samuel Johnson was wrong.Share&#8216;No man but a blockhead,&#8217; part two.Samuel Johnson was wrong because no sane person ever became a writer mainly for the money. Or anyone who did so, did not stay in the business very long before recognizing the mistake. For some writers, some of the time, this business can be lucrative. Again McCullough and Halberstam in their prime were two examples. But for most people, most of the time, the writing life is&#8212;no joke&#8212;a calling. My line about the book business has always been: The only reason to write a book is if you feel you can&#8217;t not write it. The same is true about the reporting and writing business as a whole. People stay in this line of work because they love what is exhilarating and glorious about it &#8212; the ability to learn, the license to share and tell &#8212; more than they dread what can be sleep-losing, confidence-eroding, and overall maddening about it. The latter boils down to sitting at a keyboard and trying to figure out how to say what you know you mean. I&#8217;m not sure whether John Kenneth Galbraith actually said this, but I&#8217;ve always credited him with the view that writers strive for the note of spontaneity that comes on the eighth or ninth draft. Someone else told me: the right form of any sentence is already out there in the ether. You just have to exhaust all the wrong possibilities before you find it. You don&#8217;t do this work unless you want to.Over the decades I have always wanted to do the work of seeing, and learning, and telling, and connecting, and through nearly every minute have enjoyed doing so. And in the past year I have been very fortunate to do so in this space, and am grateful to Substack for making it possible.In the olden blogging days, a writer could see something, and write out reactions to it, and publish them and get readers&#8217; reactions, all within the span of a few minutes or hours. For understandable reasons, that&#8217;s just not feasible at big-time publications any more. They can no longer leave the publishing controls in the hands of individual writers. Among other reasons, the legal exposure and brand consequences are too great. That&#8217;s sensible for publications. But I had gotten used to having those controls in my own hands. As I did, for instance, in this whole series through the 2016 campaign, and in every one of the hundreds of Atlantic posts I filed from China. I have been given the controls again here, and I am grateful for that.In more than 100 dispatches over the past year, I have been glad to write, and learn, and post: About politics. About China. About technology. About books. About the press. About leaf blowers. About speeches. About airplanes. About family members, from the very young to the young-at-heart. About other topics, all of them available here.But I&#8217;ve had an extra job in this past year, which I&#8217;ll explain for what it means about the years ahead.Give a gift subscriptionBuilding &#8216;Our Towns&#8217;Here is another chronology: Nearly ten years ago, on our return from a multi-year residence in China, Deb and I began reporting from parts of America generally left out of mainstream news coverage. That was for an Atlantic series called &#8220;American Futures,&#8221; with John Tierney, and numerous broadcasts on Marketplace radio, with Kai Ryssdal and his team.Four years ago, we published a book about this view of America, edited by Dan Frank, called Our Towns. Three years ago we spent 100 filming days on the road, with the great filmmakers Steve Ascher and Jeanne Jordan, to make a documentary of the same name. Two years ago, during the lockdown, we worked on production and narration. Early last year, HBO aired the film, still on HBO Max.During the same time as working on the film, Deb and I built and launched a new non-profit organization, called the Our Towns Civic Foundation.    Deb and I have spent a lot of the past two-plus pandemic years in what we lovingly call the open-ended &#8220;infrastructure week&#8221; of starting the foundation. We&#8217;ve built a very good website &#8212; with the sequential help of designers at Epic Web Studios in Erie, Point Five in New York, Bitwise in Fresno, and Tom Hall and his team in  Maine. We&#8217;ve had crucial allies &#8212; our longtime friends Shelli Stockton and Lincoln Caplan since the very first days, Ben Speggen and Michelle Ellia and too many others to name since then. We&#8217;ve received economic backing, at an accelerating pace, most of which is detailed on the site and with more to be announced soon. We are heartened and excited and believe we&#8217;re building something that can last. This will remain a central part of my time, attention, and effort. (I type out these words in a motel in northern Ohio, during a reporting trip to small towns here.) It matters that Americans have a more three-dimensional, less fatalistically &#8220;red versus blue&#8221; portrayal of our country. It matters that people around the nation who are doing positive and innovative work &#8212; about climate resilience, about economic opportunity and inclusion, about new roles for schools and colleges, about reviving &#8220;left-behind&#8221; cities, about new models for local journalism &#8212; know that they are not alone, and can learn from one other. It matters that today&#8217;s American story more fully reflect today&#8217;s American realities.I believe in this effort the way people we&#8217;ve admired have believed in what they have done. I believe in the way Deb&#8217;s parents did, when they sold their small business and went overseas, in their 50s, for the International Executive Service Corps. And in the way my parents believed, when they viewed their small city&#8217;s future as their future. And in the way my original magazine employer, Charles Peters and his wife, Beth, believed when they started The Washington Monthly. The way we have seen countless others commit themselves, and make a difference.As we&#8217;ve gained momentum and success we can imagine a time past 24/7 infrastructure week. I can imagine a time when more of my role can be as a writer again.Subscribe nowThe year ahead, and the years ahead.Let&#8217;s return to why Samuel Johnson was right. Reporting and writing take work, and they have consequences, so in the long run they need a business base.Of the 100-plus posts I have done here in the past year, virtually all have been &#8220;open&#8221;&#8212; available to all, paying subscriber or not. The only paywall has been limiting comments on posts to paying subscribers. This open approach is one I wanted to take, because I wanted to get my own feel for this venue, and because I was aware of the awkwardness of asking people to put up money before there was much to read. Because it&#8217;s relevant in discussions of Substack, I should disclose that when the company was offering large and well-publicized guarantees to many writers last year, it made a very generous offer to me. I was grateful to Substack, on this point and many others. But I declined, because I didn&#8217;t want to be under that additional pressure. Instead I&#8217;m here on a &#8220;pay your own way&#8221; basis. Of what subscribers pay here, 10% goes to Substack, and the rest, after various fees, goes to me. That constitutes essentially all of my writing income. Again because it&#8217;s relevant I&#8217;ll say that of the money Deb and I have raised for Our Towns, all has gone to contributors and staffers, not to us.Those of you who have paid to offer support in this past year have done so voluntarily. I can hardly express how grateful I am. I am also grateful to all who, with or without payment, have given their attention here. I recognize that people have many obligations and limited resources. But in this new year of operations, I will make this a more normal &#8220;business&#8221; undertaking on my side. I&#8217;ll post on a more predictable, regular schedule, which I&#8217;ll let readers know about. I&#8217;ll work with this rough division of labor: On American-renewal topics, my colleagues and I will mainly post on Our Towns. On everything else, from China to political journalism to the military and all of the above, I will be here. And naturally there will be significant fertile overlap.Most of what appears here will still be &#8220;open.&#8221; Anyone interested can still subscribe for free. But I will be introducing a sequence of paid-subscriber features. They will be on a plus/and basis &#8212; new features, for which I&#8217;ll ask new support &#8212; rather than a minus basis, of taking things away. Most of them will involve aspects of community and connection: ways to share experiences, insights, mutual support, being &#8220;backstage.&#8221; Because I prefer to show you something, once it&#8217;s developed, than tell you about something before it&#8217;s ready, I&#8217;ll wait to unveil what I have in mind.But I believe that asking for support is a sign of taking this enterprise even more seriously. Writing is a privilege and is also work. No man but a blockhead&#8230;My thanks; stay tuned; and note the button, below. Subscribe now",

        "description": "Book art from the renowned turn-of-the-20th century illustrator Jessie Willcox Smith. (1890 print, from Getty Images.)One of my maxims is: when possible, don&#8217;t miss a chance to give a deserved compliment. Here are a few I have in mind right now.These follow some previous reading-guide posts, like &#8220;Four Books to Notice&#8221; and &#8220;August Recommendations.&#8221; These items are a mixed bag, connected by my view that each deserves mention.1. Claire Nader: &#8216;You Are Your Own Best Teacher!&#8217;You might not have seen this one coming.I have known Ralph Nader since I was a teenager, in the 1960s, when he was in his mid-30s and had already won worldwide fame. In those days I worked for him on a project, with the future Massachusetts judge Julian Houston, about the USDA&#8217;s role in dispossessing Black farmers from the rural South. Before you even begin a response: As a former Nader employee, who in the 1970s wrote two successful books under his auspices, I am keenly aware of the mixed ways in which he has influenced modern American history. That has been my topic on other days, but not today. Instead I mention him because of a book by one of his sisters that he has made me aware of. Ralph was the youngest of four children of an immigrant Lebanese family in Winsted, Connecticut. The oldest, his brother, Shafeek, is no longer alive. The two sisters, Laura and Claire, are well known. Laura has been a long-time anthropologist at UC Berkeley; Claire is a social scientist and civic activist who began her career at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.Claire has now written what I consider a delightful and instructive book, called You Are Your Own Best Teacher. The subtitle is a good summary of its ambition: &#8220;Sparking the Curiosity, Imagination, and Intellect of Tweens.&#8221; Claire Nader&#8217;s book on the left, Josh Chin&#8217;s and Liza Lin&#8217;s on the right.The Tweens she is addressing are young readers between the ages of nine and 12. A remarkable aspect of the book&#8217;s tone is that Claire Nader is not burdened at all by issues of &#8220;generation gap.&#8221; She was born when Herbert Hoover was in the White House, and is addressing those born during Barack Obama&#8217;s time. But she breezes right along, peer to peer.Never once does she talk down to, lecture, or condescend to her readers, and she goes very light on &#8220;when I was your age&#8230;&#8221; Nor is she ever cutesy. Instead she has a chatty, warm, &#8220;you can understand all this&#8221; tone, like the youngest-spirited grandmother or great-aunt who became a favorite of the descendants. She is wanting young people to be excited about all they can do, and talks up to them, with respect.She comes again and again to the three gifts-of-youth she mentions in the subtitle, and how people just starting out can make the most of them. For instance:Delight in your present age. Take advantage of your freest years for exercising your curiosity, imagination, and concentration, while adding more daily experiences that are new to you and not part of your routine.I am obviously too far removed from Tween-hood, or even being a Tween parent, to know how this will land with its announced audience. But for parents and certain Tweens it is certainly worth checking out. And we&#8217;ll wait to hear from our oldest grandchild, Jack Fallows, who has just turned 11, to hear what he thinks.I have never met Claire Nader. I believe I would like her, based on this book.Share2) Josh Chin and Liza Lin: &#8216;Surveillance State&#8217;And now, for something completely different &#8212;  but also completely related to the world today&#8217;s Tweens will eventually run.Among the greatest strategic challenges of this era is dealing with a country &#8212; China &#8212; whose scale and success make it un-ignorable, but which is problematic in so many ways. There is no way to reckon with the world&#8217;s climate challenges without engaging China. There is no way to reckon with the long-term prospects for democratic society without facing China&#8217;s recent moves in the opposite direction.My wife, Deb, and I feel a lifelong tie to Chinese people. We first went there in the 1980s; we lived there for almost four years, during the &#8220;Prague Spring&#8221; of the Hu Jintao era; between us we wrote three books about it, including Deb&#8217;s celebrated Dreaming in Chinese.  We care about its positive and negative realities. An important new entry on the latter side is Surveillance State, by longtime China reporters Josh Chin and Liza Lin. It is a carefully documented, and absolutely harrowing, account of existence in the political environment of today&#8217;s China &#8212; above all for Uighurs, in the far western area of Xinjiang.Deb and I have been in Xinjiang; we have reported on Uighur families; and I am sorry to say that the details in Surveillance State ring true to us. It is a bravely and carefully reported book, and a well-told and enlightening narrative. Chin and Lin are presenting an important part of the story of our times.ShareOn the left, The Sun. At right, The Fight to Save the Town.3. Sy Safransky et al: &#8216;The Sun.&#8217;Until my hometown friend, the tech entrepreneur Jack Dangermond, mentioned it to me a year ago, I had not paid attention to a monthly publication called The Sun.

It is open, daring, community-minded. It is both light and profound. The issue whose cover I show above has long essays on people&#8217;s relationship with alcohol, and people&#8217;s relationship with time.

Her new book is about the structural economic-and-political injustice that has hampered four American towns or regions: Stockton, California; Detroit; Lawrence, Massachusetts; and rural Josephine County in Oregon. You can read a good review of it by our friend John Miller, of the Moundsville site, here.Anderson&#8217;s book is powerful in portraying both what seems fated about hard-pressed communities and regions, and what remains within a community&#8217;s control. The fated-ness is enormous, and is the central part of her narrative. The places with the poorest people tend also to have the most over- burdened and overwhelmed local governments, and the cycle continues from there. As she writes in her opening pages:This book chronicles the wounds left by deep cuts to local government. Containment, rather than betterment, defines the character of public services. People with choices choose to leave&#8230;.When local governments are populated mostly by low-income people, there is typically much less money for public services. Weak, broke local governments make it harder for residents to lead decent lives on low incomes or get their families out of poverty. Entire towns become poverty traps.Her book is also about people who choose to stay, and what motivates and inspires them, and what we can learn from their examples. It is another important part of understanding the complex realities of our times, which are so much deeper, more contradictory, and ultimately much more important and even promising than the standard &#8220;guy in a diner&#8221; story that might come from any of these locales.Give a gift subscription5. Bonus: the &#8216;singularity&#8217; comes to environmental data.This is a teaser. Last month I did an Our Towns post on how the technological transformation that has affected bio-sciences is spreading more generally.In brief: back in the 1990s I did a New Yorker profile of Harold Varmus, then head of the National Institutes of Health. One of his points was that biology and medical sciences, in which he had won a Nobel prize, were being transformed because advances in each branch of science were all accelerating one another. Faster computers meant faster sequencing of the human genome. Breakthroughs in materials-sciences made different kinds of surgical procedures possible. Advances in space science led to revelations from Zero-G conditions. And so on.The point of my post was that a similar accelerating-virtuous-cycle was improving the ways people could understand what was happening to their environment &#8212;everywhere, all the time.And perhaps even do something about it.Those are the recommendations for now.Subscribe now",

        "description": "Rene Magritte knew about frames. (Getty Images)Last spring, after the tragic death of the incisive press critic Eric Boehlert, I wrote about his (and many other people&#8217;s) emphasis on framing the news. Framing is the idea that the assumptions behind the presentation, emphasis, and selection of stories are generally far more important than usual indicators of &#8220;bias,&#8221; overt as they might be.This post is a quick reaction to a story this evening in the New York Times illustrating the framing points that Eric Boehlert and others have been writing about.Here is a headline on the paper&#8217;s site right now:Why does this deserve notice?The minor issue is presenting as neutral, observable fact what is in reality the writer&#8217;s or editor&#8217;s judgment and assessment. In this case, that Biden remains in &#8220;Trump&#8217;s long shadow&#8221; and that his major legislative success &#8220;can hardly break through&#8221; a focus on Trump&#8212;in a story whose own framing is part of making it harder for Biden&#8217;s legislative success to &#8220;break through.&#8221;   Writers and editors can of course make their own assessments of what matters, and why. I do it all the time, including right now. But they should own them, and make their case. A related, larger issue is that a &#8220;news analysis&#8221; of why Trump gets so much attention, gives him more attention.An even larger issue is the instinctive reduction of public life to who&#8217;s up/who&#8217;s down politics, which most reporters (including me) find fascinating. This is as opposed to the way public decisions affect households and communities, which most people care about much more.Biden today signed a bill that appears to be the biggest forward movement on climate policy in decades; that will limit health care costs for many people; that corrects the historic mistake of not letting Medicare negotiate drug prices; that increases some corporate taxes; that by most reckoning will lower the federal deficit; that by most reckoning will create many more jobs; that was eked out through a 50-50 Senate (whose 50 included Manchin and Sinema); and so on.You can oppose this bill, as all Republican Senators did. Or you can find it lacking, as many progressives do. But by any normal standards &#8212; as Barack Obama said in a tweet this evening &#8212; it is a BFD.Yet one that can &#8220;hardly break through&#8221; nonstop attention to Trump. According to an article directing its attention toward Trump.The people pointing the spotlight, have some responsibility for where the spotlight goes.ShareFraming: line by line.The actual argument of the piece deserves notice, apart from the headline and presentation. Here are the set-up passages in the second and third paragraphs.I&#8217;ve highlighted the parts on which the story depends. They are either  passive-voice (&#8220;presence was felt&#8221; &#8220;seem eclipsed&#8221;), or of the &#8220;a picture emerges&#8221; variety. The latter is a familiar journalistic technique, of asserting something as true without coming out and saying so. Watch for it in stories: &#8220;From 15 interviews with the governor&#8217;s staff, a picture emerges&#8230;&#8221; (Rather than, &#8220;After 15 interviews with the governor&#8217;s staff, I am convinced&#8230;&#8221;) In this story, it shows up as &#8220;finds himself struggling&#8221;, &#8220;lived with the shadow,&#8221; &#8220;proved no match.&#8221;It is as if I said right now: &#8220;This story often finds itself struggling to keep issues in perspective.&#8221; &#8220;Its framing has proved no match for the realities of our times.&#8221; &#8220;It lives in the shadow of past politicized coverage.&#8221;I don&#8217;t know the editors of this piece, and there is no point in naming the writer. It&#8217;s an institutional question. But if you wonder what it means to &#8220;frame&#8221; the news, it means this.Subscribe now",

        "description": "A historical view of the famous Amphitheater at the Chautauqua Institution in New York. It looks very similar these days. The stage shown at the left in this image is where Salman Rushdie and Henry Reese were sitting yesterday morning, August 12, when an attacker rushed from the crowd to stab them. (New York Public Library.)This is an unusual post. It is co-written by my wife, Deb, and me; it&#8217;s co-posted in a longer version on the Our Towns web site, because it was through Our Towns travels that Deb and I met some of the people we will mention; and it is not what I had intended to write today, which was U.S. politics-related, and will hold.Instead Deb and I want to write about the &#8220;other&#8221; victims of an attack that has drawn worldwide attention. We hope you will find their stories compelling, along with their ideas about possibilities for response.What else happened in Chautauqua, and why it matters.By Deborah Fallows and James FallowsIn the wake of the shocking and brutal knife attack on the main stage of the Chautauqua Institution yesterday, the world&#8217;s attention is naturally and properly directed toward Salman Rushdie. He has spent most of his adult life under the threat of murder ordered by fatwa; he has never stopped writing and has dared to re-appear in public; he has been one of world&#8217;s best-known exemplars of what &#8220;courage of one&#8217;s convictions&#8221; can mean. Now the world is reminded of what he had to fear all along.The two of us know Salman Rushdie only through his work, but we join the widespread horror at what he has endured and admiration for what he represents.We know in a different way the other person who was stabbed yesterday, and the place where the assault occurred. We want to say a few words about each of them.The other man who was stabbed: Henry Reese, and the City of Asylum.Henry Reese was preparing to lead an on-stage discussion with Salman Rushdie yesterday, when the attacker stormed up from the audience and began stabbing them. We understand that Henry was injured, with a wound that just missed his eye, as he attempted to block the attacker.There could hardly have been a better-suited person to lead this discussion than Henry Reese, which is of course why Chautauqua had selected him. Over the past two decades, he and his wife, Diane Samuels, have led Pittsburgh&#8217;s &#8220;City of Asylum,&#8221; which has been devoted to providing protection, support, and a base for artists who have been persecuted for their views. Salman Rushdie&#8217;s experience and personal guidance have been important parts of their effort.You can read the City of Asylum&#8217;s account of Rushdie&#8217;s role in its creation from its own website, here. After the first of our many trips to visit them back in 2014, Deb Fallows wrote about&nbsp; Reese, Samuels, their vision, and their work. This is from one of her articles, which mentioned the roles both of Rushdie and of an exiled Chinese poet named Huang Xiang:There are Cities of Asylum all around the world, founded about 20 years [in the 1990s] ago to provide sanctuary for exiled at-risk writers. A couple from Pittsburgh, Henry Reese and Diane Samuels, happened to hear Salman Rushdie speak in town. When he happened to mention the Cities of Asylum in Europe, they were interested. To say &#8220;interested&#8221; is an understatement.For six years, Reese and Samuels asked the network in Europe to let them create a Pittsburgh City of Asylum. One day they got a call back: yes. The Pittsburgh agreement would be unusual, as other centers were organized with institutional sponsorship, mostly universities. Pittsburgh, as a community, would go it alone. Reese, who had run successful businesses involving coupon books, telemarketing, and call centers, and Samuels, who is a visual artist, pulled together a group of friends and donors to give it a try for two years. They would need to raise money to provide housing, medical benefits, a living stipend for the writer.They bought a former crack house on a small lane called Sampsonia Way and fixed it up. The lane feels like a Midwest version of a hutong in old Beijing. It sits in the close-in north side section of Pittsburgh known as the Mexican War Streets (with street names from battles and generals from the Mexican American War), a kind of gentrified Bohemian row-house neighborhood with many writers, artists, eclectic personalities and interesting people. Reese and Samuels live there, too&#8230;The Chinese poet and calligrapher Huang Xiang, at the 10th anniversary celebration for City of Asylum. (Renee Rosensteel.)Huang Xiang and his wife, Zhang Ling, arrived. Then the magic began to happen. No one had any rules for how this was supposed to work, so they all learned from one another.Huang Xiang was full of ideas and energy. As Reese describes it, Huang was fairly bursting to let loose with all that had been pent up for so many years. Huang didn&#8217;t just recite a poem, he danced, shouted, waved, and lived that poem with his entire body and spirit. He was a master of performance&#8230;Reese&#8217;s and Samuels&#8217;s default was to say yes to everything. When Huang saw Pittsburgh&#8217;s Mt. Washington and said he&#8217;d like to carve a poem into the mountain, in the tradition of Chinese poets, Samuels didn&#8217;t blanch but suggested he might paint his poems on the outside of his house instead. So they set up scaffolding around the frame house and Huang went to work, painting his poems in his own &#8220;grass style&#8221; calligraphy. He was &#8220;writing his house&#8221; as they now describe it.People could not help but notice House Poem. Before long, neighbors who didn&#8217;t even understand a word of Huang&#8217;s Chinese poetry, began to slip notes through the mail slot, with poems they had written themselves.There is much more in Deb&#8217;s account, which is all the more relevant in the wake of this shocking news. Among her conclusions:I finally understood that the City of Asylum is about more than giving an exiled writer a place to live and work. It is about building a community around them that participates with the poetry, or art, or music that is being created in that living space.&#8216;So speak&#8230;&#8217;Two other reports on the City of Asylum, both by Deb, are &#8220;A River of Words in Pittsburgh,&#8221; and &#8220;Language as Art in Pittsburgh.&#8221; In&nbsp;2016 our colleague Ben Speggen wrote in the Erie Reader about what the City of Asylum had meant to its community. These too have additional relevance.As does the quote that has headlined the City of Asylum&#8217;s web site since long before this tragedy:So far no one has died from the Chautauqua attack, although Rushdie&#8217;s status was initially reported as &#8220;critical,&#8221; and though the wounds of all sorts are profound. We barely dare reflect on what might have happened if the weapon were not a knife but the familiar high-capacity, rapid-fire weapon of destruction. The objects of this attack have stood for courage and freedom of expression. Their examples and influence will always live, and we hope their own work becomes all the stronger.&nbsp;ShareChautauqua and America.The other object of attack was the Chautauqua Institution itself. This is a magical physical space, and an enduring example of the best in civic life at all levels: individual commitment and values, family connections and tradition, community possibilities, goals that transcend boundaries of race and faith and gender and politics.We feel ourselves very fortunate to be part of the extended Chautauqua family. We have been there many times over the decades, starting when our children were little in the 1980s and extending to the immediate pre-pandemic years. Three years ago Jim emceed a weeklong series of afternoon discussions, in Chautauqua&#8217;s glorious, open-air Hall of Philosophy, including people we&#8217;d met in the Our Towns travels. We&#8217;ve had the honor of speaking on the main amphitheater stage where yesterday&#8217;s attack occurred, and being in chairs like those where Rushdie and Reese were seated. We&#8217;ve made memories and friendships that endure.We know how significant the atmosphere of trust, informality, person-to-person contact, and casual conversation and connection is to Chautauqua&#8217;s lasting imprint &#8211; and therefore how deeply shocking this act of violence was.There is no better way to express what Chautauqua has stood for, and will stand for, than to hear the powerful brief message that its president, our friend Michael Hill, delivered to a Chautauqua community vigil last night, from the stage of the Hall of Philosophy.Eloquence and profundity, in times of grief, are rare rhetorical achievements. Michael Hill was eloquent and profound. We have made a transcript, which you can see at the Our Towns site. But for the full effect we hope you will listen to these four minutes:Michael Hill also put out a formal statement today.Bear Salman Rushdie in your thoughts. And Henry Reese, Diane Samuels, and the City of Asylum family. And the example set by the whole Chautauqua community.&nbsp; Subscribe now",

        "description": "At Project Fighting Chance, in San Bernardino, California, young people take lessons in boxing&#8212;but also in chess, music, math, self-discipline and self-improvement, and other important life skills. Now it may be forced out of its buildings, as detailed in the second item below. (Screen shot from the movie Our Towns, on HBO Max.)This post is a list of some recommendations and pointers. They&#8217;re completely different from one another but all on my mind right now.1. &#8216;The Boys,&#8217; by Katie Hafner.I&#8217;m biased, because the writer Katie Hafner is a long-time friend. Twenty-plus years ago, we co-taught a course in magazine writing at UC Berkeley, when our mutual dear friend Orville Schell was the dean of its journalism school. We&#8217;ve stayed in touch.Bias declared, I am here to tell you that Katie&#8217;s new novel, The Boys, is very much worth buying and reading &#8212; and reading in hardcover, if possible. Its compact layout and elegant &#8220;form factor&#8221; are ideally suited to hardcover reading. (I continue to believe that people of any age absorb material differently, and maintain a different kind of attention, when looking at a physical page rather than a screen.)The book got a very positive and perceptive review last month in the New York Times. It is gracefully written, and funny. It is wholly original, fantastic-yet-plausible, and tender and moving, in a way you might not expect when you begin it, or even when you&#8217;re most of the way through. It&#8217;s a novel I think you will remember, and reflect upon. Congratulations to Katie Hafner, and please add it to your lists.By the way: one of the book&#8217;s non-human characters is a beloved (and senescent) pet named Mike the Cat. The original Mike the Cat of our household, whom we&#8217;ve discussed with Katie over the years, is pictured below, in his prime. Mike is no longer with us except in memory, but he would be honored by his connection to this new book.Mike the Cat, imagining the time when he would be a central character in a book.Share2. Project Fighting Chance, in San Bernardino.The very first segment in our HBO movie, Our Towns, featured an innovative and important organization in San Bernardino, California, called Project Fighting Chance, or PFC. You can see Ian Franklin, founder and president of PFC, in this trailer of the movie from West City Films. The PFC web site is here, and that is Ian Franklin below.Ian Franklin of Project Fighting Chance, from the film Our Towns.There could hardly be a better illustration than PFC of Americans trying hard, at the local level, to use limited resources for the greater good. Its trademark is teaching boxing, but it also instructs young people, from very tough neighborhoods, in music, math, chess, and other skills. It serves as a haven and safe-space home.At the Our Towns foundation website we&#8217;ve just published a new podcast led by Evan Sanford with Ian Franklin and Terry Boykins, the PFC executive director, about what their project is doing, and why it has had such effect. For instance: It was recognized as California&#8217;s &#8220;non-profit of the year&#8221; two years ago; it has been invited to offer programs in San Bernardino schools; graduates of its boxing-training programs have won many national titles.But recently PFC has learned that it might be pushed from its headquarters site in San Bernardino within a few weeks. The situation is strange, as detailed in two very good local-news reports: this one from Brian Whitehead in the San Bernardino Sun, and this from Dianne Anderson of Precinct Reporter. The short version is that the religious group that owns the building, and the nonprofit organization that manage it, seem to have suddenly changed the terms of PFC&#8217;s rental. There is much more information in those local stories&#8212;and in our new podcast, which I hope you will listen to here. I have put out queries to the landlord groups and will report back if I learn more. For the moment, check out what Project Fighting Chance has done, and consider supporting them. Share3. Sarah Smarsh, &#8216;New York Times.&#8217;The landslide vote against the Kansas anti-abortion proposal was nearly two weeks ago. Last week, in the New York Times, Sarah Smarsh, of Kansas (and author of Heartland), made a point that can&#8217;t be made often enough.It was about the reductionist, destructive assumption that the country is starkly divided into &#8220;red state people&#8221; and &#8220;blue state people,&#8221; and that when you cross one state or county line, you have gone into wholly alien terrain, full of people you cannot deal with.Her whole op-ed is worth reading, but I am thinking of this (emphasis added):In a state where registered Republicans far outnumber Democrats, the results reveal that conservative politicians bent on controlling women and pregnant people with draconian abortion bans are out of step with their electorates, a majority of whom are capable of nuance often concealed by our two-party system.This is not news to many red-state moderates and progressives, who live with excruciating awareness of the gulf between their decent communities and the far-right extremists gerrymandering, voter-suppressing and dark-moneying their way into state and local office. Too often, election results say more about the conditions of the franchise &#8212; who manages to use it, and what information or misinformation they receive along the way &#8212; than they do about the character of a place.American politicians and the machinery of national politics&#8212;especially the money-raising part, and the news-environment part&#8212;are indeed more and more polarized, as everyone including me has noted.It&#8217;s a natural leap, but a mistaken one, to assume that every detail of national life is flattened and polarized in the same way. This temptation to oversimplify is all the greater when Americans know the parts of the country where they don&#8217;t live only through red/blue Electoral College maps, or &#8220;guy in a diner&#8221; / &#8220;angry people at a rally&#8221; set-piece stories. It&#8217;s a big, diverse country, which has dire problems, but most of whose people are less inflamed and crazy than you&#8217;d think by watching the worst of them on the news. I am grateful to Sarah Smarsh for making this point. And to the voters of Kansas for reminding us.Give a gift subscription4. Noah Smith, Substack.The economist and blogger Noah Smith is always worth following on Substack and elsewhere. I call out in particular his recent piece on why the &#8220;CHIPS&#8221; act, promoting US-based semiconductor manufacturing, is an important step in the right direction. Even though it represents that anathema, &#8220;industrial policy.&#8221;This is a debate I&#8217;ve joined over the decades, for instance in this Atlantic cover story from nearly 30 years ago on that era&#8217;s semiconductor wars. I plan to weigh in further, and am suggesting the Noah Smith link as a valuable marker for now.Substack is also reviving a practice known in the blogging era as the &#8220;Blogroll,&#8221; or standing lists of other sites you learn from. Substack is calling it the Recommendations list. I&#8217;ve just now begun populating mine, which includes Noah Smith.A book; a civic project; a podcast; some articles and posts&#8212;I hope you find at least some of them engaging and valuable, as I have.Subscribe now",

        "description": "That&#8217;s Dick Cheney in the center of this photo, when he was 35 years old and serving as Gerald Ford&#8217;s White House chief of staff. This meeting took place in November, 1976, within days of Ford&#8217;s having lost his re-election race to Jimmy Carter. At right in the photo is Jack Watson, head of Carter&#8217;s transition team, whose staff had prepared meticulous plans for a smooth transfer of power. At left, John Marsh, a White House counsellor to Ford who did the same on the outgoing administration&#8217;s side. As an incoming Carter staffer, I first met Dick Cheney in those days. (Getty Images.)  Dick Cheney has always been young, and always been old. This post is meant to connect his latest public message, in a powerful, blunt minute-long video on behalf of his daughter Liz Cheney and strongly against Donald Trump, to the anomalous young-but-old place he has had in modern public life.It is not an attempt to recap his very well-known official record. For that there are books, movies, our collective memory.ShareDoing everything, early.After his wastrel early years&#8212;wastrel by all accounts, including his own&#8212;Cheney became that familiar political type, the sharp young staff assistant. In his mid 20s he was an aide to a Republican governor of Wisconsin. At 28 he worked briefly on a Republican Congressional staff, and soon became an aide to the also-precocious Donald Rumsfeld, then in his 30s and head of Richard Nixon&#8217;s Office of Economic Opportunity. (Rumsfeld of course exemplifies timescale anomaly, having been both the youngest and the oldest Secretary of Defense in U.S. history. Jerry Brown holds a similar distinction among California governors, as the second-youngest and also the oldest ever.) Gerald Ford in 1975 with two people who would each serve as his White House chief of staff, and whose careers were linked in countless other ways. At left, Donald Rumsfeld, then age 42 and serving as chief. At right, Rumsfeld&#8217;s deputy and later successor as chief, Dick Cheney, then age 34. (National Archives.)At age 30 Cheney was a staffer in Richard Nixon&#8217;s White House. By age 34, he was Gerald Ford&#8217;s White House chief of staff, succeeding &#8212; wait for it &#8212; Donald Rumsfeld. There&#8217;s a long series of other &#8220;young&#8221; steps for Cheney&#8212;notably five terms in Congress starting in his late 30s, and one term as Secretary of Defense starting in his late 40s, which included the Gulf War. By the time Cheney became the &#8220;old man&#8221; of the Bush-Cheney ticket in 2000, he was still in his 50s.But in physical terms Cheney has always been old. He was noticeably losing his hair in his 30s. He survived the first of his many serious heart attacks at age 37, and had his first of several major heart operations in his 40s. Soon after he turned 70 he had a heart transplant. In public life his bearing has long been that of the grizzled old hand.Give a gift subscription&#8216;What you&#8217;ve seen in the recent Liz Cheney, you saw in the old Dick Cheney.&#8217;I know about Cheney&#8217;s bearing because I first met him in his young/old Ford White House years. In the fall of 1976 Cheney was the chief of staff and campaign manager for a president running for re-election. I was one of many 20-something staffers on Jimmy Carter&#8217;s campaign, which of course unseated Ford. Within days of Carter&#8217;s victory, Cheney was taking the lead in making sure that the incoming Carter team had its best possible chance for success. Everything you would like to believe about &#8220;country over party,&#8221; &#8220;orderly transfer of power,&#8221; and so on, Dick Cheney (and of course Ford) made sure that their White House staff exemplified. I realize that this does not sound credible 45 years later. But I know it first hand. The picture at the top of this post was taken just a few days after the very close Carter-Ford results. Losing a presidential election is devastating&#8212;as Jimmy Carter came to know, four years later. But the Ford team, led by Cheney, began cooperating with the Carter team right away. It was &#8220;the right thing to do.&#8221;I also met Cheney several times during his Congressional career. He was then among the legislative figures who gave most serious attention to the nascent Defense Reform movement. The intellectual and political leader of this group was Gary Hart, then a rising-star Democratic Senator from Colorado. Another &#8212; also wait for it &#8212; was a 30-something first-term Republican Congressman from Georgia named Newt Gingrich. In Congress Cheney did not make defense-reform his keystone issue, as Hart did. But he put in the time. He patiently asked open-minded questions; he read books and briefings; he didn&#8217;t divide up &#8220;facts&#8221; by party origin. He had more in common with the Liz Cheney we have seen in the January 6 committee hearings than the Dick Cheney people came to know in the Iraq war years. Again I know this first-hand.Share&#8216;Dick Cheney&#8217;s Heart.&#8217;This was the Cheney of the pre-Halliburton, pre-Florida recount, pre-Iraq-and-Abu Ghraib years. I won&#8217;t get into the hypotheses of what changed that person into the one the world came to know in the 2000s.But I will quote something I wrote a dozen years ago, after Cheney had stepped down as vice president but when he had been hospitalized after his fifth heart attack.The brief post was called &#8220;Dick Cheney&#8217;s Heart,&#8221; and it said in full:News about former VP Cheney's latest heart problems is not on the front page at the moment, so I figure it is a good time to make this point.On general&nbsp;John Donne&nbsp;principles I hope every person has as full and long a life as possible. But there are specific reasons to hope that Cheney surmounts these problems and goes on for a while. It has to do with one more uncompleted cycle in his life.We all know the cliche about people who switch from youthful idealism to mid-life flinty-mindedness. One version goes, If you're not a socialist in your twenties, you have no heart; if you're not a capitalist in your forties, you have no mind. I think there's an important addition: If you're not a humanist in your seventies, you have no soul.It doesn't always happen, but we celebrate the examples when it does. The elderly warriors who become peacemakers. The tycoons who become philanthropists. The schemers and narcissists who become conciliators and mentors. If the twenties-to-forties shift reflects a growing awareness of life's hard realities, the later shift reflects an understanding of life's tragedies and unfairnesses and humanity's shared risks and hopes. Think of Ebenezer Scrooge's last-minute conversion in&nbsp;A Christmas Carol.Dick Cheney has been through a particularly marked version of the first shift, only. Those who knew him in his twenties and thirties, when he first came onto the public stage, remember him as a talented, understated, conciliatory, non-partisan figure who stood for \"public service\" in the classic, and classiest, sense. He was Gerald Ford's White House chief of staff in his mid-30s and was admired by the Republicans who served with him and the Democrats to whom he helped ease the transition to the Carter Administration.Cheney's legacy through his fifties and sixties is, to put it mildly, different -- in the way he became the Vice Presidential nominee, in his influence on U.S. policy and values while in office, in his&nbsp;conduct&nbsp;since&nbsp;leaving&nbsp;the White House. Cheney is not yet 70 (he was born in January, 1941). For many reasons, I would like to know what kind of Cheney we'd see in this next decade.ShareA one-time prodigy reaches his 80s.A screen shot from yesterday&#8217;s video by Dick Cheney.I wrote that post more than a decade ago, before Dick Cheney turned 70. What have we seen since of the Dick Cheney who improbably has survived into his 80s? -We see someone who distanced himself from his party&#8217;s anti-gay marriage policies&#8212;after one of his own daughters had come out.-We see someone who has memorably blasted Donald Trump&#8212;&#8220;a coward,&#8221; the greatest individual &#8220;threat to our republic&#8221; in the nation&#8217;s entire history&#8212;after another of his own daughters has faced the MAGA-party consequences of standing up to Trump.Taking a stand, once it&#8217;s personal, is better than never taking a stand at all. The latter is the shame of most incumbent Vichy Republicans. So Dick Cheney deserves credit for saying what he did.Liz Cheney, with whom I disagree on nearly every policy issue, deserves greater credit for taking a stand against Trump before her father did, and before it was purely personal. What she has done on the January 6 committee does not change the rest of her record but in itself deserves deep, lasting acclaim.As for where Dick Cheney goes from here:-He will always be known, at least to me, as one of the handful of people most responsible for America&#8217;s greatest foreign policy disaster, the invasion of Iraq. Others include George W. Bush himself, the inescapable Donald Rumsfeld, Paul Wolfowitz, Paul Bremer, and the rest of the familiar crew. -But he has chosen to take this turn, at this stage of his life, which deserves notice.What more can his heart show us &#8212; literally, and metaphorically? We all have a finite time to leave our mark. Let us see what he does with his.Subscribe now",

        "description": "In his first moments of existence, Tiger James Fallows, born July 31, 2022. (Thomas Fallows)Early this morning, July 31, 2022, in Los Angeles, proud and grateful parents Tom Fallows and Lizzy Bennett Fallows were blessed by the arrival of Tiger James Fallows. For them this is their fourth child, and first son. For Deb and me, this is our sixth grandchild, and second grandson.Tiger, his mother, and all others in the extended family network are doing very well. His big sisters &#8212; Tide, Navy, and West &#8212; will have a new responsibility. Their whole family, based in Santa Barbara, will have the new adventures that come with so many live-wire personalities, and the mix of a boy with the girls. His numerous cousins are excited for new comrades. So of course are Lizzy&#8217;s parents, Susan and Don Bennett. We are so happy for all of them.ShareA word of background on names: Deb and I have two wonderful sons, Tom and Tad. They both had the good fortune, unlike me, of having known all four of their grandparents as significant parts of their lives while growing up. Only one of those four is still around: Deb&#8217;s phenomenal mother, Angela Zerad, whom I wrote about last Thanksgiving when she turned 100. Deb is visiting her this weekend, and Angie continues to thrive.Our sons also got to know very well their two grandfathers. Deb&#8217;s father, Frank Zerad, grew up in Chicago as the child of immigrants, and spoke Czech before he spoke English. He was a loving, big-hearted, good-humored, open-minded, endlessly curious, broadly informed, and remarkably tolerant man. He was a submarine officer during World War II; he ran a successful small business in the Midwest; and then, starting in their 50s, he and Angie spent several decades as volunteers for the International Executive Service Corps, with multi-month and multi-year assignments in South Korea, Indonesia, Egypt, Kenya, and elsewhere. Our boys came to know, love, remember, and have vivid recollections of Grandpa Frank &#8212; and Grandma Angie, who is still here.My father was James A. Fallows, A for Albert. (I am James M. Fallows, M for Mackenzie.) He was known as &#8220;Sunny Jim&#8221; in his childhood in Jenkintown, Pennsylvania, and as &#8220;Tiger Jim&#8221; during his years as a civic leader and beloved small-town doctor in Redlands, California. I wrote about him extensively at the time of his death, in 2008, and shortly before that when he received a delayed undergraduate degree for the two rushed wartime years he spent at Ursinus College before medical school. Our sons knew him well. They also knew and dearly loved (as I did) my mother, Jean Mackenzie Fallows, who was a grade-school sweetheart of &#8220;Sunny Jim,&#8221; married him when she was 20 years old, and was with him until her death.I knew my father as &#8220;Dad.&#8221; Our sons eventually knew him as &#8220;Tiger Jim.&#8221; In sharing the news of Tiger James&#8217;s arrival, Tom and Lizzy said today: &#8220;We hope he is inspired by Tiger Jim and Frank's senses of adventure, compassion, gusto, and lifelong curiosity -- big shoes to fill!&#8221;I agree, and can&#8217;t wait to see them all. Previously in this series: Welcome Jack Fallows, in August, 2011; Welcome Tide Fallows, in June, 2014; Welcome Eleanor Fallows, in February, 2015; Welcome Navy Fallows, in May, 2016;Welcome West Fallows, in September, 2018.Glad to add &#8216;Welcome Tiger James Fallows,&#8217; on this last day of July, 2022.Subscribe now",

        "description": "On the left of this swipe-screen, current days per year with maximum temperature above 105 F. At right, projected super-hot days by the end of this century. From the federal government&#8217;s new HEAT.gov site. This is just the kind of thing the federal government should  be doing more of. This post is about the news of this epoch: climate and sustainability, plus a new tool of this moment for envisioning and &#8212; who knows! &#8212; possibly doing more about these challenges. This post will be image-heavy, as opposed to text.Intentionally, this is not about the news of this week&#8212;inflation, midterms, flounderings of the press, etc. Nor the news of this American generation&#8212;whether the U.S. governing model is running out of luck, or which American institutions have crumbled or by contrast shown new strength, or how the NYTs recent I was wrong&#8230; supplement should have been more broadly applied. I&#8217;ll get to these soon.Today&#8217;s installment is a meant as a tech intro-and-update. It comes in the wake of the &#8220;astonishing&#8221; but still uncertain Biden-Schumer-Manchin apparent agreement to invest in national and global challenges, including climate. I&#8217;d like to talk about a new climate-related site called HEAT.gov and why it matters.Share&#8216;Mapping Common Ground&#8217;A few words of background:Earlier this month, my wife, Deb, and I, and our Our Towns colleague Ben Speggen joined some 15,000 other people at the annual User Conference in San Diego for the digital-mapping company Esri. I&#8217;m a long-time admirer of Esri&#8217;s. The company was founded and is still run by decades-long family friends, Jack and Laura Dangermond. It is based in their (and my) inland-California home town of Redlands, and has transformed everything about life in that small community. Deb and I featured Esri and the Dangermonds in our HBO movie&#8212;including their explanation of why they decided to build what became a global tech giant not in Cambridge, where they had been studying, nor in Palo Alto, where the money was, but instead in the place where they grew up. I&#8217;ve written about them many times&#8212;including a note several years ago, when the Dangermonds made a historic $165 million land-preservation donation to save a crucial part of the California coast. Have you ever noticed, on a map, where the California coast stops running east-to-west&#8212;as from Malibu to past Santa Barbara&#8212;and instead starts running north-and-south? That area is known as Point Conception, and it is of enormous ocean-and-land-based ecological significance. The vegetation is unusually rich, in this transition zone between northern and southern California. So is the wildlife. So is the sea life, where ocean currents collide and converge.  The 24,000 acres of the Dangermond Preserve, for which the family made a $165 million donation so that it could be perpetually protected as part of The Nature Conservancy. The Preserve is indicated by the blue arrow; Point Conception, by the red. Vandenberg Air Force Base is immediately to the northwest. (ArcGIS map by James Fallows.) These are the 24,000 acres of vulnerable land that Jack and Laura Dangermond enabled The Nature Conservancy to protect as a permanent research site and nature preserve.I think the company and the family have done a lot of good for the world. For instance: Esri&#8217;s mapping software, used on a for-pay basis by local and national governments everywhere and by countless corporations, is now offered free to K-12 schools any place on Earth, and most non-profit organizations.  Esri created the software behind the phenomenally popular and influential global Covid dashboard and map, from Johns Hopkins university. The company and its staffers have been partners and supporters of ours in many ventures, especially in developing &#8220;geo-journalism.&#8221; The most recent illustration is an Esri &#8220;StoryMap&#8221; of Bucksport, Maine, which we published yesterday.&#8216;Think global,&#8217; with new tools for &#8216;acting local.&#8217;What we saw at this year&#8217;s User Conference was a concentrated application of mapping tools to dealing with climate and sustainability issues. The theme of the entire conference was &#8220;Mapping Common Ground.&#8221; The implication was that maps might offer a way to create a ground-truth&#8212;a shared, comprehensible reality even in an era of contending &#8220;facts.&#8221; The maps on display covered a wide range of topics, from economic inequality to the proper layout of train lines. I&#8217;d like to concentrate on those involving climate and sustainability.At the conference, David Hayes, who has worked through his career on sustainability projects and is now the Biden White House&#8217;s advisor on climate policy, gave several presentations. It&#8217;s worth remembering the particular moment when he spoke: after the notorious Supreme Court decision limiting the EPA&#8217;s power over climate issues, but before this week&#8217;s Manchin/Schumer/Biden agreement.In those parlous times, in a session that I emceed, Hayes reinforced the importance of local, statewide, and regional innovations for sustainability. But he also laid out the administration&#8217;s undeterred national agenda, as reported by Alex Woodie in Datanami:Reducing U.S. greenhouse gas emissions by 50% below 2005 levels in 2030;Reaching 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035;And achieving a net-zero emissions economy by 2050.What, exactly, does all of this mean in practical terms? That is more than I can get into today. I can say that Hayes offered a preview of what promises to be a series of online maps and dashboards designed to give people a clearer, more comprehensible sense of: what is happening; how it will affect them; and what they can do.In an excellent new article for Fast Company, Alex Pasternack discussed many of the map-based implications of the new White House programs, with examples. Let me give just a few illustrations from the first such climate-based public map the White House has released, HEAT.gov. The main points about all this and related &#8220;digital dashboards&#8221; (like the one for Covid) and maps:They are customizable. You can see your immediate neighborhood, or the entire world.They are configurable. You can see the &#8220;real&#8221; weather as of 2020, and the projected weather as of many decades from now.They can be combined. You can overlay a map of likely future flood zones, with areas of greatest economic and social vulnerabilities.What can these maps show us? Here is a very tiny &#8220;bailing the ocean&#8221; sample set:First, a map showing the priority list of communities most at risk from heat stress some decades from now. This is based on an overlay of likely future temperatures, with current resources and vulnerabilities, and other factors and trends. Number one on this future vulnerability list is in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas. Number ten is in Arkansas. In between, at number seven, is my own home county in California. You can tune the map to your own interests here. It is meant to serve as a guide for preparation, avoidance, and resilience.Heat stress map, from the White House&#8217;s new HEAT.gov site. This one predicts communities likely to be under greatest environmental, economic, and social stress a few years from now. &#8216;Cooling Days&#8217;, and moreAnd here is a map of great importance to the electric-grid industry. It shows &#8220;cooling days,&#8221; or potential demand for air conditioning. First, the current level. Then, by the end of this century:The power grid will evolve to meet this challenge, or it will not.Similarly, here is a before-and-after set of maps about &#8220;dry days,&#8221; with consequences for agriculture, urban water supply, and much else.First, current &#8220;dry days,&#8221; per year.Then, by the end of the century:There is a lot more to come &#8212; in terms of other portals that depict and explain the coming crisis, and that suggest most useful avenues for action. And there is a lot more to discuss.For now let me suggest that you balance each minute you spend hearing about either Joe Manchin or Kyrsten Sinema, with two minutes on HEAT.gov. And gratitude to the public and private officials who are making this information accessible.Subscribe now",

        "description": "Franklin Delano Roosevelt, then president of the Harvard Crimson, with the Crimson&#8217;s staff in his Harvard college class of 1904. You&#8217;ll find him in the upper center of the photo. (Getty Images.)We all know what we&#8217;re supposed to worry about, when it comes to debate-on-campus, the constraints on free discussion, and also the flow of courageous independent thinkers into the ever more-imperiled American press. Major newspapers remind us every day.Last month, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, I spoke with someone at the center of many of these pressures. She is Raquel Coronell Uribe, originally from Bogota, Colombia, who will soon start her senior year at Harvard and is the first Hispanic person to become president, or editor-in-chief, of the independent student newspaper The Harvard Crimson. This is a job Franklin D. Roosevelt held some 120 years ago. I&#8217;ll let you pick him out among all the other suit-wearing, clean-shaven, prep-school-looking WASP-y men in the photo of the Crimson&#8217;s staff in those days, above. (He&#8217;s near the middle.)The paper&#8217;s staff looks much different now. But its independence is the same &#8212; unlike publications at many campuses, it has no financial, editorial, or other official ties to the university &#8212; and so are the pressures on it. Can &#8220;kids these days&#8221; handle contention, debate, uncomfortable ideas? Including at the most elite institutions, generally portrayed as hothouses? I had this same job roughly midway between FDR&#8217;s class of 1904 and Raquel Coronell Uribe&#8217;s class of 2023. In my college class of 1970, internal and external pressures were at least as intense as they are now. Last month in Cambridge, I spoke with Coronell about how people outside elite universities should think about people inside&#8212;and particularly their openness to difficult ideas and debate.The whole discussion is a little over 20 minutes long. You can hear it above&#8212;and I hope you will. I&#8217;ve also posted a separate item with a full transcript; it is here. For now, here are a few highlights, with time cues linked to the discussion, in hopes they&#8217;ll lead you to listen to more.Subscribe nowHarvard Crimson presidents from the class of 2023, and of 1970, in the Crimson&#8217;s office on Plympton Street in Cambridge last month. (Deborah Fallows)Excerpts:-On getting from Bogota to Cambridge. In Colombia both of her parents were prominent journalists:Raquel Coronell Uribe 01:26I was born in Bogota, Colombia, and I lived there for until I was 12 or 13.Although somewhere in the middle, we did an impromptu move to California. Both my parents are journalists. And my dad's work as a journalist at the time when I was around six years old, put a target on his back, and really all of our backs, because, you know, powerful people didn't like the reporting that he was doing and what he was finding.With the help us Committee to Protect Journalists, and the Knight Foundation, and Stanford, overnight we pretty much packed up our life in a couple of suitcases and flew to San Francisco. And we were in the Bay Area for two years, while things calmed down a little bit.Long story short, I ended up in Miami afterwards and got the opportunity to come here as a student at Harvard. And it took me a little bit to get to the Crimson. I didn't join until my sophomore year. But I always read the Crimson and I knew that I had to be a part of it. And as soon as I walked through these doors, I just felt the energy of the newsroom &#8212; of people bustling to get the paper out, to write their articles, to edit, I knew that this was my new home. So I dove into the paper.On &#8220;kids these days&#8221; and their view of a future in journalismFallows 06:23Based on the experience you and your colleagues have had at the paper&#8212;day after day, late into the night&#8212; what would be your bet for 10 years from now, what proportion of them will be in some form of journalistic activity?Coronell 06:35I think the majority of them.I don't think that we all know exactly what it is we want to do. But I would be shocked if the majority of us, more than half at least, aren't doing journalism in the future, The way that my dad puts it in, and that I agree with, is that journalism is a little bit like a bug. Once it bites you, it&#8217;s like you're done. That's who you are. If you like it, you will be like infected with want to do it in some form or another for the rest of your life.On &#8220;things that can&#8217;t be said&#8221;:Fallows 09:47Is there ever an occasion where people say, Gee, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, I bet our counterparts could have made X or Y or Z argument, but we can't do that now because we're afraid to step on toes. Which is the impression you get from most coverage of elite universities these days. Does that kind of feeling come up?Coronell 10:08I'm sure it does for you know, individuals and people here and there, but it's not something that I have ever heard, you know, the board editorial board express or a large group of people in our newspaper express.And I think actually, the Crimson has served as a venue for people who one might think would feel that way, to have their opinions published. You know, within reason, obviously&#8212;we have editorial standards, and we enforce those. But those pieces are published. And I think that goes to show our willingness to engage in debate and to cultivate that debate, and to make sure that it is a part of campus life and a part of journalism's life.On shifting away from print: The Crimson, which has been a six-day-a-week print newspaper, has just announced that it will switch to one print edition per week&#8212;more or less on the model of the NYT&#8217;s Sunday sections, or the WSJ&#8217;s Weekend Review&#8212;plus round-the-clock digital coverage. What was the reasoning?Coronell 16:43It's a decision that was not taken lightly at all. And I think that we wanted to make sure that no matter what we did, we would remain, you know, the oldest continuously published college daily, and I think it's just a matter of what form that daily takes.I think that, you know, my colleagues and I, we, we all see the value of print, and how important it is to kind of have that physical paper to hold in your hands, and both from just a journalistic perspective, and you get to present content in a way that you don't otherwise.And also just the nostalgia historical value. And I think one of the reasons people joined the Crimson is because of that. So so I guess I'll just preface that discussion with that.And I think what it came down to was that people really are not reading the print newspaper anymore. When you looked at the pickup rates, it was less than a third of students who were really picking up the papers on a daily basis. Putting together a paper takes the entire day, and then some. And it just was a question of where of how we wanted to engage with our readers and what kind of content we wanted to give them and where to put our sites.On what others might find surprising about her job:Fallows 21:24I&#8217;d like to ask you just one other question. What's the main thing that's a reality of your life&#8212;including as the first Latina woman to be president of the Harvard Crimson&#8212;that you think people don't understand? Or they'd be surprised to know about your daily life here?Coronell 21:55Oh, that's a good question. I think people may not know that I more or less live here&#8230;Fallows 22:13[Laughs] &#8230; I know that! I know that!!! Why do you think I was in Adams House? [The Harvard &#8220;house&#8221; closest to the Crimson&#8217;s office.] It's like 20 feet away from the paper.Uribe 22:19I wish I was in Adams. And I more or less live here. And I think from from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed, I'm doing Crimson work.There is a lot more to hear. Please give a listen when you can. And think about people from a wide variety of backgrounds, including those with more lucrative options in front of them, who are deciding about journalism: This is who you are.",

        "description": "The Harvard Crimson&#8217;s office, on Plympton Street in Cambridge. (Courtesy of The Crimson / photo by Julian J. Giordano.)In an accompanying post, I present a podcast interview with Raquel Coronell Uribe, a Harvard senior who is the president of the student newspaper The Crimson, plus some excerpts from our discussion.Here is a full version. I offer it as a rough-and-ready auto-transcription from Otter.ai.  Otter is great but not perfect. You&#8217;ll see some mixed-up punctuation and other jumble, which I&#8217;m not taking the time to line-edit. I mean this mainly as a guide &#8212; it&#8217;s a way to scan the topics. If there is anything that is interesting, or confusing, I recommend that you consult the podcast itself, which is below. The time markers in the transcript should match the podcast.The discussion:James Fallows Raquel, it's a real pleasure to talk with you. Would you say a word about the building in which we are meeting and why we are meeting here today?Raquel Coronell Uribe 00:10Absolutely. Yes. It's a pleasure to be with you. So 14 Plympton Street is where the Harvard Crimson is based. This is our building and where we produce every night. We, you know, are the Harvard student newspaper, but we're totally independent from Harvard financially. And editorially, we've been around for 149 years coming up on 150.I'm the current president, and not so long ago, you were the president. So, you know, you're my predecessor. And we've tried to carry on your tradition of just editorial and a free student press.Fallows 00:48And as you were gracious in your phrasing, I'm your predecessor--53 years removed. So back in 1969 1970, I was the president of the Crimson. And it was just a delight and an honor to see the tradition being carried on so well by you.How, briefly, did you end up from wherever you started out in life to 14 Plympton Street and Cambridge? Just remind us of what took you from Bogota, to, to Cambridge.Coronell 01:26So I was born in Bogota, Colombia, and I lived there for until I was 12-13.Although somewhere in the middle, we did an impromptu kind of move to California, because both my parents are journalists. And my dad's work as a journalist at the time when I was around six years old, put a target on his back, and really all of our backs, because, you know, powerful people didn't like the reporting that he was doing and what he was finding.With the help us Committee to Protect Journalists, and the Knight Foundation, and Stanford, overnight, we pretty much packed up our life in a couple of suitcases and flew to San Francisco. And we were in the Bay Area for two years, while things calmed down a little bit.Long story short, I ended up in Miami afterwards and got the opportunity to come here as a student at Harvard. And it took me a little bit to get to the Crimson. I didn't join until my sophomore year. But I always read the Crimson and I knew that I had to be a part of it. And as soon as I walked through these doors, it just felt the energy of the newsroom of people bustling to get the paper out, to write their articles, to edit, I knew that this was my new home. So I dove into the paper.Fallows 02:49I'm glad you did. I'm glad to hear that. When I was at the Crimson in the late 1960s, having started on the business board selling ads, because I wanted to save money to go to medical school, as I thought I was going to do.There was the same excitement, then about journalism and all the turmoil of those times, which were in a way even more tumultuous than now. Journalism was seen as a more sort of \"normal\" career path or career option for people at Ivy League schools or with elite educations. These days, how do you consider journalism as something to spend your undergraduate time on your colleagues on the Crimson, at a time when journalism is in such trouble economically and civically, what has drawn your colleagues in the paper,Coronell 03:37I think that the thing has drawn us to the Crimson is really the same thing that would, you know, draw us to journalism later on.But I think there's no kind of context or place in which it's more clear about the value of a free student press or a free press than at Harvard. And I think that the ability to hold decision makers accountable to you know, hold the university president the Deans accountable, to keep an eye on what they're doing, to report it. And, frankly, to get the pushback that we do from reporting it is, I think, what excites us all to be here and what keeps us going and what keeps us here until I've seen hours of the night, putting together the paper.Because I think that, you know, as students, we're stakeholders and kind of the decisions that go on here, and the ability to to figure those out, ahead of time sometimes, to figure out what Harvard has to say about the decisions that it makes both within the country you know, like the the things that it invests in, in its endowment in for example, or even public policies or things like that are hugely important to us and to all of our peers. So being able to record that and hold them accountable, I think, is what really draws people to the CrimsonFallows 04:54What would have been one or two of the big issues on which the Crimson has had had to take a stand during during your time here. Back when I was here it was things like the policy on ROTC and the bust of University Hall. What have been moments you think of where the Crimson and its independence were coming into disagreement or misalignment with the university and its policies? Coronell 05:26A great question. I mean, I think one story that comes to mind, this is from our news side, but one story that comes to mind is one that one of our reporters did recently on the Kennedy School and kind of what happened with its financial aid office and how it left students scrambling.And, you know, I think that was a very much a story that he had to dig for, and that he had to that reporter's name is Miles Herszenhorn , he had to really dig for that story and and find it.And I think that HKS students were, you know, grateful to see their views represented in a way that maybe the school hadn't really spoken out about. And a few weeks later, coincidentally, or perhaps not, so coincidentally, the Dean of HKS came out and apologized for what had happened with the office. So I think that is an example of kind of the the causal effects that our reporting can can have sometimes.Fallows 06:23Based on the experience, you and your colleagues have had, you know, day after day, late into the night and the paper, what would you bet 10 years from now, what proportion of them will be in some form of journalistic activity?Coronell 06:35I think the majority of them, I think, you know, I don't think that we all know exactly what it is we want to do. But I would be shocked, if you know, the majority of us more than half at least, aren't doing journalism in the future, because I think that the way that my dad puts it in, and that I agree with is that journalism is a little bit like a bug. Once it bites you it like you're done. That's who you are, if you like it, you will be like infected with want to do it in some form or another for the rest of your life.Fallows 07:15Number one. That is well put. Number two, I agree. So congratulations.Let me ask you about another theme. I have not been on universities for a very long time, I've spent my time in the journalism business. Something that one always reads about university life now involves constraints on freedom of discussion and free debate, etc. And every week, when you pick up the New York Times, or some news story about limits on campus discussion, how do you see that as somebody who is leading one of the sort of main implements of discussion and free debate on the most famous campus in the US? How what should people outside the academy think about the state of free debate within the academy now?Coronell 07:59Yeah, I think what I can weigh in on, you know, more specifically, is the state of that debate within our newspaper. And so that would be within our editorial pages, for example. And I, you know, what, say that I have been so privileged to get to know a group of people, the editorial board that is incredibly thoughtful, and it's debate, it's respectful. It welcomes people from different views and welcomes those views, to form nuanced takes and nuanced opinions on the things that we pine on it, those things are not always or sometimes not ever popular.But I think, to the credit of the editorial board, you know, and I think they've shown this, especially during my tenure is just the willingness to publish op eds, letters to the editors and dissenting takes on their their views in even when those takes, you know, really are quite critical of the editorial board. There's no room in the debate for ego or for kind of, you know, refusing to publish something because it's insulting or it's critical or anything like that. I think they, you know, really prioritize making sure that their purpose as a board is to serve as a springboard for debate debate, and to really kind of cultivate that dialogue on campus and to continue that conversation in our pages from other people. So what I would say is that, I think that what I would want people to know is that I think that debate on campus is something that is welcome. And, and that you know, that's that's,Fallows 09:47Is there ever an occasion where people say, Gee, 10 years ago, 20 years ago, I bet our counterparts could have made X or Y or Z argument, but we can't do that now because we're afraid to step on toes, which is the impression you get from most coverage of elite universities these days, but does that kind of feeling ever come up?Coronell 10:08I'm sure it does for you know, individuals and people here and there, but it's not something that I have ever heard, you know, the board editorial board express or a large group of people in our newspaper express.And I think actually, the Crimson has served as a venue for people who one might think would feel that way to have their opinions published and their pieces published, you know, within reason, obviously, we're, we have editorial standards, and we enforce those but those pieces are published. And I think that goes to show that, you know, our willingness to engage in debate and to cultivate that debate, and to make sure that it is a part of campus life and a part of, you know, journalism's life.Fallows 11:00One of the areas, which you and I have discussed over the past year was was the controversy on campus, about the Crimson publishing an editorial endorsing a BDS strategy for Harvard. What should the outside world know about the Crimsons decision to publish that editorial, and the blowback the Crimson received? Coronell 11:27With all editorials what the editorial board does is published the majority view of the board. So there are meetings, there are three meetings per week, in which a topic is posed and discussed and then voted on. And, you know, people should know that this was the the majority view of the board.I was present at the debate, it was a respectful one, in which no sort of, you know, objectionable or ad hominem attacks or anything like that was was made. It was a debate based on you before every debate, there is a reading list people must do in order to to a pine. So there are stories and articles from all sorts of publications, from the New York Times to Crimson articles. So I believe people were informed when they voted and made this decision.And, you know, I think I would say that they were aware as well that it would be an emotional topic to engage with, and one that many people would disagree with. But they still felt that it was worthwhile. At the time, this, this came on the heels of Israel apartheid week, which is a programming that happens on campus are hosted by the Palestinian solidarity committee. And what the board does is opine on topics that, you know, have recently happened on campus or things that are relevant. So that was a reason that it was, you know, relevant in that moment to opine on it. And, and they felt that, despite the fact that it would be an unpopular opinion with many, and that it would be one that would overturn precedent, that it was one that was worthwhile, and they felt that they, you know, had to speak on.And since then, I've been, you know, really proud of the board, because of the way that they have handled, you know, responses is to publish all nearly all of the letters that have come in disagreeing with them. And I think that really does paint a view of how fraught this debate and the topic is, and I think it has given a platform to both sides or to all sides to really have their say.Fallows 13:43To clarify, for those who don't know the workings of the Harvard Crimson, the editorial board is different from the editors of the paper. Would you explain that distinction?Coronell 13:52Absolutely. Yeah, so so so we have 10 boards across our papers. And one of those boards is the editorial board. And we have what's called news-ed divide, a news-ed wall. And we also have a news-biz wall and an ed-biz wall, which basically means that the people on the editorial board are only on the editorial board, they don't cover any of the topics on the new side. And they also don't make any of the business decisions that the Crimson does.So if you're on the editorial board, essentially, you are limited to attending the meetings to helping write the editorials into writing, you know, op eds or columns if you so choose. And that ensures that we have fair impartial coverage of all topics on campus and also that we don't have any business decisions that are in any way influenced by our editorial decisions that the editorial board makes. And I think that's important to note because, you know, we we don't ask our other editors what their opinions are on the editorial side become discussed because it's not, you know, part of their role. And the editorial board really only seeks to represent the majority view of the editorial board. And in that sense, it serves as a springboard for debate on campus.Fallows 15:08And this structure is more or less the one, The New York Times Washington Post, the LA Times, even the Wall Street Journal have. I save \"even\" because of their editorial board. But they all have their news operation is different from their editorial operation.It's a little different from the structure when I was in your job long ago, but had a sort of similar effect. The President, you know, Editor in Chief of the paper did not really was not really in charge of editorials. And so that is useful for people to know.And also, as you and I have discussed, I think most alumni, including me, were proud of the independence that the Crimson showed, and I believe that's been the main view from alumni of just thinking that is this a publication that is up to the students to decide, you know, what they were that they should say.So let me ask you about one other development in the Crimsons long history between my era and yours. The very first night I was in the newsroom, there was a single sheet and press while they had these giant sheets of paper, they were fed in one by one for the printing, then there became the press that I think you still have downstairs. But the Crimson is in the middle of an evolution from a print first operation to something else. So could you describe the process of Crimson how a historic college newspaper has decided to bridge the print and digital divide?Coronell 16:43it will answer Yeah. Yeah. So I think that it's a very, it's a debate, I mean, so it's a decision that was not taken lightly at all. And I think that we wanted to make sure that no matter what we did, we would remain, you know, the oldest continuously published college daily, and I think it's just a matter of what form that daily takes.I think that, you know, my colleagues and I, we, we all see the value of print, and how important it is to kind of have that physical paper to hold in your hands, and both from just a journalistic perspective, and you get to present content in a way that you don't otherwise.And also just the nostalgia historical value. And I think one of the reasons people joined the Crimson is because of that. So so I guess I'll just preface that discussion with that.But but it was a decision that was many months, years in the making, and it involved, you know, undergraduates, and it involved alumni, and it involved, you know, experts in journalism, such as you, you were, you know, a big voice and very helpful in making this decision.And I think what it came down to was that people really are not reading the print newspaper anymore. When you looked at the pickup rates, it was less than a third of students who were really picking up the papers on a daily basis. But at the same time, as you also know, I'm sure putting together a paper takes the entire day, and then some. And it just was a question of where of how we wanted to engage with our readers and what kind of content we wanted to give them and where to put our sites.Because while we have less than a third of pickup rate for the print newspaper, we also have over 30 million yearly views on our website. So I think it just became a question of, clearly our website is what is most frequented. So we should make sure that we are prioritizing that, while at the same time we are optimizing the newspaper and we are able to give our readers a very unique almost luxury readership experience, reimagining that paper and if that means doing so less frequently, I think that is without doubt the correct answer.Fallows 19:01And I will leave it to you at the proper time to announce exactly how those will be done. But every publication including the Atlantic where I worked for many years, and the oldest magazine has tried to balance its print and online presence. Everybody else is doing this.Let's go into one particular aspect of your printed online balance, which is the inflexible deadline of a daily print paper sort of shaped the whole rhythm of the day, you know, by 5pm, certain things had to be done by 8pm. Certain things had to be done in at 2am or whenever the presses had to roll. And that rhythm and inescapability of deadlines was part of a journalist's conditioning and the teamwork that went into it. So how can you -- what's the way that you recreate some of the good parts of that deadline consciousness in a 24/7 Publishing cycle?Raquel Coronell Uribe 19:56It's interesting because I think that really what made the decision And so clear to us are and what made the rhythm at which we were working impossible was that we were working with those inflexible print deadlines. But we were also working with online deadlines.So we basically had, you know, twice the deadlines and the same amount of time in the day. So I think that just by nature of a college newspaper, we will still have those deadlines. I mean, we will still we still plan to publish every single day.And I think actually, what this creates is a more rigorous deadline structure. Because, you know, if news breaks at 2pm, and you have until you know, 4am, to post that news to get it up, now, you actually do not have that cushion, that 12 hour cushion until it has to be written for the presses, you have to have it up almost immediately, in order to be relevant to readers, you know, you really have to make sure you're informing people in real time. And I think being able to focus on online more than we had before, it kind of allows us to follow that deadline structure in which we are trying to get the news up as soon as it happens.And also, I think there's a question of timeliness. And if you publish Tuesday's news on Friday, well, you know that that's no longer relevant to readers in the same way it would be on on the same Tuesday.Fallows 21:24I&#8217;d like to ask you just one other question. What's the main thing that's a reality of your life as the first Latina woman, president of the Harvard Crimson, at the helm of this historic newspaper? What's the main thing about your life and responsibilities that you think people don't understand? Or they'd be surprised to know about your daily life here?Coronell 21:55Oh, that's a good question. I think people may not know that I'm more or less live here.James Fallows 22:13[Laughs] I know that! Why do you think I lived in Adams House? It's like 20 feet away from the paper.Raquel Coronell Uribe 22:19I wish I was in Adams. And I'm more or less live here. And I think from from the moment I wake up to the moment I go to bed, I'm doing Crimson work.And for me, as President, I kind of have a hand in all things. And that's anything from if there's a leak in the roof, I have to make sure that we're taking care of it to you know, an hypersensitive story or something like that, making sure that we are reviewing it to make sure that our reporting is, you know, legal, ethical, and, you know, all of the standards that we impose upon that.So I think I think that that is one thing. My roommate jokes that you know, she she has never seen me less than then when I, you know, became became a part of the Crimson and jokes that my new roommates are all Crimson editors. Fallows 23:11We did not prepare this question at all. But I'll say there's nothing you could possibly have said, that would more reassure me about the current management of the Crimson or more suggest continuity over the eons.So Raquel, thank you very much for taking this time to talk. Congratulations on what you're doing and to all of your colleagues and the next stages for the .Coronell 23:32Thank you so much. That means the world to me. Thank you.Subscribe now",

        "description": "On the tarmac in Zhuhai, in the fall of 2006. We were really, really glad to be safely on the ground. From left: Peter Claeys, Walter Wang, James Fallows. This post is off the U.S. political news of the moment, and about longer-term trends. It is about what the latest update on China&#8217;s aerospace progress tells us about its longer-term ambitions and possibilities.Summary: complicated projects are hard, even for the Chinese.China Airborne&#8212;back then.The photo at the top of this post was from the most dangerous flight I ever took. It was in late October, 2006; I had arrived a few months earlier in China; and I was helping my dear friend Peter Claeys, wearing a hat at left in this photo, as he ferried a small airplane from Changsha, in central China, to a far southern Chinese airport near Hong Kong, for the Zhuhai airshow.(I&#8217;m at right in that photo. Our friend Walter Wang, who rode in the back seat, is in the middle.)Peter Claeys, who I am sad to say died in 2018, was then the dealer in Asia for Cirrus aircraft, the same kind I had owned and flown in the U.S. Thanks to my six years&#8217; previous experience as a Cirrus owner in the U.S., I was, improbably, one of the most experienced Cirrus pilots anywhere within the region. I used to get email and phone offers all the time for an exciting new career as a freight pilot in China. One caller even thought to add the term, &#8220;Would you like to be a freight dog?&#8221;Peter and I sat in the front seats for the flight together from Changsha to Zhuhai&#8212;he in the left seat, me in the right. The trusting Walter Wang was in the back. The three of us came closer to not surviving than in any other small-plane flight I&#8217;ve ever made. The expressions you see on our faces above are of genuine relief. I explain why we were so worried, and how we made it, in the first chapter of my book China Airborne, which I wrote in 2011 while we were living in Beijing and which came out in 2012.Subscribe now&#8216;Marker Industries.&#8217;The point of China Airborne was that aerospace was one of several &#8220;marker industries&#8221; that would tell whether the Chinese economy could go from being a huge-scale, low-wage global subcontractor, to matching the U.S., Germany, Japan, and so on as a high-end, high-wage, global research-and-technology power.My argument was that in these marker industries&#8212;aviation and aerospace, pharmaceuticals, high-end software, the university-research establishment&#8212;lasting success was harder than it seemed. Going from a peasant economy, to low-wage outsourced manufacturing, as China had done from the 1960s through the early 2000s? Very hard. Going from giant factories to world-standard research and design labs? Even harder &#8212; or so I argued.A few hours before the photo shown above, as Peter Claeys helps a crew in Changsha fuel up the plane for the flight to Zhuhai. The &#8220;normal&#8221; gas pumps weren&#8217;t working. So this gas had been siphoned from an old Soviet military plane parked at the airport. (James Fallows)Why was this so hard? It was because so many different organizations had to work together so smoothly, in ways that were both informal and tightly regulated.In aviation this meant that the military had to work with civilian authorities. Companies had to work with the government. Pilots had to work in give-and-take ways with air-traffic controllers. (U.S. controllers sequence airliners for landing with much, much less separation than controllers do at Chinese airports. That is because the pilots and controllers trust one another to keep the system running&#8212;safely. I talked about how and why in the book.) Regulators had to extend trust to a certain degree&#8212;but know when to crack down. It was not a coincidence, I argued, that around the world aviation safety had become a proxy for economic and technical sophistication in general. And I told the story of how Chinese airlines had gone from some of the most dangerous in the world, to some of the safest, through a barely publicized partnership with American institutions&#8212;the FAA, Boeing, United Airlines, and others.ShareMy book China Airborne, which  came out during the Romney-Obama re-election race of 2012, was received largely as a novelty item in the U.S.  I was just back from China and went on the Colbert show, where he was mainly asking &#8220;Can you believe these wacky Chinese?&#8221; with their plan to build 100 new airports. It was the only one of my books that The Atlantic did not excerpt. The economist Tyler Cowen won my lasting gratitude by saying that this was &#8220;one of the best books on China (ever).&#8221;But mainly, and properly, I joined the limitless crowd of people writing about China, and adding our triangulations to the endless efforts to provide a picture of China, through our own portrayals. (As my wife, Deb, did in her widely celebrated book, Dreaming in Chinese.) None of us will ever &#8220;understand&#8221; China. (See also: &#8220;understanding&#8221; America.) We&#8217;ll all add what we&#8217;ve seen. With Peter Claeys on a refueling stop in Taiwan in 2008. He said that his hairdo was optimized for strong winds, like the 40-kt wind on arrival there.ShareChina Airborne&#8212;now.This weekend the Financial Times has an excellent long article about how the Chinese aerospace industry has &#8230; found it harder to compete against Boeing and Airbus than Chinese leaders might have foreseen.The article, by Arjun Neil Alim, is behind the FT&#8217;s no-exceptions, no-nonsense paywall, so I won&#8217;t quote from it at length. I will say that almost everything envisioned more than a decade ago as a possible obstacle to China&#8217;s entry into the Boeing/Airbus duopoly, has in fact proven to be a major problem.For instance (and paraphrasing):In 2012, I argued that the market for Chinese-made airliners seemed likely to be limited to China&#8217;s own regional carriers, plus the likes of Air Laos and others that depended on Chinese government aid. In 2022, that seems to be the case.In 2012, it seemed to me (and others) that it would be hard for Chinese manufacturers to match the world-wide sales, supply, maintenance, and training network of Boeing and Airbus. In 2022, that&#8217;s a big problem.In 2012, I argued that &#8220;Chinese&#8221;-made airliners were likely to be essentially envelopes containing high-value engines, avionics, software, and other components made in Europe or North America. In 2022, that&#8217;s the reality for China&#8217;s new &#8220;home-grown&#8221; airliner, the C919.In 2012 and in fact for years before, the Chinese military was &#8220;preparing&#8221; to open its domestic airspace to private civilian aviation. In 2022 it is preparing still.Update: the book also had a section on why China was likely to land a person on the Moon before it developed a full-scale rival to Boeing or Airbus. Short version: a moon-shot is an enormous, focused, centrally run, all-hands-on-deck effort, and a certain amount of trial-and-error is expected. (The &#8220;successful&#8221; U.S. moon missions involved several fatal setbacks.) By contrast, a full-scale aerospace system involves millions of passengers, thousands of airplanes, many thousands of crew, tens of thousands of daily takeoffs and landings, and many other elements all working in decentralized fashion at the same time&#8212;with an expected safety tolerance of zero. It takes a long time to get to this level.If you can read the FT, I hope you&#8217;ll consult Arjun Neil Alim&#8217;s article for more. He confirms that almost every obstacle foreseen a decade ago has in fact impeded Chinese aerospace ambitions.Does this mean that the Chinese economy has hit a ceiling in these extremely complex, multi-system, high-end global systems? Of course not. Nothing about China&#8217;s potential is limited or knowable. As I said in China Airborne, quoting my friend and mentor Liam Casey: the more you know about China, the less you know.But it&#8217;s a reminder that every country has limits, and complications, and problems. Until someone shows me a reason to think otherwise, I&#8217;m sticking to this hard-earned view: The U.S. looks most fragile and vulnerable from a distance. And most resilient, as you look case-by-case and up close. And for China, the opposite.Old plane at the Zhuhai airport, ten years ago. (James Fallows)Subscribe now",

        "description": "From the White House site today.I&#8217;m getting back into the online realm&#8212;just in time for news this morning that Joe Biden has tested positive for Covid, and for the final presentation this evening of the January 6 committee&#8217;s evidence. Three points before this evening&#8217;s events.1. Getting Covid, when old.I am roughly two presidential-terms younger than Joe Biden. He is 79. I am 72. I can only begin to imagine how disorienting it is for Biden to be a living fossil in American politics, considering that at age 29 he was one of the youngest people ever elected to the U.S. Senate. (Anyone first known as remarkably &#8220;young&#8221; in a particular job, as Biden was, has to adjust to becoming known as &#8220;old.&#8221; Bill Clinton, now senior statesman, was a boy-wonder governor of Arkansas. Jimmy Carter, the oldest-ever former president, was among the youngest presidents when sworn in. Al Gore was in Congress in his 20s and first ran for president at age 39.) But I&#8217;ll share my experience of what it is like, as a &#8220;mature&#8221; American, to finally get a positive test result. This happened to me about six weeks ago.I had tried like crazy to avoid exposure. Some people are now &#8220;double-boosted&#8221;&#8212;the original two vaccinations, plus two boosters. I&#8217;ll just say, I&#8217;ve had at least that many shots. My wife, Deb, and I barely left our home during the first year of the pandemic. Since then, we&#8217;ve avoided most travel, and have gone by car or our propeller plane whenever we could. But about six weeks ago, I suddenly tested positive&#8212;on the excellent free library-based PCR tests in DC, confirmed on our rapid-result home antigen test. How did I get it? No doubt by going to a college reunion a few days earlier&#8212;either en route through airport exposure, where people with violent hacking coughs wore no masks (though I had a N95 mask on the whole time), or at a reunion dinner. Who knows exactly where or how. It doesn&#8217;t matter.I would rather not have gotten infected. I live in fear of long-term Covid effects. But once it happened, it wasn&#8217;t that bad. For two days I had a cough and felt tired. Then for about ten days I felt entirely normal&#8212;but stayed hermit-like by myself in a separate part of the house. Deb, who kept her distance, has still always tested negative. Via Zoom, I talked with my doctor the first day I tested positive. I asked about Paxlovid; she said that unless the symptoms got worse (which they didn&#8217;t), I should avoid it or any other drugs (which I did). By Day 11 after the first positive test, I was testing negative again. Soon after that, I was able to do a public event in DC&#8212;a wonderful Politics &amp; Prose bookstore discussion with the author Patrick Radden Keefe, about his new book Rogues. For now, my Covid experience seems to be over.Moral? You&#8217;d rather not get this disease. But if you&#8217;re vaccinated, it doesn&#8217;t have to be that bad, even if you&#8217;re old. Let&#8217;s hope that is the case for Biden.Share2. The White House press corps has lost its mind, or at least its perspective.More than twenty-five years ago, in my book Breaking the News, I wrote about the gulf between the gotcha obsessions of the White House press corps, and the issues most Americans were most interested in learning about.The press is supposed to be a proxy for the public&#8217;s interests. Too often, it&#8217;s a proxy only for itself.Today offered a classic illustration&#8212;if you can stand to watch it, which I recommend that you don&#8217;t. It&#8217;s the C-Span clip of this afternoon&#8217;s full White House briefing, when officials Karine Jean-Pierre (the press secretary) and Dr. Ashish Jha (the Covid advisor) answered questions about Biden&#8217;s diagnosisThe questions included: Where was a comma placed, and why, in the White House doctor&#8217;s letter? (Time 30:30). And, was a White House videographer unfairly exposed when recording a video of Biden that was shot outdoors.  (Time 13:17)? And, what about wild hypotheticals? (Time 50:09). And, how was the White House going to track people Biden had met recently? (Trust me: this is not hard. Anyone who has met an incumbent president, remembers it.)  That is, the representatives of the public asked questions it would not have occurred to any other Americans to wonder about.The whole tone was nit-picking and prosecutorial. And it reflected no awareness of the difference between the last time a serving president tested positive for Covid&#8212;when Trump was rushed to Walter Reed, in secrecy and with lies about his real condition&#8212;and now, when Biden&#8217;s team promptly and routinely announced the testing news.&#8220;There are real flashbacks to when Trump got Covid, and he ended up spending several days at Walter Reed,&#8221; a White House reporter for a major network told the network&#8217;s anchor just after the press conference. (I&#8217;m intentionally not using the reporter&#8217;s name, or the network&#8217;s; it&#8217;s a systemic rather than an individual problem.) Actually, there aren&#8217;t &#8220;real flashbacks.&#8221; Trump lied about his condition, and co-opted his staff in that effort. He was also in much more serious medical peril, in an era before vaccinations and boosters. Comments like these are meant as &#8220;context,&#8221; but appear without any context. History is important. Just plugging in &#8220;here&#8217;s something that happened before&#8221; isn&#8217;t history and doesn&#8217;t help. I&#8217;ll say it again: the hoary phrase, &#8220;See things steady, and see them whole&#8221; is a goal for the media. These are words you won&#8217;t see in the White House press room, or a TV green room.Share3. Where the January 6 Hearings Leave Us.The committee has so far done an exceptional job in laying out its case, and keeping its members from getting in the way. I gave some of the early play-by-play here. Soon I&#8217;ll tune in, and plan to weigh in by tomorrow. Breaking the News is a reader-supported publication.

        "description": "Three of the books on my mind: from John Mack Faragher, Patrick Radden Keefe, and Craig McNamara. (James Fallows)This post is not about the struggles of the moment. I have written about those recently here and here.Instead it follows an installment from last fall, about books (by friends) that I think deserve notice. One of them I talked about went on to win the Edgar award, for Best Novel! I take no credit but am glad.Why books &#8220;by friends&#8221;? If you are in this business, a lot of the people you know are writers. Some of them are very good.Here are some good books by good writers I would like to recommend.Share1) Imagine a City, by Mark VanhoenackerI&#8217;ll start with the book I don&#8217;t have a photo of, above. It is Imagine a City, by Mark Vanhoenacker, whom I have corresponded with for years, although we have never met.Vanhoenacker&#8217;s day job is as an airline pilot. He might have been in command when you were flying internationally.His &#8220;real&#8221; job (though the airline would not like for me to say this) is as a writer. I&#8217;ve mentioned time and again that at the dawn of aviation, more than 100 years ago, the widespread assumption was that any poet, any writer, any historian, any artist &#8212; anyone who thought about perspectives on the world, anyone who would benefit from this new vantage point &#8212; would want to learn to fly. That is because of the unmatched view of the Earth from a few thousand feet up.Mark Vanhoenacker, in one of his airliners. (Mark Vanhoenacker)Mark Vanhoenacker has been the modern representation of that idea. His book Skyfaring several years ago was an elegant and eloquent paean to the art and science of flying. His new book, Imagine a City: A Pilot&#8217;s Journey Across the Urban World, shares some of what he has learned while on the ground.I can&#8217;t judge how he is as a pilot &#8212; presumably, far more accomplished than I would ever be. I can say that he is a really good writer. Share2) Because Our Fathers Lied, by Craig McNamaraMy wife, Deb, and I have known Margy McNamara Pastor and her late husband Bob Pastor for decades, since the time Bob and I worked together in the Carter administration. Over the past decade Deb and I have become friends with Margy&#8217;s brother Craig McNamara, mainly through visits to his walnut farm in rural Winters, California.The world knows both of them as children of Margaret and Robert McNamara, the latter a central figure in the U.S. disaster of the Vietnam war.Craig has written an extraordinary memoir of growing up in these circumstances, and the burdens and privileges of the childhood he had. His book is funny, touching, well-written, surprising, enlightening, and brutally honest. It is a powerful description of the political and personal stakes of coming to terms with a complicated father, in a tragic and traumatic era in world history.&#8212;If you were entranced by the Errol Morris film The Fog of War, you&#8217;ll want to read Craig McNamara&#8217;s account of what it was like to see that film, with his father present.&#8212;If you&#8217;ve never heard of the film The Fog of War or even of Robert McNamara, you will be enlightened by this book. Seriously, you will be glad to have read this. I am glad Craig wrote it.Share3) California: An American History, by John Mack Faragher.John Mack Faragher is known to the world as a history professor at Yale. He is known to me as the oldest brother of the large family that grew up in the house immediately next to ours, in the small inland town of Redlands, California. His younger brothers, Danny and Jimmy, were my contemporaries all through grade school and high school. Their younger siblings were friends of my younger sisters and brother. John was the guy ahead of us all, who had &#8220;gone East,&#8221; to graduate school at Yale.Now he has written a great, accessible, edgy history of our best state. I recommend it.Share4) Vanishing Asia, by Kevin Kelly.Kevin Kelly is known in the tech world as a co-founder of Wired and an all-round tech guru. He is also a very talented photographer.From decades&#8217; worth of travel and reporting, he has a huge, three-volume, 1000-page photo collection called Vanishing Asia. The volumes are: West Asia, about Turkey and its environs; Central Asia, about India and the region; and East Asia, covering China and Japan and their neighbors.It is a stupendous life&#8217;s work, and worth seeing and learning from if you have the chance. It really is extraordinary. It is more a museum project than something most people will have in their homes, but is worth support and notice. Here is a sample photo, from Afghanistan:By Kevin Kelly.Share5) Bonus: Rogues, by Patrick Radden Keefe.Last week, at a Politics &amp; Prose bookstore event in D.C., I had a chance to interview Patrick Radden Keefe about his collection of magazine journalism, Rogues.You may know Keefe from his epic recent books Say Nothing, about Northern Ireland, and Empire of Pain, about the Sackler family and the world that they madeIf you liked those books, you will enjoy this one as well. And even if you don&#8217;t know those books, you should know this one.More books, more writers, more suggestions to come. Subscribe now",

        "description": "In the 1700s this French court got by with only two judges. The U.S. has nine Justices on its highest court, and perhaps should have more. (Getty Images.) No one has &#8220;the&#8221; answer for a Supreme Court that has become the least representative, least accountable, and yet most reckless branch of federal government. I won&#8217;t again make the argument for why I think all three of those adjectives are appropriate. You can see it here and here.&#8212;The summary is: The nine members of the Supreme Court are virtually the only Americans free to exercise such sweeping life-and-death power as long as they choose, on whatever logic they choose, for as long as fate allows. As a bonus, they are the only members of the federal judiciary, and practically the only federal employees, not subject to conflict-of-interest, ethics, or financial-disclosure laws.  &#8212;The only limits on their power have been internal: a sense of ethics, propriety, precedent, restraint, institutional balance, and commitments they made when seeking confirmation. Which is to say, for at least five of them, no limits at all. Remember that one of them is married to a person who resists subpoenas  about her role in the January 6 insurrection&#8212;while her husband rules on cases involving that very event. It is hard to see how a democracy functions, long-term, with such limitless power in such unrepresentative and unaccountable hands. That is related to the critique that Elena Kagan made in her dissent from the disastrous ruling last week dis-empowering the Environmental Protection Agency, and is parallel to the case I made here.Thus it is all the more important to look for partial answers, for steps in the right direction. That is the purpose of this post. ShareA &#8216;Plan B&#8217; idea for the Court.Yesterday a group called Fix the Court released proposed legislation with a Plan A / Plan B structure.&#8212;The main effect of the law, Plan A, would be to enact 18-year fixed terms for Supreme Court Justices, as many groups (including the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and several U.S. Representatives) have proposed, and is long overdue.&#8212;The innovation of the law is its &#8220;contingency&#8221; provision. The Constitutional validity of any term-limit rules might ultimately be appealed to the same Supreme Court whose members would be affected. And suppose they ruled against it? To keep themselves in their seats?If that happened, according to this provision, Plan B would kick in: the Court would automatically be expanded, from nine members to 13. The logic of this approach was laid out by G. Michael Parsons, of NYU&#8217;s law school, in a detailed law-review article and an op-ed last year.Parsons summed up the argument this way:Popular plans [to reform the Court] get watered down to preempt legal concerns, while controversial policies dominate the debate based on their constitutional pedigree. For example,&nbsp;Fix The Court&#8217;s&nbsp;plan&nbsp;would require justices to take senior status after 18 years (a widely popular approach), but the plan exempts sitting justices to avoid potential legal issues.&nbsp;Take Back the Court, meanwhile, argues that packing the court is the only viable option because anything else&nbsp;might be invalidated.But what if this choice between popularity and predictability is a false one? Rather than settling on one plan, Congress instead should use a rare legislative tool known as &#8220;backup law&#8221; to layer its policy preferences from most politically desirable to most constitutionally secure. If the court holds the first preference unconstitutional, the second will automatically take its place.&nbsp;Yesterday I spoke with Gabe Roth, head of Fix the Court, about the reasoning and the politics behind this &#8220;backup law&#8221; approach.A transcript of our talk is below; I will post the audio recording as soon as I can. The main point of the discussion is Roth&#8217;s emphasis that accountability for the court should be a bipartisan cause. Since the days of the Declaration of Independence, few Americans have wanted unaccountable robed figures to have sweeping powers over all of the rest of us.Gabe Roth explains why a two-part bill, like the one he is proposing (based on Parsons&#8217;s articles), may be a practical way to start.I have condensed this transcript of our talk, and added emphasis in bold, below.Give a gift subscriptionJames Fallows:&nbsp; Please tell me the back story on this proposal.Gabe Roth:&nbsp;I run Fix The Court, We&#8217;re a nonprofit organization. We've been around for almost eight years. We worked on the Ro Khanna term limits bill in 2020 and 2021, that would have it so justices in the future would only serve for 18 years.I'm always scouring the legal and academic world to see a lot of new articles and just see what people are talking about that I just got really intrigued by this idea from G. Michael Parsons, with the concept of the backup law. As the Supreme Court has become so powerful and so unaccountable, it would be a way for Congress to reclaim some power.This idea of &#8220;backup law&#8221; or &#8220;contingent design&#8221; has just always sort of stuck with me. I feel like there&#8217;s just a lot of energy around court expansion, but I don&#8217;t personally think that that&#8217;s a solution. But I wanted to see if there was a way to bring that idea together with term limits. And I thought &#8220;contingent design&#8221; accountability would be a way to do it. It&#8217;s been running around in my brain for a while. It became more acute in the last two weeks after the awful court decisions.Q: Forgive me for not knowing: Do you have a legislative staff background yourself? How did you know how to do this?A: My background is, I went to journalism school for grad school at Northwestern, and then did local news and hated it. So then I went into political consulting and did that for about 10 years&#8230; I started something called the Coalition for court transparency, with cameras in the Supreme Court and then bring your cameras to the lower courts. That didn&#8217;t really go great.I realized that it&#8217;s not the cameras issue that makes the Supreme Court the most powerful, least accountable part of our federal government. So I started my own group called Fix The Court. We&#8217;ve been working with lawmakers&#8230; We actually got a bill just signed by Joe Biden, the Courtroom Ethics and Transparency Act, that&#8217;s basically a STOCK Act for the judiciary. It means if you&#8217;re a judge, you have to put your financial disclosures online, and report your stock transactions within 45 days of a purchase or a sale. The Congress has had to do this since 2012. But the judiciary hasn&#8217;t had to. We got a law passed after the Wall Street Journal&#8217;s reporting on some of the ethical lapses and missed stock recusals&#8230;So we do a lot of mostly bipartisan work. After I put up the proposal you&#8217;re asking about, the Khanna one and the backup provision, we&#8217;ve gotten a fair amount of calls from the Hill. People are interested in it.I don&#8217;t know if anyone&#8217;s going to introduce it or if it will go anywhere. But I wanted to start by saying like, this is a thing that could be done. And then seeing where the interest goes from there.Q: You mentioned you&#8217;ve been doing bipartisan work. Are there any Republicans you can name who&#8217;ve been interested in these kinds of measures?A: We didn&#8217;t really start focusing on term limits until mid 2015. And we had we had a lot of support from Republicans. But then Donald Trump won. And it&#8217;s been basically silent since then.There have been a few [GOP] House members here and there. I&#8217;m not going to discuss off-the-record conversations. But we&#8217;ve had a backbencher from Texas. A backbencher from Arkansas.But back in 2015 and 2016 [before Trump], I was hanging out with Mike Huckabee and Ben Carson on the on the campaign trail, and they were talking about term limits. Ted Cruz wrote about it. Marco Rubio talked about it. Rand Paul. I went to Iowa in January 2016. And all the events that I went to, term limits would come up without me even asking about it. And that was really exciting, at the Republican events.Now they don&#8217;t want to talk about court reform, even though the basic outlines of the 18-year proposal were put together by a co-founder of the Federalist Society. The great irony of this whole thing is that Steve Calabresi wrote the seminal article on 18-year term limits. And now the Republicans are like: &#8216;Oh, we're good. We don't need reform.&#8217;Again the irony. I'm 39 So I would say for the vast majority of my adult life, I have associated movements for term limits with conservatives. It's conservatives who are introducing a Congressional term limits bill. It&#8217;s conservatives that are signing these pledges to pass term limit laws for legislatures in many states. But that's really shifted, at least for the Supreme Court.Most of the work I did on Supreme Court term limits occurred when everyone thought Hillary Clinton was going to be president. I definitely had liberal friends at the time that were like, &#8220;What are you doing? Hillary's gonna win.&#8221; I'm like, &#8220;This is a nonpartisan idea, that the Supreme Court shouldn't be philosopher kings. They shouldn't be as old as the hills ruling from on high for three or four decades.&#8221;I wouldn't say I&#8217;m surprised, but there's some disappointment that court reform has become such a partisan football. In fact both parties should want the vast majority of the decisions impacting our country to be made by their elected representatives, and not nine lawyers in robes.Q: A question about ethics and accountability. As you mentioned earlier, there are ethics provisions for lower court judges. Is there any actual reason these cannot be applied to the Supreme Court? Or is it just custom and deference?A: That's an open question. The current code of conduct for U.S. judges was written by the Judicial Conference. So that comprises lower court judges. You probably can&#8217;t have, you know, your Triple-A affiliate telling the major leagues what to do. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re a baseball guy, but if the pitch clock is working for the Nashville Sounds, which is my Triple-A affiliate team growing up, it should work just fine for the Milwaukee Brewers, the Pittsburgh Pirates and the Chicago White Sox, et cetera.But that&#8217;s the theory about why what exists for lower courts doesn&#8217;t apply to SCOTUS.In terms of whether or not Congress could pass a law about court ethics, I think they absolutely could. It just hasn't really been tested. And when you look at other provisions of federal law that touch on judicial ethics, in a lot of cases the Supreme Court voluntarily follows them. For example, the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. William Rehnquist wrote a memo in 1991, around the time that went into effect, saying: We're not going to opine on the constitutionality of it. But we believe, as Justices, that the proscriptions against accepting gifts are reasonable, so we're going to abide by them.And then back in 1978, the post-Watergate Ethics in Government Act required judges to file annual financial disclosure reports like members of Congress and members of the executive branch. Lower federal judges actually sued to be exempt from that. They thought it was too intrusive. It went all the way to the Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court declined to review it. What ended up standing was the lower court decision which said, basically: Guys, it's not that big of an imposition, you can like write down, you know, the fact that you own stock in IBM once a year. But the Supreme Court has never like officially applied it.They know the writing&#8217;s on the wall in terms of ethics. To me, it&#8217;s a really weak argument that Congress couldn't impose an ethics code, or requires the justices to write one. If Congress has the power to set where the Court sits, when it sits and how much money it gets each year, and what type of jurisdiction it has which type of cases, it goes to follow that they could set some basic guidelines on types of behavior.Q: One more question. I like the idea of the backup plan. I hope it passes. But suppose it doesn&#8217;t. What Is To Be Done about the Court?A: Let me take a step back. I have an answer to that, but I want to paint it in another way.I want to go back to when I was in Iowa in 2016. I was going to all these different [Republican] candidate events, and everyone was talking about term limits.But then Scalia died, and Ginsburg got sick, and all the discussion changed.If I go back to those times, and think about the way the Supreme Court has had all this power accumulating over the years, I would have assumed that in 2017 and 2018 there would be all sorts of proposals from Congress on how to rein in the Court&#8217;s power. The writing was on the wall. And Ro Khanna did introduce his bill. But there needs to be a much more full-scale public debate about what is the path forward, to rein in a Court that has outsized power.And that to me is what part you know, part of the reason we're putting this proposal out is, we want there to be more folks in Congress discussing ways to rein in the Court. Congress has let atrophy the muscles that it has to rein in outsize judicial power. There may be multiple different ways of getting to the end goal of Article One government [the Congress] reclaiming its power. We need to get there,I'm not naive, I don't think that this [backstop] bill is going to be passed in the next 180 or so days left in the Congress. But I think over time, as you see these different proposals out there, and especially once there's a Democratic leadership change, I think you'll have a chance of something going the distance. Clearly the term limits bill and the court expansion bill don&#8217;t have the support of the [Democratic] leadership now. But we need to think of creative proposals that might get their support, or get other folks to push the leadership on these existing proposals.I think this is addition by addition and that over time, we'll get to the point where a majority of the majority realizes that something needs to be done.Is this &#8220;the&#8221; answer? No, and Roth does not pretend it is. But it is a place to start. It is a Thing That Could Be Done.Subscribe now",

        "description": "The British cartoonist James Gillray, imagining in the early 1800s the plight of American democracy more than 200 years later. (Getty Images.)America prides itself on being a &#8220;young&#8221; country, which it certainly is in cultural terms and in demographics. The median age in the U.S. is now just over 38&#8212;about a decade younger than Japan or Germany, many years below that of most European countries. For as long as there has been global pop culture, the U.S. has been a self-renewing fount of what is fresh and new.But in governmental terms, this &#8220;young&#8221; country is not just mature but geriatric. I&#8217;m not talking about the people who now run the branches of government, old as many of them may be. I&#8217;m talking about the branches themselves, under the shaggy balance-of-powers, evolving-democracy system set up in 1787. The United Kingdom and some other countries have lines of succession going back even before the signing of the U.S. Constitution. But practically no other modern nation still runs on rules set up long before the use of electricity, or knowledge of the germ theory of disease&#8212;from the days when no image could be captured except in a drawing, when the only means of instant communication was through drums or smoke signals, when the fastest means of transportation was the horse. From the days when millions of people within the new United States were held in slavery.Of course these revolutions in technology don&#8217;t directly affect governance. (Slavery obviously did.) But they illustrate how long ago this one country&#8217;s rules were set. Other countries are not like this. They have changed their rules, with the times, more substantially than the U.S. has.Has the United States grown to behemoth size and strength because of these antique rules? There are people who will argue that is so. I think they need to get out more, and see more of the world. My line has always been that, on the contrary, only a country with as much already in its favor as the U.S. has&#8212; size, location, assets, natural riches, ability to absorb endless waves of newcomers and become the platform for their success&#8212;could have gone so far for so long with this defective framework. We have succeeded in spite of our antiquated rules, rather than because of them. Countries that weren&#8217;t as &#8220;lucky&#8221; as the U.S. had to go back to the drawing board long ago.Which brings us to luck. ShareA &#8216;fortunate&#8217; country, shaped by luck good and bad.In the fundamentals of its place in the world, the United States is very fortunate. But it has been profoundly shaped by incidents of luck, good and bad. &#8212;The good has mainly involved certain leaders, in certain times. What if George Washington had dreamed of clinging to power after his first two terms, rather than stepping aside? What if Abraham Lincoln had not been available in 1861? Or Franklin Roosevelt in 1933 and 1941? Or Martin Luther King in the early Civil Rights era? Or someone more impulsive and insecure than John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis?&#8212;The bad has mainly involved moments of abysmal history-changing misfortune. What if Aaron Burr&#8217;s bullet had been a few inches off, rather than hitting Alexander Hamilton in the torso? Or John Wilkes Booth&#8217;s bullet? Or Lee Harvey Oswald&#8217;s? Or James Earl Ray&#8217;s? Or Sirhan Sirhan&#8217;s? What if the Palm Beach County registrar had not produced &#8220;butterfly ballots&#8221; in 2000? What if George W. Bush had paid more attention to the al Qaeda warning memos a few months later? What if James Comey had kept his peace one week before the election in 2016? What if the major media had realized that &#8220;But her emails!&#8221; was a stupid and destructive theme to keep harping on? What if, what if, what if.A string of intentional actions and luck have brought us to the current thin-ice moment of national governance. I laid out both categories in a previous post here. &#8212;The intention includes Mitch McConnell&#8217;s sequence of stonewalling one Supreme Court nomination, and ramming another through on a rocket-docket basis. Plus gerrymandering, and weaponization of the filibuster, and much more.&#8212;The bad luck includes Ruth Bader Ginsburg&#8217;s reckless bet that at age 80 she could outlast Barack Obama&#8217;s second term in office and beyond, rather than putting her successor&#8217;s appointment in Obama&#8217;s hands. What if, what if: If Obama had appointed a successor to Ginsburg just after his re-election in 2013, and if any Republicans had dared counter Mitch McConnell&#8217;s stonewall of the Garland nomination in 2016, none of what the Court has done in this past month could have happened. Roe, gun control, the EPA, gerrymandering, church and state, the Indian Laws, the foreshadowing of more, and more radical to come&#8212;none of it. What if.By intention, and by luck, June 30, 2022, brings the U.S. to a moment when all three branches of its now-antique governing system are under exceptional strain.Donate SubscriptionsThree branches, all struggling.&#8212;The executive branch has until recently been under control of a man actively plotting to overturn election results by force. And who apparently was thwarted only by &#8220;luck&#8221;&#8212;that some of his associates, young and old, decided not to go along.&#8212;As for the judiciary, the Supreme Court has a new majority arising in circumstances that to anyone with a judicial temperament would have dictated restraint. Those circumstances? One person in a seat someone else should be occupying; another, rammed through on election eve; the third, Bret Kavanaugh. And all three appointed by a man who took office with minority support, and with the least regard for the law or democracy of anyone ever to sit in the White House&#8212;as every one of these Justices is fully aware. And the senior member of their bloc being married to someone credibly accused of abetting the January 6 insurrection, and resisting Congressional requests that she testify about it.Yet in these circumstances, where stepping back would be the wisest course, they have instead swung for the fences. They have overturned whatever they felt like, based on a high-school-debate level selective rummaging through  &#8220;history&#8221; (I speak from experience) and a radio-talk-show host&#8217;s glee in &#8220;owning the libs.&#8221; It is as if Hannity, Carlson, and Jesse Watters had been given the controls. The judiciary has gone rogue, in a way no living American had previously seen. (As I wrote online after the Indian Law ruling, the Court&#8217;s motto has been changed to l&#8217;etat, c&#8217;est nous.  Which I will intentionally mis-translate as, &#8220;We are the law.&#8221;) Anyone who in 2022 still respects Donald Trump, can in 2022 still respect this radical court. These rest of us shouldn&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t.&#8212;In the legislative branch, we have a Congressional committee that has done an exceptional job of investigating, collating, connecting, and presenting material, as discussed here. But they are nine members, of 435 in the House. And two Republicans, of 210.Of those 435 total, all of them should be out registering their patriotic alarm about what they have learned from the hearings, and their patriotic determination that the United States remain a democracy under rule of law. So should all 100 Senators.Liz Cheney, of Wyoming, made a speech to exactly that effect last night at the Reagan Library. I disagree with Liz Cheney on virtually every point of policy. I agree entirely with what she said there &#8212;and admire her lethally calm presentations during committee hearings.But the number of Republican Senators and Representatives who have spoken up for the working of democracy is &#8230; anyone? I hope to be corrected, and to learn that the number of patriots is more than zero. I will collect any of their names here.ShareCan luck run out?Here are the people who, according to recent testimony, the U.S. is &#8220;lucky&#8221; to have had at the right place, at the right time:&#8212;Jeffrey Rosen, and his colleagues Richard Donoghue and Steven Engel at the Department of Justice, who defied Trump&#8217;s orders to announce that the election was stolen, in contrast to the complaisant Jeffrey Clark.&#8212;Brad Raffensperger and Gabriel Sterling, Republicans in charge of Georgia elections; Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman, also of Georgia; Rusty Bowers of Arizona; and others who refused to knuckle under to Trump election claims. And their counterparts in other states.&#8212;Cassidy Hutchinson, who gave her extraordinarily poised and straight-arrow testimony this week, centering on the crucial, uncontroverted evidence that Donald Trump knew the mob was armed, and still urged them toward the Capitol.But: What if Jeffrey Clark had already been in place, rather that Jeffrey Rosen?What if election deniers had moved Raffensperger and Sterling out of place, and Moss had been terrorized out of doing her work?What if Hutchinson had been enticed, threatened, or in other ways persuaded not to give her testimony. under oath?What if the numerous bills giving controls of election results to partisan state legislatures had already taken effect?We are on thin ice. I am on long-time record as an American optimist. But we&#8217;re counting on continued luck, while hearing the ice crack.Michael Beschloss has been around nearly as long as I have, and has read much more history, and is also famously long-time optimistic about the U.S.&#8220;I can't predict to you whether we'll be living in a democracy five years from now or not,&#8221; he told Nicole Wallace last night. &#8220;I hope we are.\"I share his hope. I share his reluctance to predict.It depends on luck. And courage. And the vote. Subscribe now",

She didn’t know then that all the university’s student halls would be full, and she would be forced to accept accommodation in Liverpool.Sarah Smith, Jessie’s mother, who works as a PA in Sheffield, said she feels “frightened and disgusted” about her daughter living so far from the university. Manchester has offered £100 a week to cover commuting costs, but she feels this “misses the point”. She doesn’t want her daughter to be a 40-minute train ride away from the city she signed up for.

        "description": "Chief Justice John Roberts said he&#x27;s concerned about critics questioning the legitimacy of the Supreme Court.Erin Schaff/The New York Times via APChief Justice John Roberts defended the authority of the Supreme Court to interpret the Constitution, saying its role should not be called into question just because people disagree with its decisions.When asked to reflect on the last year at the court in his first public appearance since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Roberts said Friday he was concerned that lately some critics of the court&#x27;s controversial decisions have questioned the legitimacy of the court, which he said was a mistake. He did not mention any specific cases or critics by name.&quot;If the court doesn&#x27;t retain its legitimate function of interpreting the constitution, I&#x27;m not sure who would take up that mantle. You don&#x27;t want the political branches telling you what the law is, and you don&#x27;t want public opinion to be the guide about what the appropriate decision is,&quot; Roberts said while being interviewed by two judges from the Denver-based 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals at its conference in Colorado Springs.Roberts described the last year as an unusual and difficult one, pointing to the public not being allowed inside the court, closed in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, as one hardship. He also said it was &quot;gut wrenching&quot; to drive into the Supreme Court that was surrounded by barricades every day.The barriers were installed in May when protests erupted outside the court and outside the homes of some Supreme Court justices after there was an unprecedented leak of a draft opinion indicating the justices were planning to overturn Roe v. Wade, which provided women constitutional protections for abortion for nearly 50 years. The barriers are gone and the public will be allowed back inside when the court&#x27;s new session begins in October but an investigation ordered by Roberts into the leak continues.Gorsuch considers the leak a threat to the judicial processSpeaking at the same conference Thursday, Justice Neil Gorsuch said it is &quot;terribly important&quot; to identify the leaker and said he is expecting a report on the progress of the investigation, &quot;I hope soon.&quot;Gorsuch condemned the leak, as have other justices who have addressed it publicly.&quot;Improper efforts to influence judicial decision-making, from whatever side, from whomever, are a threat to the judicial decision-making process,&quot; Gorsuch said. Reporters from The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg attended the talk.The leaked draft was largely incorporated into Justice Samuel Alito&#x27;s final opinion in June that overturned Roe v. Wade in a case upholding Mississippi&#x27;s law banning abortion after 15 weeks. The ruling paved the way for severe abortion restrictions or bans in nearly half of U.S. states.In June&#x27;s ruling, Roberts, appointed to the court in 2005 by former President George W. Bush, voted to uphold Mississippi&#x27;s law but he did not join the conservative justices in also overturning Roe v. Wade, as well as Planned Parenthood v. Casey, the 1992 decision that reaffirmed the right to end a pregnancy. He wrote that there was no need to overturn the broad precedents to uphold the state law, saying he would take &quot;a more measured course.&quot;Polls show the public is losing faith in the Supreme Court Roberts has spoken out repeatedly about the importance of the judiciary&#x27;s independence and to rebut perceptions of the court as a political institution not much different than Congress or the presidency.Opinion polls since the leak and the release of the final abortion decision, though, have shown a sharp drop in approval of the court and confidence in the institution.When asked what the public might not know about how the court work, Roberts emphasized the collegiality among the justices and the court&#x27;s tradition of shaking hands before starting conferences or taking the bench. After the justices might disagree about a decision, everyone eats together in the court&#x27;s dining room where they talk about everything but work, he said. He said it&#x27;s not borne out of &quot;fake affection&quot; but a respect that comes from the push and pull of explaining ideas and listening to the responses to them.&quot;We have a common calling and we act like it,&quot; he said.

        "description": "The 2022 season is officially over for Marlins second baseman Jazz Chisholm Jr., as MLB.com&#8217;s Christina De Nicola (Twitter link) reports that Chisholm is still rehabbing from a stress fracture in his back.  Chisholm hasn&#8217;t played since June 28 and is thus eligible to be activated off the 60-day injured list at any time.  There hasn&#8217;t been any type of setback in the second baseman&#8217;s recovery, and yet since the Marlins aren&#8217;t in contention, they opted to shut him down rather than bring Chisholm back for a few meaningless games.\nChisholm was initially placed on the IL with a strain in his lower back, though reports surfaced on July 22 that Chisholm was suffering from a stress fracture.  Given the initial six-week recovery timeline and the subsequent follow-up time needed for a minor league rehab assignment, it already seemed a little unlikely that Chisholm would take the field again this season.\nInjuries have already been a recurring theme of Chisholm&#8217;s short career, as he spent time on the injured list last season due to a hamstring problem and a shoulder contusion.  Since making his MLB debut on September 1, 2020, Chisholm has played in only 205 big league games, though his performance in 2022 underlines why he was such a highly-touted prospect.\nChisholm&#8217;s first-half performance earned the 24-year-old his first All-Star selection, as he hit .254/.325/.535 with 14 home runs.  Between this strong offensive performance, excellent baserunning, and good defense (in the eyes of the Outs Above Average and Defensive Runs Saved metrics), Chisholm generated 2.5 fWAR over only 60 games played.\nIt speaks to Miami&#8217;s disappointing season that Chisholm is still second on the team in fWAR, behind only Sandy Alcantara&#8217;s 4.8 total.  The lack of punch throughout the lineup quite possibly might have kept the Marlins out of contention even if Chisholm has remained healthy, yet losing the second baseman ended whatever chance Miami might&#8217;ve had at a playoff berth.  The Marlins were 39-40 on July 5, but have since posted an 18-40 record.\nIf there is any plus side to be found, Chisholm is expected to be ready for the start of the 2023 campaign, so the Marlins can now proceed with one cornerstone tentatively in place.  Plenty of other decisions remain throughout the roster, of course, and the club might again be looking to move some young pitching in trades to acquire some offensive help.",

        "description": "Photo by Carmen Mandato/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The red-hot righty is having a pretty unbelievable season while being one of baseball’s underrated arms. When you take a deep look at the Astros’ bullpen, you’re probably looking at closer Ryan Pressly or late-inning relievers such as Rafael Montero, Héctor Neris, and/or Ryne Stanek. And since that’s a really tough core, I can’t blame you. But you’re probably forgetting someone, a pitcher who doesn’t make any noise and is actually being underrated. That is Bryan Abreu.\nLet’s start by putting you in context. Abreu, who is just 25 years old, carries a streak of 18 scoreless appearances. Better yet: he’s allowed only ONE hit in his last eight games (9.1 innings). In September, across four apps through Friday, Abreu is yet to allow a baserunner and has seven strikeouts over five innings.\nThat’s pretty good, isn’t it?\nIn addition, Abreu owns a 4-0 record with a 1.88 ERA over 45 games (52.2 IP) with 75 punchouts and a 1.08 WHIP.\nEven though the Astros are not loaded with left-handed relievers, Abreu has done an incredible job facing lefty hitters. He’s been even better against them than against righties as you can see below…\nVs RHB: .200/.296/.284, .581 OPS, 108 PA\nVs LHB: .187/.279/.209, .488 OPS, 104 PA\nAmong all the MLB pitchers with at least 17 appearances after the All-Star Game, Abreu is one of just two hurlers that are yet to allow a run. The other one is Padres’ Tim Hill, but he’s thrown only 15 1/3 innings, 4 1/3 fewer than Abreu. \nI know the Astros don’t usually use Abreu in high-leverage situations, but when they do, he thrives. In 33 plate appearances in those scenarios, opponents have managed to post a .039/.212/.077 slash line with a .289 OPS.\nAbreu’s improvement is one for the ages. He went from registering a 22.4 strikeout percentage in 2021 to an elite 35.4 in 2022. Even his control got better: from 11.2 BB% to 9.9 this year.\nAll I can guess is that Abreu put a lot work on his slider during the offseason. That pitch –whose usage went up from 37.3% to 47.1%– has been the key for him in 2022, and the improvement from 2021 has been pretty notorious…\nAbreu’s slider in 2021: .246 AVG, .456 SLG, 89.8 MPH EV, 38.0 whiff%\nAbreu’s slider in 2022: .152 AVG, .188 SLG, 85.7 MPH EV, 49.5 whiff%\nAbreu might not be the Astros’ pitcher with the highest profile, but he’s certainly making himself a name in the Major Leagues this season. However, with the Astros heading to the postseason, his biggest challenge is yet to come.",

        "description": "Warwick Davis is returning as the Nelwyn dwarf sorcerer in the new Disney+ series Willow. \nThe 1988 fantasy film Willow was under-appreciated in its day, but it's now a fantasy cult classic. Disney+ is betting on the strength of its nostalgic appeal with the new fantasy series Willow, set decades after the events of the first film. And now we have an official trailer, which debuted at D23 Expo.\nAs we've reported previously, the original Willow was directed by Ron Howard, and it told the story of a child with a rune birthmark who was prophesied to bring about the downfall of the evil sorceress Queen Bavmorda. The child was set afloat on a grass raft and found by a village of little people (the Nelwyn). A Nelwyn dwarf sorcerer named Willow led a party to find a community of Daikini (tall people) to raise the baby. Many magical adventures ensued.\nThe Oscar-nominated film debuted to mixed critical reviews, but made a decent showing at the box office, earning $137.6 million globally—even though it never became the blockbuster hit producer George Lucas had hoped it would be. Lucas and Davis had discussed the possibility of a sequel series as early as 2005, but Disney+ didn't give the project the green light until October 2020, with Howard on board as an executive producer.Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Continuing battles over the FBI’s investigation into the documents former President Trump kept at Mar-a-Lago and King Charles III’s ascension to the British throne following the death of Queen Elizabeth II are expected to dominate the discussion on this Sunday’s talk shows.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump and the Justice Department (DOJ) each submitted the names of two candidates Friday to potentially serve as a special master to review the documents that the FBI took at the former president’s Palm Beach, Fla., property last month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon ruled in favor of Trump’s request on Monday to have a special master appointed to review if the documents the FBI took are protected by attorney-client or executive privilege. The ruling blocked the DOJ from reviewing the materials while the special master does its work.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the department appealed the ruling on Thursday, asking the judge to partially stay her ruling blocking investigators from accessing the classified materials that the FBI took. If Cannon grants the stay, the DOJ would be able to review about 100 of the roughly 10,000 documents taken.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLegal experts said they viewed Cannon’s decision to appoint a special master as unusual, saying it does not meet the legal test that lawyers analyze when asking for one to resolve legal disputes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), chair of the Senate Intelligence Committee, said on Thursday during a press appearance that he wants to ensure the appointment of a special master does not slow down the investigation of the damage that could have been done.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said he has not yet heard when the intelligence committee will receive a briefing from U.S. intelligence officials on the situation, but he is pushing to receive updated information.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said lives can and have been lost due to the mishandling of information and the country can be made less safe. \n\n\n\nWarner said late last month after a partially redacted affidavit that provided the FBI’s justification for executing a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago was publicly released that the document suggested some of the country’s “most sensitive information” was mishandled. He said the DOJ investigation should be allowed to proceed “without interference.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWarner will appear on CBS’s “Face the Nation” and CNN’s “State of the Union.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer first lady, Secretary of State and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has expressed concerns about Trump’s handling of classified and sensitive documents at Mar-a-Lago. She has also rejected comparisons that Republicans have made between the situation and her handling of classified information on a private email server while serving as secretary of state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClinton tweeted “I can’t believe we’re still talking about this, but my emails...” on Tuesday, referencing the investigation that became a major point of discussion during her 2016 presidential run.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe said Republicans are attempting to make the investigation about her, proposing that the FBI should follow a “standard” that they set when they declined to prosecute her for her handling of the materials.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClinton will also appear on “State of the Union.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Republicans have continued to slam the investigation as politically motivated and an abuse of power.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who will appear on Fox News Channel’s “Sunday Morning Futures,” has called for Attorney General Merrick Garland and FBI Director Christopher Wray to testify before the House Judiciary Committee about the investigation into the materials at Mar-a-Lago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe suggested in a letter to Garland that the DOJ was leaking information to the media to create a “one-sided narrative.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSeveral pieces of information about what the FBI found have been reported in the aftermath of the search, including the revelation this week that a document containing information on a foreign nation’s nuclear capabilities was found at Mar-a-Lago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe death of Queen Elizabeth II and the succession of King Charles III as monarch of the United Kingdom will likely also be featured in discussions. The queen’s death on Thursday ended her 70-year reign, the longest in the country’s history.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKing Charles gave his first address as monarch on Friday, telling the country that he plans to serve by his mother’s example and will “uphold the constitutional principles at the heart of our nation.” He received largely positive reviews from many British commentators for his remarks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKaren Pierce, the British ambassador to the U.S., told Fox News’ Bret Baier on “Special Report” on Friday that many Americans have come to the British embassy in Washington, D.C. to leave flowers for the queen. She said that “it is so good to see ordinary American people give up their day to come and pay their respects to the queen.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPierce, who will appear on “Face the Nation” and “State of the Union,”&nbsp;said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” that the queen was a “great admirer and friend to America.” Pierce said the queen often spoke about the two countries’ shared values and “freedom-loving, common-law heritage.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJane Hartley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Kingdom, will appear on “Fox News Sunday.” She said in a statement after the queen’s death that she expresses her condolences to the royal family on behalf of the American people and that her “life of service” has been a gift to her country and the world.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There has been no greater steward of the alliance of friendship and cooperation between the United States and the United Kingdom than Queen Elizabeth,” Hartley said. “Her dedication to public service is an example to us all.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBelow is the&nbsp;full list of guests scheduled to appear on this week’s Sunday talk shows:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nABC’s “This Week” — To be announced.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNBC’s “Meet the Press” — Vice President Kamala Harris&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCBS’ “Face the Nation” — Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.); Karen Pierce, British ambassador to the U.S.; Oksana Markarova, Ukrainian ambassador to the U.S.; Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba of Jackson, Mississippi; retired Marine Gen.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/3637216-discriminatory-profiling-needs-to-end-at-homeland-security/",
        "description": "On his first day in office, President Biden issued an&nbsp;executive order&nbsp;directing federal agencies, including the Department of Homeland Security, to review their policies to ensure that they advance equity for all, including people of color and other historically marginalized groups. And this year&nbsp;he&nbsp;ordered&nbsp;the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security to review the Justice Department’s rules against discriminatory profiling, which are riddled with loopholes, and consider whether they should be updated.\n\n\n\nIt is equally important to adopt more robust rules at Homeland Security, a sprawling agency whose activities touch on millions of Americans’ lives, often in unseen ways. Two decades since its founding in response to the Sept. 11 attacks, the department still does not forbid its agents from discriminating against Americans based on their religion or country of birth and gives them too much latitude to consider race and ethnicity. Its weak safeguards — and the agency’s failure to police even these lax boundaries — have gained the department a reputation for targeting&nbsp;Muslims as terrorists and Latinos as illegal immigrants.\n\n\n\nSecretary&nbsp;Alejandro Mayorkas can fix this. He has already&nbsp;ordered&nbsp;that race, religion, national origin, and other protected characteristics “shall never be factors” in decisions about whom to apprehend or deport. (This directive is being challenged in court for unrelated reasons.) He must now ensure that this principle is applied to the myriad other decisions that the department makes, such as&nbsp;placing someone on a terrorism watchlist, which can trigger immigration, travel, and employment consequences; tagging someone as a security risk, which can impede travel; and collecting intelligence without suspicion of criminal activity, which can encroach on constitutional rights.\n\n\n\nThe department makes most of these decisions in secret. But the treatment of Muslim travelers provides a glimpse into the weakness of the department’s rules and oversight. At airports across the country, Homeland Security agents&nbsp;have questioned&nbsp;American Muslims about their religious views, asking what mosque they attend, how many times a day they pray, and whether they have friends or relatives “who have been martyred fighting in defense” of their beliefs. Earlier this year, three Muslim Americans sued the department claiming that they had been subjected to unconstitutional questioning from border officers about their faith and were “unfairly targeted and humiliated” based solely on their religious beliefs.\n\n\n\nReligion and national origin often overlap. In January 2020, some 200 Iranian and Iranian American travelers entering the U.S. were held for questioning about their&nbsp;“political views and allegiances”&nbsp;— based on the assumption they might be predisposed to retaliate for the U.S. killing of the Iranian general Qasem Soleimani.\n\n\n\nAs with other forms of profiling, there’s no evidence this approach makes us safer.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security itself has done no studies or even published case studies suggesting that this type of profiling protects the country.\n\n\n\nAccording to one former high-level department official, risk assessments that rely on travel history and demographic factors (for example, national origin or nationality) yield a false positive rate of at least 97 percent. Indeed, the idea that the government can assess the risk posed by an individual based on broad criteria like nationality or religion — which was the essence of President Trump’s 2017 “Muslim ban” — is roundly rejected by national security officials.\n\n\n\nAnd yet discriminatory profiling persists at the Department of Homeland Security. That’s because the department’s own rules essentially allow the practice. The department’s current guidance on discriminatory profiling does not prohibit (or even mention) religious profiling.&nbsp;That’s a striking omission, given its track record of targeting Muslims as potential terrorist threats. The&nbsp;department claims to follow 2014 Justice Department&nbsp;guidelines&nbsp;that do cover religion, but those rules exempt most of the agency’s counterterrorism, screening, and border activities.\n\n\n\nThe department does better&nbsp;on paper&nbsp;with race and ethnicity, allowing the use of these criteria only “when a compelling governmental interest is present, and only in a way narrowly tailored to meet that compelling interest.” Nevertheless, national security is the “compelling government interest” par excellence. It is all too easy for homeland security officials to take a broad view of what it constitutes. And the department seems to make no effort to keep tabs on these decisions to ensure that its guidance is properly implemented.\n\n\n\nThe department must replace its current patchwork of gap-riddled policies with a clear and comprehensive set of rules that prohibits discriminatory profiling in all its forms and across all the department’s activities. In a new&nbsp;report, the Brennan Center proposes a policy that would strengthen and broaden the department’s nondiscrimination rules and institute mechanisms to enforce compliance.\n\n\n\nSecretary Mayorkas has the authority to adopt such a policy and should do so without delay.\n\n\n\nDiscriminatory profiling in the name of security is among the toxic legacies of 9/11. It’s wrong. It’s ineffective. It tramples basic rights. And it traumatizes vulnerable communities.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration and the Department of Homeland Security have affirmed their commitment to equity and fairness. As the nation marks another 9/11 anniversary, it’s long past time to live up to that commitment.\n\n\n\nFaiza Patel is senior director of the Liberty and National Security Program at the Brennan Center for Justice at NYU Law.",

        "description": "Legal streaming services offering access to top tier football in Europe have a few unique selling points over piracy platforms.\nPerhaps most importantly, people who subscribe to legal services help to keep the game alive. They support the clubs they love, they support the players, and allow broadcasters to get a return on the money they invested in TV rights. \nAnd make no mistake, TV rights are far from cheap.\nOn the downside, legal sports streaming services are very expensive, some would say disproportionately so. They can easily cost ten times the amount of a pirate service, despite the latter providing at least ten times more channels &#8211; x10. But at least legal services are more reliable than pirate offerings &#8211; in theory.\nYou Had One Job&#8230;..\nMid-August we reported on remarkable situations in both Spain and Italy. At the start of the new season, after football leagues LaLiga and Serie A had warned fans not to use pirate IPTV services, fans who paid to access legal services found that they couldn&#8217;t watch matches due to technical issues.\nFor multi-billion dollar corporations, not being able to get matches to paying fans wasn&#8217;t a particularly good look, especially when pirate services were able to carry on business as usual.\nBut those two events were a one-off, or a two-off if we&#8217;re being picky. Until this week at least, when fans in France were treated to a similar experience.\nCanal+ Couldn&#8217;t Keep Up With Demand\nOn Wednesday evening, France&#8217;s PSG faced off against Italian giants Juventus in the UEFA Champions League. PSG eventually came away with the spoils having won two goals to one. The match was available on Canal+ &#8211; or at least that was the plan.\nUsers who logged in early apparently had no issues but for those who tried to tune in just before the game started, things didn&#8217;t go nearly as smoothly. Just minutes after kickoff, Canal+ used Twitter to explain that it was unable to cope with the number of people trying to log in to the myCANAL app.\n\nIn keeping with football tradition, it only seems appropriate to criticize from the comfort of the touchlines (or couch), perhaps along the lines of: &#8220;So why did you sell that many subscriptions?&#8221; But that would, of course, be a little unfair &#8211; the unexpected can happen to anyone.\nUnfortunately, an hour later Canal+ was back on Twitter again, this time with a red-faced emoji, having failed to sort out the mess, with half the match gone.\n\n&#8220;Will it work again at 10:46 p.m.? What a shame! Refund the subscription! And tomorrow night, we do it again?&#8221; a frustrated fan responded. &#8220;We haven&#8217;t seen anything of the game. It&#8217;s nice to pay 50 bucks a month not to see the match you pay for,&#8221; complained another.\nAbout Those Unreliable Pirate Streams&#8230;.\nPeople who didn&#8217;t pay to watch the match legally (and some that probably did) had no problem finding it through unauthorized channels. It was a conundrum outlined by a Twitter user who tweeted directly at Canal+ while its service was inaccessible. In summary: why am I paying you anything?\n\nA report on Radio France reveals that pirates had plenty of choice.\n&#8220;At half-time, we found that 50,000 spectators were following PSG&#8217;s first Champions League match via a Twitter account. Another live channel has nearly 6,000 views, more than double that for another. These figures were probably boosted by the MyCanal bug, which prevented subscribers from legally following the meeting,&#8221; the publication reveals.\nAccording to the publication, Twitter did take some streams down but they reappeared in new tweets just a few minutes later and the reporter was able to watch the entire second half without any interruption. But the problem &#8211; or solution for myCANAL users &#8211; wasn&#8217;t confined to Twitter. Plenty of tweets linked to Telegram channels, where the match was also available.\n&#8220;By following these links, we then came across a live stream, followed by more than 45,000 spectators. Within minutes, we were able to join nearly a dozen different conversations to watch the game,&#8221; Radio France adds.\nThe bottom line is that if legal services can&#8217;t get it right, illegal services are ready to step in and do their job for them. And the last thing legal services need is pirates playing the hero, because that never ends well.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "The Padres made a series of transactions prior to today&#8217;s game, according to Kevin Acee of the San Diego Union-Tribune (Twitter link).  Right-hander Pierce Johnson was activated from the 60-day injured list, right-hander Reiss Knehr was optioned to Triple-A, catcher Austin Nola was activated off the paternity list, and infielder/outfielder Matt Beaty was designated for assignment.\nJohnson appeared in six games in April before heading to the IL with tendinitis in his right forearm.  While the bright side is that forearm issue didn&#8217;t result in a longer-term injury like a Tommy John surgery, Johnson still ended up missing most of the 2022 season, costing the Padres a key bullpen arm and costing Johnson a chance to build himself a nice platform for his entry into free agency this winter.  Still, the right-hander has time to play an important role down the stretch as San Diego looks to secure a wild card berth.\nAfter playing with the Hanshin Tigers in Japan in 2019, Johnson returned to Major League Baseball when he signed a two-year, $5MM deal with the Padres in January 2020.  That contract then become a three-year, $7MM pact when the Padres exercised their club option on Johnson for 2022 &#8212; essentially a no-brainer decision given Johnson&#8217;s solid work (3.22 ERA, 31.6% strikeout rate) over 58 2/3 innings in 2021.\nBeaty also spent time on the 60-day IL this season, with a shoulder impingement limiting him to only 20 games.  Beaty was a solid part-time/bench player for the Dodgers in 2019-21, but Los Angeles designated him for assignment in March, and Beaty landed with the Padres in a rare trade between the two NL West rivals.  It&#8217;s safe to say that the injury derailed Beaty&#8217;s season, as he has only a .333 OPS over 47 plate appearances.\nWith these struggles in mind, teams might be wary of claiming Beaty off the DFA wire, though his roughly league-average production as a Dodger could sway teams in need of a left-handed hitter.  Beaty also brings some versatility in the field, as he has experience at both corner outfield and corner infield positions.",

        "description": "The return of in-game nap time is imminent.\n    \n\n  Tony bad. Cairo good? The news is out. Tony La Russa is traveling back to Chicago with the team, after Sunday’s game against the A’s. Whether or not this means his return is imminent is unknown, as he has yet to be cleared to manage — a fact made clear by the elusive release sent out by the White Sox:\n\n\npic.twitter.com/J6WjroJFVQ— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nIf La Russa were to return, what does it mean?\nSince La Russa’s leave, the Sox are 8-3, with a +31 run differential under Miguel Cairo, and have won 8 of their last 10. While a small sample size, that stretch is pretty damning considering the only other time the Sox have had eight wins in a 10-game stretch was back at the beginning of May. The players seem to like working under Cairo as well, with many of them putting some not-so-subtle digs in at La Russa in the media when asked about the state of the team.\nThere’s two thoughts when it comes to Tony coming back (because it seems like a when more than an if.) \nFirst, if he comes back in the next week or so, the momentum the White Sox have built with Cairo will be gone. Eleven games of solid and winning baseball, while productive, isn’t a lot to build momentum to bring you into and through the postseason. The players are just getting warmed up to Cairo, and resentment towards La Russa is still fresh. It seems hard to think that La Russa’s imminent return will keep the fire going.\nThe second thought is that if La Russa is back right before the playoffs and the team can continue its roll until the last week or so of the season, the White Sox might be able to overcome Tony’s return. Given the reversal of fortune in just the last week, 20-25 games of positive momentum might propel the White Sox into the playoffs, and then some. Can the momentum outlast Tony’s insufferable energy, though? Are the last few games just a fluke, or is Cairo actually doing some good for this team? Would La Russa’s return just mean another first round exit that nobody wants?\nA late return would also call into question Tony’s health. If he isn’t healthy enough to take the stress of managing for a month, would he be able to handle the stress of a tight division run and the playoffs? Is there a point of no return for La Russa, even if just for the rest of this year? Does it matter ... has La Russa already hurt the team enough that even with Cairo as a replacement, it can’t overcome being the third seed against a good third wild card in the playoffs (almost certainly finishing with a better record than the White Sox)? \nThere are too many questions with answers we don’t know right now, and may never know. Maybe Tony’s return will miraculously change his methods, or rally the team behind him. Maybe Cairo can’t keep the momentum going. Maybe it actually is a matter of if and not when, and Tony La Russa has managed his last game for the White Sox, just no one knows it yet.\nThings are shaping up, however, that Tony returns to manage the club as soon as Tuesday, hosting the Rockies. Put your seat belts on.",

        "description": "Photo by David Berding/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The quest for the Central continues. \nFirst Pitch: 6:15 pm CDT\nTV: FOX / ~ / Radio: TIBN\nAfter a disappointing opener on national television, the Twins will look to bounce back with an encouraging second game, on national television. As the old saying goes, the Apple doesn’t fall far from the FOX, and that’s where Minnesota and Cleveland will be duking it out this Saturday evening.\nThey’ll do so with the Guardians having opened up a 2.5-game lead on the Twins, who are no longer in sole possession of second place, meaning that while they continue to win ballgames here, the Guards will have their eye on the scoreboard out of Oakland, where the second-place White Sox are taking on the A’s.\n  \n        \n  \nThe AL Central standings are brought to you by my poor grandmother, a Tigers fan.\nThe Twins sent out Dylan Bundy last night to no avail; tonight they’ll see if Chris Archer’s allotted 12 outs can get the job done. Early starting pitching failures doomed the Twins last night, as despite scoring six unanswered runs, they had already allowed seven. Conventional wisdom dictates that you score more than your opponents do, at least if your goal remains winning the division, and not falling into obscurity around the halfway mark of September.\nThe Guardians are sending the slightly-more-dependable Triston McKenzie, who’s been enjoying one heck of a campaign out of the Cleveland rotation. Minnesota is 2-1 in games against McKenzie so far in 2022, having most recently tagged him for seven earned runs in late June. Let’s see more of that!\n\n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nGUARDIANS\nTWINS\n\n\n\n\nSteven Kwan - DH\nLuis Arraez - DH\n\n\nAmed Rosario - SS\nCarlos Correa - SS\n\n\nJose Ramirez - 3B\nJose Miranda - 1B\n\n\nJosh Naylor - 1B\nMax Kepler - RF\n\n\nOscar Gonzalez - RF\nGio Urshela - 3B\n\n\nAndres Gimenez - 2B\nNick Gordon - 2B\n\n\nWill Benson - LF\nKyle Garlick - LF\n\n\nLuke Maile - C\nGary Sanchez - C\n\n\nMyles Straw - CF\nJake Cave - CF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTriston McKenzie - RHP\nChris Archer - RHP\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOf course, seeing a performance like that would require the lineup to pull a little more weight than they’ve been able to do on this injury-decimated roster. The bottom half of the order has plenty of heart n’ hustle, but it’s hits that we’ll need this weekend.\nGO TWINS GO!",

        "description": "Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Cubs righthander had another bad game at the Friendly Confines. Sorry, folks, it’s not a small sample size anymore.\nMarcus Stroman just doesn’t pitch well at Wrigley Field. Here are his splits:\nHome games: nine starts, 7.11 ERA, 1.534 WHIP, nine home runs in 44⅓ inningsRoad games: 12 starts, 1.84 ERA, 0.980 WHIP, four home runs in 68⅓ innings\nOf Stroman’s nine Wrigley starts, just three can be called “good to excellent.” Of his 12 starts on the road, at least eight can be called “good to excellent.”\nHonestly? I wouldn’t have Stroman start another game at Wrigley this year until he and the coaching staff can figure out what’s going on here. (Note: Stroman had never pitched at Wrigley Field before this year.)\nThis game, on yet another pleasant late summer afternoon at the ballpark, wound up as a 5-2 Cubs loss to the Giants, and Stroman had one bad inning and struggled thereafter. He was removed after four innings, having allowed seven hits, the key a two-run homer by Joey Bart, and throwing only 49 strikes out of 80 pitches.\nIn that ugly four-run Giants second, Stroman balked in a run. That gave the Cubs the MLB lead in balks, with eight.\nThe Cubs did have an early lead in this game. In the bottom of the first, Nico Hoerner doubled with one out and one out later Ian Happ doubled him in [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nThat lead was short-lived, as the Giants’ four-run inning happened in the top of the second. The Cubs did cut the lead to two in the bottom of the second. Alfonso Rivas tripled down the right-field line and scored on a throwing error [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nDavid Bote, the next hitter after Rivas, singled, but was stranded. The Cubs had only four more baserunners the rest of the game, and none until the sixth, when Happ doubled again with two out. Happ now has 38 doubles, just two short of the Cubs’ first 40-double season since Javier Báez had 40 in 2018. The 38 doubles for Happ puts him, at this writing, third in the National League behind Matt Olson (41) and Freddie Freeman (44).\nBeyond not being able to figure out Marcus Stroman, would someone please explain Sean Newcomb to me? In this game, Newcomb was nearly lights-out, throwing three shutout innings with three strikeouts and just one hit allowed. He’s had other outings like this, but then he’s had two others recently when he couldn’t get guys out and allowed at least five runs in both. So — what’s going on here? If he could pitch like he did today all the time, he’s a candidate for next year’s team. If he pitches like he has in those other outings, he’s a DFA candidate.\nMy current reaction is ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. Perhaps yours is too.\nThe other event of the day at the ballpark was inductions into the Cubs Hall of Fame for Buck O’Neil, Pat Hughes and Jose Cardenal. Here’s a video the team released today after the induction ceremony:\n\nAnd here are the plaques for the three new inductees:\n\nCongratulations to these three worthy people from Cubs history.\nThis loss clinched a losing season at home for the Cubs, who are 30-41 at Wrigley Field with 10 home games remaining. Even so, their record at home since July 17 has been better, at 13-8. Also, if the Cardinals win tonight the Cubs will be mathematically eliminated from the NL Central race. Obviously they were essentially eliminated months ago, but that would clinch it.\nThere were tons of Giants fans at Wrigley both Friday and Saturday; you likely heard lots of “Let’s go Giants!” chants on the Marquee broadcast. I ran into a couple of San Francisco fans who said they had gone to the doubleheader the Giants played in Milwaukee Thursday, then Friday and Saturday at Wrigley, then planned to attend the Bears/49ers NFL opener at Soldier Field Sunday. That’s a lot of sports!\nThe Cubs, meanwhile, will wrap the series and homestand Sunday night at Wrigley, weather permitting. Wade Miley will start for the Cubs and just after Saturday’s game, the Giants made this announcement:\n\n\nBrebbia will start tomorrow’s game.— Susan Slusser (@susanslusser) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nJohn Brebbia threw the eighth inning Saturday, so clearly he’s being used as an opener. What the Giants will do beyond that is still not known.\nGame time Sunday, if they can play, is 7:08 p.m. CT and the game is ESPN’s national Sunday Night Baseball game.",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  It’s kinda hard to score ten runs in a game and lose. Except at Coors Field... \n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nDIAMONDBACKS\nROCKIES\n\n\n\n\nDaulton Varsho - RF\nRandal Grichuk - RF\n\n\nAlek Thomas - CF\nYonathan Daza - CF\n\n\nJake McCarthy - LF\nC.J. Cron - DH\n\n\nChristian Walker - 1B\nBrendan Rodgers - 2B\n\n\nKetel Marte - DH\nMichael Toglia - 1B\n\n\nEmmanuel Rivera - 3B\nElias Diaz - C\n\n\nWilmer Difo - 2B\nElehuris Montero - 3B\n\n\nCooper Hummel - C\nSean Bouchard - LF\n\n\nGeraldo Perdomo - SS\nAlan Trejo - SS\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM. Bumgarner - LHP\nJose Urena - RHP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn franchise history, the Diamondbacks have a record of 124-3 when scoring ten or more runs on the road. All three of the losses were in Coors Field. On Sep 23, 1998, the team got their first taste of the Denver experience. They jumped out to a 6-2 lead, before the Rockies scored nine unanswered runs, and even a five-run seventh couldn’t prevent a 14-11 loss. Then, on May 30th, 2019, then went down 11-10, though this did at least go into extras. Arizona trailed 7-5 after three frames, but a five-run eighth gave them a 10-8 lead, only for Yoan Lopez to blow it, before Yoshihisa Hirano took the loss in the tenth. Then there was last night, which I trust I need not rehash. \nYou will not be at all surprised to hear that the Colorado Rockies have more victories where they conceded 10+ runs than any other team. Since the last expansion in 1998, they have 34 such wins, with the next most the Texas Rangers, back on 25. But what’s startling is that a mere three of those Rockies’ victories came on the road: only the Marlins and Mets have fewer such wins away from home. Colorado went almost nineteen years without such a victory (July 1999 in Los Angeles until July 2018 against Arizona). That compares to 31 of them in Coors - easily the most at home (second are again the Rangers with 20). The most Coloradoesque is likely the 18-17 walkoff win over the Marlins in 2008. \nIt’s questionable whether this apparent setting of the hitting level to “easy” at home helps the Rockies overall, or if it also works as a road-field disadvantage. Because since 1998, they have a .392 road W%, effectively tied (with the Pirates) for worst in the majors. When playing in Coors, they are almost 150 points better, at .540. That’s a respectable 13th best, and for comparison, ranks them thirteen places above the similarly-crappy elsewhere Pirates. The Coors Field effect is real, for the Rockies’ road OPS is .629, the worst in the National League. It’s 182 points below their home OPS, the best in the National League. Maybe the sport just needs to admit there are places where MLB should not exist. #ContractTheRockies",

        "description": "The Brewers placed left-hander Eric Lauer on the 15-day injured list due to elbow inflammation.  The placement is retroactive to September 8.  Right-hander Trevor Kelley was called up to take Lauer&#8217;s spot on the active roster.\nMilwaukee has essentially gone all season without its rotation at full strength, and the injuries have now started to mount up as the Brewers chase an NL wild card berth.  Lauer joins Freddy Peralta and Aaron Ashby as starters on the IL, leaving the Brew Crew with Corbin Burnes, Brandon Woodruff, Adrian Houser, and Jason Alexander as the provisional starting four.  No immediate decision needs to be made about a rotation replacement since the Brewers have off-days on both Monday and Thursday, but Triple-A hurler Ethan Small is the only other pitcher currently in the organization who has made a start for Milwaukee this season.\nWith two solid seasons under his belt now, Lauer has emerged as a stable member of the Brewers rotation.  The southpaw has a 3.91 ERA over 145 innings this year, albeit with a below-average 22.8% strikeout rate and 8.6% walk rate.  In fact, Statcast metrics across the board weren&#8217;t very favorable to Lauer in either 2021 or 2022, and it seems as though Lauer has benefited from a .257 BABIP.  His 3.58 ERA since the start of the 2021 season is over half a run lower than his 4.19 SIERA.\nStill, the bottom-line results are more than enough for a fourth or fifth starter, and prior to this elbow problem, Lauer had also been a pretty stable source of innings amidst several other injuries that sidelined Milwaukee starters.  Losing Lauer and Peralta will further tax an already-struggling Brewers staff &#8212; since August 1, Brewers pitchers have a cumulative 1.2 fWAR, the sixth-lowest total of any pitching corps in baseball.  This has contributed to the Brewers&#8217; major slide from NL Central contenders to outside the postseason bracket altogether, 3.5 games behind the Phillies for the last wild card slot.",

Louie Gohmert (R-Texas) presented a flag from the U.S. Capitol on Friday to Simone Gold, who was sentenced to 60 days in prison for her actions during the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. \n\n\n\nGold, who founded the anti-COVID-19 restriction group America’s Frontline Doctors and promoted the unproven drug hydroxychloroquine as a cure for COVID-19, pleaded guilty in March to entering or remaining in a restricted building or grounds during the storming of the Capitol. She was sentenced to 60 days imprisonment and ordered to pay a $9,500 fine. \n\n\n\nGohmert said in a release that Gold is a “patriot” and “American hero.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“After having her name and reputation shamefully dragged through the mud, the Biden administration’s DOJ threw her in prison for peacefully walking into the U.S. Capitol on January 6&nbsp;and delivering a speech,” Gohmert said. “Dr. Gold is the definition of what a political prisoner looks like—something I never thought I’d see here in the United States of America.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said Gold gave the world “life-saving” early treatment options to COVID-19 that “undoubtedly” saved many lives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMultiple studies and fact checks throughout the COVID-19 pandemic have concluded that hydroxychloroquine does not make a difference in protecting people from the virus.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“History will not look kindly upon those who persecuted—and prosecuted—doctors who spoke out against the COVID lockdown, mask and vaccine mandates,” Gohmert said.\n\n\n\nGohmert said in July 2020 after contracting COVID-19 that he would take hydroxychloroquine as a treatment.",

        "description": "In 2001 — 21 years ago — a replica of the late U.S. Rep. Robert J. Lagomarsino’s (R-Calif.) congressional office opened on the California State University Channel Islands (CSUCI) campus. The university near Camarillo also became the official home for his career archives: boxes of papers, photographs and awards spanning Lagomarsino’s 34 years as an elected Republican politician from Ventura County, Calif.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPerhaps it’s no surprise that Cal State Channel Islands continues to be the steward of the Robert J. and Norma M. Lagomarsino Archives and Special Collections. Lagomarsino introduced the first bill calling for a public university to open in his district and he later helped to secure $7 million to buy land for the CSUCI campus, which eventually opened at the site of the former Camarillo State Hospital. Notably, he also played a key role in establishing the Channel Islands National Park.\n\n\n\nAcross Ventura County, however, according to media reports, former U.S. Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Calif.) isn’t feeling the love from the university to which he entrusted his archives: California Lutheran University (CLU) in Thousand Oaks. In fact, Gallegly is suing CLU, alleging it failed to fully establish the Elton and Janice Gallegly Center for Public Service and Civic Engagement as promised. Gallegly, a Simi Valley Republican, was a congressman from 1987 through 2013.\n\n\n\nThe Gallegly/Lagomarsino dichotomy shows the risk that members of Congress face when they donate their career papers and memorabilia to an institution they don’t control. Donating&nbsp;their archives to an academic or other institution for scholarly use can also open up a politician’s career to criticism they may not anticipate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCLU established the Elton and Janice Gallegly Center for Public Service and Civic Engagement in 2012-2013 when Chris Kimball was CLU’s president. CLU completed a replica of Gallegly’s Washington D.C. office in the campus library in 2018. Last year, under the new president, Lori Varlotta, the school removed the replica office.\n\n\n\nVarlotta told a local newspaper that the school took this action because the office “has not been the driver of activity and engagement at the center as perhaps initially thought.” She said the university had to choose, “which one is most advantageous to our students, our scholars and faculty. We believe that the archives, particularly given their potential as a&nbsp;research tool, will serve the university's purpose to educate more than the office.”\n\n\n\nThose outside of academe may forget that supporting students for success is the main responsibility of a university. At CLU, a vocal contingent of students and library staff protested the Gallegly Center, saying Gallegly did not represent the university’s values. In 2017, students circulated a petition against his center, which stated, “After researching Elton Gallegly, we do not support his legislature and believe it contradicts what Cal Lutheran stands for… This Center serves as a monument to Mr. Gallegly’s service, one in which he targeted the identities shared by many of our students, people of color – particularly Hispanics, the LGBTQ community, and immigrants to this country.”\n\n\n\nGallegly perhaps did not foresee these pitfalls:\n\n\n\nUniversity presidents and governing boards turn over. The university president who championed the center may leave the job or retire; the new president may have different views. The governing board may also appoint new members who don’t think the congressperson’s work is relevant or aligned with the university’s mission and values.&nbsp;Students may protest and refuse to visit the replica office or to engage with the center if they disapprove of the congressperson. No administration wants to be accused of&nbsp; ethnic insensitivity or ignoring student needs. According to media reports, Gallegly was well-known for his strong anti-immigration views, his support for President Trump’s southern border wall, and for urging the deportation of illegal immigrants.&nbsp;Political winds change. A member of Congress can be popular today but not tomorrow. The political pendulum often swings widely from left to right and back again, especially in today’s era of strong political acrimony. Funding can dry up as benefactors lose interest and contracts can be interpreted in different ways.\n\n\n\nIt would appear that former Rep. Gallegly’s long congressional career is today being viewed by some through a different lens than a decade ago. For now, the university is in control until a judge decides otherwise.\n\n\n\nRitch K. Eich, former chief of public affairs for Blue Shield of California, has published five books on leadership. A retired captain in the naval reserve, he served on Congressional committees for Sens. Dan Coats of Indiana and Carl Levin of Michigan. Eich's leadership was cited in the Congressional Record by Coats, also former Director of National Intelligence, and Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana. He holds a Ph.D from the University of Michigan.",

        "description": "David Kohl-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Can the Rockies continue their win streak? After a wild and wacky Coors Field special that included:\n\nSeason-high five home runs (previous season-high was four, recorded two days earlier)\nC.J. Cron’s 504-foot home run — second-longest in the Statcase Era (not including Trevor Story’s 505-footer, of course)\nA blown 8-1 lead in the fifth inning — the most runs they’ve allowed in a single frame since the Giants scored 10 (also against Germán Márquez) on May 4, 2021\nA Ryan McMahon leadoff home run — the second time in franchise history that the Rockies have led off and ended a game with a homer (last time was Aug. 16, 2021: Connor Joe &amp; C.J. Cron)\nA walk-off three-run homer — Elias Díaz’s second homer of the game and his third-career walk-off homer. He finished the game with a career-high four hits and seven RBI, and also became the first catcher in franchise history to record at least seven RBI in a single game.\n\nOh, and the game only lasted three hours and five minutes. Also, lost in all of last night’s craziness is the fact that the Rox have won three consecutive games for the first time since their season-best five-game streak from July 12-16.\nJosé Ureña (3-6, 6.13 ERA) will take the mound for the Rox. In his last time out, he took the loss in game two of last Saturday’s doubleheader. He allowed seven runs (six earned) on eight hits, struck out one and walked another. That one strikeout was the only one he’s recorded in each of his last two starts, and he also has not made it out of the sixth inning in three consecutive starts. The last time he faced the Snakes was Aug. 13, where he allowed four runs on seven hits, including three home runs, walked two and struck out five in the 6-0 loss. \nHe will face Madison Bumgarner (6-13, 4.83 ERA), who is searching for his second road win of the 2022 season. His first came on April 29 against the Cardinals. In his last start, Bumgarner pitched five innings against the Brewers on Sept. 3, allowing two unearned runs on six hits. He did not factor into the 8-6 10-inning loss.\nCan the Rockies win their fourth consecutive game?

However, a subsequent blockbuster drought has left beleaguered theatre owners praying that the Christmas release of mega-sequels to Avatar and Black Panther will pull them back from the brink.The world’s second-largest cinema chain, UK-based Cineworld, last week filed for bankruptcy protection in the US after succumbing to almost $9bn (£7.75bn) in debt and lease liabilities.

They say they previously used Tornado Cash for licit purposes, and are now suffering financial damages because they can't legally use the service.In the suit, they argue that the Treasury Department overstepped its authority in what it can sanction, claiming that \"Tornado Cash software, including the smart\ncontracts, consists of immutable open-source software code, which is not property, a foreign country or a national thereof, or a person of any kind.\" They've also argued that the designation is unconstitutional under both the free speech protections of the First Amendment and the due process protections of the Fifth Amendment.\n        \n            \n              \n                Joseph Van Loon v.

        "description": "The Nationals signed outfielder DJ Peters to a minor league contract, and Peters played his first game with Triple-A Rochester yesterday.  The 26-year-old was a free agent after being waived by the Korea Baseball Organization&#8217;s Lotte Giants back in July.\nPeters&#8217; time in the KBO League resulted in a .228/.299/.402 slash line over 354 plate appearances, with 13 home runs.  The Giants paid Peters a $600K base salary &#8212; well above what the outfielder would&#8217;ve earned on a minor league salary, and there was no guarantee Peters would&#8217;ve landed a big league deal as a free agent.  Of course, Peters couldn&#8217;t have signed anywhere last winter due to the lockout, and thus he opted to take some guaranteed money with the Giants rather than face the unique uncertainty of the 2021-22 offseason.\nPower has been Peters&#8217; calling card since the Dodgers selected him in the fourth round of the 2016 draft.  Over his minor league career (and counting last night&#8217;s game with Rochester), Peters has hit .266/.359/.488 over 2197 PA, but after the canceled 2020 minors season, he returned and struggled at Triple-A in 2021.  However, Peters also made his MLB debut last season, hitting .197/.242/.422 with 13 homers over 240 combined PA with the Dodgers and Rangers.\nThe rebuilding Nationals can offer plenty of opportunity for players who might have late-breakout potential, with 30-year-old rookie Joey Meneses serving as a prime example of how unheralded players can unexpectedly blossom.  Peters&#8217; power bat and strong throwing arm give him a couple of plus tools, and the best could be yet to come if he can cut down on his strikeouts and become a more polished overall hitter rather than just an all-or-nothing slugger.",

They deploy the usual lineup, except Eddie Rosario returns to hit in place of Marcell Ozuna, and Michael Harris II slides up above Vaughn Grissom to give the Braves alternating handedness from the three spot on down. The Braves won 3-0 over the Rockies the only other time they used this lineup and starting nine at these positions.\nThe Mariners swap in Abraham Toro and Sam Haggerty for Adam Frazier and Jesse Winker, respectively, given the southpaw nature of Max Fried.

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Milwaukee is thin on starting pitching after losing another arm. For the second day in a row, the Brewers placed a starting pitcher on the injured list.\nAfter deactivating Freddy Peralta on Friday due to ongoing shoulder fatigue, Eric Lauer joined him with left elbow inflammation. Trevor Kelley was recalled to take his roster spot.\n\n\nLHP Eric Lauer placed on the 15-day injured list, retroactive to 9/8, with left elbow inflammation. RHP Trevor Kelley recalled from Triple-A Nashville. pic.twitter.com/txvoYL36CE— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nLauer left with the injury after allowing seven earned runs in 2 2⁄3 innings against the Rockies on Wednesday.\nGiven the nature of his ailment, it’s not surprising that Lauer will miss some time. The good news is that there is no structural damage to his elbow.\n\n\n• Freddy Peralta going  on the IL as expected. He’ll miss at least two starts until he’s symptom free and can resume throwing. • Eric Lauer saw team doctors yesterday and left elbow is structurally fine. Good news. https://t.co/X3hhGqdSsE— Sophia Minnaert (@SophiaMinnaert) September 9, 2022\n\n\n\nWith Lauer, Peralta, and Aaron Ashby all out of action, the Brewers are extremely thin in their rotation. Ethan Small has performed so poorly in Triple-A lately that he is essentially a non-option. Josh Lindblom could be an option as a veteran arm, but his performance has been similarly underwhelming, and he is not on the 40-man roster.\nThe team does have two off days next week, putting them in a window during which they could survive with a shorter rotation.\nKelley returns for his fifth stint with the Brewers this season, for whom he has pitched to a 6.00 ERA and 6.87 FIP in 21 innings. He’s been excellent in Triple-A, posting a 1.78 ERA and 2.24 FIP with the Nashville Sounds.",

The streaming platform's Star Wars offerings this year included our first look at the third season of The Mandalorian, as well as a final trailer for the limited series, Andor,  and a trailer for a new animated anthology series, Tales of the Jedi.\n(Spoilers below.)\nWe've been pining for the new adventures of Grogu and his Mandalorian space daddy (Pedro Pascal) since their heartfelt reunion in the finale of The Book of Boba Fett—aka The Mandalorian season 2.5. (Din Djarin had sent Grogu off for Jedi training with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), but the bond between the two proved far more powerful. Sniff.) The teaser revisits some of the highlights of the S1 and S2 adventures of this \"clan of two,\" before giving us a glimpse of what's to come.Read 10 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Former President Trump and the Justice Department (DOJ) have submitted a total of four candidates to be potentially appointed as special master in charge of reviewing the documents the FBI took at Mar-a-Lago last month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe submissions came after a federal judge granted Trump’s request on Monday to have a&nbsp;special master review the materials that the FBI obtained to see if any are protected by attorney-client or executive privilege.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe DOJ also filed an appeal on Thursday to request that the special master not review the more than 100 classified documents that the FBI took, arguing that a pause in its review of those materials could cause “irreparable harm” to the government and the public in delaying the investigation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Trump legal team and the DOJ each proposed two candidates to conduct the review.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere are the four people that Trump and the DOJ have proposed to serve as special master:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRaymond J. Dearie&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump chose Raymond J. Dearie, a retired U.S. district judge for the Eastern District of New York (EDNY), as one of his picks. Dearie was nominated to the seat and confirmed by the Senate in 1986 by then-President Reagan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe served as chief judge of the court from 2007 to 2011, according to his profile page on the court’s website. Dearie assumed senior status on the court in 2011, moving to a form of semi-retirement that allows judges older than 65 to take a lighter caseload.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDearie also served as a U.S. attorney for EDNY from 1982 to 1986. He also served on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, which reviews requests for surveillance warrants against suspected foreign spies in the U.S., according to Trump and the DOJ’s court filing announcing their choices.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPaul Huck Jr.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPaul Huck Jr., who is Trump’s other pick, has spent his legal career working in both the public and private sectors. Huck served as deputy attorney general in Florida for four years and then served as general counsel to Gov. Charlie Crist, a Republican at the time who has since joined the Democratic Party, from 2007 to 2008.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile serving as general counsel, he was the top legal adviser to Crist on constitutional, legislative and statutory matters involving the executive branch, according to his profile page on the site for conservative legal organization The Federalist Society, where he is a contributor.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Federalist Society defines a contributor as speaking or participating in its events, publications or multimedia presentations, and the title does not necessarily imply any other endorsement or relationship with the organization.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHuck also founded his own law firm, the Huck Law Firm, and is a former partner at the multinational law firm Jones Day, according to the court filing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBarbara S. Jones&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne of the DOJ’s picks is Barbara S. Jones, who served as a U.S. district judge for the Southern District of New York for more than a decade and a half. She was nominated to the seat in 1995 by then-President Clinton.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe presided over cases on a wide range of topics, including accounting and securities fraud, antitrust, corruption, labor racketeering and terrorism while serving, according to her profile page for Bracewell LLP, where she is a partner.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBefore she began serving as a district judge, she served as chief assistant to Robert Morgenthau, the district attorney of New York County at the time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJones also served as the chair of the Response Systems to Adult Sexual Assault Crimes Panel, which Congress created to analyze investigations of sexual assault in the military.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe served as a special master in 2018 to review documents from Trump’s former attorney, Michael Cohen, to examine if any were privileged.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThomas B. Griffith&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThomas B. Griffith, the DOJ’s other candidate, served as a federal judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit from 2005 to 2020. He serves as special counsel for the law firm Hutton Andrews Kurth LLP.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGriffith served as the Senate legal counsel, the body’s nonpartisan top legal officer, from 1995 to 1999, according to his profile page on his law firm’s website. He advised Senate leadership and committees on investigations in the role.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGriffith was also the general counsel to Brigham Young University in Utah for five years. He is a lecturer of law at Harvard University and has served in that role in the past for Stanford University and Brigham Young.",

        "description": "Many people mistakenly credit Niklas Luhmann with the invention of the zettelkasten method, so I&#8217;ve been delving into historical note taking practices. I&#8217;ve recently come across a well known and influential book on historical method from the late 1800s that has well described version of the slip (box) method.\nOriginally published in French in 1897 as Introduction aux études historiques and then translated into English by George Godfrey Berry, Henry Holt and Company published Introduction to the Study of History in 1898 by authors Charles Victor Langlois and Charles Seignobos. Along with Ernst Bernheim&#8217;s popular Lehrbuch der historischen Methode mit Nachweis der wichtigsten Quellen und Hülfsmittelzum Studium der Geschichte (Leipzig: Duncker &amp; Humblot, 1889), Langlois and Seignobos&#8217; text is one of the first comprehensive manuals discussing the use of scientific techniques in historical research.\nPrimarily written by Seignobos, Book II, Chapter IV &#8220;Critical Classification of Sources&#8221; has several sections on the zettelkasten method under the section headings:\n\nImportance of classification—The first impulse wrong—The\nnote-book system not the best—Nor the ledger-system—Nor the &#8220;system&#8221; of trusting the memory\nThe system of slips the best—Its drawbacks—Means of\nobviating them—The advantage of good &#8220;private librarian-ship&#8221;\n\nThis section describes a slip method for taking notes which is ostensibly a commonplace book method done using slips of paper (fiches in the original French) instead  of notebooks. Their method undergirds portions of the historical method they lay out in the remainder of the book. Seignobos calls the notebook method &#8220;utterly wrong&#8221; and indicates that similar methods have been &#8220;universally condemned&#8221; by librarians as a means of storing and maintaining knowledge. Entertainingly he calls the idea of attempting to remember one&#8217;s knowledge using pure memory a &#8220;barbarous method&#8221;. \nThe slip method is so ubiquitous by the time of his writing in 1897 that he says &#8220;Every one admits nowadays that it is advisable to collect materials on separate cards or slips of paper.&#8221;\nThe Slip Method\nThe book broadly outlines the note taking process: \n\nThe notes from each document are entered upon a loose leaf furnished with the precisest possible indications of origin. The advantages of this artifice are obvious : the detachability of the slips enables us to group them at will in a host of different combinations ; if necessary, to change their places : it is easy to bring texts of the same kind together, and to incorporate additions, as they are acquired, in the interior of the groups to which they belong. As for documents which are interesting from several points of view, and which ought to appear in several groups, it is sufficient to enter them several times over on different slips ; or they may be represented, as often as may be required, on reference-slips.\n\nSeignobos further advises, as was generally common, &#8220;to use slips of uniform size and tough material&#8221; though he subtly added the management and productivity advice &#8220;to arrange them at the earliest opportunity in covers or drawers or otherwise.&#8221;\nIn terms of the form of notes, he says\n\nBut it will always be well to cultivate the mechanical habits of which professional compilers have learnt the value by experience: to write at the head of every slip its date, if there is occasion for it, and a heading in any case; to multiply cross-references and indices; to keep a record, on a separate set of slips, of all the sources utilised, in order to avoid the danger of having to work a second time through materials already dealt with.\n\nWhere the Luhmann fans will see a major diversion for the system compared to his internal branching system is in its organization. They describe a handful of potential organizations based on the types of notes and their potential uses, though many of these use cases specific to historical research are now better effected by databases and spreadsheets. As for the broader classes of more traditional literature-based textual notes, they recommend grouping the slips in alphabetical order of the words chosen as subject headings. Here, even in a French text translated to English, the German word Schlagwörter is used. It can be translated as &#8220;headwords&#8221;, &#8220;catchwords&#8221; or &#8220;topical headings&#8221; though modern note takers, particularly in digital contexts, may be more comfortable with the translation &#8220;tags&#8221;.\nWhile there are descriptions of cross-linking or cross-referencing cards from one to another, there is no use of alpha-numeric identifiers or direct juxtaposition of ideas on cards as was practiced by Luhmann.\nThe authors specifically credit Ernst Bernheim&#8217;s Lehrbuch der historischen Methode several times in the book. While a lot of the credit is geared toward their broader topic of historical method, Bernheim provides a description of note taking very similar to their method. I&#8217;ve found several copies of Bernheim&#8217;s text in German, but have yet to find any English translations. \nBoth Bernheim and Langlois/Seignobos&#8217; work were influential enough in the areas of history specifically and the humanities in general that Beatrice Webb (an influential English sociologist, economist, socialist, labour historian, and social reformer who was a co-founder of the London School of Economics, the Fabian Society, and The New Statesman) cites their work in Appendix C &#8220;The Art of Note-Taking&#8221; in her 1926 autobiographical work My Apprenticeship, which was incredibly popular and went through multiple reprintings in the nearly full century since its issue. Her personal use of this note taking method would appear to pre-date both books (certainly the Langlois/Seignobos text), however, attesting to its ubiquity in the late 1800s.\nWhat is the &#8220;true&#8221; zettelkasten method?\nScott Scheper has recently written that personal communication with Luhmann&#8217;s youngest son Clemmens Luhmann indicated that Luhmann learned his method in 1951 from the Johannes Erich Heyde text Technik des wissenschaftlichen Arbeitens (with several German editions from 1931 onward). This book&#8217;s note taking method is broadly similar to that of the long held commonplace book maintained on index cards as seen in both Langlois/Seignobos (1897) and Webb (1926). One of the few major differences in Heyde was the suggestion to actively make and file multiple copies of the same card under different topical headings potentially using carbon copy paper to speed up the process. While it&#8217;s possible that Luhmann may have either learned the modifications of his particular system from someone or modified it himself, it is reasonably obvious that there is a much longer standing tradition as early as Konrad Gessner in 1548 to the middle of the 20th century of a zettelkasten tradition that is more similar to the commonplace book tradition effectuated with index cards (or slips &#8220;of a similar size&#8221;). Luhmann&#8217;s system, while seemingly more popular and talked about since roughly 2013, is by far the exception rather than the rule within the broader history of the &#8220;zettelkasten method&#8221;. With these facts in mind, we should be talking about a simpler, historical zettelkasten method and a separate, more complex/emergent Luhmann method.",

        "description": "The Dodgers have placed right-hander Blake Treinen on the 15-day injured list, retroactive to September 7.  Right-hander Andre Jackson has been called up from Triple-A to take Treinen&#8217;s spot on the roster.\nTreinen is dealing with tightness in his throwing shoulder, which is an ominous diagnosis considering that Treinen has missed most of the season due to shoulder problems.  As Treinen told MLB.com&#8217;s Juan Toribio and other reporters last week, he was initially advised to get surgery to repair a partial tear in the front capsule of his shoulder, but instead chose a non-surgical recovery option.  This allowed the right-hander to make it back for two more appearances after being activated from the 60-day IL, but Treinen has now been sidelined again.\nIt&#8217;s probably safe to assume that Treinen will again try to make it back without going under the knife, especially with the postseason nearing.  Whether he&#8217;ll be able to return after a minimum 15 days is another question, and it is possible Treinen has already thrown his final pitch of the 2022 season.  It might be that surgery is inevitable to fully correct his shoulder issues, and such a procedure might now potentially threaten his readiness for at least the start of the 2023 season.\nIn the midst of his IL stint, Treinen and the Dodgers agreed to a contract extension back in May that guaranteed his 2023 salary at $8MM, which was the total of a club option Los Angeles already held on his services.  Another club option for 2024 was also added, worth between $1MM-$7MM depending on Treinen&#8217;s health and other benchmarks.  With Treinen still plagued with shoulder problems, this extension might already look like a misfire on the Dodgers&#8217; part, especially if he ends up having to miss a portion of the 2023 season.  While $8MM isn&#8217;t a huge amount to a big-payroll team like L.A., that number could certainly impact the luxury tax number for a club that figures to be in tax territory once again next year.",

        "description": "Bookmarked What Can Students Do? by Cameron Paterson (learningshore.edublogs.org)\nTeachers do too much of the learning and thinking for students. It does not have to be this way. When teachers work harder than students, young people become inculcated into coming to school to watch the adults work. If we want them to learn; if we want them to think, this is not something that can be outsourced. And if we want them to take responsibility for the culture and feel of the classroom and school, we need to invite them into the conversation, and even step away and let them take the lead. What do you complain about having to do that your students could do tomorrow?\n\nCameron Paterson reflects upon the question of what can students do in the classroom? He shares examples of where his students have co-constructed assessment criteria, self-assessed their work, written their own report comments and taught their own lessons. This reminds me of Bianca Hewes&#8217; work with &#8216;meddles and missions&#8217;.\nPersonally, I have tried a few of these things when I was in the classroom, making the curriculum explicit and getting the students to work with me to design assessments. I even got my Year 8 Media Studies class to design their own excursion, including making inquiries with various places in preparation. In these situations I guess the focus of the teaching were the skills associated with how to learn.\nThe issue that I had was that I was only one part of the week for these students and that this was all vastly different to how other teachers and classes were operating. I guess the point then is how much can students do when we let them? \nIt is interesting thinking about all this outside of the classroom. In my role working with teachers and administration on some of the day-to-day technical trivialities, such as academic reporting and attendance. It is always so easy to just fix problems as they arise. However, I always endeavour to meet half-way, whether it be to provide a short summary or to actually walk through a problem. The challenges in these situations is the limits of time, I wonder if that too is sometimes the challenge in the classroom too.The post 📑 What Can Students Do? first appeared on Read Write Collect.Also on: edublogs.org",

        "description": "Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Matt Manning fought through a rainy outing, while the bats remained red hot. On a rainy Saturday in KC, the Tigers blew the Royals away in the middle innings with a sustained display of extra base power to secure the series victory in a rain shortened contest. In the process they continued to creep right up on the Royals’ heels for fourth place in the AL Central.\nMatt Manning got in a bit of trouble in the bottom of the first before settling in. A one-out double from Bobby Witt Jr. was followed by Sal Perez hunting a breaking ball and slapping it to left for an RBI single. Manning got two quick outs to close out the inning, but the Royals had the early lead.\nIt didn’t last long. \nIn the top of the second, Kerry Carpenter worked a 3-0 count from Jonathan Heasley and then hammered a low fastball 396 feet for his fourth home run to tie the game. Spencer Torkelson singled on a liner to left, but was stranded when Jeimer Candelario popped out.\n\n\nTired KC: Kansas CityWired KC: Kerry Carpenter pic.twitter.com/bWCNbnDBLl— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nManning bounced back with a strong half inning in the bottom of the second. He got Michael Massey to ground out, and then froze Nick Pratto and Kyle Isbel for called third strikes.\nAkil Baddoo led off the third with a walk, and after Riley Greene popped out, Victor Reyes smoked a triple to the wall in right to score Baddoo. Javy Báez took an oppo approach all day and followed Reyes with a liner up the right center field gap for an RBI double. Harold Castro singled through the right side, Báez raced around to score, and it was 4-1 Tigers.\n\n\nVictor Reyes gives the #Tigers a 2-1 lead, driving in Akil Baddoo with a double! #DetroitRoots@AkilBaddoo pic.twitter.com/czekeb8U8B— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nManning got three quick outs in the bottom half, but by now the rain was really coming down, making it tough to grip balls and bats. Heasley called out the grounds crew in the top of the fourth to get the mound in shape with a heathy dose of Quick-Dry, but was clearly also struggling to grip the ball. Manning had even more trouble in the bottom half. He couldn’t get any bite on his breaking balls, and after Sal Perez led off with a single, Manning threw a would-be curveball to the backstop. Vinnie Pasquantino grounded out, moving Perez to second, and there was a lengthy delay as Manning asked for a fresh, drier supply of balls from the dugout, a new rosin bag, and a towel. The rain was just streaming down everyone’s face when Bally Sports showed a close-up, and you had to wonder if they’d be able to continue. \nManning got Michael A. Taylor to ground out, scoring Perez, and the next hitter, Massey, lost his bat on a whiff and sent it tomahawking into the Royals’ dugout, where fortunately no one was hurt. A very angry Massey tried to bunt in a 2-2 count, not trusting himself to hold on to the bat, and fouled out, slamming his bat to the dirt. Good times.\nThese were good times for the Tigers, as the torrent of extra base power continued in the top of the fifth. Baddoo led off with a walk again, and Riley Greene singled, with a Kyle Isbel throwing error advancing them to second and third. Victor Reyes came up with a big two-run single to center and it was 6-2 Tigers. The Royals went to the bullpen for Collin Snider at that point. Báez greet the new reliever with a drive to the wall in right for an RBI triple, his second extra base hit on the day, and Harold Castro ripped a ground ball back through the box for an RBI single to score Báez, and it was now 8-2.\n\n\n\"Keep the line moving.\"                    — Ancient proverb pic.twitter.com/EAMo4OtWq0— Detroit Tigers (@tigers) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nHarold Castro keeps the line moving, driving in Javier Báez for a 4-1 #Tigers lead! #DetroitRoots pic.twitter.com/igvxhdh38n— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nManning seemed settled back in and a little drier in the top of the fifth. He handled a comebacker from Pratto for the first out, froze Isbel for strike three again, and Nicky Lopez lined out to Greene in center for a quick half inning.\nSpencer Torkelson led off the sixth against lefty Amir Garrett with a shot off the wall in left field for a triple. Unfortunately, Candelario and Baddoo struck out. Riley Greene drew a four-pitch walk with two out, but Reyes lined out to center to end the half inning. Manning racked up three quick ground ball outs in the bottom of the sixth as his pitch count reached 85. It was good to see him fight through the conditions as he was clearly extremely frustrated by the situation at its worst in the fourth and fifth innings.\n\n\nSpencer Torkelson's drive to left off Amir Garrett would have been a home run in every other ballpark except here at Kauffman Stadium, where instead it's his first career triple.— Jason Beck (@beckjason) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nIn the top of the seventh, the Royals capitulated, pulling Salvador Perez in favor of backup catcher Sebastian Rivero. Carlos Hernandez succeeded Garrett out of the Royals bullpen. We were probably lucky that no one got hurt in this one as there were puddles forming in the infield and outfield by the middle innings. \nThe Tigers went 1-2-3, and Hinch sent Manning out for the bottom half. He walked Pasquantino, but got Michael A. Taylor to ground into a force at second. The ball went right up the middle and Harold Castro picked it behind second base as he reached the outfield grass and flipped it high with his glove to Báez, who made a slick play to catch it and get his toe to the base just before Pasquantino slid in. Originally ruled safe, Báez called for a challenge immediately, Hinch obliged, and Pasquantino was out. \nAt that point, Hinch came out to pull Manning at 94 pitches, sending Andrew Chafin in to face the left-handed hitting Massey. Chafin got Massey to ground out, moving Taylor to second, but walked Nick Pratto. Nate Eaton pinch hit for Isbel, and pulled a routine grounder to Báez that should’ve ended the inning. For whatever reason, Castro wasn’t ready for Báez’s toss, perhaps expecting him to go to first. Either way, the flip was right to him but Harold was caught off guard and ducked under the throw at the last minute. It went right over him, Taylor scored, and everyone was safe. Nicky Lopez followed with a ground ball to Harold that he also couldn’t convert as Pratto scored. Fortunately, Chafin cut off the rally there by striking out Melendez to end the inning.\nManning wasn’t charged for the last run as it was an obvious error on Castro. His line ended with 6.1 IP, 3 R, 2 ER, 3 H, BB, 4 SO. Pretty good on a day where they really had to battle the elements all game long.\nKerry Carpenter singled the opposite way, against lefty Anthony Misiewicz, to start the eighth. Torkelson did not hammer the baseball somewhere this time, striking out on three pitches. Candelario flew out to left for the second out, and Baddoo struck out to end the half inning.\nAt this point, the rain really picked up again, and they finally called for the tarp.\n....\nFinally, around 7:50 p.m. EDT, they finally called the game and put it in the books as a Tigers’ victory. With the victory, the Tigers are now a game and a half behind the Royals for fourth place in the AL Central. Tyler Alexander will face a tough matchup against RHP Brady Singer on Sunday at 2:10 p.m. EDT..\n\nYouth movement getting hot\n\n\nSo on August 10th, Kerry Carpenter made his debut for the Tigers. So with a month’s work of work, let’s look on how he has done over 19 games (70 PA).270/.329/.508 .837 OPS  wRC+ 137 with an ISO of .238.

        "description": "Kyle Isbel attempted to pass through section 301 and 12/17 but was foiled by his lack of wizardry. | Photo by Kyle Rivas/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A game that should have been called after five innings eventually ends early anyway. There’s honestly not a lot to say about this game. Jonathan Heasley had even less control and velocity than normal, leading him to allow seven runs on seven hits and two walks without a single strikeout. It’s hard to say whether the weather was more of a factor or if he was just tired from the long season or perhaps injured, but his fastball was hovering around 90 after averaging 93.6 coming into this game. The TV broadcast crew, consisting of Rex Hudler and Steve Physioc, asserted that young players should just learn to pitch through such drastic drops in velocity, but those are almost always signs of impending, if not current, injury.\nStill, watching the game, it seems just as likely that Heasley was pitching afraid. Not of the Tigers hitters - though he had every reason to fear them - but of whether the next pitch was going to cause him a lower-body injury. There was heavy rain for most of the game and the Royals were obviously affected by it. Multiple players slipped and slid at various points but they also moved more slowly to avoid such slips and slides which helped the Tigers take extra bases. The Tigers hit three triples in the game; it was the first time they’d done that since 2012. Heasley also slipped while throwing a pitch early on and its easy to imagine that his velocity may have taken a dive because he was pitching more tentatively than normal.\nThe Royals were notably playing better after the All-Star Break but have now lost seven of their last ten games. They look very nearly as bad as they did at the beginning of the season. Still, I’ll take Nick Pratto striking out over Carlos Santana doing it every day of the week. At least in 2022.\nThe Royals managed a measly four hits. Salvador Perez collected two of those. Two of the runs they scored were unearned after the Tigers threw away a fielder’s choice hit by pinch-hitter Nate Eaton in the seventh inning. Bobby Witt Jr. and Nicky Lopez accounted for the other two hits. Bobby’s double was the only extra-base knock.\nCollin Snider had a rough relief outing but Amir Garret, Carlos Hernández, and Anthony Misiewicz pitched scoreless innings with at least a strikeout a piece. That’s about all of the good to come out of today’s game.\nIt seems borderline irresponsible for the game to have been played under the conditions that it faced. It’s a miracle, given the pouring rain, that no players were injured. At worst, the game likely should have been called after the fifth inning with the Royals down 8-2 and unlikely to come back with rain that had been coming down hard for several innings at that point. Still, the short-staffed umpire crew - the fourth umpire was unable to make the game because inclement weather affected his travel plans - saw fit to keep the players out there through seven and a half innings. They should be ashamed.\nThe Royals will look to avoid the sweep tomorrow afternoon at 1:10 PM CDT. Brady Singer will take the mound for KC. The Tigers will call on swing-man lefty Tyler Alexander.",

He’s allowed seven runs in his last nine starts, and in two starts against San Diego this season the left-hander has allowed two total runs, winning both games.\nOffense figure to be at a premium Saturday, since Blake Snell has never allowed more than two runs in any start against the Dodgers. Snell has a 1.99 career ERA against the Dodgers, including 12 strikeouts over five innings on July 1. The Dodgers did win that game, which perhaps provides the blueprint, force Snell to throw a lot of pitches, and get him out of the game one way or another.\nSeems like a winning strategy.\n\nGame info\n\nTeams: Dodgers (94-43) at Padres (77-62)\nPitchers: Julio Urías vs. Blake Snell\nLocation: Petco Park, San Diego\nTime: 5:40 p.m. PT\nTV: SportsNet LA",

        "description": "Jordan Lyles was far from his best in the disappointing loss to Boston.  | James A. Pittman-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Falling behind 4-0 before recording an out, things went from bad to worse for the O’s Saturday in a loss to Boston Any hope of the Orioles sneaking into a Wild Card spot seemingly flat-lined Saturday night in a 17-4 loss to the Red Sox. \nSure the heartbeat of the O’s playoff chances was feint heading into Saturday’s game anyway. However, for there to be any hope of resuscitating those chances, the O’s needed to find ways to sweep a team like the Red Sox. They needed a strong start from Jordan Lyles and more signs of life from their inconsistent offense. The Orioles got neither of those things in the loss Saturday. \nBaltimore was seemingly dealt a fatal blow in this game before they even got a chance to hit. Lyles loaded the bases against the first three batters he faced—walking Tommy Pham, giving up a single to Alex Verdugo and hitting Xander Bogaerts. All of that set up Rafael Devers to drive 2-0 fast into the bullpens for a grand slam that put Boston up 4-0—all before Lyles recorded an out. \nEarlier this week, Lyles missed his scheduled start against the Blue Jays after suffering from flu-like symptoms. While the veteran righty was healthy enough to make the start Saturday, it was clear early on that he wasn’t feeling 100%. Lyle’s fastball was a couple of miles per hour slower than normal, he couldn’t get a feel for his breaking balls and he consistently struggled to convert two-strike counts into outs. \nThe second was a little cleaner for Lyles, though he still had to work out of a two-on, one-out jam to escape the inning unscathed. The third turned out to be the only 1-2-3 inning of the day for the Orioles starter—though he did give up a loud fly ball off the bat of Trevor Story, which was caught on the warning track by Cedric Mullins. \nThen, in the fourth inning, the Orioles were finally forced to pull the plug on the Lyles start. The O’s entered the top of the fourth down 4-1 after a Cedric Mullins solo-HR in the bottom of the third. Lyles would give that run right back after consecutive doubles from Enrique Hernandez and Kevin Plawecki, and things only got worse from there. \nAfter getting Pham to fly out, Lyles gave up back-to-back singles to Verdugo and Bogaerts—allowing Plawecki to score—and that’s when Brandon Hyde decided Lyles’ day was over. Keegan Akin would come in from the pen and immediately allow two more singles—which pushed across the inherited runners Verdugo and Bogaerts. The inning finally finished with the Orioles down 8-1, and Lyles’ final line finished at 3.2 innings pitched, seven hits allowed, eight earned runs and only one strikeout. \nBirdland’s woes Saturday were further compounded by an offense that never seemed capable of making a huge comeback. The most lively inning for the Birds’ bats came in the fifth when they were already down 10-1. GUNNAR HENDERSON led off the inning with a single up the middle. Ramon Urias followed up by launching a ball to left field, barely missing a HR, as it caromed off the top of the Great Wall of Baltimore for a double. HENDERSON would then come in to score on a Jorge Mateo sac fly, while Urias later scored on a Mullins single. \nOutside of the mini outburst in the fifth, the Orioles’ offense seemed largely lifeless. The Red Sox continually sprayed the ball to all fields, collecting hits on everything from home runs over the Wall to blooped singles in between three O’s fielders. The Orioles, on the other hand, always seemed to hit the ball right at a Boston defender. Some of their best contact resulted in balls that died at the warning track or were caught right against the fence. \nBaltimore got their final run of the day on a Ryan Mountcastle eighth-inning single, bringing home Ryan McKenna after he reached on a two-base fielding error. The eighth also saw the debut of reliever Yennier Cano—a pitcher the Orioles acquired from the Twins in the Jorge Lopez trade. The flame-throwing righty worked 1.2 innings, giving up six hits, walking three and allowing seven runs. The stat line is perhaps a little harsh to Cano, as Hyde clearly left him in longer than he should’ve to try and get through the ninth. \nWhen it became clear the Cano had nothing left in the tank, McKenna took the mound with the bases loaded to try and get the last out of the inning. Three more runs came around to score with McKenna pitching, but he did finally get that out. \nPerhaps Saturday was the clearest indicator of why this Orioles team—one that needs Jordan Lyles to work some magic to even hope to make playoffs—isn’t quite ready for October baseball. However, it still always stings to get thoroughly embarrassed by a divisional rival—especially when you’re just on the outside looking in on the playoff race. The O’s still have a chance to win the series on Sunday, and they’ll look to put this loss behind them by doing just that. In the meantime, Birdland should just try to forget this game ever happened.",

This is a useful reflection, touching on the rise of algorithmically organised sites, as well as apps and frameworks such as MidJourney, GPT-3 and GAN. Thinking about this, he has a stab at what might be next.\n\n• You could hook up GPT-3 to MidJourney and get it to try incantations to produce pictures, and feed the output to GANs tuned to pick output that humans will like\n• Once that’s working, try doing the same with the text-to-video generator hooked up to GANs tuned to pick output that humans will like\nCharles Arthur https://socialwarming.substack.com/p/the-approaching-tsunami-of-addictive\n\n\nIn the end, Arthur explains that the future is already here and is progressively taking shape around us.\n\nAll the disparate bits above might look like, well, disparate parts, but they’re available now (and that’s without mentioning deepfakes). The trees are here, and the forest might be starting to take shape. Here’s an example: a 40-page comic book about monsters, free for download (PDF), by Steve Coulson, in which all the images are drawn by MidJourney. It’s very, very impressive.\nCharles Arthur https://socialwarming.substack.com/p/the-approaching-tsunami-of-addictive\n\nThe post 📑 The approaching tsunami of addictive AI-created content will overwhelm us first appeared on Read Write Collect.",

        "description": "Elvis Andrus continues his revenge tour. | D. Ross Cameron-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The offense scores a lot of runs, once again Good teams beat bad teams, right? Well, the White Sox did just that once again, against Oakland today. And it was another bloodbath for the White Sox offense, with 10 runs on 20 hits. \nThe pitching wasn’t too shabby, either, with Lance Lynn going six innings with five strikeouts and two unearned runs. Lynn also had 21 swinging strikes, his third-most on the season and only one fewer than last time out. Lynn has been lights-out recently and has only given up one earned run in his last three starts (albeit with five unearned) and seems to be assuring himself at least of that No. 3 spot in the rotation should this team make the playoffs. \nElvis Andrus is proving himself to be the midseason  pickup the team really needed as well, as on this west coast trip he’s 9-for-27 now, with three home runs, nine RBIs, and two doubles. His defense has been great as well, with many wondering where Tim Anderson fits back into the picture when he comes off of his IL stint. \nThe scoring got started early in the second inning, with an RBI single from Yasmani Grandal leading to Elvis Andrus continuing his revenge on the A’s by hitting a three-run homer to make it 4-0 early.  \n\n\n\n\nEvery starter but Gavin Sheets had a hit on the day, with the Nos. 6 and 7 hitters, AJ Pollock and Andrew Vaughn, going 4-for-5 on the day. Vaughn also had two RBIs with a double in the fourth that increased the White Sox lead to 7-0.\n\n\n\n\nThings weren’t all so hunky-dory for the Sox, more specifically Josh Harrison, who went 3-for-4 with a walk, but committed errors in the fourth and sixth innings that ended up leading to both runs the Athletics scored.\n\n\n\n\nGood teams, however, don’t let the mistakes get to them, as the Sox stood strong and scored two runs in the seventh and one in the eighth to arrive at the 10-2 final. \nThe fourth win for the Sox in a row is also the 10th as acting manager for Miguel Cairo, who after winning the Field of Dreams game last year has come on and righted the ship in 2022, with nine wins in the 12 games since Tony La Russa had to take a break from managing. The run differential in Cairo’s games this season is up to +39, with the Sox now at only -4 on the whole. The Sox seem like a changed ballclub in the last two weeks, and hopefully they can carry that momentum into La Russa’s inevitable return.\nThe Sox are now 72-68 and currently one game behind Cleveland (although the Guardians are up big in Minnesota at the midway point). Thursday’s makeup game against the Guardians could have huge implications on the division race, and having the momentum to get there could propel the Sox to the division lead. Point blank, whether the Guardians, White Sox or Twins win the AL Central this year, they are going to have to earn it with head-to-head wins in September.\nThe Sox will go for the four-game sweep in Oakland tomorrow afternoon, with Johnny Cueto on the bump.",

        "description": "Gary A. Vasquez-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Andre Jackson was recalled from Triple-A Oklahoma City The Dodgers quest to build a postseason pitching staff is becoming less and less about picking from a group of arms, and more of the pitchers who are healthy will be active in October. Blake Treinen rejoined the infirmary on Saturday, placed on the 15-day injured list with what the team is calling right shoulder tightness.\nThe move is retroactive to Wednesday, meaning the earliest Treinen can return is September 22. But that’s if he’s healthy.\nHe missed 4½ months after a torn capsule in his right shoulder, and returned to the fold on September 2, just over a week ago. The veteran right-hander pitched twice last week for the Dodgers, tossing a scoreless inning last Sunday against the Padres then another two days later against the Giants. Treinen retired six of his seven batters faced.\nThen came the soreness, which kept Treinen out the last few days. Including Saturday.\n\n\nDave Roberts said Blake Treinen catch play didn’t go as expected.  There is a growing possibility Trenien may go on IL. #Dodgers— David Vassegh (@THEREAL_DV) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nRoberts said the discomfort is more in Treinen’s latThat’s different from the shoulder capsule he partially tore earlier this, and something Roberts said is normal. But given how late in the season it is, “it’s preventing him from what he needs to do,” Roberts added— Jack Harris (@Jack_A_Harris) September 10, 2022\n\n\n\nTreinen is one of eight Dodgers pitchers on the injured list, seven of them relievers, and all with designs on making it back for the postseason. The closest ones to returning might be Tommy Kahnle and left-hander Victor González, each of whom threw on back-to-back days this week for Triple-A Oklahoma City. \nGonzález’s 30 days on rehab assignment is up after Wednesday, which means the Dodgers will have to make a roster decision to activate him from the 60-day injured list.\nAs for now, Andre Jackson got the call up to the majors as the fresh arm in the bullpen. This is his third stint in the majors this season but he has yet to pitch. Jackson has the distinction of having his last game in both Triple-A and with the Dodgers an extended save. He got a three-inning save on the final day of the 2021 regular season in Los Angeles, and last Sunday for Oklahoma City pitched four scoreless innings to close out a win against division rival Round Rock.\nJackson was originally listed to start for Oklahoma City on Sunday, but plans can change.",

        "description": "Left fielder Kris Bryant, who&#8217;s played in just 42 games in his first season with the Rockies, might not see the field again in 2022.\nAfter Saturday night&#8217;s game against Arizona at Coors Field, the Rockies will have just 22 games remaining. \nWhen manager Bud Black was asked if there is still time for Bryant to heal up and return from plantar fasciitis in his left foot, Black said, &#8220;There is time but I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s going to happen. But we&#8217;re hopeful.&#8221;\nBryant, 30, missed time early in the season with a sore lower back. He&#8217;s been on the injured list since Aug. 1 as he deals with his foot injury. Black said that Bryant is now out of his walking boot, is receiving treatment, working out in the weight room, and playing catch.\n&#8220;He hasn&#8217;t had a bat in his hand for a while, but he&#8217;s feeling much better,&#8221; Black said.\nBlack said he sees some benefits to Bryant returning this season, even for a limited time.\n&#8220;I think he just wants to play,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;All players like to play; if he can get to that point. And just going into the offseason knowing you&#8217;re truly healthy, knowing that he played and tested it.&#8221;\nThe Rockies are 20-22 in the games in which Bryant has played. He&#8217;s slashed .306/.376/.475 with five home runs (all on the road), with 12 doubles and 14 RBI. Prior to the season, Bryant signed a seven-year, $182 million contract.\nFriday night rewind. The Rockies&#8217; 13-10 victory over Arizona on Friday night came on a walk-off, three-run homer by catcher Elias Diaz, who set career highs with four hits and seven RBIs. He became the first catcher in franchise history with at least seven RBIs in a game.\nThe Rockies led the game 8-1 through four innings before the Diamondbacks took a 10-8 lead by scoring nine runs in the fifth. The nine runs were the most allowed by Colorado in an inning since San Francisco scored 10 runs in the top of the first inning on May 4, 2021. Prior to Friday night&#8217;s comeback victory, the Rockies were 0-15 in games in which they had allowed nine runs in a single inning.\n&nbsp;",

        "description": "The U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) detected a magnitude 7.6 earthquake in the South Pacific country of Papua New Guinea on Saturday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe quake occurred inland, 67 kilometers, or 40 miles,&nbsp;east of the town of Kainantu in the eastern part of the county. It occurred Sunday morning local time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt was about 90 kilometers, or 55 miles, deep. Earthquakes can occur as deep as hundreds of kilometers beneath the earth’s surface, but they are stronger if they are shallower, according to the USGS.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said on its website that there is no threat of a tsunami in the area.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe USGS issued a yellow alert for shaking-related fatalities and economic losses, meaning that some casualties and damage are possible but should be relatively localized. Yellow alerts have required a local or regional response in the past.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPapua New Guinea, located to the east of Indonesia and north of Australia, is located on the Pacific ocean’s “Ring of Fire,” where ample seismic and volcanic activity regularly occurs.",

        "description": "Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  After falling out of first place, the Mets responded with a solid all-around game. Yesterday’s ugly loss to the Marlins put the Mets in a place they had avoided for almost the entirety of the 2022 season: second place. It was their fourth loss to a bad team over the past week, so it’s understandable that between that fact and their newfound place looking up in the division standings, some fans were getting more than a bit concerned. Both the team and its fans needed a resounding rebound win to ease their spirits, and the baseball gods cooperated. The Mets offense had one of their most impressive showings of the season and Carlos Carrasco made an impressive bounce-back from his disappointing start last week,\nThe Mets once again got off to a rough start tonight, as they failed to score against Marlins starter Pablo López in the first inning despite recording three hits (the first one was erased on a double play by Francisco Lindor, the second one he’s hit into in as many days). Then in the bottom of the frame, after recording the first two outs, Carlos Carrasco surrendered a single to Joey Wendle and a run-scoring double to Garrett Cooper (though it should be noted that said run may not have scored if not for a bad relay throw from Mark Canha in left field). Thus, the Mets were quickly once again trailing a bad team in the early goings.\nThankfully, the offense fought back against López starting in the third inning. Francisco Lindor struck a one-out double to right field to get things started, and Jeff McNeil followed that up with a hit to right field that was somewhat generously ruled a double after he advanced to second on the throw to home plate. That throw may have gotten Lindor out if it had been handled, but instead it went past Jacob Stallings, and the game was tied at a run apiece. \nThe Mets failed to get McNeil home, so the game remained tied heading into the fourth, but the offense once again got to work then. Canha and Daniel Vogelbach got on base to start the frame on a walk and a single, respectively, and Eduardo Escobar—who has been red hot in recent times—socked a double to right field to score a run and give the Mets the lead. You’d best believe that they weren’t done, though: James McCann—who has also miraculously been hot in recent times—blooped a single into right field to score yet another run and make it 3-1 Mets. With the top of the order now up, López—clearly struggling at this point—walked Brandon Nimmo to load the bases, and Lindor then once again came through with an important hit by knocking a single into right field to score yet another run. López finally recorded an out on the next batter, but it was a sacrifice fly off the bat of McNeil to score one more to make it 5-1.\nAfter retiring Pete Alonso on a hard line drive to left field, another walk ended López’s night after just 3.2 innings, and Don Mattingly went to left-hander Andrew Nardi to try to finish the frame. Unfortunately, he did not accomplish the job quite as quickly as Mattingly might have hoped, as Mark Canha greeted him with a home run over the left field wall for a grand slam to make it an eight-run inning—the most the Amazins have scored in one inning all year—and give the Mets a 9-1 lead. Vogelbach added another hit for good measure—his second of the frame and the sixth by the Mets overall—before the inning mercifully came to an end with the Mets offense having finally awakened.\nThey would add another run in the fifth inning with a Francisco Lindor homer, his third hit of the day, to give the Mets double-digit runs. Though while the offensive outburst was undoubtedly encouraging given the offensive struggles the team has gone through in recent times, Carrasco’s performance on the mound may well have been more encouraging. After giving up a hit to Miguel Rojas in the second inning, he went on to retire the next eleven batters in a row. His stuff looked much sharper in comparison to his dreadful start against the Nationals in his first game back from the injured list last week. As he was still working up his pitch count since making his return, he ended up being done after 74 pitches, and his final line—6 innings, 4 hits, no walks, 6 strikeouts, and one run—were hugely encouraging. The Mets will need more performances like this from Cookie as they continue to fight for the National League East title in September.\nEscobar continued his hot streak with a seventh inning solo homer to make it 11-1 Mets. Bryce Montes de Oca came on to replace Carrasco for his third major league appearance, and while he struck out three batters on some nasty-looking pitches, he also allowed three singles, including an RBI knock by Stallings, to cut the lead to 11-2. Trevor Williams came on in the eighth inning and gave up a run of his own on a wild pitch. Alex Claudio of all people was the one person to throw a scoreless inning in the final frame of the game. In the end, those couple runs given up by the bullpen meant little, as the Mets secured a much-needed 11-3 victory. We will need to wait to see how the Braves game goes against the Mariners—we will continue to be scoreboard watching for the rest of the season, given the current state of the standings—but for now, we can feel good about how the Mets came to play tonight. They will go for the series victory tomorrow with Taijuan Walker taking the mound.\nSB Nation GameThreads\nAmazin’ AvenueFish Stripes\nBox scores\nMLB.comESPN\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs\n  \nWhat’s WPA?\nBig Mets winner: Eduardo Escobar, +17.3% WPABig Mets loser: Tyler Naquin, -6.8% WPAMets pitchers: +4.4% WPAMets hitters: +45.6% WPATeh aw3s0mest play: Eduardo Escobar RBI double in the fourth, +16% WPATeh sux0rest play: Garrett Cooper RBI double in the first, -11.7% WPA",

        "description": "Though there&#8217;s plenty left to be decided in the Phillies&#8217; 2022 season, it&#8217;s never too early to speculate about what the club might have in store for the winter or for the 2023 campaign.  To this end, Peter Abraham of The Boston Globe writes that &#8220;the Phillies will be eager suitors&#8221; for Xander Bogaerts, provided that Bogaerts (as expected) opts out of his contract with the Red Sox.\nReports already surfaced in June that Philadelphia would be targeting the shortstop position this winter, with the Phils looking to make a splash in a free agent class that is expected to include the likes of Bogaerts, Trea Turner, Dansby Swanson, and Carlos Correa.  Bogaerts and Correa are seen as virtual locks to exercise opt-out clauses, and Turner and Swanson are both scheduled to hit the open market (though Swanson and the Braves are exploring an extension).\nBogaerts&#8217; talent makes him a natural target for any team that wants a big upgrade at shortstop, and the Phillies are perhaps an even more logical fit due to the past ties between Bogaerts and president of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski.  After all, Dombrowski was Boston&#8217;s president of baseball operations when Bogaerts signed his current contract &#8212; a six-year, $120MM extension that included an opt-out clause following the current season.  Bogaerts would be leaving three years and $60MM on the table to opt out, but is no doubt he&#8217;d easily top that number on the open market.\nOf course, shortstop is not quite the problem position it was for the Phillies at the start of the season.  After a very slow start in his rookie year, Bryson Stott has started to acclimate to the Show, hitting .305/.349/.488 with five home runs over his last 175 plate appearances.  However, Stott has mostly split his time between second base and shortstop, with defensive metrics (albeit in a sample size of not even one full season) indicating that his glove plays better at second base.  While Bogaerts&#8217; own glovework at shortstop has been a question mark for years, he is currently enjoying the best defensive season of his career, with positive grades from the Outs Above Average, Defensive Runs Saved, and UZR/150 metrics.\nIf the Phillies were to sign Bogaerts and move Stott to second base, that leaves Jean Segura as the odd man out.  The Phils hold a $17MM club option ($1MM buyout) on Segura for the 2023 season, and Segura is posting his typical level of offensive production, though he has only 301 plate appearances due to a fractured finger.  Another option would be to retain Segura, and Stott and Segura at second and third base with Bogaerts as the new shortstop.  This would displace the defensive-challenged Alec Bohm from third base, and Bohm could perhaps be tried at first base, and Rhys Hoskins &#8212; who is a free agent after 2023 &#8212; could become a trade chip.\nThere are lots of ways the Phillies could approach things this winter, and payroll will also be a factor in a pursuit of Bogaerts or any other top-flight shortstop.  A lot of salary (Segura, Didi Gregorius, Noah Syndergaard, Zach Eflin, Corey Knebel, Kyle Gibson, Brad Hand, Jeurys Familia) could come off the books in the form of pending free agents and declined club options, but that also leaves a lot of roster holes to be filled.  As per Roster Resource, the Phils are slated to pay the luxury tax in 2022, and thus they&#8217;d have to pay a higher penalty in draft pick compensation for signing a qualifying-offer free agent (i.e. Bogaerts).",

        "description": "Eamon Gilmore is the European Union’s special representative for human rights.In the last year, we have seen an avalanche of crises.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfghanistan, where girls are denied education, and women their equality; Belarus, where there are now over 1,300 political prisoners; Myanmar, where a military coup has sent a democratically elected leader to prison and the Rohingya people continue to suffer; Ethiopia, which has descended into civil war; and Ukraine, where Russia’s aggression continues with mounting evidence of war crimes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe are currently witnessing the highest number of violent conflicts since World War II. In such conflicts, human rights abuses add to the violations of international humanitarian law. What I saw in Bucha, Ukraine earlier this year, and heard from survivors, haunts me, playing in my mind like a newsreel from the 1930s.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussian forces have reportedly forcibly deported children, they have weaponized rape and sexual violence, targeted civilian areas with indiscriminate shelling. The rulebook has been ripped apart and chucked out the window. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nOf course, with all that we are seeing, we run the risk of being overwhelmed by the tide of atrocity and abuse, which can, in turn, lead to defeatism. However, it is vital that we look to the future of human rights with a greater degree of confidence, energy, determination and optimism.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the Human Rights Council and the United Nations, our diplomats are struggling every day to defend the very concept of human rights from those who wish to redefine them, so they are meaningless.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd as I travel around the world, I’m particularly shocked by the stories I hear from detainees and their relatives: tales of torture, the denial of access to lawyers, to loved ones, and accounts of being kept in conditions intended to break the human spirit.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe brutalization lays bare a shocking absence of humanity as the powerful seek to control, subjugate, even erase the humanity of others.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWar crimes, as we have seen in Ukraine, Syria and Ethiopia, cry out for accountability — the victims demand it. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFreedom, equality and dignity shouldn’t just be aspirations or ambitions, but actions. And though this is challenging to achieve, it’s important to remember that much is already being done.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe European Union champions human rights more than any other major actor in the world, both politically and financially. Every day, our 140-plus EU delegations and member country embassies work to bring the EU Action Plan on Human Rights and Democracy to life. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince its launch in 2015, the EU Human Rights Defenders Mechanism, ProtectDefenders.eu, has supported nearly 53,000 human rights defenders and their families who are at risk. Through regular dialogue with over 60 countries or regional groupings, we have frank, detailed discussions about human rights both in non-EU countries and within the bloc — including, just recently, Saudi Arabia.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOur trade schemes also continue to be powerful tools in the promotion of human and labor rights, good governance and sustainable development. In my mission to Pakistan earlier this year, for example, I was able to raise the plight of women textile workers and encourage wage parity. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe tend to underestimate ourselves, and to overestimate the strength of others.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, it’s important to recognize that repression is itself a sign of weakness. Human rights violations and abuses demonstrate latent instability and insecurity, and with new technologies available to document and record them, it’s now harder to get away with war crimes and to hide atrocities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPolitically, we’re also in a better position to hold perpetrators to account. Just three years ago, there was a real risk to the very existence of the International Criminal Court (ICC), with some countries threatening to leave and the U.S. sanctioning its top officials. Now, the ICC is leading the investigation into war crimes in Ukraine. We’ve also seen Russia unable to mobilize votes in multilateral settings in the face of international clamor for accountability.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, we do need to be more innovative and proactive, not just reactive.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe need to improve cooperation with the rest of the world. We need to broaden the constituency for human rights and be mindful of the language we use, making it more understandable to all. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nHuman rights belong to people everywhere. They aren’t the preserve of states, institutions or experts. Better protection and respect for human rights and democracy around the world will reduce inequality, poverty and social exclusion, and it will serve peace. We must state this clearly and consistently. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe EU’s strategic and security interests and its values of human rights and democracy are indivisible. Today, as we tackle the implications of Russia’s illegal aggression on Ukraine, the bloc’s steadfast commitment is a reminder to the rest of the world that we can weather the storms together — but we need to keep pushing.",

        "description": "Jamie Dettmer is opinion editor at POLITICO Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe current economic challenges facing Western economies are greater than anything we’ve seen in living memory, and they hold out the prospect of era-changing political turmoil.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe two quick body blows of the pandemic and Russian President Vladimir Putin’s war on Ukraine in rapid succession have not only left European economies reeling, but they’ve arguably exposed the wishful thinking of policymakers and leaders who were insisting for much of this year and last that inflation would be transitory, and everything would snap back to pre-pandemic normal. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat was never going to happen. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nGovernments are never perfect; they can’t get everything right. But as the blows have landed in recent years, European leaders have all too often been leaden-footed, offering band-aids for long-term problems, or allowing themselves to be trolled into agreeing on fanciful policies that are inadequately thought through and planned. As a result, the West is now mired in a new, terrifying normal of great instability, uncertainty and impoverishment, one partly manufactured by Putin’s Russia and President Xi Jinping’s China, which both leaders are eager to exploit. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis, in turn, has raised a crucial question of competency, undermining public confidence in the institutions of government. And as energy bills start to skyrocket and cost-of-living continues to soar, those same leaders must now be careful in how they handle those who feel abandoned and desperate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis week, Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki highlighted this question of competency, saying, “No matter how we assess the EU, one thing is certain: its decision-making process, especially in a situation where external circumstances are changing fast, is very slow.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, earlier this year, the Edelman Trust Barometer found that public trust in governments running the world&#8217;s democracies has fallen to new lows. Conversely, and disturbingly, it also recorded rising scores in several autocratic states, notably China. “We really have a collapse of trust in democracies,” said Richard Edelman, whose communications group published the survey of over 36,000 respondents in 28 countries that was conducted last year — or, in other words, even before spiraling inflation and energy prices, and before the invasion of Ukraine. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAll too often, what seems to be ever present in current policymaking is a failure to question assumptions, as well as a reluctance to encourage “devil’s advocate” discussions or game out third- and fourth-order effects. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd examples of this short-sightedness in governance abound. Britain’s energy squeeze and water shortage, for instance, has been compounded by a succession of both Labour and Conservative governments failing to plan for worst-case scenarios, resulting in a country that hasn’t built up energy storage capacity or built a new reservoir in 31 years. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nInstead, the U.K. government blithely assumed it would always be able to secure cheap, abundant energy from the Continent and that British rain patterns would never alter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn the Continent, meanwhile, wishful thinking has seamed French and German-led Russia policy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe pandemic may have been a black swan event, but the invasion of Ukraine wasn’t. Not only was it predictable, it was predicted by United States policymakers and intelligence analysts. And Putin has telegraphed his revanchist thinking for years, even well before securing power. As a key adviser to then St. Petersburg mayor Anatoly Sobchak, he’d made no secret of his disgust at the break-up of “historical Russian territory.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFast forward to the aftermath of the military foray into Georgia, the 2014 annexation of Crimea, the testing of new weapons in Syria, and a smaller-scale invasion of Ukraine — in addition to his frequent grievance-filled speeches about the dissolution of the Soviet Union — and European leaders still remained highly reluctant to accept warnings that Putin’s massing of troops on the border of Ukraine was no feint. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt is true that Western powers did move quickly with oil sanctions after the offensive, but even then, they still weren’t thinking through the immediate repercussions. In hindsight, a delay may have been more sensible, as Russian oil tycoon-turned-dissident Mikhail Khodorkovsky noted to POLITICO, arguing the bloc should have secured alternative oil supplies before the embargo, or considered another strategy entirely, such as slapping tariffs on Russian energy. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow, the eye of the storm is approaching, and governments and policymakers have arguably been lagging behind in responding to the inevitable consequences of highly predictable energy price hikes for householders and businesses. By comparison, during the pandemic, they strove to cushion lower-income and rural populations from the economic misery of lockdowns, partly to head off any populist backlash, offering financial support rather quickly.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome governments moved quicker than others — Italy’s outgoing Prime Minister Mario Draghi spent much of his last months in office traipsing around North and Sub-Saharan Africa, securing alternative gas supplies for his country, pulling off what has been described as a miracle: While the country’s dependence on Russian gas hovered around 40 percent at the start of the war, it’s now around 10 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOthers have been much slower to react, despite clamor from homeowners and businesses who have been hit by rising energy costs since March.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBritain has been notably driftless on the crisis, although that appears to be belatedly changing now that the ruling Conservatives have concluded their interminable leadership contest. And EU countries are only now getting down to the details of how to rein in or cap energy prices, or cushion voters who have already been struggling with a broader cost-of-living squeeze, still mired in the consequences of the pandemic.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut isn’t this all still too slow? &nbsp;\n\n\n\nCertainly the 70,000 or so Czechs who protested in Prague last weekend thought so, calling for the resignation of the country’s center-right coalition. “The aim of our demonstration is to demand change, mainly in solving the issue of energy prices, especially electricity and gas, which will destroy our economy this autumn,” event co-organizer Jiri Havel told local media.In response, whether wittingly or not, Czech Prime Minister Petr Fiala accused protesters of acting on behalf of the Kremlin. “It is clear that Russian propaganda and disinformation campaigns are present on our territory and some people simply listen to them,” he said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMaybe so. Maybe some are orchestrated by Russian disinformation. Putin certainly hopes to manipulate Europeans and has been gloating about the prospect of Europe freezing this winter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut as they face mounting clamor and likely social unrest this winter, European leaders ought to avoid labeling protesters or angry householders as Russian stooges, most of whom will simply be reacting to astronomical energy bills, trying to fathom how to cope with cold, hard economic reality, rather than worrying about geopolitics.",

        "description": "Jasen Vinlove-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Miami, FL—The Mets woke up in second place in the division for the first time since April and decided to make it the Marlins’ problem.\nThe Miami Marlins have traditionally played spoiler to the Mets in September, perhaps most notably when they eliminated the Metropolitans from playoff contention in their last game at Shea Stadium in 2007.\nSaturday was simply not one of those games. The Marlins looked every bit of the bottom-tier team that they are, while the Mets looked like they were simply practicing for their October run.  \nMost of the damage came in the fourth inning. Marlins starting pitcher Pablo López gave up four of his five runs in that frame, and was then tagged with three more runs when reliever Andrew Nardi gave up a grand slam to Mark Canha later in the inning.\nFrancisco Lindor went 3-for-5 with a solo home run in front of the Mets-heavy crowd (announced attendance of 17,441). \nLópez continued both his second-half rockiness and his general struggles against the Mets. In nine starts since the All-Star break, López has a 6.52 ERA. His career ERA against the Mets is 6.53. If you take out all of his nine starts against the Mets, his career ERA is 3.15.\nMets starting pitcher Carlos Carrasco is on the other end of the spectrum when he plays Miami. He has whatever the opposite of “South Beach Flu” is. In two starts at loanDepot Park, he has given up one earned run in 13 ⅓ IP. In four starts against Miami this year, he has a 2.15 ERA. \nThe lone two runs from the Marlins came on a Garrett Cooper line drive double in the first inning and a Jacob Stallings single to left field in the eighth. Cooper has driven in a run in three straight games for the first time since June 3-5.\nThe Atlanta Braves overtook the Mets by half a game with a win over the Seattle Mariners late Friday night. The Mets had given up their 10.5-game division lead, despite going 52-35 over their last 87 games. As of 10:20 p.m. on Saturday, the Mets and Braves share the NL East lead.\n\n\n\nDon Mattingly speaks to the media after the @Marlins 11-3 loss to the Mets. #MLB | #MakeItMiami pic.twitter.com/X0i2BGTikT— Bally Sports Florida: Marlins (@BallyMarlins) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n      Win Probability Chart - Mets @ Marlins\n  \n\nThe Marlins and Mets will meet for the rubber match on Sunday at 1:40 p.m. Jesús Luzardo will take the mound against Taijuan Walker.",

        "link": "https://www.denverpost.com/2022/09/10/roberto-clemente-legacy-rockies-kyle-freeland/",
        "description": "Sitting in a prominent place on a shelf in my baseball library is &#8220;Clemente: The Passion and Grace of Baseball&#8217;s Last Hero,&#8221; by David Maraniss.\nIt&#8217;s a splendid biography, capturing the beauty, grace, passion, and contradictions of Pittsburgh Pirates Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente.\nWhen it was announced that left-hander Kyle Freeland was the Rockies&#8217; nominee for the annual Roberto Clemente Award, I started re-reading Maraniss&#8217; book. One particular phrase caught my attention: &#8220;What burned in the eyes of Roberto Clemente was the fire of dignity.&#8221;\nFor those who don&#8217;t know, the Roberto Clemente Award is Major League Baseball&#8217;s annual recognition of a player &#8220;who best represents the game of baseball through extraordinary character, community involvement, philanthropy and positive contributions, both on and off the field.&#8221;\nFreeland, a Denver native, embodies all of that.\nFor several years, Freeland, along with his wife, Ashley, have been involved with Special Olympics Colorado, volunteering at various events and raising funds.\nFreeland, obviously, is honored to be the Rockies&#8217; nominee. But I was curious, did he know anything about Clemente? After all, Freeland was born more than 20 years after Clemente died on New Year&#8217;s Eve 1972. And through the years, I&#8217;ve discovered that many major leaguers are not well-versed in baseball history.\nJackie Robinson, of course, is an inescapable part of that history, as he should be. Clemente, from Puerto Rico, was, in a sense, the Jackie Robinson of the Spanish-speaking world. But he&#8217;s not nearly as well known. Freeland was taken aback when I asked him if he knew anything about Clemente.\n&#8220;Of course, I know who Clemente was,&#8221; Freeland said.\nHe knew that Clemente was much more than just one of the greatest outfielders in history.\n&#8220;He was a humanitarian and an incredible person and a great ballplayer,&#8221; Freeland said.\nFreeland knows that after 18 seasons in the majors, Clemente was killed in a plane crash on that fateful New Year&#8217;s Eve as he attempted to deliver food and medical supplies to Nicaragua after a devasting earthquake.\nWhen Freeland was in the seventh grade at Hamilton Middle School, he did a major project for National History Day.\n&#8220;We were required a pick an icon in history and do a presentation on them,&#8221; Freeland said. &#8220;I did something mostly on Jackie Robinson because I wanted to do something about breaking the color barrier. But I also included Roberto Clemente for his helping break the color barrier and for his philanthropy.&#8221;\nFreeland became the Rockies&#8217; nominee after Ian Desmond retired from baseball. Desmond was the Rockies’ Roberto Clemente nominee for five consecutive years, from 2017-21. Desmond, who opted out of both the 2020 and &#8217;21 seasons due to the COVID-19 pandemic, spent last year focusing on Newtown Connection, a youth program he co-founded that runs through the Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of Sarasota and Desoto Counties in Florida.\nFreeland was ready when Desmond passed him the baton.\n&#8220;This is a very big deal for me,&#8221; Freeland said. &#8220;Over the years, I&#8217;ve been trying to build up my efforts of helping out my community.\n&#8220;I remember having a conversation with Ian about the award in 2019 and he said, &#8216;Whenever I&#8217;m done, I want you to be the nominee.&#8217;\n&#8220;He also said, &#8216;You have no idea how much impact you have off the field with kids, adults, fans. You can change a lot of futures and mindsets with very small things you do in your community.&#8217; So I took that to heart. And Ian was one of the first people I called when I was told I was going to be the Rockies&#8217; nominee. So I kept that promise to him.&#8221;\nThursday will mark the 21st annual Roberto Clemente Day. A special logo will appear on the bases and official dugout lineup cards and a special tribute video will be played in ballparks.\nThe Rockies will be in Chicago on Thursday, so Freeland will be recognized on Sept. 19 at Coors Field prior to the Rockies&#8217;  game against the Giants.\nEach major league club has a nominee for the award and fan voting is going on now at MLB.com. The winner of the fan vote will count as one vote among those cast by the blue-ribbon panel to determine the 2022 Robert Clemente Award winner.",

        "description": "Erik Williams-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Astros came up short against the Angels on Saturday night. \nThe Astros and the Angels played the second game of a three-game set at Minute Maid Park with 38,533 in the house on Saturday night. \n\nTaylor Ward got to Houston starter José Urquidy quickly, driving in Mike Trout with a one-out single in the first inning for a 1-0 lead. In the bottom of the first, Jose Altuve scored the tying run after singling, taking second on a wild pitch, and coming home on a Yuli Gurriel single. \nAnaheim made quick work of the newly retied contest, scoring four in the top half of the second for starter Shohei Ohtani. (note: Ohtani didn’t need very much help) Andrew Velazquez brought home Mike Ford with an RBI-groundout, then Trout hit a three-run homer to make it 5-1, Angels. \nIn the fifth inning, Ward drove in Ford for the final run off Urquidy, who retired after completing the frame. This was the third time this season that Urquidy gave up six runs with a resultant GameScore of 26, which was correspondingly his third worst mark of the season. He struck out four and allowed 10 hits and a walk, putting 61-of-88 offerings over the plate and leaving as the losing pitcher of record.\nThe score remained 6-1 in favor of Anaheim for the rest of the contest. \n\nAltuve singled in the first inning and scored Houston’s run, but didn’t have a lot of luck through the rest of the game. He finished one-for-four with two strikeouts. \nGurriel led Houston’s offense by going three-for-four, raising his average to .242. It was his eighth three-hit game of the season.\n\nYordan Alvarez went one-for-three with an eighth-inning two-out double and a walk. \nKyle Tucker finished 0-for-four with two strikeouts and five runners left stranded.\nTrout’s homer was his 34th of the season, and the sixth game in a row in which he has gone deep. He finished two-for-three with a double, a walk, two runs, and a strikeout. \n\nSeth Martinez pitched two innings of relief for Houston, putting 22-of-33 pitches over the plate, striking out three, and allowing no hits and one walk. \n\nWill Smith whiffed two in a perfect inning of work, getting 9-of-14 pitches between the wickets. \nPhil Maton walked a batter, but also struck out two in a hitless inning. He plated 11-of-17 offerings.\nOhtani got 48-of-79 pitches in the black, striking out seven and giving up one run on six hits and two walks to finish with a 56 GameScore. While warming up for the sixth inning, he removed himself due to a developing blister. Due to the major league rule that was created specifically for him, he was able to remain in the contest as the designated hitter. \n\nCheck back tomorrow for the rubber game between these two, and the final matchup of the season. Houston is 12-6 against the Angels so far this year, and hope to get to 90 victories with their second attempt. They’ll turn to Luis Garcia (11-8, 3.99) against Tucker Davidson (2-5, 6.42).",

        "description": "The Cubs placed second baseman Nick Madrigal on the 10-day injured list due to a right groin strain, and activated Patrick Wisdom (left ring finger sprain) from the 10-day IL to fill the open roster spot.  Madrigal suffered the injury in yesterday&#8217;s game, and given the lack of time remaining in the season, it isn&#8217;t out of the question that Madrigal might be shut down entirely.  This is the second groin injury (the first strain was to Madrigal&#8217;s left groin) and third injury overall for the second baseman in 2022, after a back problem cost him three weeks in May.\nOverall, Madrigal has played in only 59 games this season, only slightly topping the 54 games he played during a 2021 campaign that was shortened by hamstring surgery.  While Madrigal is still eyed as the Cubs&#8217; second baseman of the future, this health history is already concerning, and it&#8217;s fair to say that his injuries were certainly a factor in his .249/.305/.282 slash line in 228 PA this season.  With the Cubs out of contention, their eyes are on 2023, and aren&#8217;t likely to push Madrigal back onto the field unless his current groin issue ends up being pretty minor.\nUpdates on other injury situations from around the National League&#8230;\n\nPhillies interim manager Rob Thomson updated reporters (including MLB.com&#8217;s Todd Zolecki) on several injured Philadelphia players, including two pitchers ready to return to the mound.  Seranthony Dominguez will be activated prior to tomorrow&#8217;s game against the Nationals, after missing a little over three weeks due to right triceps tendinitis.  Zach Eflin will be activated from the 60-day IL prior to Tuesday&#8217;s game, with Eflin possibly working as an opener as he embarks on a new role as a relief pitcher.  Eflin has been out since late June due to knee problems, and with less time to ramp up for a starter&#8217;s workload, Philadelphia will instead use Eflin out of the bullpen.  Zack Wheeler (forearm tendinitis) won&#8217;t be back until at least September 20, but Wheeler threw 15 pitches off a mound today, and Thomson said Wheeler will throw a proper bullpen session on Monday or Tuesday.\nKris Bryant hasn&#8217;t played since July 31 due to plantar fasciitis, and Rockies manager Bud Black wasn&#8217;t sure if the slugger would be able to return before the season is over.  &#8220;There is time but I don’t know if it’s going to happen&#8230;He hasn’t had a bat in his hand for a while, but he’s feeling much better,&#8221; Black told reporters, including The Denver Post&#8217;s Patrick Saunders.  Bryant has been able to play catch and lift weights now that he is no longer in a walking boot, though it remains to be seen when (or if) he&#8217;d be able to take part in fuller baseball activities.  Between the platar fasciitis and two separate IL stints due to back injuries, Bryant&#8217;s first year with the Rockies has essentially been a lost season, with only 42 games played.  The one bright spot is that Bryant at least hit well when he was able to play, contributing a .306/.376/.475 slash line and five homers in 181 plate appearances.",

        "description": "Photo by David Berding/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Are things unraveling for good? The 1D clue in today’s New York Times crossword filled a three-letter space, and was amusingly clued as “Something you might haul.” Need a hint? Well, in Minnesota’s case, it could also be clued as “something you might be getting handed to you.” Getting the picture?\nAfter opening up a 7-0 lead on Friday before allowing six unanswered runs, Terry Francona’s junior heroes posted a 6-0 lead on Saturday, and didn’t give anything back until the Twins miraculously scratched four across, all with two away, in the bottom of the ninth.\nThe Guardians have had difficulty keeping the pressure on against Minnesota, as each game has seen both teams scoring all of their runs, then patiently allowing the other side to do the same (although tonight’s comeback fell just short of yesterday’s.)\nI’m going to take an unconventional approach to this one and introduce the studs and duds early, because God knows this team needs to shake it up a little bit.\nSTUDS:\nDH Luis Arraez (3-for-5, 2 2B, RBI)\nSS Carlos Correa (3-for-5, K)\nBoth of Arraez’s doubles came with one out, after Jake Cave had been retired leading off an inning. And both times, he advanced to third on a hit from Carlos Correa immediately after. And both times, he was not driven in by the heart of the order, with Jose Miranda and Max Kepler failing to bring them home.\nDUDS:\nRP Cole Sands (3.1 IP, 2 H, 3 ER, 5 BB, 1 K)\nEffectively the entire lineup, spots 3-9, more or less\nIt’s hard to tag Chris Archer with a “dud,” as he had to exit after two innings with pec tightness. It’s more of the Archer situation as a whole that’s entered “dud” territory, as he increasingly functions as a glorified opener in front of an overtaxed bullpen. It’s not his fault, and the ability of Rocco and his strength and conditioning staff to get Archer through a full season is commendable — but the team was in a less-than-desirable situation having to rely on Cole Sands at length in a crucial game.\nSands’ third inning was the stuff of nightmares; he walked two on either side of a double-play, hit a guy, walked another guy, walked in a run, then hit a guy to score another. This would make it 4-0 Guardians, as they’d already notched two in the first on an Amed Rosario homer.\nRegarding the offense, there were hits scattered around the rest of Minnesota’s batting order, which has increasingly become Arraez-Correa-Miranda-help-please-oh-lord-LORD-HELP mom come get me Sandy Leon is in the box and there’s men on base. But, nothing to write home about.

Iowa and Myrtle Beach lose.  Iowa Cubs\nThe Iowa Cubs lost to the Jacksonville Jumbo Shrimp (Marlins), 3-2.\nAll three runs scored by Jacksonville came off starter Caleb Kilian, who allowed three runs on four hits—including a two-run home run in the second inning—over 2.2 innings. Kilian had some control issues as he walked five and had two wild pitches. Kilian struck out three.\nKervin Castro cleared waivers and reported to Iowa. He relieved Kilian in the third inning. He faced four batters and struck out three of them. The other one was retired trying for a bunt single, so he was perfect over 1.1 innings. \nCam Sanders had two innings of middle relief when he gave up neither a run nor a hit. He did walk one and struck out two. It was Sanders’ fourth-straight appearance without allowing an earned run. \nThe I-Cubs had but four hits tonight, but one of them was a solo home run by first baseman Matt Mervis in the top of the first inning. Mervis now has 31 home runs this season and ten with the I-Cubs. Mervis went 2 for 4.\nTennessee Smokies\nThe Tennessee Smokies reeled in the Pensacola Blue Wahoos (Marlins), 6-4.\nBen Brown started and got the win. Brown allowed two runs on just three hits (one solo home run) over five innings. What was really impressive is that Brown struck out seven and walked just one.\nBailey Horn finished out this game with a two-inning save. Horn surrendered two hits but no runs. He struck out two and walked no one.\nThird baseman Chase Strumpf connected for a two-run home run in the third inning, his 21st this season. Strumpf went 1 for 4 with a walk.\nFor the second-straight day, DH Miguel Amaya homered in this game. This one came with the bases empty in the fifth inning and was his sixth this season and fourth in Double-A. Amaya 2 for 2 and was hit by a pitch twice. He scored two runs.\nSince returning to Tennessee after Tommy John surgery, Amaya has hit .284 with a .375 OBP in 27 games. His slugging percentage is .495 in that span.\nFirst baseman Bryce Ball doubled twice in a 2 for 4 game. He drove in two runs, including the first run of the game in the bottom of the first.\nShortstop Andy Weber went 2 for 4 with one run driven in.\nCenter fielder Zach Davis was 1 for 2 with two steals and he was hit by a pitch.

        "description": "Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Dodgers got a rare outburst of runs against Blake Snell, riding a fifth-inning rally to beat the Padres 8-4 on Saturday night at Petco Park. The win lowered the Dodgers’ magic number to four to clinch the National League West.\nSaturday had all the makings of a typical Snell start against the Dodgers. He allowed only nine runs in his first nine starts against them, including the postseason. Two of those starts were injury-shortened, but still covered 40⅔ innings. Though four innings in this one, he allowed only one, with five strikeouts, consistent with his 37.5-percent career strikeout rate against them.\nIn the fifth inning, a familiar pattern emerged. Trayce Thompson fell behind 0-2 but earned a walk. Austin Barnes doubled into the corner, extending his hit streak to seven games, with extra-base hits in three of his four September starts. This became a 1-1 game with runners on second and third for the Dodgers, with Snell about to face the top of the order for a third time.\nThat wasn’t the exact scenario of Game 6 of the 2020 World Series, but it was close enough (just two batters off, regarding the score). On that night in Texas, after a hit by Barnes, Snell wasn’t allowed to face the Dodgers a third time through. On Saturday, he remained in the game, and paid the price.\nMookie Betts walked on four pitches to load the bases, then fell behind 3-1 to Trea Turner. Snell got 14 combined swinging strikes on his slider and curve, but couldn’t get them over in the fifth. Turner hammered a fastball for a three-run double, and Freddie Freeman followed with another double on a fastball.\nAll of a sudden, Snell’s night was done, 27 pitches into the fifth with nobody out, and five runs charged to his ledger. Saturday was the first time Snell has allowed more than two runs to the Dodgers.\nThat was more than enough for Julio Urías, who seems to have roughly the same outing every time out no matter how his stuff is playing. \nIt wasn’t always the smoothest ride for Urías, who walked two in a 25-pitch first inning. He escaped without damage, yelling in a combination of disgust and relief on his way back to the dugout. In the second inning, a single by José Azocar on an 0-2 fastball caused Urías to pace around the mound, even faking to throw his glove.\nUrías settled in after that, picking off Azocar to end the inning. Urías pitched seven innings, and has lasted at least six innings four straight starts and nine times in his last 10. \nHe allowed solo home runs to Manny Machado in the third and sixth innings, continuing a remarkable stretch. After a second-inning RBI single by Twins centerfielder Gilberto Celestino on August 9, Urías has pitched 35 innings and allowed a total of five runs, all on solo home runs.\nThe two runs against Urías were his most allowed since July 29. He maintained his lead among National League pitchers with a 2.30 ERA. \nTemperatures cooled, but Freeman didn’t\nFreeman homered and singled in the series opener in San Diego on Friday, then drove in the Dodgers’ first run Friday with a single in the third inning after Trea Turner tripled.\nHis double in the fifth was his MLB-best 45th of the season, fifth-most by a Dodger in a single season. With 24 games remaining on the schedule, Freeman is four behind Shawn Green’s LA Dodgers mark set in 2003, and seven behind Johnny Frederick’s franchise-record 52 doubles, hit in 1929 for Brooklyn.\nFreeman homered again in the seventh, again driving in Turner, who walked. Freeman on the night had four hits, giving him an MLB-leading 178 on the season, and drove in four runs. Freeman has five games with four hits this season, and four games with at least four RBI. \nFreeman also leads the majors with a .330 batting average. If a Dodgers first baseman leading baseball with a .330 batting average sounds familiar, well here are Freeman’s most similar players by age, per Baseball Reference:\n  \n        \n      Source: Baseball Reference\n  \nSaturday particulars\nHome runs: Freddie Freeman (19); Manny Machado 2 (28)\nWP — Julio Urías (16-7): 7 IP, 5 hits, 2 runs, 2 walks, 5 strikeouts\nLP — Blake Snell (6-9): 4+ IP, 7 hits, 5 runs, 3 walks, 5 strikeouts\nUp next\nAndrew Heaney will try to turn off the home run spigot in Sunday afternoon’s series finale (1:10 p.m., SportsNet LA), with right-hander Joe Musgrove pitching for San Diego.",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  C.J. Cron belted another homer to lift the Rockies over the D-backs on a chilly September evening After last night’s madness, the Rockies’ and Diamondbacks’ offense fell back down to earth a little bit. Luckily, though, the Rockies were able to continue their winning ways and secure their first four-game win streak since July, and also their 40th win at Coors Field in 2022.\nUreña Sharper\nAfter back-to-back rough outings, José Ureña looked sharper tonight. He didn’t allow a hit until the fourth inning and only allowed one run, but didn’t make it out of the sixth inning for the third-straight game. Ureña threw 5 1⁄3 innings, allowing one run on five hits while striking out five and walking two. Considering he only struck out a single batter in both of his last two starts combined, this was a marked improvement and luckily the Rockies offense showed up to secure their fourth-straight win.\n\n\nJosé Ureña's 5 strikeouts pic.twitter.com/c9L8O8xtRu— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\nHe also got tangled up in a scary collision with Geraldo Perdomo at first base, but luckily both players were able to get up on their own power and remain in the game. Perdomo was lifted in favor of pinch-hitter Corbin Carroll in the eighth inning.\nCron Zone, Part Deaux\nAfter his record-setting homer last night, C.J. Cron decided to continue his streak with a three-run, 457-footer to center to drive in Yonathan Daza (who walked) and Randal Grichuk (who hit a 424-foot double that barely stayed in the park). It was Cron’s second homer in as many days, the 21st allowed by Madison Bumgarner this year (18th to a right-handed batter), and the 13th homer hit by the Rockies this week. This was Cron’s 28th homer of the season — he’s now two away from tying his career-high of 30, set in 2018 when he was with the Tampa Bay Rays. \n\n\n¡Qué CRONazo, C.J.!  ​ #LosRockies pic.twitter.com/iXwprefLPA— Rockies de Colorado (@LosRockies) September 11, 2022\n\n\n\nIt was followed by back-to-back doubles by Brendan Rodgers and Michael Toglia, and a walk by Elehuris Montero. Rodgers would come around to score on a sacrifice fly by Sean Bouchard, but Alan Trejo popped out to end the inning.\nBullpen Sharp\nAfter Ureña’s exit, the bullpen held the D-backs to exactly zero hits over 3 2⁄3 innings. Carlos Estévez walked Cooper Hummel but Justin Lawrence, Estévez and Daniel Bard all struck out a batter apiece. Not too shabby!\nEjections, Ejections, Ejections!\nTo add to the night’s excitement, Ketel Marte and Torey Lovullo were both tossed after a questionable strike call at the plate. Yesterday, Brendan Rodgers was also tossed in the fifth. Since the offense wasn’t as potent tonight, I guess this was the best way to get things going (although it didn’t spark anything for the D-backs). \nUp Next\nThe Rockies will look the sweep the series against the Snakes and try to tie their season-high five-game win streak. They will also try to hold off reigning NL Pitcher of the Month Zac Gallen (11-2, 2.42 ERA), who will duel against Ryan Feltner (2-7, 5.85 ERA). First pitch is at 1:10pm MT — see you then!",

        "description": "C.J. Cron is dangerous again. Madison Bumgarner discovered that the hard way on a cool Saturday night at Coors Field.\nCron rocketed a three-run, 457-foot homer off the accomplished veteran left-hander in the sixth inning, lifting the Rockies to a 4-1 victory over Arizona. The Rockies have won four consecutive games for the first time since putting together a season-best five-game winning streak July 12-16.\n&#8220;I was just trying to get the runners in from second and third,&#8221; Cron said. &#8220;I take pride in getting the runners in when I can. I don&#8217;t think he wanted to throw the pitch he did right there. But fortunately, he did, and I put a good swing on it.&#8221;\nColorado got an encouraging start from right-hander Jose Urena and stellar work from the bullpen trio of Justin Lawrence, Carlos Estevez and closer Daniel Bard, who pocketed his 29th save in 32 chances.\nPrior to the sixth inning, Bumgarner smothered Colorado hitters, limiting them to two hits. But Randal Grichuk led off the sixth with a double and Yonathan Daza walked, setting the scene for Cron&#8217;s demolition of Bumgarner&#8217;s 2-2 fastball.\n&#8220;He was using all of his pitches to both sides of the plate,&#8221; Cron said. &#8220;He would use his fastball in, with his cutter off of it and the pitches looked very similar. And he would throw the fastball away with his changeup to that side of the plate. He was very good tonight.\n&#8220;His velo is not how it used to be, but he still knows how to pitch. He&#8217;s one of the best out there at making his pitches kind of all look the same.&#8221;\nNonetheless, Bumgarner is struggling. He suffered his 14th loss of the season, a career-high. He has not recorded a win since July 23, going 0-4 with a 7.68 ERA over his last eight starts.\nThe Rockies then added an insurance run against Bumgarner in the sixth. Brendan Rodgers ripped a double that eluded diving center fielder Alek Thomas. Rookie first baseman Michael Toglia followed up with a bloop double to left, though Rodgers was held up at third. Rodgers scored on Sean Bouchard&#8217;s sacrifice fly.\nCron has gone yard in four of his last seven games and now has 28 homers, two shy of the career-high 30 he hit with Tampa Bay in 2018. He hit a towering 504-foot homer in Colorado&#8217;s 13-10 win on Friday night, tied for the longest homer in Coors Field history.\nThe first-time All-Star hit 21 homers before the break but has a relatively modest seven after the break. In fact, prior to his recent power surge, he&#8217;d hit just three homers across the first 36 games of the second half.\nStill, there&#8217;s no denying his game-changing ability when he&#8217;s in the zone.\n&#8220;I haven&#8217;t done anything crazy,&#8221; Cron said when asked if he&#8217;s changed anything recently. &#8220;Obviously I wish I hadn&#8217;t (stunk) for a month and a half. Just bad hitting, I guess.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m starting to feel a little bit more comfortable, but I&#8217;d still like to drive the ball a little more. The homers are there but after that, there isn&#8217;t much else. Hopefully, I can finish strong and get back on track.&#8221;\nSince the All-Star break, Cron is hitting .201 (34-for-169) with five doubles, one triple, seven homers 26 RBIs in 43 games.\nUrena, who&#8217;s been struggling, was searching for a strong performance and he got it, pitching 5 1/3 innings of five-hit ball and giving up one run. He struck out five and walked two.\n&#8220;We talked about it before the game that we wanted to see him use more secondary pitches,&#8221; manager Bud Black said, noting that Urena threw three consecutive changeups to strike out Daulton Varsho in the third inning. &#8220;That&#8217;s something we&#8217;d like to see more of in the coming starts.&#8221;\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tProgressive catching guru Jerry Weinstein one of Rockies&#8217; hidden treasures: &#8220;He&#8217;s a hard (blank), but in the very best way&#8221;\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSaunders: Rockies&#8217; Kyle Freeland embracing the legacy of Roberto Clemente\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Kris Bryant facing time crunch to return\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tWATCH: Rockies&#8217; C.J.

Cron and a walk-off by Elias Diaz\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\nUrena&#8217;s only high-traffic inning was the fourth when the Diamondbacks took a brief 1-0 lead. Jake McCarthy, Christian Walker and Ketel Marte hit three consecutive singles to get the D-backs on the board. Urena escaped further trouble by getting Emmanuel Rivera to ground into a 5-4-3 double play.\nArizona threatened again in the sixth. Varsho led off with a double and McCarthy drew a one-out walk. Black had seen enough and he called in Lawrence from the bullpen. The right-hander induced Walker to bounce into another 5-4-3, inning-ending double play.\nLawrence, who pitched 1 2/3 scoreless innings, continues to make his case as a late-inning reliever for next season. Estevez pitched a scoreless eighth and Bard tossed a perfect ninth, whittling his ERA to 2.06.\nThe Rockies finish their penultimate homestand of the season Sunday afternoon against Arizona as they try to complete a three-game sweep.",
