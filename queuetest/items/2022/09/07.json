        "description": "When President Joe Biden called out &#8220;Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans&#8221; last Thursday as representative of &#8220;an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic,&#8221; he drew a clear line between those supporting the former president and those from all parties who support democracy. He quite deliberately drew a line between Trump supporters and &#8220;mainstream Republicans&#8221; who do not embrace the &#8220;extreme ideology&#8221; of their former allies.Immediately, Trump supporters attacked the president and rushed to defend Trump, just as more news broke about his theft of classified documents and other presidential records when he left the White House. This tied the Republican Party to Trump, along with what is a stunning national security story that continues to unfold.&nbsp;Just tonight we learned that FBI agents found a document detailing the military defenses of a foreign government, including its nuclear capabilities, during last month&#8217;s search of Mar-a-Lago. What is at stake here is not simply information about the U.S., or even information about the way our leaders conceive of what is best for the U.S. What is at stake is the security of the U.S. and our democratic allies. Some of the documents they found were so highly restricted that they required special clearances on a need-to-know basis. Trump kept them in boxes at Mar-a-Lago.&nbsp;This situation is extraordinary, but yesterday, Senator Marco Rubio demonstrated his loyalty to Trump when he referred to Trump&#8217;s theft and mishandling of the documents as &#8220;a fight over storage of documents.&#8221; Rubio is the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee.&nbsp;Yesterday&#8217;s decision by Judge Aileen Cannon further illustrated the strength of the MAGA Republicans and their positions in places of power.&nbsp;Cannon was nominated by Trump and confirmed after he lost the 2020 election. Yesterday she granted Trump&#8217;s request for a special master to review the government documents the FBI recovered from Mar-a-Lago on August 8. Today, Ian Millhiser at Vox explained that Cannon&#8217;s order could delay the FBI investigation by as much as years (other analysts argue that she has cut off only one avenue of investigation, so they believe it will not be that big a speedbump). The Department of Justice can appeal the decision, which Millhiser agrees with other legal analysts is &#8220;riddled with legal errors,&#8221; but an appeal would go to the 11th circuit, where Trump appointed 6 of the 11 judges who, if they wished, could further delay the case, and then agree with Cannon. The Department of Justice could then appeal to the Supreme Court: which now has a 6 to 3 Republican majority, three of whom Trump himself appointed.&nbsp;Cannon&#8217;s order appears to have been intended to send a message. Bloomberg News legal and political reporter Zoe Tillman said today that seven senior officials who served in Republican administrations, including two former governors, a former attorney general, a former acting attorney general, and a former deputy attorney general, asked to send in a &#8220;friend of the court&#8221; brief in opposition to Trump&#8217;s request. Cannon denied their request, saying the court &#8220;appreciates the movants&#8217; willingness to participate in this matter but does not find&#8230;[it]...warranted.&#8221;&nbsp;Millhiser asked: &#8220;Why would a judge do this unless they are trying to advertise the fact that they are not open to opposing arguments? Just accept the&#8230;brief and then don&#8217;t read it if you don&#8217;t want to make a public spectacle out of not caring what anyone says.&#8221; Los Angeles Times legal affairs columnist Harry Litman said he didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d ever seen a court reject a friend of the court brief before.&nbsp;MAGA Republicans are standing behind Trump in his determination to overturn the 2020 election. In Michigan on Friday, six people filed a suit to order Governor Gretchen Whitmer and Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson to &#8220;work together to rerun the Michigan 2020 presidential election as soon as possible.&#8221; One of those joining the suit previously handed over her township&#8217;s vote tabulator to a group trying to prove &#8220;voter fraud&#8221; in the election.&nbsp;And today, Zachary Cohen and Jason Morris of CNN reported that newly released surveillance video shows that on January 7, 2021, a Republican county official in Georgia escorted into her county&#8217;s election offices two operatives working with Trump&#8217;s attorneys to try to find voter fraud. That same day the voting systems were breached. The official, Cathy Latham, is under investigation for her role as a fake elector and has given conflicting testimony about her actions. Some of Trump&#8217;s allies in the fake election scheme seem also to have launched a multistate effort to gain access to voting machines after the 2020 election.&nbsp;Lies about the election from right-wing media convinced these MAGA Republicans of the Big Lie that the election had been stolen, but documents emerging from the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit against the Fox News Channel are illustrating that the people feeding those lies knew they were false. Dominion has sued the media giant for defamation, saying its hosts knew the stories they told of the voting machines switching votes were false and that it has been &#8220;irreparably harmed&#8221; by the lies that will lead to more than $600 million in lost profits over the next 8 years. The document production has yielded a November 2020 email from an FNC producer insisting that it must keep host Jeanine Pirro off the air because she was spreading conspiracy theories to back Trump&#8217;s lies that the election had been stolen.&nbsp;And, today, New Mexico judge Francis J. Mathew ruled that Couy Griffin, the founder of Cowboys for Trump, must be removed from his office as Otero County commissioner for participating in the January 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. In a lawsuit brought by New Mexico citizens, Mathew ruled that Griffin is disqualified for office under the Fourteenth Amendment, which prohibits from holding office anyone who had engaged in &#8220;insurrection or rebellion&#8221; against the country. This is the first time this clause has been enforced since 1869, and the first time a court has found the attack on the Capitol was an insurrection.Now other Republicans are weighing in to suggest that, now that the lines have been made very clear indeed, they will stand with the Constitution if there is an attempt to take the government by force. Today, eight former secretaries of defense and five former chairmen of the Joint Chiefs of Staff published an open letter in the national security outlet War on the Rocks outlining the &#8220;principles of civilian control and best practices of civil-military relations.&#8221; The leading illustration was an image of the U.S. Constitution.&nbsp;These former military leaders noted the many factors that have created &#8220;an exceptionally challenging civil-military environment,&#8221; and reiterated that &#8220;civilian control of the military is part of the bedrock foundation of American democracy.&#8221; They noted that &#8220;[t]he military&#8212;active-duty, reserve, and National Guard&#8212;have carefully delimited roles in law enforcement [that] must be taken only insofar as they are consistent with the Constitution and relevant statutes,&#8221; and that &#8220;[m]ilitary and civilian leaders must be diligent about keeping the military separate from partisan political activity.&#8221;&nbsp;This is a calmer echo of the open letter the ten living former secretaries of defense published on January 3, 2021, in the Washington Post, which called for a peaceful transition of power after the 2020 election and seemed to warn colleagues not to back the former president&#8217;s attempts to create an uprising. They said: &#8220;Efforts to involve the U.S. armed forces in resolving election disputes would take us into dangerous, unlawful and unconstitutional territory. Civilian and military officials who direct or carry out such measures would be accountable, including potentially facing criminal penalties, for the grave consequences of their actions on our republic.&#8221;Perhaps most notably, in an interview with Greg Sargent of the Washington Post, published today, longtime conservative Bill Kristol said that, at least in the short term, the Republican Party cannot be saved. &#8220;And,&#8221; he offered, &#8220;if we don&#8217;t have two reasonably healthy parties, the unhealthy party has to be defeated.&#8221;And, finally, the formula shortage has largely fallen out of the news, but the administration has not dropped the ball. Yesterday, the administration completed the twenty-second mission of Operation Fly Formula, which has now flown in more than 85 million 8-ounce bottle equivalents.&#8212;https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2022/09/02/president-biden-announces-twenty-second-operation-fly-formula-mission/https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/speeches-remarks/2022/09/01/remarks-by-president-bidenon-the-continued-battle-for-the-soul-of-the-nation/https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2022/9/6/23339017/trump-fbi-mar-a-lago-aileen-cannon-judge-special-master-supreme-court-executive-privilege&#8203;&#8203;Ian Millhiser @imillhiserWhy would a judge do this unless they are trying to advertise the fact that they are not open to opposing arguments?

It was summer and the days were hot.

Everyone, infant babies included, crouched in silence as they waited for the smugglers to return.

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Rockies score ten runs - including two decisive Randal Grichuk homers - to collect the walk-off victory against the Brew Crew The Rockies were scored upon early and couldn’t figure out Brandon Woodruff at all. It seemed an inevitable defeat was in store, yet Colorado’s bats woke up late and beat up Milwaukee’s bullpen to score an improbable walk-off victory 10-7 on Tuesday.\n\nBrewers bombs in the first\nChad Kuhl’s first inning was inauspicious, to say the least. The game’s first hitter, Christian Yelich, took Kuhl’s middle-middle changeup out to what seemed like the stratosphere, a 499-foot home run that gave Milwaukee an early 1-0 lead. The homer is the longest hit by a left-handed hitter in the Statcast era, and the second-longest overall.\n\n\n499-FOOT YELI  (MLB x @FTX_Official) pic.twitter.com/GqTLC76cu2— MLB (@MLB) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nHunter Renfroe got in on the action too, as he took Kuhl straight to center field for a two-run shot two batters later. The Rockies quickly found themselves in a 3-0 hole after just the first frame. \nMonty mashes\nIt’s hard not to like Elehuris Montero, isn’t it? The rookie has certainly impressed this season, and on Tuesday added his fifth long ball of the season to his list of accolades. Milwaukee starter Brandon Woodruff, who had not allowed a base runner with one out in the bottom of the third, threw a curveball that was inside and out of the zone to Montero. Montero was able to turn his body and send the ball high into the Denver sky for a homer and get the Rockies on the board as the game now sat at 3-1. \n\n\n MONTY MASH  pic.twitter.com/mII6ij765N— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nMiddle inning moments\nIn the top of the fourth frame, Kuhl had begun to settle in some. He seemed to be gaining confidence and may have been on his way to working deeper into the game, especially as he was able to record the first two outs without issue. Keston Hiura’s double shook that notion though, and Hiura was then joined on the base paths by Jace Peterson after he walked. Both would subsequently score on Omar Narváez’s double, sinking the Rockies deficit to four runs. \nKuhl’s night would end prematurely yet again. His final line read as 4 1⁄3 innings pitched, allowing five earned runs on six hits, two walks, and five strikeouts.\nColorado had opportunities to fight back in the following innings, such as the bottom of the fourth when the returning Yonathan Daza led off with a walk to set things up for the middle of the order. They went down quietly though and the score remained 5-1. \nThe bottom of the fifth was the same. A two-out rally by way of a Montero walk and Alan Trejo single put two on and gave Ryan McMahon a chance to cut into the deficit. Instead, he flew out to end the threat and keep the score right where it was. \nEighth-inning explosion\nThe bottom of the eighth frame created an entirely different vibe to the ballgame - and it happened out of nowhere.\nWoodruff had kept the Rockies down all game, but his outing was done after seven innings. Enter Luis Perdomo, who was met with four consecutive hits. A double by Montero got it going and was followed by a Trejo RBI single. Ryan McMahon then recorded a knock to put two on for Daza, whose shoulder is looking juuust fine as he used it to crank a ball out to center field for a three-run homer, putting Colorado within a run.\n\n\nWelcome back, @Yonathandaza_‼️ pic.twitter.com/uAzWoxpsrj— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nRandal Grichuk then decided to get in on the action. As Perdomo departed (having thrown just eight pitches), Peter Strzelecki entered in relief and allowed Grichuk’s 14th home run of the season, unbelievably tying the game at 6.\n\n\nTHE MITT HAS BEEN HIT! @RGrich15's homer in the bottom of the 8th hit the mitt, which means @uchealth is donating $5,000 to @ACS_CO to help eliminate cancer. pic.twitter.com/h5muKFgO2O— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nGrichuk’s 500th career RBI created a whole new ballgame, and we went to the ninth tied. \nGrichuk strikes again - for the win\nThe Brewers took the lead in the top of the tenth thanks to a Willy Adames RBI double, so it was up to the Rockies to tie things again to keep the game alive. Yonathan Daza’s first-pitch double in the bottom of the inning did just that, scoring McMahon from second to even things at seven. After a C.J. Cron walk and Charlie Blackmon ground out, Randal Grichuk then stepped up with a chance to win the game. A fly ball would likely score Daza from third base, while a groundball could result in a double play and send things to the 11th. With the count full, Brewers reliever Taylor Rogers delivered his pitch.\n\n\nWALK IT OFF @RGrich15 pic.twitter.com/rOPaqMoxot— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n:)\nUp Next\nWe’ve got one more in the Rockies-Brewers series before a day off on Thursday. Wednesay’s finale will pit to left-handers against each other: Milwaukee’s Eric Lauer (10-6, 3.54 ERA) against Colorado’s Kyle Freeland (7-9, 4.75 ERA).\nFirst pitch is at 1:10pm MDT. See you then!",

        "description": "The Royals announced that former big league reliever Mark Littell has passed away. He was 69 years old.\nA Missouri native, Littell split his MLB career between the state&#8217;s two clubs. He signed with the Royals as an 18-year-old in 1971, and he reached the majors just two years later. The right-hander struggled over his first eight outings, including seven starts, posting a 5.68 ERA. That&#8217;s hardly surprising for a 20-year-old hurler, though, and Littell spent most of the following two seasons at Triple-A.\nAfter a brief return to the majors in 1975, Littell moved to the bullpen full-time by &#8217;76. He thrived in that role, working multiple innings as an old-school fireman and finding great success. He pitched to a 2.08 ERA in 104 innings over 60 outings that season, finishing 37 games in the process. Littell&#8217;s contributions even earned him some down-ballot MVP support.\nThat year didn&#8217;t end as Littell would&#8217;ve liked, as he surrendered Chris Chambliss&#8217; famed walk-off home run to clinch the American League Championship Series for the Yankees. That was the only run he allowed in 4 2/3 innings through the series, though, as Littell continued to pitch exceptionally well until his final offering of the season. He returned to throw another 104 2/3 innings the next season, posting a 3.61 ERA. Littell made two appearances in that year&#8217;s postseason, allowing three runs in as many innings in another defeat to the Yankees.\nThe following offseason, Kansas City traded him to their in-state rivals in a deal that brought back former Cy Young finalist Al Hrabosky. Littell had two great seasons to kick off his tenure with the Cardinals, working to a sub-3.00 ERA while tallying more than 60 appearances in each of 1978-79. His production dipped thereafter, and he threw his final big league pitch in 1982. Littell didn&#8217;t partake in that year&#8217;s postseason, but he&#8217;d been a member of the St. Louis squad that won the World Series.\nAltogether, Littell appeared in nine MLB seasons, working to a career 3.32 ERA over 532 innings. He finished 181 of his 316 appearances, including 56 saves. Littell fanned 466 batters, a 20.5% rate that was well above the league average at the time.\nMLBTR sends our condolences to his family, friends, loved ones and former teammates.",

And per The Washington Post, the FBI recovered \"a document describing a foreign government's...nuclear capabilities\" he had taken to Mar-a-Lago. We do not have TIME for a Trump appointee's bought-and-paid-for delays. Judge Cannon must vacate her Special Master ruling, or the Department of Justice must ignore it, and if necessary arrest Judge Cannon as a risk to the national nuclear defense. (3:52) WHY is Trump not already in a naval brig or army stockage? WHY haven't Mar-a-Lago, Bedminster, and Trump Tower been sealed off indefinitely until we are sure he didn't stash MORE NUCLEAR DOCUMENTS THERE? (5:12) We spent the years after 9/11 listening to the Republicans warn of \"loose nukes,\" dirty bombs, unimaginable risks - this document IS a loose nuke, it is the written equivalent of a dirty bomb, and TRUMP is the \"unimaginable risk.\" 10:30 On August 26 Trump boasted \"nothing mentioned on 'nuclear'\" in the Mar-a-lago affidavit. Now 'nuclear' has been mentioned and Trump must be detained in a secure facility until we know we and our allies are safe, and then we can decide how many decades his sentence should be for.\r\nB BLOCK (15:28) EVERY DOG HAS ITS DAY: Cider, in Atlanta (17:05) POSTSCRIPTS TO THE NEWS: The Insurrection clause of the 14th Amendment is finally used to remove an officeholder; the damning video showing Sidney Powell's henchmen going in to access a Georgia voting system; the would-be Trump Attorney General Jeff Clark fails to get the bar association's punishment against him sealed. (20:35) IN SPORTS: Minor League Baseball players seem set to join Big Leaguers' union, Chicago Bears announce a new stadium just as they've done continuously since 1989, and Oakland's Dave Stewart will be honored, but not for Lucille - and how Nancy Faust figures in! (26:23) THE WORST PERSONS IN THE WORLD (26:23) As the new British Prime Minister's twitter handle, the Ohio GOP skunked by Trump, and the Proud Boy who wasn't too proud to lie, vie for the honors.\r\nC BLOCK (31:58) THINGS I PROMISED NOT TO TELL: It took a year to finally get to the sports anchor desk at WCVB Channel 5 Boston, but only six months to get the hell out. Why would you hire me to do sports if you didn't want me to tell jokes?See omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",

        "description": "Thomas Shea-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Three errors, lack of clutch hitting, negates decent pitching and some stellar hustle on the base paths The first place 2022 Astros have gotten where they are mostly on the strength of league-leading pitching, strong defensive support, and enough offense to win close games.\nAlthough starting pitcher Framber Valdez recorded his 23rd quality start, the usually stout Astros defense sabotaged his efforts with three errors, and the offense left nine runners on base, was only 1-11 with runners in scoring position, and came up short in the score 4-3.\nThe Rangers got to Framber Valdez early, scoring three runs in the second inning, starting with a lead-off walk to Mark Mathias followed by a single to Leody Taveras. Both players scored on an Ezequiel Duran double. And before Valdez had even gotten one out in the inning, Duran scored on an infield hit and throwing error by Jose Altuve. \nValdez buckled down and retired the next three batters, two on K’s. The third run against Valdez was scored as unearned.\nThe Astros answered in their half of the second with a leadoff single by Kyle Tucker. Tucker took second on a passed ball and then stole third, his 21st of the season. He would score on a groundout by Yuli Gurriel.\nIn the third inning, Jose Altuve brought the Astros one run closer by flexing his new-found opposite field power with a solo shot just over the right-field fence. Right fielder Adolis Garcia got his glove on the ball but could not retain control.\n\n\nOppo Taco Tuesday   pic.twitter.com/lp7GeTorvg— Houston Astros (@astros) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nKyle Tucker, whose hustle and baserunning resulted in the Astros’ first run, hustled his way to the Astros’ third run in the fourth inning. He led off the inning with a single, stole his twenty-second base getting to second, moved to third on a J.J. Matijevic infield hit, and scored on an RBI fielder’s choice by Chas McCormick. \n\n\nThe @Rangers got out to an early lead but the #Astros have tied it at 3 and we've got a brand new ballgame!⚾️⭐️⚾️⭐️#LevelUp pic.twitter.com/7xXIwIB91z— AT&amp;T SportsNet™ | SW (@ATTSportsNetSW) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nIn both the first and fourth innings, the Astros would not have scored without the Tucker stolen bases.\nThe Astros and Rangers remained tied at three-all until the seventh. The Rangers took advantage of the Astros’ third infield error after Yuli Gurriel bobbled a grounder by Corey Seager with one out. Eventually, Seager would score after a Nathaniel Lowe single and a Valdez wild pitch which scored Seager from third with two outs.\nPhil Maton came in to finish the seventh with a strikeout of Leody Taveras.\nAlthough Valdez gave up four runs, he is still credited with his 23rd consecutive quality start, as two of the runs (at the time of this writing) were scored as unearned. Nonetheless, it was not one of Valdez’s best performances, as he gave up six hits, four walks, two wild pitches, and only got five groundouts in 6-2/3 innings. He did strike out eleven Rangers.\nNotes: The Astros had a season-leading five stolen bases, two by Tucker, two by Jeremy Pena, and one by Jose Altuve, who was left stranded at second base in the ninth inning with one out after stealing second. The Astros were 1-11 with runners in scoring position.\nIt was a disappointing loss, but you’ll love this assist by the “Machete.”\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Astros go for the series win in tomorrow's rubber match, pitting Cristian Javier against the Rangers’ Cole Ragans. Game time 7:10 CT at MMP.\nBox score and videos here.",

        "description": "This was a big win. | Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Down in a hole, Orioles hitters stepped up with a five-run rally in the third inning and four two-out runs in the final two innings.  It’s been a long while since Camden Yards felt the energy, emotion, and adrenaline of playoff baseball. On Tuesday, September 6, 2022, you could be forgiven for thinking that playoff baseball was back at the Yard. This was an insane four-hour marathon featuring 22 combined hits, 12 different pitchers, an ejected manager, and a benches-clearing brawl. The Birds overcame an early three-run deficit with a five-run explosion in the third inning, pulled their starter in the fourth and held on by the skin of their teeth until the late innings, when the offense scored an incredible four runs with two outs to put the nail in the Blue Jays’ coffin.\nBut back to the beginning. The Orioles needed swing-and-miss stuff from Kyle Bradish tonight, and Bradish definitely brought that stuff. He fired 64% strikes, got 10 swings-and-misses in three innings, and struck out the side in the second inning. \nYet the results weren’t there. Credit the Blue Jays for being the Terminator 2 of lineups. That same inning Bradish whiffed the side, the Jays still found time to put together a run with a double and a single. Particularly Robert Patrick-like (duh, I mean in results, not looks!) was Bo Bichette, who from a drag on the Jays offense has turned into its hottest hitter. Together with barrel-shaped catcher Alejandro Kirk, the two went a combined 8-for-10, a miserable headache for Orioles pitching. And indeed, Bichette’s first hit of the game was a squeaker that hit the padding over the grounds’ crew shack to put the Jays up 3-0. \nWith Orioles hitters having gone a dreadful 1-for-19 with RISP combined over the first two games of this series, this felt like an ominously steep hill to climb.\nBut a glimmer of hope lay on the horizon, and it was Blue Jays starter Mitch White’s ugly 0-3 record and 7.04 ERA as an AL East pitcher. He kept the O’s off balance for two innings by switching speeds. But that ended abruptly with an five-run explosion from Baltimore in the third inning. \nThe party kicked off with consecutive walks from Rougned Odor and Jorge Mateo (of all people). White, trying to get fine with location, threw an inside fastball—only it was right off Cedric Mullins’ left hand. \nBases loaded, no outs, Adley Rutschman at the plate. Kind of a dangerous situation, huh? \nWatch out: CHAOS COMIN’, Y’ALL. Adley got a really random pitch to hit, a curveball diving out of the zone but, being Adley Rutschman, he put bat to ball and cued a double down the third-base line. Two runs scored. (Quick non sequitur: Adley’s 28th double in just 88 games would make him the MLB leader in doubles per plate appearance if this were a real, actual statistic that FanGraphs kept track of. Maybe they should.)\nDid the Birds have more in them? You’ve already seen the final score so … you know they did. Anthony Santander’s eight-pitch at-bat ended in an RBI groundout to drive in Mullins and tie the game. Grabbing the baton after him, Ryan Mountcastle smoked a fastball between the infielders, scoring Rutschman. The Orioles had snatched back the lead. \nA floundering Mitch White was yanked after walking Urías on four pitches. It was probably a wise call, even though it was just the third inning. Off the righty Julian Merryweather, Gunnar Henderson singled with authority, driving in the Orioles’ fifth run. With just one out, there could have been more, but Austin Hays and Odor, batting around, poured cold water on the rally. \nThis whole series has felt like playoff baseball, and Brandon Hyde was clearly treating tonight as such. So in the fourth inning, when Kyle Bradish got squeezed by home plate ump Jeff Nelson for a leadoff walk, then gave up a single, Hyde got out the hook. Out came Bradish after just 66 pitches and three innings. In came Dillon Tate, making his earliest appearance in over 400 games—and in one of the toughest situations yet: runners on first and third, no outs, the Jays’ Whit Merrifield, George Springer and Vlad Guerrero Jr. up to bat. Would Hyde’s gamble pay off?\nYessiree, Bob. It was a monster fourth inning for Tate, who got Merrifield to fly out weakly to right, so that the runner on third didn’t test Santander’s arm. Springer was caught looking for Out No. 2. A harmless groundout by Guerrero Jr. concluded one of Dillon Tate’s most brilliant outings of the year.\nThat brilliance was slightly obscured, unfortunately, by a fifth-inning run for the relentless Toronto that cut the lead to 5-4. The infuriating Bichette fell down 0-2 against Tate, then just chipped a low pitch down the line. Two outs later, Tate was one swing away from ending the inning, but Matt Chapman tapped a high fastball into left field, scoring Bichette. \nHave you ever tried to squeeze into an old pair of pants that’s clearly too tight on you and decided, “Alright, I’m going to hold my breath and just pray to the Almighty that the button doesn’t pop off before the night is over”? That’s what it’s like trying to protect a one-run lead for 12 outs against the Toronto Blue Jays. In this high-leverage situation, Hyde was riding with his best relievers. After Tate, Cionel Pérez answered the call with 1.1 scoreless innings. With two outs in the sixth, Vlad Guererro hit a ball that was scary, but 390 feet to deep center won’t cut it in Camden Yards. \nToronto was also emptying the cupboard, so while Yusei Kikuchi had an 8.53 ERA against Baltimore this season, interim manager John Schneider tried to stash the left-hander in a lefty-heavy stretch of the lineup. \nNo such luck, buddy. \nJorge Mateo proved the wisdom of playing the matchups, squaring up a ball to the gap and flying around the bases for his MLB lead-tying seventh triple. With two outs and the lefty Cedric Mullins at bat, the Orioles were praying for a wild pitch or something. Instead, Mullins delivered and more, cracking a 97-mph Kikuchi fastball into right field, a two-out RBI single to push the O’s lead to 6-4.  \nNine more outs. Bryan Baker didn’t quite repay Hyde’s trust, allowing another goddamn Bo Bichette single and another by Alejandro Kirk. With runners on the corners and no outs, a double play wasn’t the worst result. But it did mean a fifth Blue Jays run to slice the lead to one again. \nFor some innings now, the Blue Jays dugout had been jawing about the home plate ump’s calls (which, if we’re being honest, were screwing both sides in an impartial and even-handed way), and when Bryan Baker whiffed Matt Chapman, someone couldn’t resist saying something nasty to Baker, who couldn’t resist mouthing back. The benches cleared, but not much happened. Until the next inning, when Ryan Mountcastle saw three straight balls (they were balls), and Toronto’s Schneider decided to mouth off again towards home plate. He promptly got tossed, and we in Birdland promptly got a reminder of all the reasons there are to hate the Toronto Blue Jays.\nWith six outs left and a one-run lead, Brandon Hyde turned to Félix Bautista for his longest save of the year. Mountain Time. Suck-it-in, Hold onto your Butts Time. \nThe Result of the Experiment: pretty darn good. A one-pitch groundout, a three-pitch K, and another groundout. Next! \nInsurance runs against Toronto are really nice, and even though this game was three-and-a-half hours in, Orioles hitters refused, as Tina Turner once sort-of said, to go down nice and easy, adding, not one, not two, but three insurance runs in the bottom of the eighth. \nRougned Odor started it all off with a single to center off Toronto set-up man Trevor Richards that he somehow, inexplicably, ridiculously stretched into a double! “He’s out by 30 feet—” Kevin Brown started to say… but he wasn’t! On replay, Bichette completely whiffed on the tag. It was, as Brown said, the greatest double of the season. (My recommendation: save this clip to your phone and watch it on replay when you’re sad.) \n\n\nRougned Odor, safe somehow, because why not pic.twitter.com/X4fxdv2rni— Zachary Silver (@zachsilver) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nThe inning only got more ridiculous after that. With two outs, Cedric Mullins hit an oopsie swinging-bunt single and stole his 30th base of the season, tying his effort from last year. Adley drew yet another big-boy walk and with the bases juiced, Anthony Santander drew another (an easier walk, because Richards was looking like a ball of nerves by this point). That pushed Odor in, a moment that felt like the dam bursting. \nIn another big-time situation, Ryan Mountcastle came up and smoked a single to right field. Mullins scored easily. Adley motored home from second and was tagged out by Toronto’s Kirk. But wait! On the replay, it looked like Kirk either blocked the plate or that Adley’s cleat slid in under the tag. Take your pick of legal theories, umps. Hyde’s challenge won, and the Orioles were credited with runs eight and nine.\nThe Mountain was back out on the mound, now pumping 102 mph with a four-run lead. (Technically, this was still a save situation because he entered in a one-run game.) George Springer sent a hard-hit ball to the outfield, and so did Guerrero—almost like the defeated, angry Blue Jays were fruitlessly swinging out their frustrations. (Love it!) The Bichette-and-Kirk Show then put together another rally. But it was all sound and fury, signifying nothing, because Bautista did what he does and blew away Teoscar Hernández to end the game. \nSeptember 6th is an important day in Birdland history, as you probably know. Tonight didn’t disappoint. It was, as the MASN booth said, maybe the most emotionally charged night of the season. Flinging absolutely everything they had out there, the Orioles stole a game back from the Blue Jays and put themselves in a position to earn a series split tomorrow. An epic.",

        "description": "Ron Chenoy-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Randal Grichuk’s two home runs propel Rockies to victory.  After winning the opener on Monday against Colorado, the Brewers hoped to take the series in game two. Brandon Woodruff got the start on the mound for the Crew against Chad Kuhl for the Rockies. With the Brewers only 2.5 games back from the last wildcard spot, all of these games down the stretch are extremely important. \nMilwaukee struck early, as Yelich hit a 499-foot home run to lead off the game, and Renfroe hit a two-run home run later in the inning that scored Adames, giving the Brewers an early 3-0 lead The Rockies would answer in the bottom of the third when Montero hit a solo home run to left that cut the Brewers lead to two. \nNarvaez helped the Brewers gain some insurance in the top of the fourth, when he doubled to deep right, scoring both Peterson and Hiura, giving the Crew a 5-1 advantage. \nThe Brewers would add another run in the top of the seventh, this time off a Willy Adames RBI double that scored Garrett Mitchell from second. This gave Milwaukee a 6-1 lead heading into the eighth. \nPerdomo was brought in for Woodruff to pitch the eighth and gave up four runs on an RBI single and a three-run home run. Strezlecki was then brought in for Perdomo and gave up a solo home run to Grichuck, which tied the game at 6-6. \nMilwaukee would gain the lead in the top of the tenth of a Willy Adames double that scored Yelich from second. Taylor Rodgers was then brought in to close the game and gave up an RBI double to Daza that scored McMahon from second. Then, Randall Grichuck hit his second three-run home run of the night to give the Rockies the walk-off victory. \nThe Brewers will finish their series in Colorado on Wednesday, then head home for a doubleheader against the Giants on Thursday. Eric Lauer starts against Kyle Freeland in Wednesday’s rubber match. The first pitch is at 2:10 CDT on Bally Sports Wisconsin and 620 WTMJ.",

But people familiar with the situation, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss a sealed indictment, suggested the prosecution will likely mirror aspects of the federal case in which Bannon was pardoned.”",

For a moment, a spotlight fell on a garden spider’s half-finished orb web, its owner threading the final silken spiral on to radiating spokes.As the sun rose, the sunbeam shifted and the snare became almost invisible, a deathtrap for any passing insect. A small, vulnerable butterfly, jinking between the shrubs, settled on a conifer branch nearby: a newly hatched holly blue, with immaculate wings like pale azure silk. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Coors Field, on an unseasonably hot and dry September night, was like a volcano ready to erupt.\nAnd did it ever.\nWith a first-pitch temperature of 95 degrees &#8212; the hottest ever for a Rockies home game in September &#8212; the Rockies and Brewers combined for six home runs in Colorado&#8217;s thrilling 10-7, 10-inning victory. Colorado&#8217;s four homers were its most in a game this season.\nThe Rockies won it on Randal Grichuk&#8217;s walk-off, three-run homer off of lefty Taylor Rogers. Grichuk&#8217;s second homer of the night traveled 457 feet. He became the first player in Rockies franchise history to hit a game-tying home run in the eighth inning or later and then also hit a walk-off home run in the same game. He&#8217;s the first big-leaguer to do it since Baltimore&#8217;s Trey Mancini on June 7, 2017.\n&#8220;This one is probably up there, in the top (moments),&#8221; Grichuk said. &#8220;To hit a game-tying homer in the eighth and then the winning homer. It&#8217;s pretty special.&#8221;\nGrichuk knew he got all of the game-winner.\n&#8220;That&#8217;s the only ball I&#8217;ve ever hit where I looked at our dugout and showed some emotion and didn&#8217;t just sprint out of the box,&#8221; he said.\nBut the biggest no-doubter of the night came off the bat of the Brewers&#8217; Christian Yelich, who launched the longest home run by a left-handed hitter in Coors Field history.\nMore on that in a moment.\nThe Rockies, who trailed most of the night, tied the game, 6-6, with a five-run eighth inning, highlighted by a two-run homer by Yonathan Daza (fresh off the injured list) and a solo shot by Grichuk. Daza launched his solo homer to dead center off of Luis Perdomo. Grichuk&#8217;s came off of Peter Strzelecki.\nDaza hit his second home run of the season and the fourth of his career. Three of those homers have come against the Brewers.\nAsked if he knew his homer was gone, Daza quipped: &#8220;No chance. I have no power. &#8230; I was happy it went out. I have never hit a ball dead-center in my life. That feels good.&#8221;\nNow, back to Yelich. After what he did, he should look into a meaty endorsement deal.\nThe Brewers&#8217; leadoff hitter rocketed the fourth pitch of the ballgame 499 feet and into the third deck in right-center field. The ball landed not far below the Smashburger sign.\nThe homer, served up by Colorado right-hander Chad Kuhl, was smashed, indeed. Yelich&#8217;s homer fell just 5 feet short of the longest overall &#8212; a 504-foot blast by Giancarlo Stanton, then with the Marlins on Aug. 6. 2016. The previous record for lefty homer at Coors came on May 30 of this year by the Marlins Jesus Sanchez off of right-hander Ryan Feltner.\nAnd get this: In 100 career at-bats (117 plate appearances) entering Tuesday&#8217;s game, Yelich had never hit a home run at Coors Field.\nFor Kuhl, Feltner, right-hander Jose Urena, and lefty Austin Gomber, tryouts for the Rockies&#8217; 2023 starting rotation have become central to the club&#8217;s final stretch of a last-place season.\nKuhl&#8217;s latest audition, obviously, did not go well. After serving up the historic homer to Yelich, he walked Willy Adames, setting the table for Hunter Renfroe&#8217;s two-run homer and a 3-0 Milwaukee lead.\nBy the time Kuhl&#8217;s 4 1/3-inning performance was done, he gave up five runs on six hits, issuing two walks and striking out five.  After 23 starts, he owns a 5.38 ERA.\n&#8220;I just felt like the first inning I left two pitches right over the middle and from there on out I felt like I was much more aggressive,&#8221; Kuhl said. &#8220;I felt like I was out of synch and they took advantage. My night really came down to pitches down the middle and that was really it.&#8221;\nManager Bud Black, obviously thrilled that the Rockies broke out with four home runs, said he liked how Kuhl rebounded from the poor first inning.\n&#8220;Chad can spin the ball &#8230; and his fastball has velocity,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;The thing that has bit Chad a little bit here lately has been his lack of fastball command. And we saw that tonight.&#8221;\nSince pitching a masterful complete-game shutout of the Dodgers at Coors Field on June 27, Kuhl is 1-4 in nine starts, posting a 9.08 ERA, allowing 15 home runs over that span for an average of 3.40 home runs per nine innings.\nBefore Tuesday&#8217;s game, manager Bud Black reiterated that Gomber &#8212; part of the Nolan Arenado trade &#8212; will get his chance to be a starter. Tuesday night, Gomber came on as a middle reliever, giving up one run on one hit with two strikeouts. Gomber&#8217;s ERA is 5.56.\nMeanwhile, Brewers right-hander Brandon Woodruff dominated the Rockies for seven innings, giving up one run on two hits, with two strikeouts and two walks. His one major mistake was giving up a solo homer to rookie Elehuris Montero in the third inning. It was Montero&#8217;s fifth homer in 37 games of his inaugural season.\nMile-High Homers\nThe five longest home runs in Coors Field history:\n1. 504 feet, Giancarlo Stanton, Marlins 8/6/16.\n2. 499 feet, Christian Yelich, Brewers, 9/6/22\nt3. 496 feet, Mike Piazza, Dodgers, 9/26/97\n496 feet, Jesus Sanchez, Marlins 5/30/22\n5. 495, feet, Ryan McMahon, Rockies, 8/9/22\nCrazy Coors\nTuesday night was a wild one at Coors Field. Here are some of the highlights:\n\nColorado overcame a five-run deficit, matching the largest come-from-behind win of the season (July 3 vs. Arizona, 5-0).\nThe first-pitch temperature of 95 degrees was the highest in any September home game in franchise history. The previous high was 94 degrees, two times, including Monday.\nRandal Grichuk&#8217;s walk-off hit was the fifth of his career and his third walk-off homer.\nGrichuk&#8217;s six RBIs tied a career-high. The last time he did it was on July 18, 2015, as a member of the Cardinals, against the Mets.\nRookie Elehuris Montero reached base three times, going 2-for-3 with two runs scored, recording a double, home run, and an RBI while also drawing a walk.\nShortstop Alan Trejo went the game 3-for-4 and his three hits were a career-high.\n\nOn Deck\nBrewers LHP Eric Lauer (10-6, 3.54 ERA) at Rockies LHP Kyle Freeland (7-9, 4.75)\n1:10 p.m. Wednesday, Coors Field\nTV: ATTRM\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM\nFreeland is coming off a hard-luck start at Cincinnati. He took a no-decision in the Rockies&#8217; 3-2 loss to the Reds, despite allowing just one run on eight hits over 5 2/3 innings. He&#8217;s been roughed up at home recently, going 1-1 with an 8.27 ERA over his last four starts at Coors Field. The lefty has faced Milwaukee four times in his career, going 2-2 with a 2.52 ERA and holding the Brewers to a .205/.297/.341 slash line.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKiszla: Why Bud Black wants to return as Rockies manager in 2023: &#8220;To be part of the solution to help us win.&#8221;\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Michael Toglia, Kyle Freeland help knock off Brewers, 8-4\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tJose Iglesias&#8217; solid season with Rockies interrupted by trip to IL\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKeeler: Todd Helton&#8217;s second coming?

He struck out five and didn&#8217;t walk any. Lauer has gone 1-4 with a 7.40 ERA in 10 career starts vs. Colorado. He is 0-4 with an ugly 14.63 ERA in five career starts at Coors Field.\nTrending: Brendan Rodgers&#8217; 16 defensive runs saved at second base are the most in the majors and fifth-most among all infielders, Plus, his 2.2 dWAR (Baseball Reference) is tied for the fifth-highest among all major league position players. (Entering Tuesday&#8217;s game).\nAt issue: Entering Tuesday&#8217;s game, the Rockies’ 7.4% walk rate was the second-lowest in the National League and 25th in the majors. However, their 21.0% strikeout rate was the fourth-best in the NL and eighth-best in the majors.\nPitching probables:\nThursday: Off day\nFriday: Diamondbacks RHP Zach Davies (2-4, 3.74) at Rockies RHP German Marquez (8-10, 4.86), 6:40 p.m., ATTRM\nSaturday: Diamondbacks LHP Madison Bumgarner (6-3, 4.83) at Rockies RHP Jose Urena, 6:10 p.m., ATTRM",

        "description": "Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A wild, wacky night in Oakland saw 19 runs and 22 hits. When the Braves woke up the morning of June 1, they trailed in the NL East by 10 and a half games. The club was 23-27 following yet another brutal extra innings loss in Arizona.\nOn Tuesday night, the Braves slugged their way to a wacky 10-9 win over the Oakland Athletics. They are now tied with New York for the division lead for the first time all season.\nThe Braves got things started early with three runs in the first. After loading the bases, William Contreras hit a ball down the line for a sacrifice fly to plate the game’s first run. Vaughn Grissom, who had four hits on then night, then inside-outed a ball down the line to make it 3-0.\nMatt Olson, making his first trip to Oakland since the trade, crushed a three-run homer to center to push the Braves’ lead to 6-1 in the third. Oakland would chip away with four runs of their own, including back-to-back homers, in the bottom half to make it 6-5 in a hurry. The ball was flying all night.\n\n\nMatt Olson homers in his return to Oakland! pic.twitter.com/K0iMcH8emK— MLB (@MLB) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nThe offensive outburst continued in the middle innings. Atlanta found a little two-out magic in the fifth as Michael Harris singled home a run, followed by a two-run line drive from Marcell Ozuna to make it 9-5.\nKyle Wright’s struggles continued shortly after. He issued two walks and hit a batter, and he exited the game after 4+ innings. He was not sharp; it seemed the Oakland mound may have been bothering him as Kyle often stumbled on his delivery and had little command from the opening frame. Hopefully, he will bounce back in his next start in San Francisco.\nDylan Lee came into a bases-loaded, no-out situation and surrendered a game-tying three run homer after getting relatively painless two outs. It has not been a kind last month to Lee, who may be running out of gas after a lot of high leverage innings earlier this season. Jesse Chavez mercifully ended things and ended up tossing 1.1 scoreless. He has, once again, been a revelation.\nThe Braves took the lead right back in the top of the sixth on a sacrifice fly that nearly left the park. 10-9. That run would prove to be the difference.\nThe bullpen settled in nicely. Chavez calmed things down, and both Raisel Iglesias and AJ Minter worked clean innings. Kenley Jansen entered the 10-9 game in the ninth and looked like a new man, striking out two and getting an infield fly to end it.\nIn total, Chavez, Iglesias, Minter and Jansen tossed 4.1 innings of one-hit, no-run, no-walk, eight-strikeout ball. They, quite literally, saved the game.\nIt was, in short, a bizarre baseball game. Kyle Wright is a good pitcher, and Cole Irvin isn't exactly a bum. Oakland Coliseum is the 2nd most pitcher friendly yard in the league and has been for years. A batch of 2019-2021 golf/baseballs finding their way to the park is not out of the question. It has also been scorching hot in Northern California, which may have contributed to a Coors Field like atmosphere tonight. Who knows.\nThe Braves and Athletics will wrap up their brief two-game stint on Wednesday afternoon with Spencer Strider set to return following his historic 16-strikeout performance against Colorado last week. Oakland will counter with hard-throwing lefty Ken Waldichuk, who came over from New York in the Frankie Montas trade and made his big league debut last week. First pitch is set for 3:37 p.m. ET.",

        "description": "On magazine covers, billboards and TV screens, middle-aged celebrities are flaunting their fat-free, perfectly toned muscles. How hard is it for the average fiftysomething to measure up? And what will it do to the rest of your life?Could Nicole Kidman possibly be real? That was the question springing from her photoshoot for Perfect magazine, in which the 55-year-old adopts a power victory pose, flexing arms like a bodybuilder, her biceps taut, huge, extremely detailed. She looks like an anatomical drawing, and as if she could pull a truck out of a swamp. I was bewitched by her legs. It’s difficult to see muscle definition, head on, on a leg. Oh boy, not any more. The Daily Mail said she looked “decades younger” than her age, which is not true, since we don’t tend to age one another by our arms (it’s all in the eyes, folks). What she does look is absolutely ripped, in her 50s. She looks like an elite athlete, as does Davina McCall, 54, with her rock-hard six-pack and even Huw Edwards, 61, who caused a stir by showing off his toned torso on Instagram.There has been a trend for visible strength in the female form in the past few years, driven by millennials, who exercise differently. They focus on body-strength training and urban calisthenics, using online coaches, motivational Instagram communities and better, less fat-depositing lifestyles. Yet the important difference is in their sexual politics. Continue reading...",

For years they have been nicknamed “Elvis worms” for their sparkling scales, reminiscent of the sequined jumpsuits worn by Elvis Presley. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Tigers rallied back but costly fielding errors handed the win to the Angels in extra innings.  It didn’t start off well for Eduardo Rodriguez and the Tigers, but they both rallied and battled back to force a tie game that went into extra innings. They briefly took a lead in the 10th and had a chance to win, but then poor fielding work led to two runs scoring in the bottom of the inning and handing the game back to the Angels 5-4.\nThe first inning lasted a total of four pitches for the Tigers, with Victor Reyes getting the lone hit before being erased on a double play. The Angels, on the other hand, wasted no time getting on the scoreboard thanks to Mike Trout who blasted a solo home run to open the scoring. His homer was bookended by fine running catches from Akil Baddoo to limit the damage. \nThe second inning was mired by bad luck as both Spencer Torkelson and Josh Lester connected on pitches that left their bats at over 105 MPH but found gloves to become outs. As if taking the Tigers’ bad luck and converting it into their good luck, the Angels teed off on Rodriguez in the bottom of the inning. After getting a double-play to erase a leadoff single, Mike Ford hit a high flyball that just kept carrying over the wall to add another run. Jo Adell followed that with a solo home run of his own and suddenly the Angels had a 3-0 lead and Rodriguez seemed to be on the ropes. \nThe Tigers went quietly in the third, except for a Tucker Barnhart walk. Rodriguez settled down considerably and struck out David Fletcher and Shohei Ohtani, with a Trout flyout in between. \nThe fourth inning brought good fortune to the Motown men. Javier Báez ripped a hard hit one-out single and then with two outs, Spencer Torkelson brought him home with a line drive RBI single to get the Tigers on the board, trailing 3-1. Harold Castro flashed the leather with a great running throw to get the first out on a chopper up the middle, while Rodriguez pitched around a one-out double to keep the Angels from answering back. \n\n\nSpencer Torkelson and the Tigers finally get on the board in Anaheim. #DetroitRoots pic.twitter.com/jyoNPSNdSr— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nNeither team did much in the fifth inning. The Tigers went quietly in order in the top of the fifth, while the Angels also went down in order, thanks to a great play from Ryan Kreidler at third to get Max Stassi. Rodriguez looked to have settled into a nice groove after a rough start. \nWilli Castro lead off the sixth with a double and then Reyes hit a deep out to left that was nearly overrun by Adell. A wild pitch moved Castro to third with one out and he came home on a groundout from deep in the hole at third from Báez. That would be the end of the day for Mike Mayers, as Aaron Loup came on to get Castro on a lineout to retire the side. Rodriguez got both Trout and Ohtani on routine flyball outs and then wrapped up a 6 pitch half-inning with a groundout. With a pitch count of 75, he had fully bounced back from a start that looked like he might not make it out of the second inning. \nRyan Kreidler nearly tied the game at three in the seventh, when he drilled a two-out, 3-2 sinker into the corner for a double, coming just feet away from a home run. Unfortunately, Tucker Barnhart followed with a groundout on the first pitch he saw to end the threat. Rodriguez finished his night with another clean inning in the bottom of the seventh. His final line was solid. Seven innings, five hits, three runs, no walks, and four strikeouts. \nJose Quijada took over for Loup in the top of the eighth and AJ Hinch countered with Eric Haase pinch-hitting for Baddoo, but he struck out swinging. Willi Castro fouled off a couple of meatballs he probably wanted to turn on for extra bases and then was hit in the knee by an inside pitch. He was checked on and stayed in the game after proving to his manager he was okay. Reyes followed with a flare that dropped right on the right-field line for a double and suddenly the Tigers has two in scoring position with only one out. The Angels brought in Jimmy Herget to face Báez who swung at the first pitch he saw and hit a grounder up the middle to drive in Castro and just like that the Tigers weren’t losing anymore. Harold Castro got the intentional walk to bring up Spencer Torkelson but he struck out on a half swing to end the inning. \n\n\nWe're tied at 3 in the 8th after Javy Báez grounds to third to plate Willi Castro. #DetroitRoots pic.twitter.com/519SBe0tO0— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nAlex Lange got the call in the bottom of the eighth and started off with a strikeout of Adell before walking Matt Thaiss, who pinch hit for Stassi, though Lange looked like he was getting squeezed at the top of the zone. It didn’t matter since he got Fletcher to ground into an inning-ending double play to send things to the ninth, still tied. The Angels challenged the call at first but the call was confirmed. \nRyan Tepera took over in the top of the ninth against the bottom of the Tiger’s order and he pitched a clean inning as the Tigers’ hitters were retired quietly. That sent things to the bottom of the ninth with Trout and Ohtani due up first. AJ Hinch turned to his most reliable arm, Joe Jiménez to face the teeth of the Angels’ order. Jiménez gave Trout nothing but his fastball and Trout couldn’t find it as he whiffed three times on it for the first out. He stuck with the heater vs Ohtani and got him to whiff twice on the heater before hitting a routine flyball to left for the second out. Jimenez got Rengifo to a full count before he laced a two-out single into right, but Jiménez got Tayor Ward to fly out harmlessly to send things to extra innings. \nThat meant extra innings and on came the ghost runners. The Angels stuck with Tepera and Haase greeted him with a sharp single to left to move Clemens, the runner, over to third with no outs. With Haase dancing off first, Willi Castro popped out in the infield for the first out.  Victor Reyes struck out on a foul tip which left it up to Báez. Tepera gave him nothing but sliders and on a 1-2 pitch, Baez got a hold of one that was well off the plate away and grounded it into right field for a hit to score Clemens and give the Tigers a 4-3 lead. Harold Castro flew out to end the inning and turn things over to Andrew Chafin, instead of Gregory Soto, to try and deliver a win.\nChafin faced the bottom of the Angels’ order with Taylor Ward standing at second to start things off. Matt Duffy started things off with a flyball to right field to advance Ward to third. Andrew Velazquez hit a grounder to a drawn-in Báez but he bobbled it and and his throw was in the dirt, even though he had plenty of time to set and throw. Haase whiffed on picking the throw in, the run scored, and the batter moved to second on the throw. \nThen, on a 2-2 count, Chafin bounced a wild pitch to Wallach to move the winning runner to third with one out. Chafin walked Wallach, perhaps intentionally to give himself a chance at the double play. Magneuris Sierra came to the plate and immediately laid down the safety squeeze bunt. Instead of letting the ball go foul, Chafin fielded it along the line but had no play on the speedy runner as the winning run crossed home plate. Even worse, given the high threat of the bunt, Torkelson and Kreidler were not in a position to make a play on the bunt as they stayed even with the bases. This is Tigers baseball in 2022. Try again tomorrow.",

        "description": "Tommy Sommer threw a quality start for the Dash, continuing a strong finish to his season. | Tiffany Wintz/South Side Sox\n    \n\n  Outside of Charlotte, each team struggled to score runs, but there were decent pitching performances from Matthew Thompson and Tommy Sommer   \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nA good bullpen game — in fact, a bullpen game that that took a no-hitter into the seventh inning! The way Charlotte spread out the innings was really weird, Jason Bilous, who is a starter, came in for the fifth and sixth. Tanner Banks, a former starter, came in for the third and fourth. Meanwhile, the first guy up, JB Olson, hasn’t been a starter in his professional life, and he went the first two — just a really weird pitching plan tonight. But it certainly worked out really well for everyone. Banks was the best of the bunch, retiring four of the six batters he faced via strikeout.\nMeanwhile, on offense, Charlotte could not match the excellence of a shutout, but it did enough and then some, with the help of a couple of errors. Yolbert Sánchez and Zach Remillard led the gang in hits with two, and they both added a stolen base. Remillard gets the edge because of a double, and one of the two RBIs, though. Micker Adolfo and Lenyn Sosa had the team’s other two hits. Sosa also had the second RBI.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nThe Barons get blanked in a rain-shortened game — the shortest game possible, as it ended after five completed innings. Matthew Thompson got the start today and had one of his good ones. Four innings of work, with five strikeouts while allowing just one run, bringing his ERA in Double-A below 6.00. The offense obviously did not do well with no runs scored, as just two batters had hits today. Oscar Colás had two of those and Bryan Ramos had the other. Colson Montgomery continues to really struggle in Double-A, with a 0-for-2 performance and no walks.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nWell, Tommy Sommer did his job, but none of his fellow arms did, and few Dash bats were able to ride the Sommer wave. He went six and allowed just one run, lowering his ERA to 2.89 in High-A. In this one, Sommer had a bit of a strikeout pitch, getting six — just as many innings as punch-outs. He just did the typical Sommer thing, which is keep guys off of the bases. The bullpen just wasn’t good behind him. It allowed five runs the next three innings, to lose the game in semi-blowout fashion.\nThe offense, similar to their A-ball counterparts in Kannapolis, did reach base enough to score more runs, but it was walk-based. W-S walked six times and earned eight hits. They went 2-for-13 with runners in scoring position, so that is where the minimal runs came from even with 14 batters on base. Every hit was a single, too, so there was not much pop to speak of. Caberea Weaver and Alsander Womack each had two of those singles. Andy Atwood was the lone man to reach base three times, getting to first base on a single and two walks.\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \n  \n        \n  \nTwo bad innings and an overall bad performance by the offense dooms Kannapolis. The second inning saw two unearned runs scored after a Jayson Gonzalez error. Manuel Veloz was on the mound for that, so the runs weren’t his fault; that doesn’t mean he was good today, though. He walked three batters as he struggled with command. Jesus Valles took over and cruised through two innings, before running into trouble in the sixth. He gave up an inning-opening homer and two more runs before getting pulled. He was doing so well, with eight strikeouts, but was burned whenever a bat even touched one of his pitches. The only pitcher to go unscathed was Eric Adler, though his two hits allowed in one inning gave the impression he really wanted to give up a run.\nThe offense was pretty close to nonexistent. Its one run scored was unearned — a double play that scored Brooks Baldwin. Kannapolis did get five walks, so it showed good command of the strike zone — it just couldn’t get anything going to men on base. The Cannon Ballers went 1-for-11 with runners in scoring position. The weekly MVP, Logan Glass, had the only extra-base hit of the day, a double.",

It’s now 1-0, Mariners. \n\n\nMoncada made a somewhat haphazard attempt to stop Sheets' throw to third with France tagging up.

        "description": "Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The late-night/early-morning spot of Cubs fans asks you to give an early grade to the Seiya Suzuki signing.  Welcome back to BCB After Dark: the swingin’ spot for night owls, early-risers, new parents and Cubs fans abroad. I don’t know about your neck of the woods, but it’s blistering hot out here. So come on in for the air conditioning. Let’s hope the power stays on. There’s no cover charge tonight. No dress code either, although you do have to wear clothes. I know you might be tempted otherwise on a night like tonight. Grab a table near the front. Someone will be by shortly to take your order. Bring your own beverage.\nBCB After Dark is the place for you to talk baseball, music, movies, or anything else you need to get off your chest, as long as it is within the rules of the site. The late-nighters are encouraged to get the party started, but everyone else is invited to join in as you wake up the next morning and into the afternoon.\nThe Cubs beat the Reds tonight 9-3 in what is going to be known as the “Hayden Wesneski Game” as Wesneski was brilliant in getting the win with five scoreless innings in his major league debut. I also liked how Wesneski said after the game that “I didn’t think Chicago on a Tuesday would get this loud.”\nLast time I asked you if you thought that DH Franmil Reyes will be a part of the “next great Cubs team,” as team president Jed Hoyer likes to call it. There was a good response to this and by a margin of 52 percent to 48 percent, you said “no.” But that’s really close.\nOn Tuesday night/Wednesday morning I don’t do a film essay. But I always have time for some jazz, so those of you who want to skip that can do so now. You won’t hurt my feelings.\n\nTonight we have the great jazz songstress Cassandra Wilson and her band performing at a festival in Spain in 2008. The song is “Caravan,” which is an old Duke Ellington jazz standard, although the lyrics are rarely sung like they are here. \nI’m going to say this is a bit of fusion because there’s a long electric guitar solo in here by Marvin Sewell.\nYou may also recognize the guy on piano. It’s a 21-year-old prodigy who was fairly unknown a the time outside of jazz circles by the name of Jon Batiste. He was not a complete unknown in 2008—after all, he’s touring with Cassandra Wilson—but he’s unknown enough that this video manages to misspell his name. He was certainly a long way from an Oscar and multiple Grammys.\nAlso in this video are Reginald Veal on double bass, Lekan Babalola on percussion and Herlin Riley on drums.\n\n\nWelcome back to those of you who skip all that jazz.\nTonight I’m going to ask you to grade the five-year, $85 million contract the Cubs gave outfielder Seiya Suzuki this past off-season. Yes, it’s not fair to grade a five-year deal after a little less than one year, but that’s never stopped fans before.\nSuzuki was the Cubs big free agent purchase this winter, Yes, Marcus Stroman is making more money per season, but he’s only on a three-year deal that he can opt-out of after two years. Suzuki is here for a good five years and for $85 million. That doesn’t include the $14 million and change the Cubs had to send to Hiroshima to sign him. \nI don’t think I have to tell you how Suzuki’s season has gone. He came out on fire in April and then the league adjusted to him in May and he struggled badly. He was injured all of June. Since coming off the injured list, Suzuki was solid but unspectacular in July and August. He’s been quite good in a small sample in September. Overall, Suzuki is hitting .261/.336/.425 with 11 home runs and 43 RBI over 95 games. Again, that’s solid, but is it something you play almost $100 million for?\nSo grade the Suzuki contract. If you think that his struggles early in the season were just an adjustment issue and that the Suzuki we’ve seen in April and September is the real Seiya that we’ll see going forward, give it an “A.” If you think the overall stat line that Suzuki has put over the course of the season, then that’s a “C” or maybe a “B” if you’re generous. If you think hard times are coming for Seiya in future years of the deal as he ages, then grade accordingly.\nSo what grade would you give the Suzuki signing, almost a year into it?\n\nThank you all so very much for stopping by. If you could help us by busing your own table tonight, that would be a big favor. Stay cool the rest of this evening. If you need us to call a ride for you, let us know. Please tip your waitstaff. And join us again tomorrow night for another edition of BCB After Dark.",

        "description": "What does this fella have to do to earn some run support? | Aaron Josefczyk-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Another quality start for Jimmy Shimmy, but the offense fails back him up ... AGAIN  Johnny Cueto was brilliant again, but it just wasn’t enough, as the Mariners hung on to even the series, with a 3-0 win. \nIn the only night game of this three-game set, the Chisox were happy to welcome Yoán Moncada and Luis Robert back into the lineup. Although for Robert, the return was brief. More on that later.  \nIt was a quiet top of the first, with a single by Moncada, the only action for the Sox.  Encouraging to see Yoán making solid contact in his first at-bat after coming off the IL.  In the bottom of the frame, Cueto made a quick 1-2-3 of the Mariners. \nThe second inning was scoreless for both teams, but wasn’t short on action. In the Sox half, unfortunately, Robert was hit in the hand. Dude just can’t catch a break. After a visit from training staff, he stayed in the game for a bit, only to be replaced in the bottom of the fifth by Adam Engel. The update from the Sox is that Robert has a bruised left hand and will be day-to-day. To lead off the bottom of the inning, Eugenio Suarez singled to right but was quickly erased on a force out by Jesse Winkler. It should have been an easy double play, but Romy González couldn’t find the ears quick enough to get it out of his glove to turn it. Then, during Cal Raleigh’s at-bat, Cueto sent a pitch flying way past Yasmani Grandal that enabled Winkler to easily get to second.  Ultimately, Raleigh walked to put runners on first and second. Luckily, Cueto magic appeared, as Adam Frazier grounded into a DP and all the runners were erased.  \nIn the third, the South Siders and Mariners both went down in order. Gilbert’s pitches were stumping the boys while Cueto kept the Mariners off-balance as well, as he continued to mix up his delivery. We love the Cueto Shim Sham Shimmy!  \nThings got a bit exciting in the fourth for both teams. Moncada had his second single of the night, which was good to see, because the Sox really need Yoán to be productive down the stretch if they have a chance for the AL Central. Then, José Abreu was hit by a pitch up and in. With two on and no out, Eloy Jiménez flew out to center field and Gavin Sheets grounded into a force out that should have been a DP, but this time it was the Mariners who didn’t execute to keep the Sox alive in the inning. It was all for naught, however, as AJ Pollock lined out to end it. \nImagine that! Runners in scoring position who didn’t score. \nIn the bottom of the fourth, the Mariners had their fair share of action and adventure with a leadoff double by Ty France. He came around to score on a bad-hop throwing error by Sheets after a Mitch Haniger fly out. I’m not sure I’ve ever seen a team score a run because a ball hit a camera; baseball is full of firsts no matter how long you’ve been watching.   \nThe fifth inning came and went for both teams. It was uneventful. That’s all you need to know. \nIn the sixth, after Moncada struck out, Abreu smoked a double into the center-field gap. Eloy followed with a rocket SINGLE to center field. José was held at third by Joe McEwing, which was a good thing because he would have been DOA at home. I find myself often asking why do we have so many slow-ass runners? Do you, too? Then, I bet you can guess what happens next: The Sox couldn’t execute with runners in scoring position. Sheets was unable to drive Abreu home, as both he and Pollock struck out, the eighth and ninth victims for Seattle starter Logan Gilbert. In the bottom of the sixth, the Mariners got a single from Haniger and Cueto walked Suarez, but he pitched out of it.  \nIn the seventh, Matt Brash came in to pitch for the Mariners and Engel led off with a single — and was caught stealing. Grandal walked, Romy struck out, and Elvis Andrus grounded out. More men left on base; the story of the 2022 White Sox. After Cueto came out for the bottom of the seventh and gave up a leadoff base hit to Frazier and a walk to Jake Lamb, Miguel Cairo made the call to the pen for Jimmy Lambert. Lambert took care of business and retired the next three batters. \nThe eighth inning started off quietly, as Moncada flew out and Abreu struck out. With two outs, Jiménez singled and a Sheets walked. Then, shocker, Pollock struck out. Reynaldo López came in to pitch the bottom of the eighth and after getting the first two batters, proceeded to walk Haggerty and then give up a two-run home run to Raleigh — a doubled-up curveball to a curveball masher. And just like that, the Mariners went up, 3-0.  \nPaul Sewald, an appropriate name for a Mariner, pitched the ninth, looking for his 18th save. Without much effort, he found it. Nothing to look at here, folks. Game over.  \nThe White Sox had numerous opportunities to score in this game, but like they have so often done this season, they couldn’t get the job done with ducks on the pond. They stranded nine.  \nIn addition to this loss, the Guardians (70-64) won, so the Sox dropped to three games back in the AL Central race. \nThe White Sox will get one more chance against the Mariners tomorrow, at 3:10 p.m. CST. Luis Castillo will be on the bump for the Mariners, and the Sox have not yet named their starting pitcher. You can catch the rubber match on NBC Sports Chicago and WMVP 1000 AM. Both will be broadcasting the game.",

        "description": "Not great, Bob.  | @FanGraphs\n    \n\n  Buckle in, friends. The South Siders suck again The White Sox played a late-evening game against the Mariners after a dominating performance from Lance Lynn to open the series, and end Seattle’s seven-game win streak. Tonight, we had a real pitcher’s duel, with Johnny Cueto and Logan Gilbert. The White Sox were put to sleep by Gilbert and hope to eke out the rubber match tomorrow afternoon.\n\nThe Starters\nJohnny Cueto had a good night despite the run charged (that shouldn’t have happened anyway). His command was decent, and he fanned three while only allowing four hits and two walks. \nCueto’s 96-pitch outing looked like this: \n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \nIf I had to pick one word to describe Logan Gilbert tonight, it would be: nasty. Gilbert allowed five hits but still fanned nine and kept the White Sox scoreless throughout the six innings he pitched. His command and velocity were perfection, and his fastball dominated the Sox all night. \nGilbert’s 101-pitch outing looked like this:\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \n\nPressure Play\nAJ Pollock’s chance to save the game ended in tragedy. With two on and two out in the eighth, Pollock struck out swinging to strand runners. This was a common theme of the evening. The play had an LI of 4.17. Yikes. \n\nPressure Cooker\nIt’s no surprise that AJ Pollock faced the most pressure tonight. His pLI was 2.53.\n\nTop Play\nCal Raleigh’s two-run home run in the eighth was truly the end of the game. Raleigh made it 3-0, and the play landed a WPA of .071.\n\nTop Performer\nGive it up for the Mariners’ pitching. Everyone had a good night, but Logan Gilbert kept the White Sox off the board for six innings, handing an easy shutout to his relievers. Gilbert’s WPA was .034.\n\nSmackdown\nHardest hit: Yoán Moncada launched two hits tonight, but his first inning, welcome-back single was crushed, at 108.8 mph. \n\nWeakest contact: Elvis Andrus’ third inning ground out was trickled out at just 48.5 mph. As far as hits go, Mitch Haniger had a single in the sixth that left the bat at just 65.5 mph. \n\nLuckiest hit: Adam Engel’s seventh-inning single had an xBA of .290. It seemed like it could start a rally, but he made a silly jump trying to steal to second and was called out. \n\nToughest out: Adam Frazier’s line out in the eighth had an xBA of .900. \n\nLongest hit: Eugenio Suárez just barely beat Cal Raleigh’s home run. Suárez’s fly out traveled 390 feet, while Raleigh’s only went 383.\n\nMagic Number: 9\nThe White Sox left nine runners stranded this evening. Let that sink in. \n\nGlossary\nHard-hit is any ball off the bat at 95 mph or moreLI measures pressure per playpLI measures total pressure faced in-gameWhiff a swing-and-missWPA win probability added measures contributions to the winxBA expected batting average",

        "description": "Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Max Muncy hit two home runs to lead the Dodgers to a 6-3 lead over San Francisco.  If you’re a fan of manufacturing runs, moving runners over, stealing bases, etc., Tuesday night wasn’t for you. Each run in Tuesday’s game was scored via the long ball as the Dodgers and Giants combined to hit five home runs, with the Dodgers coming out on top, 6-3. \nAfter hitting two home runs on Monday, Lewis Brinson remained red hot, sending the first pitch of the game into the bleachers to give San Francisco an early 1-0 lead. Tyler Anderson sat the side down in order following the home run, but found himself in trouble again in the second inning. \nAfter Anderson retired the first two hitters of the inning, Joey Bart and David Villar recorded back-to-back two-out singles. It looked like Bryce Johnson was going to drop a third straight single into left field, but Joey Gallo made an incredible catch to keep the Giants off the board and help Anderson escape the inning unscathed.\nGallo wasn’t done making the highlight reel. In the bottom half of the inning, Gallo came to the plate following Max Muncy’s first of many extra base hits and a walk to Justin Turner. Gallo hammered a 3-1 fastball over the wall in right center field to give the Dodgers a 3-1 lead, their first of the game.\nMuncy would return to the plate in the third inning and deliver his 17th home run of the year to extend the Dodger lead to 5-1. \nAs Anderson kept the Giants offense in check throughout the middle innings, the Giants’ bullpen did the same to the Dodgers’. Gabe Kapler opted to go with a bullpen game in this one, using five different pitchers, nobody throwing more than 43 pitches or recording more than seven outs. In the sixth, Brandon Crawford delivered the Giants’ first runs since Brinson’s lead-off homer with a two-run moonshot of his own, cutting the Dodger lead to 5-3. \nAfter two and a third one-hit innings from Tyler Rogers, Kapler brought in Dominic Leone to throw the bottom of the sixth. The first batter he faced was Muncy, who came through with his third extra base hit and second home run of the night, smacking a 3-2 pitch that was actually out of the strike zone to the opposite field in left to give the Dodgers a 6-3 lead.\nAlthough he allowed eight hits, Tyler Anderson was effective as always and was able to get through seven innings. The only runs he allowed came on the homers by Brinson and Crawford, and for the first time in his last six starts, Anderson didn’t walk a hitter. \nRoberts handed the ball to Chris Martin in the eighth and Craig Kimbrel in the ninth, each of whom threw perfect innings as Kimbrel recorded his 22nd save of the year.\nPerhaps the best part about this one... the Giants have been officially eliminated from the NL West race, not that anyone is a threat to the Dodgers.\nTuesday particulars\nHome runs: Max Muncy 2 (18), Joey Gallo (16); Lewis Brinson (3), Brandon Crawford (8)\nWP — Tyler Anderson (14-3): 7 IP, 8 hits, 3 runs, 3 strikeouts\nLP — Jarlin Garcia (1-4): 1.2 IP, 4 hits, 5 runs, 1 walk, 3 strikeouts\nSv — Craig Kimbrel (22): 1 IP, 0 hits\nUp next\nTomorrow is daytime, getaway day baseball.

        "description": "It’s deja vu, all over again From my recap, three weeks ago today, amended appropriately. \nWell, that’s three hours and thirteen minutes of my life I’ll never get back. I could have watched a couple of movies. Improved my mind by reading. Rammed my head repeatedly into a concrete bollard. All of them would have been more entertaining than the end of this suck-fest. The D-backs were one strike away from victory. But the head of the apparently fictional “closer by committee”, Ian Kennedy, walked two batters before allowing a two-run walkoff single. He and Mark Melancon have now combined for SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN losses. \nThis may, in fact, have been even more painful, for the Diamondbacks coughed up a five-run lead here, rather than just one run. Merrill Kelly allowed only three hits over seven innings - unfortunately, all three of them left the yard, as the Padres pulled to within one. Kyle Nelson and Reyes Moronta dodged a bullet in the eighth. But Kennedy was roundly Sirhan Sirhan’d in the ninth, ruining what had been, to the half-way point, a thoroughly enjoyable night of baseball. \n\nI had barely turned the TV on before the Diamondbacks took the lead. To be honest, I was listening to Mrs. SnakePit, who had gone off on a bit of a rant about an issue at her job, to which I was contractually obliged to pay attention. But I am reliably informed that Josh Rojas jumped on the first pitch from Joe Musgrove and flipped it just over the fence the opposite way. It was his eighth home-run of the season and got the D-backs out to an early 1-0 lead. While that was all the damage, I do want to mention the 11-pitch AB by Jake McCarthy. It ended in a groundout, yet helped run up Musgrove's pitch-count. That would become a theme.\nIt seemed as if the Padres' starter was almost permanently working  out of the stretch. Including Rojas, who was more \"trotting round the bases\" than standing on them, the leadoff man for Arizona reached base each of the five innings Musgrove pitched. However they weren't able to do anything in the second or third. Even when the first two reached in the second, on a Corbin Carroll single and Carson Kelly walk, the D-backs came up empty. With two outs in the fourth and Kelly on first, however, Sergio Alcántara worked the count full, then doubled down the right-field line. With Kelly going on the pitch, our catcher was able to score all the way from first, making it 2-0.\nThe fifth inning was considerably more entertaining. Musgrove's pitch count was at eighty after only four innings, and Daulton Varsho ambushed pitch #81 to lead off the fourth, for his 21st home-run (below). Ketel Marte struck out, something that has become an all too common event of late. Tonight, he was 0-for-4 with a pair of Ks, and since August 14, is 8-for-57 with 13 strikeouts. However, rather than dwell on that, let's instead praise Christian Walker, who hit his 32nd homer to give Arizona a 4-0 lead. McCarthy then manufactured a run: he singled, stole second, took third on the catcher's throwing error, and scored on a Kelly groundout. Tacos? Don't mind if I do.\n\nWith the Diamondbacks 5-0 up and cruising, it seemed all but assured that the team were going to lock up a fourth consecutive series victory and run their record to 10-2 over the last dozen games. When was the last time Arizona did that? Again you have to go back to 2019: August 26 through September 8, to he precise. Truth be told, I was quietly hoping for something even more memorable. Because to that point, Merrill Kelly had retired all twelve batters he had faced, throwing four perfect innings. This was the point at which I wrote the paragraph below, effusively praising the joys of late 2022 D-backs baseball. Part of me wants to pretend it never happened, but I’ll leave it here, for reasons I’ll get to later. \nI can’t remember the last time I genuinely watched back-to-back Diamondbacks games. I certainly can’t remember the last time I genuinely ENJOYED watching back-to-back Diamondbacks games. I’m thinking it was at least the 2019 season, back before... [gestures vaguely] all that happened, to rob so much of my enjoyment of baseball. It has been a LONG three years. But the recent incarnation of Diamondbacks baseball has been a genuine pleasure to watch. Perhaps it’s all relative. From the end of 2019 through the All-Star break this year, this was basically the worst team in the majors. Since the All-Star break though, that certainly hasn’t been the case.\nHow much was I enjoying this game? samath offered to guest recap it, and I turned him down. Narrator: “It would be a mistake he would later come to regret.” For Merrill Kelly ended losing the perfect game, the no-hitter and the shutout in consecutive pitches, first walking Josh Bell, then allowing a home-run by Jake Cronenworth on the next offering. Another home-run followed four pitches later, and the cruise control on this one was suddenly rolling into the shop. Kelly got through the sixth, but gave up another homer in the seventh. He became the fifth pitcher in team history to give up 3+ hits, all of them home-runs. The record there is four, set by Micah Owings on September 3, 2007. \nThe D-backs offense had, once again, completely shut up shop against the Padres bullpen. Indeed, they sent up the minimum 14 batters against them. Their only base-runner was an Alcantara single, leading off the sixth inning. He was then immediately erased on a ground-ball double-play by Rojas. He would likely have legged it out, except for tripping over his own bat as he went up first, leading to a forward roll. We should likely have just gone home after that poor omen. Kelly left after seven innings, allowing four runs on three hits and a walk, with five strikeouts. It’s the first time since September 20, 2017 that both starters have allowed 3+ HR in a game at Petco: we were the visitors then too, with Robbie Ray our starter. \nWith the score now 5-4 to Arizona, Kyle Nelson’s struggles since his recall continued in the eighth. He walked the lead-off man, and one out leader, a single put the tying run on third. Nelson bounced back to get a huge strikeout of Juan Soto, then Reyes Moronta replaced him and got Manny Machado to pop out. It was all in vain, thanks to Kennedy’s sixth blown save. After a lead-off walk, he retired the next two, allowed a single, then got to two strikes on the following hitter, before walking him to load the bases. On a night of first-pitch attacks, it seemed only appropriate that it ended on Kennedy’s first pitch to Jorge Alfaro, who singled right back up the middle to score the tying and winning runs. \nDespite the loss, I did have a bit of an epiphany in the ninth inning. I realized that I actually cared about the result of the game, and that’s why I left the paragraph of praise higher up. Over the past three seasons, my passion for baseball and the D-backs in particular, had been grindingly replaced by a kind of benevolent apathy, where I hardly bothered to do more than check the score. The last frame tonight though, was the most invested I had been in any Diamondback game for a long, long time. Even if the result was not what I hoped, perhaps it marks a turning point in the overall picture. Though if the team could book seats on the next Greenland flight for Kennedy and Mark Melancon, I’d be all the happier for it!\n  \n        \n  \n\nClick for details at Fangraphs.com\nThe Princess of Hearts: Reyes Moronta, +13.8%\nElton John: Merrill Kelly, +10.3%\nA tunnel in Paris: Ian Kennedy, -81.6%\n\n\nA happy Gameday Thread, right up to the point where it wasn’t. I am going to go with a positive Comment of the Game, from Chewbrocka. We do need to realize that, even as the team comes back from the suck we’ve experienced over the past three seasons, there are still going to be games like tonight. They’re not the end of the world. What matters is the long-term future, and that is still looking brighter than for quite some time.\n  \n        \n  \nSame two teams tomorrow, in the rubber game, with another odd start time, this one getting under way at 5:40 pm, Arizona time. Tommy Henry starts for the D-backs, hoping to bounce back from a bit of a shellacking in his last outing.",

Deep underground, in a thrumming, humidified laboratory, a world-historical statue is being reunited with its ancient marble foot. Of all the rooms at the Acropolis Museum in Athens, this is the most pulse-quickening, which is saying something considering that the building houses treasures of antiquity including friezes from the Parthenon.Prof Nikolaos Stampolidis, director-general of the museum, is playing the role of an archaeological Prince Charming: he must decide if the deftly chiselled toes are a match for the sculpture of a kouros, or naked youth on display as part of the permanent collection until conservationists began to suspect that the foot bone connected to the leg bone might be the wrong one. Perhaps the foot in the lab, which was found elsewhere at the Acropolis, will be a perfect fit. If museum staff are right, these jigsaw pieces, separated for millennia, have been within just a few square metres of one another. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Armed with her tent, her thumb, and a rendez-vous with a sailboat captain, Sarah Thomas heads to the Westfjords of Iceland; the landscape that birthed her book &#8216;The Raven&#8217;s Nest&#8217;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf a place gives itself to me, long and deep enough to make work with it, it is only right to give something in return.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMy ecological memoir The Raven’s Nest, recently published by Atlantic Books, is set in Iceland’s Westfjords, where I spent six years living, loving, learning and letting go following the financial crisis of 2008. I knew wanted to be there on publication day, a place where the book would not be so much a ‘new release’ as a basket of shared stories, ideas, and memories to gather around. I wanted to be reading it aloud to the people and places that are in it, in those places. Icelandic summer is the only time for open air roaming, a fullness of days. And so I went, with my tent, my thumb, a rendez-vous with a sailboat captain and a box of books sent ahead.\n\n\n\nThe journey to the first of five public readings I did in Iceland over two weeks this summer, was made by sea: the ‘whale road’.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n“There’s some whales if you want to see them.”\n\n\n\nAn understated and well-timed wake-up call from the captain, as I give up trying to sleep over the engine noise, turned on to get us on our way, the sail ineffective on this calm day. I emerge from the darkness of my tiny cabin into the generous light of a July horizon steaming with spouts of spray; curved backs breaching and vanishing in a slick of black; birds circling overhead. Humpbacks probably. It is an auspicious start to a book tour.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe pass a lone fisherman, and wave. Curious fulmars occasionally pull up alongside us, and we cross paths with puffins and guillemots floating in the blue. Following this concentration of life, we see nothing for hours.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The sea can be like a desert, for miles” the captain says. “And then… an oasis.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMuch as The Raven’s Nest is about chance and living well with uncertainty, it is a matter of chance that I find myself here, now, in this way. Iceland taught me a lot about that. I met the captain in the Faroe Islands in 2015 — me attempting to hitchhike to Iceland, he bailing from his voyage from Norway due to fierce weather and unable to offer a lift, both finding ourselves invited into the belly of the Faroese schooner Norðlýsið, to partake of its infamous hospitality. Thanks to that chance encounter, I have become honorary occasional ‘crew’ (aka the cook) on his own small boat in Iceland, that lift deferred and made many. When I make my almost annual migration, I usually make part of my journey with his boat and motley crew for a day or a few, wherever it is.\n\n\n\nThis trip began with my most direct route to the sea yet: within a ten-minute taxi ride from the airport, I was aboard. The captain’s destination this time is Breiðafjörður (‘wide fjord’), a bay of thousands of tiny islands between Snæfellness and the Westfjords where I once lived. Flatey, 2.5km long and 1.7km wide and the only island inhabited year-round, is where I will do my first reading. The harbour near the airport was on his route. I arrived at 2am to a pier devoid of people, the world asleep, the boats overlooked by a wooden hut from which the sound of amplified snoring was emanating, embodying the sentiment of the hour. The captain told me it is an ode to a troll woman featured in a historic series of children’s books by Herdis Egilsdóttir. Though her snoring was clearly noteworthy, she was mostly celebrated for coming to the rescue of fishermen in a storm.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow we’re heading north across Faxaflói, the vast bay which is embraced by Reykjanes (‘smoky peninsula’) to the south and Snæfellsnes (‘peninsula of the snow mountain’) to the north, with Reykjavík (‘smoky bay’) tucked in its shelter. The place-naming settlers would find that the ‘smoke’ was in fact geothermal steam exhaled by an earth where magma is never far from the surface, which has recently erupted once again, not far from our point of departure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBeing early July – close to midsummer – it is never dark, and our movements are determined entirely by the weather. We cross the ‘desert’ making a course towards Snæfellsjökull, that iconic glacier-capped mountain, supposed portal on Jules Verne’s Journey to the Centre of the Earth. Today it is unusually crisp in its detail, clear of cloud. We anchor under the mountain floating in a silken sea, the light dissolving into sleep.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHours later, the day before publication day, we are forced to duck into a harbour to wait out a 28-hour gale that was only forecast last night. Strong wind blows our boat away from the pier and mooring alone is a three person job. Finally, we hunker down, wires clanging on the mast, the fenders groaning against the hull. Journalists from the two national papers interview me over the phone – the howling wind louder than their questions. It takes me several hours and a change of mindset to find the sound relaxing. I brave the weather and go to the village pool where I meet the crew of a French sailboat heading for Greenland who are reconsidering their plans.\n\n\n\nThe storm past us, we set off again into dazzling sun and little wind, though remnants of the gale’s energy still pulses through the waves. Before we head for Flatey, we plan to explore an uninhabited island in the archipelago. En route the toilet breaks, so it’s overboard release for now; chats with curious fulmars who come to watch. In deeper water, we stop to fish. Cod after cod bites the line within seconds. I have only sea fished once before: this luck is not technique but a thrilling moment of abundance. None are especially small but we throw them back until I catch one big enough for dinner. With a few flicks of a knife the captain has produced two fillets and launches the remains overboard to an explosion of fulmars who have been patiently waiting. That evening we eat our cod anchored in the shelter of this horshoe-shaped island, a golden-glowed amphitheatre for the cry of kittiwake, guillemot; and come dusk, for a heated debate between two red-throated divers, which hangs in the cooling air.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaturday’s task is to collect a new crew member from Stykkishólmur – a major harbour – and stock up on supplies; try and fail to fix the toilet; get a shower at the pool. I visit Roni Horn’s Library of Water – an art installation of columns of meltwater from 24 of Iceland’s glaciers, housed in the town’s former library up on the hill. You only find out once you are there that the ticket office is at the bottom of the hill. The woman there gives me a ‘ticket’ which is the door code; says she is coming to Flatey tomorrow and will come to my reading. The library overlooks the bay, and the islands are refracted in the transparent columns. All of the glaciers from which the ice was collected have since receded and one of them, Ok, has died. I am the only visitor. The heating is on high and I am still dressed for the sea: fleece-lined dungarees, a wool jumper and a waterproof jacket. I begin to sweat to the extent I want to rip off all my clothes. I head for the door and find it will not open. I am locked into a library of glacial melt. This feels like a metaphor beyond that which may have been intended by Horns. While a heat wave is crisping Europe and the UK it feels like a metaphor for 2022. With 1% phone battery left I manage to text the captain, who comes to release me.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen all is done it is evening and we have heard there is a gig on Flatey. From Stykkishólmur we make the short sail in cinematic light, the sun’s rays spotlighting some islands while others rest in deep blue shadow; the sea sparkling like hammered silver. At 9pm we anchor off Flatey, the sounds from the party mingling with the raucous cliff of seabirds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA band, Ske, is playing at the old samkommahsið (‘coming together house’ – a village hall), now part of the island’s only hotel. We take the dinghy straight over – me clutching a change of clothes in a bag. I make a beeline for the toilets to peel out of my dungarees and wellies and into something more suitable, and sidle into the fray with a bottle of ice cold beer. Perhaps 60 people – young, old and everything in between – are packed into a room hot with dancing. After 5 days on sea this is a carnival of human life and colour. Ske’s Polka covers of pop songs are a hit, which have everyone bouncing and singing along tunefully. The crowd is mostly summerhouse owners and their guests. The houses have stayed in the same families for generations and their owners remain deeply connected to this place.\n\n\n\nEver more merry, we form a conga line which snakes out of the door and around the building. I spot my crew, still in their wellies and drinking beer outside, and break away from the line.\n\n\n\n“You know that was the mayor of Reykjavik whose shoulders you were holding?” the new guy asks, clearly amused.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I didn’t, no.”\n\n\n\nSeveral here tonight are Reykjavík celebrities apparently, but I wouldn’t have guessed. That is how it is here.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the morning we wake to find a huge National Geographic cruise ship has anchored the other side of the harbour. Tourists are ferried in rib boats to the shore. This is inconvenient for our back step toileting. We decide to bide our time a little and explore a nearby island with the dingy, before the captain leaves me on Flatey with my bag of everything, the tourists gone to their next stop.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt 2pm I find Gyða, the woman with whom I planned tonight’s 8pm reading. She tells me that the posters arrived but the books she ordered haven’t. In my experience, Icelanders deal with what is in front of them, so it was less strange for her than for me for this to have not been mentioned before now. So far she has only put one poster up – in the old cold store, the venue. She was waiting for me to actually arrive. Many things can happen, especially on an island, that change or delay plans – the changeable weather, ferry cancellations. This means advance planning is treated lightly. An intention is set and plans left flexible. Luckily this has given rise to a spontaneous mindset, which would serve us all well in these times of disruption.\n\n\n\nNow I am definitely here. There are no books to sell, but a reading can happen. Now it is time to advertise, for an event in 6 hours’ time. Many from Saturday’s party have left back to Reykjavík so it’s only the summer dwellers left. In an hour I have put posters up at the hotel, knocked on every door, and Gyða has posted to the island Facebook group. Everyone will know and ten would be a crowd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinally, I can sit down for a coffee with Hrönn – one of the island’s two farmers, and my host. Hitchhiking as I am, I have planned my readings south to north. My first stop is Flatey because two of The Raven’s Nest’s central chapters are set here, in and around this house. They honour her now elderly parents Hafliði and Ólöf. This house is the first place I ever stayed on Flatey, back when they ran it as a guest house. In the intervening years I have often camped in their garden. Ólöf is now in an old people’s home in Stykkishólmur and Hafliði, once the man who always stood by the gangplank to greet ferry passengers and take news and goods, is now too old to do so.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHrönn has taken on Hafliði’s role at the pier and has bought the house from her parents. She cannot be bothered with hosting tourists, but has invited me to stay inside because there are builders working in the garden. In the time period of the book, I didn’t know her at all. She is described only in a long shot as ‘a woman in bright orange rubber dungarees’ who I watched lift a seal from a fishing boat. Now I will get to spend time with her in close up. Hafliði comes in to join us. He is bright as a button but slow on his feet. I don’t know how we get to talking about it, but soon he is telling me about people with second sight, one of whom was islander Ingimundur Jónsson who died here in 1934. He knew of a boat of Flatey islanders drowning, long before the news reached the island.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe table is set for 8 and I ask Hrönn why. She tells me her father Hafliði lives with her, her niece is staying with her, I am here, and she is feeding the 3 builders 3 meals a day. They happen to be the husband and sons of Gyða, my event contact and a relative of Hrönn, so she most often joins them too. Dinner tonight is birched smoked lamb sausages and mash – lambs raised by her, meat smoked by her, potatoes grown by her. I am offered eider eggs, kittiwake eggs, rhubarb cake.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt 7.45pm I go down to the venue, the old cold store which now houses a volunteer-run café and shop selling coffee, hot dogs, handknitted mittens and jumpers, secondhand books about nature and the sea. The guests are gathering. Some I recognise from the party, some from my door-knocking, and Guðrún, the woman from the Library of Water has indeed come.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You know I got locked in?” I tell her.\n\n\n\n“Oh! That happened to a guy last week too! He climbed out of the window. It’s supposed to have been fixed but…clearly not.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe gather round in mismatched armchairs and I tell them, to whoops of delight, that this is the first reading following publication day. Not in London, or Edinburgh, but Flatey. I tell them that though I got engaged here, and my marriage to my husband is long over, I remain married to this place. I read them the two chapters set here, about Hafliði and Ólöf. The quality of their listening is so tangible, I daren’t look up, or stop. At the end of those two chapters, we sit in silence for a while.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s like music,” Guðrún says.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother woman shares that the image of Hafliði at the pier brought a tear to her eye, as he is no longer there.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI ask if I’ve made any errors.\n\n\n\n“There is one,” says Stína. “In 2011, Ólöf did not have hens. She had ducks.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n&#8216;The Raven&#8217;s Nest&#8217; is out now.\n\n\n\nThrough autumn and winter, as well as author Q&amp;As, Sarah will be doing a series of extended readings inspired by the Icelandic tradition of &#8216;kvöldvaka&#8217; (‘evening wake’), where as the nights drew in and the day’s work was done, the household would continue the work of knitting, darning and mending as one person read aloud to them from the light of a single oil lamp. Audiences are invited to bring their crafts and mending projects to do as she reads.\n\n\n\nOutwith Books Glasgow 27th September\n\n\n\nTidespace Kirkcudbright Sunday 11th September\n\n\n\nThe Crannog Centre, Loch Tay Saturday 24th September\n\n\n\nWayWord Festival, Aberdeen Sunday 25th September\n\n\n\nWigtown Book Festival Saturday 1st October\n\n\n\nLancaster Litfest Saturday 8th October\n\n\n\nStanfords Bristol Tuesday 11th October\n\n\n\nStanfords London Thursday 13th October\n\n\n\nThe Marlow Bookshop Monday 19th December&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKeep an eye on her Twitter @journeysinbtwn for further details, or her events page.",

In Bob Dylan’s Watching the River Flow, it’s a wily slide guitar that seizes center stage with a sound both witty and free, while halfway through Jackson Browne’s Doctor My Eyes, a guitar solo winds up changing the entire trajectory of the song, making it soar from a chugging ballad to a flat-out rocker.In each case, the guitarist responsible for adding those shapes and colors to the music is Jesse Ed Davis. Though little remembered today, Davis was the go-to session guitarist for music’s greatest stars of the late 60s through the 70s. His tasteful licks and surgical leads turned up on solo albums by three out of the four Beatles (all but Paul), and alighted on recordings by Rod Stewart (including the No 1 hit Tonight’s the Night), Eric Clapton, Leon Russell, Bryan Ferry, Willie Nelson, Harry Nilsson, Gram Parsons and scores more.

If it is real, it is one of the most bizarre clips that has ever made it to the internet. It is a clip of Harry Styles spitting at Chris Pine at the Don’t Worry Darling premiere.Anyone who has been keeping abreast of Don’t Worry Darling will know that it isn’t particularly good. The BBC called it “an empty shell”, The Daily Beast said that Harry Styles’s “bastardized British accent is a distraction” and Peter Bradshaw observed that the whole film is “a movie marooned in a desert of unoriginality”. But then the film would have had to be an outright masterpiece to overcome its own behind the scenes chaos. Continue reading...",

My expat father was home on leave from Hong Kong, visiting my mum and I in our Devon bungalow. He had just broken the news that I was to be sent away to boarding school and Mum was upset. There was shouting and tears. In the midst of it all, I hunkered down in front of the evening news.What I saw took me by surprise. In a place called Jamaica, people were dancing in the street to steel pan and reggae, and on the backs of tooting lorries. The celebrations were for the 10th anniversary of the island’s independence – and in that moment, with the row over my future raging above me, all I wanted was to be sucked up into the television screen and transported 4,500 miles to the other side of the Atlantic to be there with them.

Instead of a man waking in the body of a bug, a bug wakes in the body of the British prime minister.

It’s not hard to reduce the UK to filth and ruin: just give the idiot humans exactly what they want.The Cockroach was less a satire than a sneer, a book that set out to entrench rather than interrogate the divisions that led to Brexit.

During the leadership campaign she said she wanted to allow fracking, but only in areas where there was a clear public consensus in favour.On the Today programme this morning Lord Deben, the Tory peer who chairs the Committee for Climate Change, said fracking was not a solution to the UK’s energy problems. He explained:The price of gas is not affected by the relatively small amount that we can get, in addition to the North Sea or indeed from fracking.This is an international price and we would be paying the same price we got out of the fracked gas as we are for the gas we’re using now.

During the leadership campaign she said she wanted to allow fracking, but only in areas where there was a clear public consensus in favour.On the Today programme this morning Lord Deben, the Tory peer who chairs the Committee for Climate Change, said fracking was not a solution to the UK’s energy problems. He explained:The price of gas is not affected by the relatively small amount that we can get, in addition to the North Sea or indeed from fracking.This is an international price and we would be paying the same price we got out of the fracked gas as we are for the gas we’re using now.

        "description": "Only middling writing lets down the impressive-looking third instalment from an upstart Spanish studio, which follows a Chicago bricklayer’s quest to lift an ancient curseHere is the third entry in a series of modestly budgeted, surprisingly profitable Spanish digimations, shrewdly placed at the end of the summer holidays to capitalise on any waning of interest in Minions and Super-Pets. Parents present for the long haul will have witnessed two stories unfolding, primarily how hapless Chicago bricklayer Tad Stones (dubbed by Kerry Shale first time round, and after by Trevor White) realised his dream of becoming a globetrotting Indiana Jones-like archaeologist.The new one, however, is more intriguing: a pronounced narrowing of the gap between the American powerhouses who set the CGI bar and the upstart European studios who boosted their rendering capacity as those erstwhile market leaders began cutting corners. Tad’s sweetheart Sara (Alex Kelly) may possess a Disney look so comprehensive that you fear legal intervention, but elsewhere this third instalment’s attention to lighting sources indicates many long hours of poring over laptops. Only middling writing lets it down, lacking both the conceptual heft and the quality and quantity of gags we associate with Pixar at their best.As the title suggests, we’re following the Howard Carter route this time out, leaving behind the most promising comic idea, namely Tad’s chaotic flat share with Mummy (Joseph Balderrama), an actual and altogether hyper-caffeinated mummy. (Although lame references to dabbing and social media represent an already dated idea of What Kids Like.) Still, the pair’s standard-issue 200mph quest for some curse-lifting doodad sporadically tosses up inventive and dynamic design in its wake: lots of secret doors, artefacts and hieroglyphs to puzzle over, and a fun mid-film chase along the Seine involving a motorised bathtub and an odd-landing Notre-Dame joke. (Too soon, surely.) This is never more than inessential screen filler, but agreeably jolly with it – partly as it does have some idea of how to fill a screen.Tad the Lost Explorer and the Curse of the Mummy is released on 9 September in cinemas.

When she arrived, she was reassured by a sign on the door that said the same thing.\nBut when Fama, 48, opened the door, she was greeted by an unmasked employee behind a glass partition. A patient in the waiting area was also maskless. And the technician who took Fama&#x2019;s blood came into the room with a mask below her chin, before eventually pulling it over her mouth and nose.Read the rest&hellip;",

A revised PS5 model started appearing in Australia last month, and now YouTuber Austin Evans has taken a look at the internals and discovered a lot of changes. Sony is using a new, smaller motherboard for the PS5, different cooling, and has even changed the SSD enclosure.\nAll of these changes add up to another weight reduction, but no obvious changes to the exterior of the PS5. The real big change is the updated motherboard in the PS5. It has shrunk by around two inches, and the cooling for the PS5 is slightly different thanks to an additional heat pipe at the rear and a smaller heatsink.\n\nThis isn’t the first time we’ve seen a redesigned cooling solution on the PS5....\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "When Paul Cofell of Red Wing read a letter in the Palm Springs Desert Sun suggesting that water could be diverted from the Mississippi River and piped to the Colorado River basin, he couldn&#x27;t stay quiet.Cofell wrote to the newspaper, advising Californians that if they come for the Midwest&#x27;s water, &quot;we have plenty of dynamite in Minnesota.&quot;He didn&#x27;t anticipate the flood of responses to the paper that followed, some supportive, some angry. Cofell even got a call from the Goodhue County Sheriff’s Office, who told him some viewed his letter as threatening and advised him not to make any more references to dynamite.“The reaction I got was quite astounding,” Cofell said. The incident highlights the passionate reaction to the idea of sending water from the Midwest to the southwestern United States, where an ongoing drought and population growth have created a looming water crisis. States such as California, Arizona and Nevada are facing severe restrictions on their water use.One proposed solution making headlines is diverting water from the Mississippi River or some other water source to those drier states. Recent flooding along the Mississippi has led some to wonder, why not send some of that excess water to where it&#x27;s desperately needed?Julie Makinen, the Desert Sun’s executive editor, said the topic of transporting water set off a cascade of interest, with letters pouring in from all over the world.Some argue that the West’s current water systems date back decades to when there were far fewer people, and modern engineering solutions are needed. And they point out that agriculture in California and other western states is a national resource, she said.&quot;When the Midwesterners get very possessive about, ‘Don&#x27;t touch a drop of our water,’ then people here are like, ‘OK, well, don&#x27;t go to your supermarket looking for strawberries in January,’&quot; Makinen said.Others argue that “we shouldn’t try to engineer our way out of these problems,” she said.“That means stop having surf parks and stop having green grass lawns, and stop building houses in places where it’s hard to get water,” Makinen said.Plans to pipe water from wetter to drier regions of the country have been floated since the 1960s, and a few actually were built, said Todd Jarvis with the Institute for Water and Watersheds at Oregon State University. Since then, the water shortage in the Southwest has grown more dire, Jarvis said.&quot;We&#x27;re now looking at will the drought ever be broken?” he said. “I think everybody&#x27;s starting to think maybe this is the new normal.&quot;That scarcity has made water a valuable commodity, Jarvis said, attracting new interest in ideas to move it from one basin to another.&quot;The participants in the proposals are no longer governments,” he said. “We&#x27;re talking [about] private industry. Hedge funds are starting to look at water. We&#x27;re starting to see water show up on Nasdaq as far as futures.” Could it happen?Shipping Minnesota water to sate a thirsty world  DNRPlan to ship Minnesota groundwater to the southwest won’t floatDrought in the WestClimate change is making it worseMeanwhile, the crisis is expected to worsen. Studies have predicted that by 2030, global demand for water will exceed the supply by 40 percent if current practices continue.&quot;The basic laws of supply and demand tell you that as a good becomes more scarce, it becomes more valuable,” said Bonnie Keeler, an associate professor at the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Humphrey School of Public Affairs. High-quality water suitable for drinking is going to become increasingly scarce throughout the world, Keeler said.&quot;It&#x27;s very hard to move cities,” she said. “So the emphasis is going to be on finding water to meet the demand of those populations, rather than moving cities to places where there&#x27;s more water.&quot;Challenges aboundBut projects to transport water — by pipeline or some other means — face serious obstacles. First, they&#x27;re difficult to build, and expensive.&quot;They&#x27;re considered actually to be high-risk projects,” said Mohsen Tahmasebi Nasab, an engineering professor at the University of St. Thomas. That&#x27;s because they require major financial investment, plus a long time to complete, Nasab said. “We are talking years and years, sometimes decades, of studying and construction,” he said.Water transport projects tend to be extremely costly even when compared to other expensive options, such as desalination plants that remove salt from seawater, said Greg Pierce, co-director of the Luskin Center for Innovation at the University of California, Los Angeles.Environmental regulations have gotten tougher too, making it far less likely that such projects could get needed approval, he said.&quot;In the early to mid part of the 20th century, we were doing a lot of moving water around the country,” Pierce said. “I think that era is pretty decidedly over.&quot;Taking water from one region and moving it to another can have serious environmental impacts, including changing the hydrology and ecology of a river or watershed, and introducing pollutants or invasive species to a new region.And with climate change making it much more difficult to predict drought and precipitation cycles, it’s risky for one region to lock themselves into a deal that gives away its water, Pierce said.&quot;They may need that water more than they did in previous times,” he said. “The fact that there&#x27;s intense flooding, and overall more water than is needed for the local population doesn&#x27;t mean they don&#x27;t need that reliable flow.”Water flows down the Colorado River downriver from Hoover Dam in northwest Arizona,  Aug. 14, near the Lake Mead National Recreation Area.John Locher | APStricter lawsThere also are legal barriers to transport projects, which vary depending on the water source. A multi-state compact prevents the diversion of water from the Great Lakes, with a few exceptions.Minnesota&#x27;s groundwater also has an added layer of protection since an Oregon company sparked outrage in 2019 by proposing to transport groundwater from one of the state’s oldest and deepest aquifers in Dakota County by train to the western United States.State officials said the plan wouldn&#x27;t happen. But it did raise concerns about potential gaps in state laws that could allow the bulk transport of water outside Minnesota&#x27;s borders.&quot;It may surprise people in the Land of 10,000 Lakes, but we actually anticipate water quality issues of our own here in the next 10 to 12 years,” said Dakota County Commissioner Joe Atkins. &quot;So we sure as heck shouldn&#x27;t be sending our water off to the desert.&quot;Atkins helped update Dakota County&#x27;s ordinance to bar using more than 50 million gallons of groundwater a year for commercial or institutional use. Agricultural use is exempted.Last year, Minnesota lawmakers passed a law prohibiting the state from issuing a permit to use more than a million gallons of water a year if it’s being sent more than 50 miles away for a public drinking water supply, or more than 100 miles away for some other purpose.Atkins worries that local laws won&#x27;t prevent attempts by western states to access the Midwest&#x27;s water. He wants to see stronger federal protections for the Mississippi River.“With the sort of political power and influence that states like California and Arizona wield, that has me concerned that the change at the federal level could change the protection that we have over that water,” Atkins said.The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources has not received any recent proposals to transport groundwater, said Barb Naramore, deputy commissioner. She said a proposal to move water from the Mississippi River in Minnesota to the western U.S. would not be permissible. If the proposal were to take water from farther downstream, such as St. Louis or New Orleans, Minnesota wouldn’t have regulatory authority, but would have serious concerns about the impacts, she said.Minnesota is one of five states that are part of the Upper Mississippi River Basin Association, which doesn’t exclude diversion projects, but includes a commitment to notify and consult with the other states about such proposals. The group is looking at whether that needs updating or strengthening, Naramore said.Nasab said it’s likely that other state and local governments will adopt more restrictions on water resources.&quot;They&#x27;re going to put some rules on how much water you can draw from the rivers, to make sure that the environmental and ecological health of the river and the wetlands and the lakes are preserved first,” he said.Unifying issueMany critics of the water transport proposals say southwestern states should do more to reduce water use and explore other options such as reusing water before looking to the Mississippi.Cofell said he’s bothered by the attitude of some residents of the southwestern U.S. who seem to feel entitled to the Midwest’s water. He’s concerned that the proposals to transport water don&#x27;t address what he sees as the root causes of the crisis: overpopulation and overconsumption.&quot;If you look at drone photographs of Palm Springs, most of the houses have swimming pools with nice blue water in them,” Cofell said.But conservation isn’t enough, Keeler said. She said the places in the U.S. that are expected to become increasingly hotter and less hospitable are also the places seeing the biggest growth.“We&#x27;re going to start seeing over the next decade more and more instances where we have fewer options to supply water to these growing populations,” she said.The debate about transporting water has one positive outcome: greater appreciation of how fortunate Minnesota is to have an abundant resource that&#x27;s so scarce in much of the world, Keeler said.&quot;I think the threat of another state laying claim to our freshwater in Minnesota is one of those issues that really cuts across political divides,” she said.",

The Yankees will play two today, which means they have a chance to double the length of their current winning streak. No, two in a row doesn’t make for much of a streak, but four consecutive would have a nice ring to it, and would go a long way towards ending this month of misery the club has put us through. They’re slated to throw out Domingo Germán in game one, while Gerrit Cole should start game two.\nAhead of the twin-bill, we’ll have a loaded day on the site. Andrés analyzes Germán’s performance so far, while Chris writes on how the old age of the Yankee roster has been an impediment. Also, John wonders about what Josh Donaldson’s proper role is on this team, and Esteban delivers his at-bat of the week.\nToday’s Matchup\nNew York Yankees vs. Minnesota Twins\nGame one:\nTime: 3:05 p.m. ET\nTV: Amazon Prime Video, Bally Sports North\nRadio: 1280 WADO, 660/101.9 FM WFAN\nVenue: Yankee Stadium\nGame two:\nTime: 7:05 p.m. ET\nTV: YES Network, Bally Sports North, TBS\nRadio: 1280 WADO, 660/101.9 FM WFAN\nVenue: Yankee Stadium\nFun Questions/Prompts:\n1.

        "description": "Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Rizzo to IL with Guzmán called up; no good news on LeMahieu’s injury, Stanton okay after taking foul ball off foot; Levine is “perplexed” by the team’s play; Sweeney promoted to Double-A MLB Trade Rumors | Darragh McDonald: The Yankees have been without Anthony Rizzo for a good bit now, and finally they’re at least going to get something out of his roster spot. As noted, they placed Rizzo on the IL on Tuesday with headaches stemming from a recent epidural he received for his persistent back problems. In his places comes Ronald Guzmán, the former long-time Texas Ranger who has been playing in the minors for the Yankees all season. Especially with DJ LeMahieu also ailing, another first baseman was really a necessity. Guzmán is out of options, so he can’t be easily sent back down once Rizzo returns.\nNJ.com | Randy Miller: Of course, Rizzo is far from the only injured hitter the Yankees have right now. The Yankees don’t have any positive updates on LeMahieu either, who has been struggling badly. He’s going to sit for a few games, including today’s doubleheader. It seems like he would have hit the IL by now if the team had anyone reliable to replace him in the infield. Boone believes his injured toe won’t get better until the offseason and calls the discussions with team doctors “complicated” — great! There’s better news on Giancarlo Stanton after he fouled a ball off his foot and ankle on Monday. He’s sore, but not ruled out for Wednesday’s games.\nNJ.com | Bridget Hyland: Club President Randy Levine recently appeared on “The Show” podcast hosted by Joel Sherman and Jon Heyman. The primary topic was, of course, the team’s downward slide after such a promising start. He calls the fall “perplexing,” also suggests that it isn’t entirely unprecedented, pointing to the 2000 team that lost 15 of their last 18 games yet still finished with a World Series trophy. \nCBS Sports: All the shortstops keep on moving up. With Anthony Volpe now in Triple-A, following Oswald Peraza’s promotion to the majors, Trey Sweeney has been bumped up to Double-A Somerset. The Yankees’ 2021 first-round draft pick has spent the entire season with High-A Hudson Valley, where he slashed .241/.350/.415 with 14 home runs and an impressive 29 stolen bases. As before, Sweeney’s future with the team as a shortstop is unclear considering the prospects ahead of him, but he’ll have his chance to prove himself in a harder league.",

        "description": "Martyn Robertson’s film follows a 14-year-old Scottish surfing champion as he prepares to take on Ireland’s biggest waves If anyone’s come up with an image more cinematic than a matchstick-sized man riding a tsunami of a wave, I’ve yet to see it. And Ride the Wave’s matchstick man ratchets up the tension by being a 14-year-old boy: Ben Larg, a Scottish junior surfing champion based on the Hebridean island of Tiree. Normally, big-wave surfing documentaries focus on lantern-jawed, seasoned watermen, but Martyn Robertson’s film has an interestingly vulnerable edge by focusing on the stripling Larg’s desire to tackle Aileen’s and Mullaghmore, two of the cold-water breaks on Ireland’s west coast – and how his parents manage their stress levels accordingly.One minute Larg is a blond-bobbed grommet, with more than a passing resemblance to the late Dogtowner Jay Adams, crying after flunking his heats at international competitions. Half an hour into the film, he’s suddenly a bum-fluffed teenager who’s sizing up the Gaelic big-wave spots, notably the menacing Aileen’s which is capable of holding 50ft waves that wash you towards a scree field underneath 700ft shale cliffs. It’s the latest instalment of an old story: how troubled surfers throw themselves into the waves to wash off emotional turmoil on land. On Tiree, his parents are immigrants from inland, and Larg is heavily bullied to the point where they pull him and his siblings out of school. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Martyn Robertson’s film follows a 14-year-old Scottish surfing champion as he prepares to take on Ireland’s biggest waves If anyone’s come up with an image more cinematic than a matchstick-sized man riding a tsunami of a wave, I’ve yet to see it. And Ride the Wave’s matchstick man ratchets up the tension by being a 14-year-old boy: Ben Larg, a Scottish junior surfing champion based on the Hebridean island of Tiree. Normally, big-wave surfing documentaries focus on lantern-jawed, seasoned watermen, but Martyn Robertson’s film has an interestingly vulnerable edge by focusing on the stripling Larg’s desire to tackle Aileen’s and Mullaghmore, two of the cold-water breaks on Ireland’s west coast – and how his parents manage their stress levels accordingly.One minute Larg is a blond-bobbed grommet, with more than a passing resemblance to the late Dogtowner Jay Adams, crying after flunking his heats at international competitions. Half an hour into the film, he’s suddenly a bum-fluffed teenager who’s sizing up the Gaelic big-wave spots, notably the menacing Aileen’s which is capable of holding 50ft waves that wash you towards a scree field underneath 700ft shale cliffs. It’s the latest instalment of an old story: how troubled surfers throw themselves into the waves to wash off emotional turmoil on land. On Tiree, his parents are immigrants from inland, and Larg is heavily bullied to the point where they pull him and his siblings out of school. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Ever wanted to go dancing with bats to the sound of some deep house they’ve composed? Well, a duo from Arbroath have got 13 hot tracks – translated from ultrasonic frequencies – just for youHanna Tuulikki is inviting you to a bat rave: a party in the setting September sun, propelled by pulsing beats and lights. All being well, above your head will flit superskilled flying mammals – common and soprano pipistrelles, Daubenton’s bats – dining on insects attracted by your body heat. The bats have provided the tunes, too: an album of 13 dance tracks written by Tuulikki with Tommy Perman, all mixed from sampled echolocation calls from 14 species found in the UK.Bat calls are ultrasonic – beyond the range of the human ear. The sounds Tuulikki and Perman used were recorded from a heterodyne bat detector, which translates them to audible frequencies. Hearing pipistrelle calls through a bat detector for the first time a few years ago Tuulikki was “struck by how much they reminded me of the Roland TB-303 synthesiser from the 1980s”. The squelching sounds of the 303 were foundational to acid house and techno: why not make dance music from bat echolocator calls? Continue reading...",

Everything is possible, until the hammer blow of the exit poll falls. Then, with relentless predictability, members of the party that has lost first blame the voters, and then start to blame each other. James Schneider was a co-founder of Momentum, the political movement formed off the back of Jeremy Corbyn’s election as Labour leader, and was later the party’s head of strategic communications.In his new book, he takes a different approach. Opening boldly and promisingly, his first words are “defeatism plagues the British left”, and his introduction sketches his ambition: “To keep the possibilities open and turn winning from a distant hope into a reality, we must use the coming years to build power, weaken our opponents, and prepare ourselves for the next surge.” Continue reading...",

Equipped with heat sensors, this group of citizen scientists were participating in a groundbreaking study: the first ever street level assessment of heat in New York City. The goal was to find differences in neighborhoods – which communities were relatively cool? Which were sweltering hot? – and map the city’s heat inequality. Continue reading...",

        "description": "At Prior Lake High School, the first day of classes started with a pep rally. The marching band played, there were speeches, games and orientation activities. It’s the loud start to the school year. But in other ways, the first day was intentionally quiet. In high school, only ninth grade students were invited to attend on Tuesday. And in middle school, only sixth grade students showed up.“We know the importance of that transition from sixth into middle school and from ninth into high school,” said Dan Edwards, Prior Lake’s director of teaching and learning. The district, in a suburb south of the Twin Cities, is among the many in Minnesota spending extra time and care at the start of this academic year focusing on mental health and social emotional learning. For Edwards, it’s a focus meant to address the difficulties students and educators experienced last year when schools attempted to return to full time in-person learning.“COVID created a lot of disruptions, disruptions to routines and we don’t necessarily know the value of those routines until they’re taken away,” Edwards said. Last year was difficult for most Minnesota districts. Across the state, students, educators and families raised widespread and consistent concerns about mental health, as well as student behavior while at school. Tyler Koonce, a science teacher at Prior Lake, said his students last year struggled.“A lot of anxiety stuff, a lot of social anxiety, working with groups and just more of being a student and that organizational skill which was lacking,” Koonce said.Prior Lake High School science teacher Tyler Koonce poses for a photo in the school gymnasium on Tuesday.Ben Hovland | MPR NewsHe’s planning to spend a lot of extra time taking his students through time management, mental health and relationship skills. He’s also an advisor for LINK Crew, an initiative the district has championed to get freshmen connected to older students.Ryley Nordin, a senior at Prior Lake, plans to spend a second school year helping mentor younger students.Prior Lake High School senior and Link Crew member Ryley Nordin poses for a photo in the school gymnasium on Tuesday. Ben Hovland | MPR News“The freshmen just really, I could tell, appreciated having someone there to talk to,” Nordin said. “Last year one in my group said hi to me every time he saw me in the hall for the rest of the year. And that made my day and I could tell it made his day — just having a [familiar] face around the school.”Like Prior Lake, the Richfield district has a mentorship program connecting upper class students with ninth graders. But they’ve also invested extra time this summer training the adults in their schools to lead lessons in social emotional learning.Incoming freshmen compete in icebreaker activities at Prior Lake High School during a welcome rally.Ben Hovland | MPR News“We are teaching our adults that our young people need to feel safe, loved and cared for, and only when those two needs are met literally in their brains can they awaken that frontal lobe to activate learning,” said Christina Haddad Gonzalez, Richfield’s director of student services. Richfield is one of many Minnesota districts to receive a grant from the Minnesota Department of Education to address disciplinary practices. In the Richfield district, there’s data to show students of color are targeted for discipline at higher rates than white students.  SurveyMN students learning more, but mental health concerns growingExpertsPandemic taking its toll on Minnesota students’ mental healthIn addition to funding professional development for staff, the district has handed out “safe space” kits to teachers at the start of the school year to encourage them to make a place in their classrooms for students who are overwhelmed to go calm down, regulate themselves, chill with a Rubik&#x27;s cube for a bit. New curriculum aims to teach kids how to handle conflict, make friends, and develop self-regulation skills. Richfield’s lead social worker Chantelle Vaughn said the early focus and investment this year on developing social and emotional skill may lead to a big payoff.“The hope is that being really intentional about those things will overall just make for a better school year,” Vaughn said. “The kids feel safe and heard, the staff feels safe and heard and everyone has the skills and the tools they need to be supported in this work.” ",

He lasted four innings and surrendered eight runs. \nThe offense picked up what the pitching was lacking. The Atlanta lineup tallied 13 hits and responded to nearly every defensive miscue. Matt Olson, in his first trip to Oakland since being traded, hit a three-run bomb in the third off of lefty Cole Irvin.\n\n\nWelcome back, Matty O!@mattolson21 | #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/b6c0WvryOp— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nOlson wasn’t the only Brave who came to hit. Vaughn Grissom strung together four hits and collected two RBI. Oakland’s starter was chased out of the game early, tossing just 4.2 innings after giving up nine runs.\nAfter a back-and-forth affair, the Braves secured their 85th win of the season and sit atop the NL East with the New York Mets, who dropped a game to the Pittsburgh Pirates earlier in the night.\nThe series continues this afternoon at 3:37 ET as the Braves look to pick up where they left off and take care of the A’s.\nBraves News:\nFirst impressions of Atlanta’s 2022 draft picks: Owen Murphy and JR Ritchie.\nOzzie Albies’ rehab assignment and a September MiLB update in the Road to Atlanta Podcast. \nMLB News:\nThe New York Yankees placed 1B Anthony Rizzo on the 10-day IL prior to today’s doubleheader.

        "description": "Sign up for Derek’s newsletter here.Last week, the National Center for Health Statistics alerted Americans to two facts about life and death in the U.S.The first fact was sadly unsurprising: The coronavirus pandemic killed so many people that U.S. life expectancy fell from roughly 79 in 2019 to 76 in 2021—the largest two-year decline in nearly a century. The drop was sharpest among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, whose life expectancy fell to 65, close to the national average during World War II.Life expectancy is perhaps the most important statistic on the planet, synthesizing a country’s scientific advances, policy errors, and social sins into a single number. The number is built on a weird hypothetical. The formula for life expectancy says: If Americans lived their entire life in one year—say, 2021—repeating it over and over again like an extended Groundhog Day experiment, how long would the typical person survive? It’s a useful exercise for the purpose of capturing one year’s conditions. But it imagines a life that nobody will ever live. U.S. life expectancy will almost certainly surge in 2022 and beyond, not only because the worst of the pandemic is over, but also because the disaster accelerated technology like mRNA vaccines that could raise life expectancy in future decades.The second fact was perhaps more alarming: The U.S. fared worse in life expectancy than other high-income countries. While most of the developed world saw conditions improve in the second year of the pandemic, more Americans died of COVID after the introduction of the vaccines than before their invention.Any explanation of this fact must begin with the American right’s bizarre rejection of the vaccines. During the Omicron wave, Americans were less likely to be vaccinated, less likely to be boosted, and significantly more likely to die of COVID than just about all peer nations. “People don’t think of blood-pressure medication as a political act, but due to the misinformation from some media and elected leaders, Americans saw vaccines as a political statement rather than a health decision,” says Joshua Sharfstein, a vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.The American mortality mystery clearly goes much deeper than the pandemic, however. The U.S. suffers from a raft of local epidemics that have turned America into the death trap of the wealthy world.Before the 1990s, average life expectancy in the U.S. was not much different than it was in Germany or the United Kingdom, as I’ve reported. But according to a paper comparing U.S. and European mortality, American babies are more likely to die before they turn 5; American teens are more likely to die before they turn 20; and American adults are more likely to die before they turn 65. “Europe has better life outcomes than the United States across the board, for white and Black people, in high-poverty areas and low-poverty areas,” says Hannes Schwandt, a Northwestern University economist and co-author of the paper. Despite our extraordinary wealth, innovation, and panoply of glittering appliances, Americans overall suffer from something like a lifelong death premium.Some of the most immediate causes of America’s high death rate are guns, drugs, and cars. The U.S. has more guns and gun violence than any other rich country. We have more drug-overdose deaths than any other high-income country—both overall and on a per capita basis. Even before the pandemic, life expectancy in the U.S. declined for consecutive years in 2015 and 2016, largely because of the opioid epidemic and drug overdoses. The U.S. has a higher death rate from road accidents than Canada, Australia, Japan, South Korea, and the European Union. Even on a per-miles-driven basis, the U.S. still has a higher death rate than much of Europe.So how can we fix the problem? In recent months, I’ve been researching an abundance agenda, and I can see at least two places where more abundance could, in a roundabout way, lead to more longevity: housing and preventive care. (I know, when all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail, but sometimes, nails really are everywhere.)In the past few decades, the lack of housing in and near America’s most productive cities has pushed middle-class families farther away from the best-paying jobs. Among other things, this has increased commute times for people who drive to work. Americans are in their cars more than the citizens of any other OECD country, and the price of driving is paid in more than just vehicle deaths. The frequency of long commutes and the absence of walkable areas might explain why Americans are world leaders in the category of sitting on our butts. One pedometer analysis found that the typical American barely takes 5,000 steps a day. This was significantly fewer than residents of other countries in the study, including Australia (9,695 steps), Switzerland (9,650 steps), and Japan (7,168 steps).When you combine all of this sitting with America’s array of calorie-dense food options, you get another feature of American exceptionalism: our obesity rates. At 40 percent among adults, the U.S. obesity rate is double the average of most European countries and eight times higher than Korea’s or Japan’s. Although the precise relationship between weight and health is contentious, the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund has stated bluntly that America’s obesity levels are responsible for roughly one-fifth of deaths among American adults ages 40 to 85. One should neither reduce obesity to a function of walking nor reduce America’s sedentary lifestyle to its inability to build sufficient homes in and near urban areas. But more homes built near central business districts would likely reduce driving times and hopefully increase total aerobic activity.If America’s housing shortage makes us less healthy, America’s doctor shortage ensures that treatable illnesses go unchecked and lead to more expensive cases. The U.S. has fewer general practitioners per capita than most rich countries, in part because our long and expensive medical education encourages doctors to become highly paid specialists. And along with this lack of affordable and accessible primary care, we have the highest rate of avoidable deaths of any rich nation. (Examples of the OECD’s definition of “avoidable” mortality include deaths related to alcohol, shootings, accidents, and influenza.) Expanding the number of primary-care physicians would reduce the chances of treatable conditions, such as moderate hypertension, blooming into costly maladies, such as heart disease.This has all been quite gloomy, so let me end with two somewhat optimistic observations. The U.S. has world-class health care in some categories, such as cancer treatments. American men have the lowest rate of deaths from prostate cancer among rich countries, due in part to aggressive screening. And breast-cancer mortality rates are falling faster in the U.S. than in similar nations. These facts suggest that the U.S. is not utterly incompetent but rather selectively competent, and that if we refocus our health-care policies on certain tangible outcomes, we can improve quickly.  Another stunning fact is that immigrants to the U.S. live as long, or longer, than just about any group of people in the world. In fact, foreign-born Americans live so much longer than native-born Americans—seven years longer for men, and 6.2 years longer for women—that immigration alone accounted for roughly half of America’s total life-expectancy gains from 2007 to 2017.What’s this about? Maybe self-selection bias among immigrants makes them more conscientious than the typical native-born American. Maybe they are more likely to move to urban areas, like New York City, that have more walking, less smoking, and generally healthier behaviors. Maybe some combination of foreign-born habits and U.S. health-care coverage is a good formula for a long life. I truly don’t know. But I’d like to.America’s unusually high mortality rate is our national shame. It ought to be our national obsession.\r\nWant to discuss more?

        "description": "Illustrations by Joan WongNo revolutionary posters line the streets, “flaming from the walls in clean reds and blues,” as they did when George Orwell left Barcelona to fight in the Spanish Civil War. Nor can you hear loudspeakers “bellowing revolutionary songs all day and far into the night,” as Orwell did in 1936. Instead, gathered in a basement on a quiet, tree-lined street, the Belarusians preparing to leave Warsaw to join the Ukrainian army look more like a bunch of computer programmers getting ready for a long car trip.Maybe that’s because they are a bunch of computer programmers—or anyway, some of them are—gathered in a basement on a quiet, tree-lined street, getting ready for a long car trip. Canned food, dried sausage, and bags of nuts and raisins are neatly stacked on the floor beside a pile of backpacks. A couple of SUVs are parked just outside. The cars have been donated by Polish or Belarusian sympathizers, or else were left behind by others who have departed for the front. The group I am meeting will be leaving for the Ukrainian border in an hour, and they are speaking with me on the condition that I don’t take pictures and don’t ask for names. If they are identified, members of their families could be visited, harassed, even arrested by the Belarusian police. “Our relatives are hostages,” one of them told me. Already, mothers of Belarusian soldiers fighting in Ukraine have been forced to make public statements denouncing their children.I can tell you that they are young, in their 20s and 30s, and that they are on their way to join the Kastus Kalinouski Regiment, a military unit founded in March as a part of the Ukrainian army but with a separate, Belarusian status. I can also tell you that, appearances to the contrary, they and their leaders are thoroughly grounded in the international history of armed rebellion. They know their 19th-century antecedents: Kastus Kalinouski fought in the failed 1863 uprising against the Russian occupation of what was then the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. They know their 20th-century antecedents too, among them not just Orwell in Spain but Józef Piłsudski, a Polish general who fought with the Austrian army in 1914 because he hoped, eventually, to liberate Poland. Although Kalinouski was executed and Orwell’s cause ultimately failed, Piłsudski marched his Polish Legions into Warsaw. By 1918, he was the leader of independent Poland. The men in the basement are going to Ukraine both because they are, like Orwell in Spain, sympathizers with another country’s democratic cause, and because they hope, like Piłsudski in Poland, to eventually liberate Belarus from the dictatorship of Alexander Lukashenko, who has been in power for nearly three decades.[From the August 1923 issue: Józef Piłsudski, Aristocrat-Revolutionary]Hope is tempered with realism—they are headed for the front line of one of the most brutal wars of the 21st century—and bolstered by desperation, the feeling that other, better roads to political change have disappeared. K, a man in his 20s—floppy blond hair, green T-shirt, ripped shorts—told me he had begun his career working in a government office in Minsk, but quickly realized what that meant. “Your work, everything that you do, is to make sure that the Lukashenko regime remains in power,” he said. During a series of mass protests following a stolen election in 2020, a moment all of them call “the revolution,” K and a friend distributed leaflets with slogans criticizing the regime. The friend is now in prison, serving a four-year sentence (K tells me his name; later I find it on a list of political prisoners). After Russia invaded Ukraine, K was racked with guilt, unable to sleep, angry that the failure of the Belarusian revolution meant that Russian rockets could be launched at Ukraine from Belarus. “I understood that we have an obligation to go to Kyiv,” he says. “And afterwards, we will go to Minsk.”We didn’t finish our revolution, we didn’t remove Lukashenko, we didn’t prevent Russian troops from crossing our border to attack Ukraine—all of these are reasons, now, to fight in Ukraine. A long-haired man, R (one of the computer programmers), told me that he, too, took part in the 2020 demonstrations, and that he, too, left Belarus afterward. But then R returned home for a visit. What he saw shocked him. People had stopped protesting: “People aren’t fighting. This life”—he means life under the dictatorship—“is enough for them.” How can they just go on as if nothing is happening, as if rockets are not flying? “To me it’s surreal.”Most of the men I spoke with have other options; they could have good lives outside Belarus if they wanted to. B, wearing a white T-shirt printed with the slogan INSPIRE, revealed halfway through our conversation that he speaks good English, and we switched from Russian. He has family in the U.S., and has been there several times (“Bay Area … Yosemite National Park …”). His dream was to watch Woody Allen playing jazz in New York, but on the night he went to Café Carlyle, Allen wasn’t there. He describes himself as a “digital nomad”—“or maybe better to say international homeless”—and has been traveling around Europe for the past few years. He, too, works in the world of computers, but he has wanted to fight in Ukraine since the war began. In March, “it was very cold, and I was very scared.” Although “I am still scared,” he said, those “emotional videos,” watching them one after another, over and over again, “month by month, week by week,” finally persuaded him to sign on with the Kalinouski Regiment.Want to hear more from Anne Applebaum about Russia’s war on Ukraine? Join her, George Packer, and Franklin Foer at The Atlantic Festival, Friday, September 23. Register and find out more here.K, R, and B might all be roughly described as Minsk intellectuals. Their leaders, organizing papers in the next room, tell me that among the volunteers are also recent high-school graduates, factory workers, ex-policemen. Some arrive in Warsaw on overnight buses from Belarus with no money and no plans, other than to join the Ukrainian army. On the front gate of the Kalinouski Warsaw headquarters is a sign with a phone number, in case volunteers show up when no one is around. How do they know where to go? “Everyone knows,” one of them told me.I was also told about much rougher recruits, including former criminals, though I didn’t encounter any myself. One of the exiles who staffs the Warsaw recruitment office put it like this: “Certain kinds of people are drawn to the idea of weapons, fighting.” Several former members of the Belarusian military and security services are also known to be fighting with the Ukrainian army, some in the Kalinouski Regiment and some in other units. Slowly, they are linking up with one another, and with sympathizers elsewhere. On August 9, a congress of the unified Belarusian opposition appointed Valery Sakhashchik, the former commander of a legendary paratrooper unit in the Belarusian army, as the effective minister of defense in exile; I spoke with him while he was in a car, driving to Ukraine for his first formal meeting with the Kalinouski Regiment. Sakhashchik left Belarus six years ago—it was impossible “to be a free person” there, he told me—and has been running a successful construction firm in Poland. He thinks the regiment might not yet be important militarily, “but it is important emotionally, because a lot of people believe it represents the future of the Belarusian army.”Whether they make contact in advance or just appear on the doorstep, whether their background is in the military or at a university, all of the volunteers go through a verification process. Pavel Kukhta, the head of the Kalinouski Warsaw recruitment office (and one of the few people who has been public about his association with the regiment), told me that Belarusian kiberpartizanti—cyberpartisans—have hacked most of the databases used by the Belarusian KGB and can check whether residential, educational, and professional information is genuine. If it’s not, the men get sent on to the border anyway, where Ukrainian border guards will stop them and question them further. What happens after that to those who have given false information, Kukhta doesn’t know.[Anne Applebaum: Russia’s war against Ukraine has turned into terrorism]Kukhta doesn’t know a lot of things. He won’t say where the new recruits will be training, or where they will be sent afterward. He can’t say with any precision exactly how many of them are already fighting (“hundreds”). The less you know, the less you can accidentally reveal.Even putting aside the need for operational security, Kukhta, who has been fighting with the Ukrainian army since 2016, originally in the Donbas, is clearly a man of few words. For this role, he doesn’t need many. A couple of times while I am talking with the new recruits, he comes into the room where the men are waiting. He collects their passports, checks their names. There are no inspirational speeches and no drama: Everyone here has already made their decision and accepted the consequences. When I leave, they are lining up in the garden.The next time I see them—or I think I see them—is a week later, in a scraggly field behind a parking lot in a suburb in central Ukraine. New recruits, perhaps including some I met in Warsaw, are dressed in camouflage, carrying weapons, and, in a nod to my presence, wearing balaclavas to hide their faces. Their uniforms were crowdfunded or donated by sympathizers in both Poland and Belarus. Their guns came from the Ukrainian army. Their trainer is from one of the Baltic states. He is particularly valued by the Belarusians because he has passed several NATO courses, and they want to learn to fight like NATO soldiers. One of the many ironies of the current moment is how many opponents of Putin’s Russia, from the Baltic to the Black Sea (and indeed all the way to Central Asia), share Russian as a common language and can use it to organize, even to teach American military doctrine, across national lines.I watch them with “Rokosh,” the alias of a man who has been part of different Belarusian-democracy movements since the 1990s. He explains that today’s exercises involve training to fight in cities. On other days they go to the Ukrainian army’s shooting ranges, or practice trench warfare; the field has been dug up for that purpose. They follow a strict schedule—morning exercise, all-day training, films or lectures in the evenings—and live together in a run-down dormitory nearby.Rokosh earlier joined me for a longer conversation in an unremarkable basement bar with three other Belarusians associated with the regiment or with the Belarusian opposition. All of them belong to a different generation from the men in the field. They have watched the rise and fall of various opposition movements and leaders since 1994, when Lukashenko first came to power. They watched his regime turn from the soft authoritarian rule of a collective-farm boss into a vicious, violent autocracy that tortures political prisoners and allows the Russian army to launch missiles into Ukraine from its territory. They remember the Soviet Union, and they do not want their country to become part of a neo-Soviet empire. What they want instead, one of them told me, is “a radical change in the political system, legal system, economic system, and deep reforms of the entire society to bring Belarus to the principles of democracy and the rule of law.” But they do not believe the current regime will disintegrate peacefully.Like everybody else in the post-Soviet world, Rokosh and the other men have read Gene Sharp, the philosopher of nonviolent revolution and civic activism who died in 2018. They admire his ideas, but they don’t think they apply to their situation anymore. Nonviolence was tried in Belarus. It failed. “Flowers and demonstrations could not change this situation,” one of them says, so it is time to try something else. They tell me about partisan underground movements inside their country—one of them is called “Flying Storks”—which have, they say, racked up a few minor victories, including a drone attack on the headquarters of OMON, the Belarusian riot police, in Minsk. They also say they have distributed clandestine training videos designed to help people counter the tactics of the riot police: “The people’s right to revolt is justified because all civilized methods of changing the situation were exhausted,” one said. Even so, the Russian invasion of Ukraine was a turning point, a different level of threat, a shock to the system, a “spit in the face.” If Ukraine does not win, one of them told me, “we will have to say goodbye to any idea of a free Belarus.”\r\nIllustration by Joan Wong. Sources: Raúl Moreno / Laski Diffusion / PeterHermesFurian / Getty.\r\nThey aren’t the first to draw that conclusion. In the very early days of the war, inspired by another piece of history—the Belarusians who blew up railway lines and train stations to stop the Nazi advance into the Soviet Union in the early 1940s—a group of Belarusian railway workers, helped by the kiberpartizanti, sabotaged some of the Russian trains carrying soldiers and supplies to the front. They mixed the signals, snarled the tracks, took down the computer system, damaged equipment. One group of saboteurs came under police attack while setting fire to a signaling box. A Belarusian Telegram channel, “Belaruski Gayun,” also helped by providing constantly updated information from anonymous subscribers on troop and equipment movements along the border, allowing Ukrainians to prepare. The channel is still going, and is still read carefully by those guarding the territory of northern Ukraine.The members of the Kalinouski Regiment are motivated by a belief that the Belarusian regime is both much weaker and much more dangerous than many assume. Lukashenko, they argue, is deeply unpopular. They reckon that no more than 10 to 20 percent of the population supports him—mostly pensioners, bureaucrats, and security-service employees who depend on the state for jobs in a failing economy—and he knows this. Lukashenko has no ideology, but he will do anything to stay in power. That means that when Russian President Vladimir Putin threatens, as he did at the end of June, to transfer nuclear missiles to Belarus, the world should pay attention. Putin might want to avoid the geopolitical consequences of using nuclear weapons for the first time since 1945—but Lukashenko might not care.Putin could also force Lukashenko to send Belarusian troops to fight in Ukraine, but that kind of decision could have unintended consequences. Kukhta, Rokosh, and the others all say their regiment has been contacted directly by soldiers and officers now serving in the Belarusian army who want instructions on how to surrender if they are ordered to cross the border into Ukraine. Kukhta, the man of few words, gave them blunt advice: “Put your hands up and your weapons down.” He predicts that the majority of the Belarusian army’s tanks and trucks would wind up in the control of the Ukrainian army. Although there is no way to verify that claim, at least one Belarusian border guard has successfully escaped to the Ukrainian side already, declaring that he wanted to join the fight against Russia. Sakhashchik, who also predicts that the majority of ordinary soldiers would not fight, made a video appeal back in February, calling on Belarusian soldiers not to join the invasion: “This is not our war. You will not defend your homeland, home, or family and will not receive glory—only shame, humiliation, and death.”The Kalinouski fighters think Belarus has another kind of significance too. After all, if the Russian leader wants to reunite Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine into some kind of neo-Soviet empire, Lukashenko’s loyalty is a necessary ingredient. But what if the Belarusian pillar disappears? Then everything else—the empire, the war with Ukraine, Putinism itself—might crumble as well. This, they want the world to know, is an opportunity that should be taken, not least because, as one of them put it, “Lukashenko is easier to unseat than Putin.” Right now nobody other than the Poles and of course the Ukrainians is assisting the Kalinouski fighters. But maybe someday others will. Rokosh tells me that he wants the fighters eventually to get access to better Western and NATO intelligence about what goes on inside their country so that they can plan their next steps better. The Biden administration’s warnings last autumn about the coming war in Ukraine convinced many people across Eastern Europe, Belarus included, that the Americans know a lot more than they let on. Alongside Gene Sharp, the fighters have also read Charlie Wilson’s War, the book that describes how, in the 1980s, a single congressman persuaded Washington to help the Afghans overthrow their Soviet occupiers. If it happened once, maybe it could happen again?Before I leave the scruffy field, I watch the volunteers get put through their paces. They are walking in groups of three, one behind the other, as if they were in an occupied city. Some of them are slow and awkward, giving the impression that this is the first time they’ve ever held a gun. Some move faster, seem more experienced; one of them told me back in Warsaw that he’s had some police training, and I wonder if he is one of the men moving lightly, adeptly, across the field. Several other people, including a young woman, are watching from the sidelines, listening intently to the words of the Baltic trainer. One of them has a Cossack haircut—shaved head, except for a ponytail—and arms covered in patriotic tattoos.The trainer turns on heavy-metal music, and that adds a bit more drama to the scene. The sun beats down on the suburb, and I begin to feel bad about the balaclavas. The trainees repeat the same exercises over and over again. Rokosh explains that the idea, as with all military training, is for these moves to become automatic, instinctive. Computer programmers, high-school graduates, government bureaucrats, and maybe the odd thief must learn in just a few weeks to react without thinking when they are attacked.However wearisome the exercise might be, this is the easy part, the predictable part. They will train, they will prepare, they will be sent to the front—all of that, they know. What they don’t know is the true nature of the historical moment they inhabit, or how it will end. They have made a bet, but is it the right one?Here is one more story told to me by the group in the basement bar: In 2021, a few members of the Belarusian underground started communicating clandestinely with some senior Belarusian officers who said they were ready to oppose the regime. After many months of conversation, the partisans finally agreed to travel outside the country, to Russia, in order to meet them; the officers said they didn’t dare do so at home but could not travel abroad anywhere else. The meeting was a trap. As soon as the Belarusian-underground leaders arrived, they were all arrested and imprisoned.I hear the historical echo in the story, as do the Kalinouski fighters. In the winter of 1945, 16 officers of the Polish resistance, all veterans of the struggle against Hitler, began to communicate clandestinely with Ivan Serov, the Red Army general who had just arrived to run the occupation of Poland. Convinced he wanted to help, they arranged to meet him in March. But it was a trap. They were all arrested, flown to Moscow, and imprisoned in the Lubyanka, the Soviet Union’s most notorious prison, where three of them eventually died.That story unfolded at a moment of maximum Soviet strength, when the Second World War was mostly won, the Yalta Agreement had already divided Europe into spheres of Soviet and Western influence, and no outsiders—not the British, not the Americans—were in a position to help the Poles. In 1918, by contrast, Piłsudski liberated Warsaw from czarist occupation at a moment of maximum Russian weakness, when the Bolshevik revolution had begun, the Russian army had collapsed, and Europe’s other imperial autocracies, in Germany and Austria-Hungary, were failing as well.But is this 1918, with Russian power waning? Or is this 1945, when it is finally consolidating? The Belarusians don’t know, of course, but they want to influence the answer. In the bar, I asked the men if they are waiting for the right moment to return home. “We are not waiting for the moment,” one of them corrected me. “We are working on creating the conditions” that will make the right moment arrive.They believe that if they lean hard on the scales of history and help the Ukrainians win, then both Russia and its Belarusian satrap will be far weaker. They could pay a high price—not just with their time and effort but with their lives. On June 26, the commander of one of the Belarusian battalions died during the battle for Lysychansk. Ivan Marchuk, alias “Brest,” was 28. Others have also been killed, wounded, or captured.But if they don’t fight, they might pay another kind of price: If Ukraine loses and Russia is empowered, then Belarus will remain a dictatorship, and they will never be able to go home. Those of us who live in luckier countries, with better geography, don’t know what it feels like to have a choice between fighting and exile, but all of the people sweating in this field truly do. Back in Warsaw, one of the volunteers told me that since leaving his country in 2020, he had done nothing but move from place to place, trying to make a different life but never really finding a home. Belarus is his only home, but before he can return there, he has to help change it. “I run. And I run. And I run. I would like to stop running.”This article appears in the October 2022 print edition with the headline “The Kalinouski Regiment.” When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

        "description": "Injuries keep piling up for the New York Yankees at just the wrong time. First baseman Anthony Rizzo is headed to the 10-day injured list, the latest health-related setback for a banged-up team trying to hang onto first place in the AL East. Rizzo is hampered by headaches the Yankees think are related to an epidural injection he received to alleviate lower back pain. He was expected to resume baseball activities Monday, then Wednesday, before the club decided Tuesday to place him on the IL. The roster move will be made Wednesday.“I don&#x27;t think it&#x27;s anything back-related now,” manager Aaron Boone said after Tuesday night&#x27;s scheduled game against Minnesota was postponed because of rain.“I think they’re trying to get their heads around just why exactly it’s happening,&quot; he added. &quot;Once he gets up and moving, he can’t do much.”Ronald Guzmán will be called up from Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre to help fill in at first base for Rizzo, who is batting .225 with 30 home runs, 71 RBIs and an .832 OPS. The 27-year-old Guzmán is a .227 career hitter with 31 homers in 243 major league games with Texas from 2018-21. He smashed three home runs in a game at Yankee Stadium on Aug. 10, 2018. The left-handed-hitting Guzmán was batting .260 at Triple-A with 12 homers, 39 RBIs and an .823 OPS.“He made a huge impression on me in spring training. I really liked what I saw,&quot; Boone said. “And then the reports have been that really for about a month and a half now he&#x27;s been swinging the bat really well. He&#x27;s hurt us over the years in small bursts.”Rizzo is far from the only important player ailing for the Yankees, who began the day five games in front of Tampa Bay and 5 1/2 ahead of Toronto after leading the AL East by 15 1/2 games on July 8. Boone said slugger Giancarlo Stanton (left foot) and infielder DJ LeMahieu (toe) were not going to play Tuesday if the game hadn&#x27;t been rained out. Stanton fouled a ball off his foot in Monday&#x27;s 5-2 win over the Twins and later left the game. He was feeling better Tuesday, according to Boone, but the manager said neither Stanton nor LeMahieu is sure to play Wednesday. Left fielder Andrew Benintendi had surgery Tuesday to repair a broken bone in his right wrist. Benintendi was injured on a swing Friday night, but the Yankees have said it&#x27;s possible he could play again this year.“For three, four months we were largely quite healthy. We&#x27;ve taken our lumps in the injury department here lately with obviously some key guys, but that&#x27;s part of it. And opportunity knocks for other guys to have a chance to step up and impact us while we&#x27;re trying to get guys right and well,&quot; Boone said.&quot;I think there&#x27;s also some hopeful signs on the horizon that we are going to get a number of these key guys back in the mix, whether it&#x27;s in days, weeks or hopefully by the end of the year.”Right-hander Luis Severino, out since mid-July with a strained lat, is scheduled to make a rehab start Wednesday for Double-A Somerset. He&#x27;s expected to throw about 50-55 pitches and then either rejoin the Yankees or have one more minor league tune-up before returning. Severino is on the 60-day injured list and can’t be reinstated until Monday.“I definitely feel like he can impact right away,” Boone said. “We&#x27;ll see. We&#x27;ll make that call.”Tuesday&#x27;s game will be made up Wednesday as part of a single-admission doubleheader beginning at 3:05 p.m. Yankees ace Gerrit Cole (10-7, 3.28 ERA) was pushed back a day to Wednesday&#x27;s nightcap. Domingo Germán (2-3, 3.12) will pitch the opener for New York. Cole gave up a career-high five homers in 2 1/3 innings June 9 at Minnesota. The Twins plan to call up local kid Louie Varland to start the opener in his major league debut. The 24-year-old right-hander was born in St. Paul, Minnesota, where he went to Concordia University before getting picked by his hometown team in the 15th round of the 2019 amateur draft. Varland is 1-1 with a 1.69 ERA and 27 strikeouts in 21 1/3 innings over four starts for Triple-A St. Paul. He went 7-4 with a 3.34 ERA in 19 starts and one relief outing for Double-A Wichita this season. Right-hander Joe Ryan (10-7, 3.88 ERA), who had been slated to start Tuesday, goes in the second game. Minnesota entered the day a game behind first-place Cleveland in the AL Central. The Guardians played later in Kansas City.",

        "description": "The woman identified in court papers as Esther (far right) was among Haitian migrants who say they were threatened by Border Patrol agents on horseback last September as they tried to return to a makeshift camp in Del Rio, Texas.PAUL RATJE/AFP via Getty ImagesIn the chaos of a squalid migrant camp in Del Rio, Texas, last year, Esther was desperate. Her 15-month-old son was sick and hungry. There wasn&#x27;t enough food in the camp, so she went back across the river to Mexico to buy some. When she tried to return to the camp on the Texas side of the river, Esther says, she was threatened by Border Patrol officers on horseback. &quot;There were horses, and the way they were talking to us, asking questions and riding up to us, telling us, &#x27;Go back to Mexico. Go back to Mexico,&#x27;&quot; she said by phone in Haitian Creole through an interpreter. Photographs and video of Border Patrol agents on horseback trying to corral a crowd of Black migrants sparked outrage all the way up to the White House. Nearly a year later, some of those Haitian migrants have found their way to safety in the United States — but thousands more have not. And advocates say no one has been held accountable for how they were treated by immigration authorities in the camp in Del Rio, or in the months since. Esther is not the woman&#x27;s real name, but NPR is using it because that&#x27;s how she&#x27;s identified in a lawsuit filed last year on behalf of a group of Haitian migrants who were in Del Rio. Like many of the migrants, Esther says she traveled there from Chile, where she&#x27;d been living with her husband and son.She was among roughly 15,000 Haitian migrants who crossed the border illegally within a few days of each other last September and found themselves confined in a squalid camp on the banks of the Rio Grande. Esther says she tried to get medical treatment for her son, who was suffering from fever and diarrhea, in the Del Rio camp. But she says medical staff there gave her only water and syrup that didn&#x27;t seem to help.  The incident involving Border Patrol agents on horseback prompted an internal investigation by U.S. Customs and Border Protection. &quot;Not everyone&#x27;s going to like all the findings,&quot; said CBP commissioner Chris Magnus when he announced the findings at a news conference in July, &quot;but the investigation was comprehensive and fair.&quot;Investigators found no evidence that the agents on horseback struck any migrants with their horses&#x27; reins, &quot;intentionally or otherwise.&quot; But their report concludes that some officers on horseback used &quot;unnecessary&quot; force and verbally abused the migrants. &quot;There is no justification for the actions of some of our personnel, including unprofessional and deeply offensive conduct,&quot; Magnus said at the time.A disciplinary review board recommended action against four Border Patrol agents, Magnus said, although no details about their punishment have been announced.But Haitian migrants and their advocates say that report is not credible, because investigators didn&#x27;t talk to a key group of witnesses: the migrants themselves. &quot;I was shocked when I received word that the report was coming out and when I read the findings,&quot; said Nicole Phillips, the legal director of Haitian Bridge Alliance.The organization, along with other advocacy groups including the Justice Action Center, is suing the Biden administration on behalf of Esther and other migrants. CBP investigators included filings from that lawsuit as an exhibit in their 500-page report. But Phillips says they never contacted or interviewed the migrants directly.Phillips says the official report contains some important inaccuracies. For example, she says, Border patrol agents did strike migrants with their horses&#x27; reins. She&#x27;s also disappointed that investigators focused only on the incident with the horse patrols, while basically ignoring the squalid conditions in the camp. &quot;There was no investigation into that,&quot; she said. &quot;The lack of food, the lack of water, the lack of medical care. And that&#x27;s what&#x27;s also really disappointing.&quot;In the confusion at Del Rio, several thousand migrants were released directly into the United States. Thousands more were deported to Haiti, including two of Esther&#x27;s sisters, who had also been in the camp. Once Esther and her husband understood what was happening, they had to make a choice. They could still try to ask for asylum in the United States. But they didn&#x27;t want to risk being deported to Haiti, where she said her life had been threatened because of her family&#x27;s political connections. &quot;What we were thinking was we couldn&#x27;t go back to Haiti because of the problems we knew were happening in Haiti,&quot; she said. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want to get deported, and that&#x27;s why we chose to go back to Mexico.&quot;Esther and her family decided to cross the river back into Mexico, where they received medical treatment for their son, as well as legal help. Months later, they were allowed into the United States to seek asylum. They&#x27;re now in Florida, living with her husband&#x27;s family. But they know that many other Haitians weren&#x27;t so lucky. The United States has deported more than 20,000 people back to Haiti since last September, though the pace of deportation flights has declined sharply since June. &quot;That was hard really because when you think about all the effort you made to get there and it&#x27;s just gone,&quot; said a man who&#x27;s identified as Jacques in the lawsuit against the Biden administration. Jacques was also in Del Rio last year, hoping to apply for asylum. Instead he was deported back to Haiti. Now he&#x27;s hiding in the countryside to avoid the gang that drove him to leave the country in the first place, and says he only travels at night to avoid attention. &quot;Day by day things are getting worse,&quot; he said by phone in Haitian Creole through an interpreter. &quot;When you think things are getting better, things get worse. But, you know, we have to be resilient because there is nothing else we can do. We can just be cautious.&quot;Jacques says he&#x27;s just trying to survive until he can find a way to get out of Haiti again. Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "The O.B. Curtis Water Treatment Plant in Jackson, Mississippi, shown late last month. Jackson is currently struggling with access to safe drinking water after flooding caused a disruption at a main water processing facility.Brad Vest/Getty ImagesThe crisis that has hit Jackson, Miss., highlights the fragility of water systems across the country that will be increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change in the coming years.As rainfall of historic proportions flooded Mississippi&#x27;s Pearl River, a key pump at the O.B. Curtis water treatment plant, which provides the capital city with its drinking water, was unable to keep up, causing a severe drop in water pressure. Some 150,000 residents were left without safe drinking water. Although water pressure has been restored, a boil-water notice remains in effect.Historic flooding and record droughts are already stressing water systems across the country, but as the threats to infrastructure posed by climate change intensify, experts warn that what happened in Jackson may be just the beginning.&quot;The situation in Jackson is a cautionary tale, but the reality is that in 2022, communities across our country have experienced severe flooding as well as drought,&quot; says Mami Hara, the CEO of US Water Alliance.Hara blames climate change and systemic disinvestment in water infrastructure across the country. &quot;It&#x27;s a huge issue and it&#x27;s got lots of different dimensions,&quot; says Steven Buchberger, a professor at the University of Cincinnati&#x27;s College of Engineering and Applied Science.He says facilities that &quot;are decades old and have been neglected&quot; are often especially vulnerable to the challenges posed by climate change.&quot;In many instances, communities didn&#x27;t really do the proper maintenance that was required to keep updating the infrastructure,&quot; he says.In Jackson alone, some estimates put the cost to repair the city&#x27;s water system in the billions. But that is still just a fraction of the challenge on the national level. A 2020 study estimates that $2.2 trillion needs to be invested over the next two decades to address the infrastructure shortfalls. Much of it will need to come from the federal government, according to the study.Some cities have already been forced to adaptEven so, some water providers across the country have sought to anticipate the need to update infrastructure in the face of extreme weather events and have taken steps to cope with the new reality. When Central and South Florida experienced a major &quot;100-year&quot; drought in 2000 and 2001, people living in those areas experienced a critical shortage in their water supply.&quot;The drought really pushed us to diversify,&quot; says Tirusew Asefa, a system decision support manager for Tampa Bay Water, a regional wholesale drinking water utility. The event, he says was &quot;a turning point&quot; for the city of Tampa. &quot;Everybody came together,&quot; Asefa says. They decided that the city&#x27;s reliance on groundwater and surface water was not going to be enough. What emerged from that discussion was a bold option that was largely untried in the U.S. Officials decided to go for desalination using a process known as reverse osmosis. They would pump seawater out of Tampa Bay, send it through high pressure pumps and force it through extremely fine filters, removing the salt in order to make it drinkable. The Tampa Bay Seawater Desalination Plant, which went online in 2007, now provides up to 25 million gallons of fresh water to the region each day, supplementing ground and surface water sources.Asefa acknowledges that desalination is an expensive and power-intensive process, but says climate change could force Tampa Bay Water to rely more heavily on it in the future. &quot;Going forward, I think we&#x27;ve almost exhausted the surface water,&quot; he says. &quot;The low-hanging fruit is just finished.&quot;Iowa City made changes after two historic floodsFor Iowa City, two major flooding events within 15 years – one in 1993 and another in 2008 – both exceeding the 100-year flood mark, were a watershed in thinking about the city&#x27;s infrastructure. During the 1993 flood, as the Iowa River swelled, &quot;It was a huge task&quot; to protect the water treatment plant, says Ronald Knoche, public works director in Iowa City. The same event swamped a water treatment plant farther west in Des Moines, leaving a quarter of a million people without drinking water. In an echo of what has happened in Jackson, the National Guard had to be called in to deliver bottled water to residents there.In 2003, the city moved its water treatment plant out of the flood plain. To ensure it could keep pumping in the event of a major flood, it now gets water from under the river, Knoche says.Signs reading &quot;2008 the year of the river, but the river will not win!&quot;&#x27; in June 2008. The flood that year served as a wake up call to the community about the vulnerability of its water infrastructure to extreme weather events.Joe Raedle/Getty Images&quot;They go out horizontally underneath the river bed. And then they draw the water down through the sands and the river bottom,&quot; Knoche says. &quot;Then we have the deep wells also as options for us.&quot;The historic flooding that arrived five years later, however, would underscore the relentless nature of the challenges that places like Iowa City face from climate change — even when they&#x27;re being proactive. The 2008 flood was considered a once-in-every 500-year event, causing the Iowa River to crest at about 31.5 feet and damaging or destroying 351 structures in the city. In the wake of that flooding, the city got $22 million dollar in federal funds to consolidate two wastewater treatment facilities in a location protected from future high water. Southern Nevada cashes in a climate insurance policyIn the past two decades or so, the water level in Lake Mead has been rapidly falling. The lake, formed by the Hoover Dam after its completion in the 1930s, is the largest reservoir by volume in the U.S. and a primary source of drinking water for the city of Las Vegas. It&#x27;s now down more than 170 feet, with a pronounced dark-light color variation on the rock faces, known locally as the &quot;bath ring,&quot; showing starkly where the water level used to be. In fact, the change is so profound it can be seen from space.&quot;In the early to late 1990s, early 2000, [we began] ... seeing impacts to snow accumulation in the Colorado Rockies, which ultimately runs off into the Colorado River system&quot; and feeds Lake Mead, explains Bronson Mack, a spokesman for the Southern Nevada Water Authority.&quot;We were also seeing the climate models [and] hearing from the climatologists,&quot; Mack says. Those models show that the already hot and dry area of Nevada would get hotter and drier, he says.Mack says the community took &quot;immediate and swift action to start reducing our water demands&quot; by implementing comprehensive water conservation programs and initiatives, including changes to codes that now ban grass in new developments.&quot;If it&#x27;s green and it is growing, at least in the Las Vegas area, it&#x27;s being irrigated,&quot; Mack notes.A bleached &#x27;bathtub ring&#x27; is visible on the banks of Lake Mead near the Hoover Dam last month. The ring is a stark indicator of how far the water level has fallen in the past two decades or so.Justin Sullivan/Getty ImagesAnother move has been to reduce the use of evaporative coolers in large buildings. Think industrial-sized swamp coolers. They use up a lot of water, he says.Normally, the region gets about four inches of rain a year. In 2020, it received less than half that, and this year is considered the second driest in 128 years.Climate change has placed an enormous strain on infrastructure, and despite being proactive to address the problem, it has been tough for officials in Nevada to stay ahead of the changes.One concern was that the water level in Lake Mead could fall so much as to leave the water intakes high and dry, causing a complete cut off of water. So, in 2015, construction began on a $650 million low lake level pumping station, which was completed in 2020. It&#x27;s was meant, Mack says, as an &quot;insurance policy.&quot;&quot;We hoped we&#x27;d never have to turn it on,&quot; he says.In April of this year, however, just two years after its completion, officials were forced to switch on the low lake level pumping station when one of the two primary pumping stations could not operate because Lake Mead&#x27;s water level had fallen so low.&quot;I think that for us here in the West, we are a bit of a canary in the coal mine,&quot; Mack says. &quot;Climate change is knocking on our door.&quot;  Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "Democrats are bracing for a nail-biter in Nevada’s Senate race, a true toss-up that could determine whether the party retains the majority in the upper chamber. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D), who served as state attorney general for two terms before in 2016 becoming the first Latina to win a seat in the Senate, is fighting to keep her spot as she fends off a bid from Trump-endorsed Adam Laxalt (R), a former state attorney general.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Cortez Masto has shown a competitive fundraising advantage, including raising more than double the amount Laxalt raked in during the second quarter this year, polling shows the Senate race will be close.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is the most important race on the map for Republicans or Democrats,” said one GOP strategist familiar with Nevada politics, later adding, “in Laxalt, you’ve got a candidate who can carry the change message very clearly, unify all clans in the Republican Party and is running a good race.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats also acknowledge the importance of this year’s race, noting Nevada’s history as a swing state. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Democrats have shown that they have the ability to get out the vote and win close races in Nevada,” said one Democratic operative. “The Cortez Masto campaign and Nevada Democrats are prepared for what they have to do this fall in order to be successful.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats have seen their fortunes improve when it comes to the Senate, with multiple nonpartisan election handicappers moving the race for the upper chamber in their direction in recent weeks. But even as the party grows more confident in high-stakes Senate races in Arizona, Georgia and Pennsylvania, the Silver State remains something of a wild card and, according to GOP strategist Colin Reed, “one of the best pick up opportunities for Republicans.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a sign of Nevada’s importance to Democrats, the party’s Senate campaign arm launched a new ad Tuesday as part of a $33 million spending campaign, targeting Laxalt over his abortion stance and previous comments he made in which he reportedly called the Roe v. Wade decision a joke.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ad, which Laxalt campaign spokesperson Brian Freimuth called “dishonest” and “wildly inaccurate,” comes against the backdrop of a midterm environment that has already proven how the issue of abortion is energizing voters. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nNevada will be a unique test of the issue’s resonance with voters, given that the state already has protections for up to 24 weeks after conception. A poll conducted last year by OH Predictive Insights found that 69 percent of Nevada respondents said they leaned “pro-choice,” while 31 percent said they leaned “pro-life.” Laxalt has said he doesn’t back a national ban on the medical procedure and acknowledged in a response following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade that “the people of Nevada have already voted to make abortion rights legal in our state.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the Democrats’ Senate campaign arm tied Laxalt to both former President Trump and those supporting the Supreme Court’s abortion ruling.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Laxalt has been the biggest cheerleader in Nevada for Donald Trump’s Big Lie and his political career has been defined by his opposition to a woman’s right to make her own health care decisions,” said Patrick Burgwinkle, a spokesperson for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. “He’s totally out of touch with Nevadans, and it’s why they’ll reject him in November.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLaxalt’s campaign, like many other Republican campaigns this cycle, is targeting his Democratic challenger over the economy and inflation. In a statement, Freimuth called Cortez Masto a “disaster for our economy.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Her rubber-stamp support for Biden’s big spending proposals saddled our state with 15.4% inflation, costing each Nevada family $10,000 this year. This is making day-to-day life unaffordable for Nevadans and they’re enthusiastic about an opportunity for a new direction,” Freimuth said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCortez Masto, on the other hand, has emphasized abortion on and off the campaign trail. Last year, the senator penned an op-ed in Elle Magazine in an effort to raise alarm on the issue. Her campaign says the issue has been an energizing one in Nevada since Roe was overturned in June. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“When it all came in, we saw a lot of energy on the ground,” said Josh Marcus-Blank, a spokesman for the Cortez Masto campaign. “It’s a constant source of concern for voters, mostly for women, who have been raising it.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe race will also be seen as a test of how well both candidates can court Latino voters, a critical voting bloc in the state. Data from the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials Educational Fund indicates that about 20 percent of Latinos in the state, or roughly 165,100 members of the demographic, are expected to vote in November. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nPolls show Cortez Masto, the country’s first Latina senator, narrowly ahead of Laxalt, but her tight lead among Hispanic voters could be a particular cause for concern for Democrats. An AARP-commissioned poll released last week showed Cortez Masto leading by 11 points among Hispanic voters when placed on a full ballot. Her lead drops to 9 percent among Hispanic voters over 50 years old. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe poll comes as Republicans work to appeal to Hispanic voters across the country after making gains with the voting bloc in Florida and Texas in 2020. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe GOP strategist familiar with Nevada politics pointed, for example, to the Laxalt campaign’s Spanish-language website and Spanish-language radio and TV ad buys, noting there were plans for Spanish radio and TV ads in the coming weeks. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The NRSC has invested early and often in battleground states across the country, including Nevada where we are seeing historic voter registration movement toward Republicans. Additionally, the NRSC has put unprecedented resources behind Hispanic outreach through our Operación ¡Vamos! initiative which is already paying dividends,” T.W. Arrighi, national press secretary for the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), told The Hill. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nCortez Masto’s campaign has also worked to reach the voting bloc, targeting Latino and Hispanic voters on air since March 15. Additionally, Somos Votantes, a Democratic-leaning group aimed at engaging Latino voters, has already knocked on 130,000 doors in the state, with a focus on Clark County. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We are making sure that we are not leaving a door behind,” said the group’s executive director Cecia Alvarado. “They have been put into the label that this is not a frequent voter, but we don’t believe in those labels. We believe in talking to our communities.”",

        "description": "The chief of the House Republican campaign arm is pushing back on the idea that the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade has given Democrats a boost, even as he warns colleagues that a GOP majority after the midterm elections is not a “done deal.” Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), in a Tuesday interview with The Hill expressed confidence the election will end with a GOP majority — though he refused to offer predictions on how big it might be.  \n\n\n\n“We have the candidates. We have the message. I will let the voters tell us how many,” Emmer said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEmmer recognized some Republicans have adjusted expectations about a GOP wave but downplayed worries about election handicappers like the nonpartisan Cook Political Report shifting seats in favor of Democrats. Cook shifted five races away from the GOP last week. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Anybody who’s been doing this long enough knows that what you see 12 months ago is not necessarily what you see as you come out of Labor Day,” Emmer said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nOperatives on the Democratic side have also said recent special election wins in Alaska and New York are signs that the environment is better than previously thought.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Emmer said that’s “wishful thinking” on the part of the House majority. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Special elections are rarely indicative of what happens in November, and I’m confident we’re going to win both those seats,” he said of the two races lost in recent weeks by the GOP.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe election, he said, comes down to one word: security.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s economic security. I mean, you’ve got families all across this country right now who are making difficult decisions about whether they buy groceries for the family, for their kids, or whether they fill the gas tank,” Emmer said. “And then you’ve got personal security … Democrats’ failed policies, defund the police nonsense, cashless bail, has made our major cities a war zone.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe also suggested a significant shift because of the abortion decision is a kind of fool’s gold for Democrats. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I would really push back,” said Emmer, who added that he was looking forward to seeing Democratic candidates defend their votes to make abortion legal. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said the bill passed by Democrats in the House went too far. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There are only two countries on the face of the planet that are that onerous with their abortion laws, and that’s China and North Korea,” he said, speaking about the House bill. “Again, I hope they center their elections on that one issue.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEmmer praised the GOP’s slate of candidates, saying that the NRCC has broken records on minority, female and veteran recruits. His confidence extends to candidates who were at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, like J.R. Majewski in Ohio and Sandy Smith in North Carolina, even as Democrats argue they are extremists.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I firmly trust every one of those candidates that has made it through the initial process to make their case, to be able to prosecute their case, why they are the best voice,” Emmer said when asked about Smith and Majewski.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs former President Trump stays in the headlines after the FBI seized classified documents from Mar-a-Lago, Emmer said that GOP candidates will focus on the issues important to their districts. He had no negative words to say about Trump. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Donald Trump has been a great ally of ours this entire cycle,” Emmer said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“When it comes to the Trump issue, I think most people recognize, even people who may not have been favorable towards the former administration, that the FBI has been after this guy from day one before he even became president,” Emmer said, arguing that the Mar-a-Lago raid “is generally making people more upset with their government.”",

        "description": "A potential nationwide freight rail strike is looming, threatening to cripple the U.S. economy ahead of the holiday shopping season and November’s midterm elections.  Roughly 115,000 rail workers could walk off the job as soon as Sept. 16 if they cannot agree to a new contract with railroads.  \n\n\n\nThat’s the first day workers could legally strike after a White House-appointed panel released collective bargaining recommendations aimed at ending years of contentious negotiations. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFive of the 12 unions representing rail workers have reached tentative agreements with railroads to enact the Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) recommendations, which call for 24 percent pay raises, back pay and cash bonuses. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the bulk of railroad workers belong to unions that haven’t yet agreed to a deal. It’s also unclear whether workers would vote to ratify PEB recommendations that don’t address their concerns about punishing hours and rigid schedules that make it difficult to take time off for any reason. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I would suspect that most railroad workers would love to strike, would love to get back at their employers after years of abuse while they watched the industry make record profits,” said Ron Kaminkow, an organizer at Railroad Workers United, which represents rank-and-file railroaders.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than 9 in 10 railroad workers would vote to reject the PEB recommendations and go on strike, according to a recent survey from the organization. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, Kaminkow noted that workers could change their minds when faced with the prospect of years of back pay and the reality that Congress can take away their main source of leverage at any time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFederal law gives Congress the power to block or delay a railroad strike. If workers were to walk out, lawmakers could vote to enact the PEB deal or appoint arbitrators to fast-track a new contract, among a range of other options.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Association of American Railroads, which estimates that a national rail shutdown would cost the U.S. at least $2 billion a day, said that lawmakers should vote to implement the PEB recommendations in the event of a strike to “instantly reward employees and reduce economic uncertainty.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts say that an extended walkout would devastate industries that rely on freight to transport grain, coal, diesel, steel and motor vehicle parts. Shipping containers would pile up at ports, severely congesting supply chains and sending prices soaring ahead of the holidays. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The railroads are actually very critical to the nation’s economy, and also to security. There’s a lot of hazardous stuff that simply can’t go by road,” said Nicholas Little, director of railway education at Michigan State University’s Center for Railway Research and Education. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Democrats are closely aligned with labor unions, organizers acknowledge that they likely wouldn’t allow for an extended strike just before the midterm elections. President Biden, who created the PEB in July to help resolve the contract dispute, is laser focused on unclogging supply chains.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“After the pandemic and supply chain disruptions of the past two years, now is not the time for more uncertainty and disruption,” a White House official told The Hill. “Now is the time for the parties to resolve their differences, before the nation’s economy begins responding to even the prospect of a nationwide rail stoppage.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile both unions and railroads say they want to avoid a strike, some see a work stoppage as the only way to win better working conditions. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the last six years, the top freight carriers laid off 45,000 employees, or nearly 30 percent of their combined workforce, according to the Surface Transportation Board. That left trains understaffed when demand picked up, leading to service disruptions and overworked crew members.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nWorkers complain that they often cannot secure time off, even for scheduled doctor’s appointments or family events, and are disciplined whenever they miss a day for any reason. They say they don’t receive sufficient notice or rest before starting a days-long shift that could take them hundreds of miles from home. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Emotionally, you’re just drained,” Robert Hollifield, an electronics technician, said at a railroad worker town hall hosted by the AFL-CIO’s Transportation Trades Department last month. “Every time the phone rings, you go into a minor panic wondering where you’re going to have to go and how long you’re going to be gone away from your family.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany workers saw this round of negotiations as a key opportunity to revamp those policies and were disappointed when the PEB recommendations largely ignored them. There’s a growing sense of resignation that even if they want to strike, Congress won’t let them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCongress last acted to end a rail strike 30 years ago. Most of today’s lawmakers and their top aides have never dealt with the issue before and have little knowledge of the process, likely giving industry insiders more influence.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and Trainmen and the International Association of Sheet Metal, Air, Rail and Transportation Workers said in a Labor Day statement that railroads “all but hide behind Congress” in their efforts to reject workers’ demands.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“While there are no guarantees for either side as to what Congress might do if they are involved, there is no doubt that the rail carriers expect Congress to intervene to save them from dealing fairly with their employees if there is a job action,” they said.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3631579-florida-judge-throws-trump-doj-curveball-with-special-master-decision/",
        "description": "The decision by a federal judge in Florida to grant former President Trump’s request for a special master is poised to shake up the investigation into his handling of highly classified documents while dragging out the polarizing fight.\n\n\n\nLegal experts say the decision is a major curveball in the Justice Department’s probe, which could delay it for at least a few weeks, and forces the agency to weigh whether and how to battle the decision.\n\n\n\nThe developments represent a win for Trump, who had pushed for the appointment of a third-party special master to review documents seized by the FBI after they searched his Mar-a-Lago property Aug. 8.\n\n\n\nIt’s a move that has upset a series of steady victories by a Justice Department that time and again has shown the magnitude of classified information stored at Mar-a-Lago, while shifting the cries of a politicized process from Trump’s backers to those perplexed by the ruling.\n\n\n\n“It throws a significant wrench in the government’s investigation. In fact, it shuts it down for the moment until further notice. And we’re in a ‘Mother may I?’ pose, where the government can’t do anything with the evidence that it’s seized until it’s blessed to do so, expressly authorized to do so, by this judge, which means that the investigation is essentially held hostage at the moment,” Jeff Robbins, a former federal prosecutor and congressional investigative counsel, told The Hill.\n\n\n\n“You have to assume that at Mar-a-Lago they are singing ‘It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas.’ ”\n\n\n\nThe decision is viewed as unusual and has triggered some criticism of District Judge Aileen Cannon, the Trump appointee who issued the order on Monday and who some argue appeared too solicitous of the former president.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It is unusual, but of course the whole underlying circumstances are unusual,” said Jack Sharman, a white-collar criminal defense attorney, of the order. “That sort of puts an asterisk, so to speak, on some of the impact of the decision.”\n\n\n\nCannon’s ruling was largely focused on the optics — arguing that “a commitment to the appearance of fairness is critical, now more than ever” — even if Trump gains little from the exercise.\n\n\n\n“Plaintiff ultimately may not be entitled to return of much of the seized property or to prevail on his anticipated claims of privilege. That inquiry remains for another day,” she wrote.\n\n\n\n“For now, the circumstances surrounding the seizure in this case and the associated need for adequate procedural safeguards are sufficiently compelling to at least get plaintiff past the courthouse doors.”\n\n\n\nCannon gave Trump and the Justice Department until Friday to team up, directing them to “meaningfully confer” and jointly submit a list of proposed candidates.\n\n\n\nBut beyond this week, it’s not clear how the timeline will play out.\n\n\n\nAn appeal from the Justice Department would likely add to the delay the investigation will now face, but without a court-imposed deadline, a special master’s work could also take weeks.\n\n\n\nStill, the blow from the ruling is one experts say the agency cannot simply stand by and accept.\n\n\n\nBarbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney who worked on the Justice Department’s transition under the Biden administration, said that Cannon’s order raises a number of questions, not least among them being the lack of clarity around her directive that investigators not use any of the search material they obtained until after the special master has finished his or her work.\n\n\n\n“To what extent is that direct utilization, or do you have to replace the whole investigative team?” McQuade asked. “To the extent people have reviewed it, you can’t unsee what you have seen.”\n\n\n\nMcQuade said the Justice Department could ask for more clarity in the next filing and potentially try to narrow the scope of her order.\n\n\n\nAny missteps on the investigative front carry serious risks for prosecutors working the case.\n\n\n\n“One doesn’t know how long the Department of Justice will be crippled, but for the moment it is crippled. If they do anything, directly or indirectly, with the evidence that they seized on Aug. 8, they run the very serious risk that a judge, perhaps this judge, will find that all of the evidence is inadmissible and has been tainted, as lawyers like to say, as fruit of a poisonous tree,” Robbins, the former federal prosecutor, said — undercutting any eventual case they may wish to bring against Trump.\n\n\n\nBut not all see the special master as a major disruption.\n\n\n\n“The government’s position is, it will have a considerable dampening effect on it in terms of time but that may be overstated,” Sharman said.\n\n\n\n“The order seems to contemplate a matter of weeks, not months, to get all this done.”\n\n\n\nThe order is also unwinding early victories for the Justice Department as filing after filing — many unsealed by judicial order — offered up details as to the strength of the case it was building from the Mar-a-Lago search, often making it more difficult for some of Trump’s usual defenders to offer their backing.\n\n\n\n“What it will do is feed the argument. The Trump team will say this just shows that a federal judge has found that the execution of the search warrant was politically motivated or was suspicious or was conducted in an unfair way. She hasn’t made, really, any of those findings. ... There has been no evidence presented to the judge of any kind, that the Department of Justice did anything wrong, at any level,” Robbins said.\n\n\n\n“But the ruling will absolutely be invoked by every Trump ally on conservative media as a vindication of these general lies, conclusory baseless attacks on the Department of Justice,” he added.\n\n\n\n“That’s unfortunate, because that actually does create a lack of faith in the system. And it’s an unwarranted lack of faith in the system.”\n\n\n\nTrump seemed to react to the development by posting to his platform Truth Social that it “takes courage and ‘guts’ to fight a totally corrupt Department of ‘Justice’ and the FBI,” without explicitly mentioning the ruling on the special master.\n\n\n\nMcQuade said the ruling itself “suggested a little bit of a favor” toward Trump by describing the FBI search of his property as “unannounced” and by describing Trump as in a “league of his own.”\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department requested a warrant only after it learned that even after a May subpoena, Trump’s legal team likely did not return all classified information the former president had in his possession after leaving office. In the course of the department’s search, agents found another 100 classified documents — noting in a briefing that in hours they were able to find twice the number of classified materials as Trump’s team did over weeks.\n\n\n\nMcQuade also said it was “highly inappropriate” for Cannon to issue a preliminary order saying that she was inclined to grant Trump’s request, before hearing the arguments.\n\n\n\nIn deciding whether to appeal the ruling, McQuade said Justice Department attorneys will need to weigh the potential for such a move to delay the investigation in such a way that they are not able to complete it before the end of President Biden’s first term.\n\n\n\nTrump is expected to mount another run for president, meaning it’s possible he could enter office without the investigation having been completed.\n\n\n\n“He could shut down the investigation or even pardon himself,” McQuade said.\n\n\n\nBrett Samuels contributed.",

        "description": "U.S. District Judge Aileen M. Cannon shot into the spotlight on Monday after granting former President Trump’s request for an independent mediator to examine materials the FBI recovered during a search at his Mar-a-Lago residence last month.\n\n\n\nCannon, who was appointed by Trump in 2020, made the divisive decision after hearing arguments from the ex-president’s lawyers, who pushed for the special master, and attorneys from the Department of Justice (DOJ), who said the former president’s claims of privilege were unwarranted.\n\n\n\nShe ultimately ordered that a special master be appointed to determine what seized materials are protected by attorney-client and executive privilege. The ruling also directed the DOJ to temporarily stop using the retrieved materials for “investigative purposes” in an effort to “uphold the value of the special master review” — effectively pausing the department’s investigation.\n\n\n\nCannon, who sits on the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, is now tasked with choosing a special master to sift through the more than 11,000 documents and asked both sides to provide a list of possible contenders for the job by Friday. The DOJ, however, can still appeal the ruling.\n\n\n\nHere are five things to know about Cannon.\n\n\n\nTrump appointed, bipartisan approved\n\n\n\nTrump nominated Cannon to the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in April 2020. At the time, she was an assistant U.S. attorney in the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of Florida, working in the criminal division of the appellate section.\n\n\n\nThe Senate confirmed Cannon on Nov. 12, five days after major networks called the 2020 election for President Biden, in a bipartisan 56-21 vote. Twelve Democrats supported her appointment, and 23 senators did not vote.\n\n\n\nDuring her confirmation process, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) asked if she had “any discussions with anyone — including, but not limited to, individuals at the White House, at the Justice Department, or any outside groups — about loyalty to President Trump.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCannon responded “no” in writing.\n\n\n\nMember of the Federalist Society\n\n\n\nCannon has been a member of the Federalist Society since 2005, according to a judicial nominee questionnaire she submitted to the Senate Judiciary Committee in April 2020. The group is made up of conservative and libertarian lawyers, law students and scholars.\n\n\n\nCannon said she joined the Federalist Society when she was a student at the University of Michigan Law School. She was asked during her confirmation process about why she joined the group.\n\n\n\n“I did so because I enjoyed the diversity of legal viewpoints discussed at Federalist Society meetings and events,” Cannon responded in writing.\n\n\n\n“I also found interesting the organization’s discussions about the constitutional separation of powers, the rule of law, and the limited role of the judiciary to say what the law is—not to make the law,” she added.\n\n\n\nSix of the nine justices currently sitting on the Supreme Court — all of whom were nominated by Republican presidents — are members of the Federalist Society, in addition to a number of GOP senators.\n\n\n\nCannon ruled in the Pelosi, Ocasio-Cortez threats case\n\n\n\nCannon is not new to presiding over high-profile litigation. In April, the federal judge sentenced a man to 18 months in prison for making threats against Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\n\n\nPaul Hoeffer, 60, pleaded guilty in February to interstate transmission of threats to injure and admitted to threatening to kill the two congresswomen in March 2019 and November 2020. He also threatened a district attorney in Illinois.\n\n\n\nBut the 18-month sentence from Cannon was significantly shorter than the 3 1/2 years of prison time prosecutors had asked for. And it was more than a year shorter than the minimum punishment under federal sentencing guidelines, according to The Palm Beach Post.\n\n\n\nHoeffer’s legal team requested a shorter sentence because their client was diagnosed with cancer.\n\n\n\nCannon had signaled support for a special master\n\n\n\nCannon’s ruling did not come as a total surprise — the judge days earlier said it was her “preliminary intent” to install a special master to sift through documents seized from Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\n“The court hereby provides notice of its preliminary intent to appoint a special master in this case,” Cannon wrote in a court filing on Aug. 27, before either side presented their arguments at a hearing.\n\n\n\nThe New York Times called the pre-argument signal “unusual.”\n\n\n\nIn that same filing, she also scheduled a hearing to take place at a federal courthouse in West Palm Beach, rather than the location in Fort Pierce, Fla., where she usually conducts business, according to the Times.\n\n\n\nFrom Colombia to the Southern District of Florida\n\n\n\nCannon — who was born in 1981 in Colombia — made a number of stops in the legal world before landing at the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida.\n\n\n\nAfter receiving a bachelor of arts degree from Duke University in 2003 and earning her juris doctor from the University of Michigan Law School in 2007, Cannon began clerking for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 8th Circuit in Des Moines, Iowa, where she worked for a year. The bench was Republican-appointed, according to the Times.\n\n\n\nShe then moved to Washington, D.C., to be an associate attorney at the corporate law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher LLP, where she worked for three years, before taking a job as an assistant U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Florida.",

        "description": "Tensions are growing between the agriculture industry's top Washington lobby group and some producers over an immigration bill that could make it easier to employ migrants in the food production industry.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) has expressed opposition to the House-passed Farm Workforce Modernization Act (FWMA), but many growers are eager for the Senate to take up the bill, which they say would help tackle food inflation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Throughout the development of the FWMA in the House, AFBF has pointed to several key areas in which the legislation conflicts with AFBF policy. Provisions concerning the [Adverse Effect Wage Rate Rule (AEWR)], the expansion of [the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA)] to H-2A [temporary agricultural visas], caps on year-round visas, and the inclusion of e-verify only for agriculture without adequately reforming H-2A first are the main issues of concern,\" an AFBF spokesperson told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAFBF director of government affairs Allison Crittenden&nbsp;told Politico&nbsp;in July that the bill’s expansion of MSPA protections to temporary migrant workers would expose ranchers and farmers to “frivolous litigation.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe MSPA protections, which would essentially allow migrant workers to sue over labor violations, are a major sticking point for Senate negotiations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut a new study by the American Business Immigration Coalition shows that MSPA lawsuits are uncommon — of 513,137 farms with hired workers from January of 2020 to July of 2022, only 34 farms were sued in 36 court cases.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat means that only 0.006 percent of farms have been party to such a lawsuit over the last two-and-a-half years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd the American Business Immigration Coalition study concluded that the potential increase in MSPA lawsuits would be negligible, as migrant workers under H-2A guest worker visas make up only 11 percent of the farm workforce.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, the FWMA is a study in competing political priorities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt its core, the bill is a compromise solution crafted between immigration reform advocates and representatives of rural, agricultural districts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe first House-passed version of the bill was crafted in part by moderates from both parties, like longtime immigration reform advocate Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart (R-Fla.) and former Rep. Collin Peterson (D-Minn.).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut it also paired progressive immigration advocates like Rep. Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.) and staunch agricultural district conservatives like Rep. Doug LaMalfa (R-Calif.).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSupport from diverse political backgrounds gave the bill's sponsors hope that it could cut through Congress's inability to find immigration compromise, but Democratic Senate leaders are wary of risking the bill to a filibuster vote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFew, if any, of the bill's supporters expect it to come to a vote before November's midterm elections — some are hopeful the Senate may vote on it during the lame duck session after the election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, frustration is growing, particularly as the Farm Bureau's opposition endangers an already-tenuous path to 60 votes in the Senate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"This is not a new issue for me and for and for my industry, agriculture. We've been in this for 20, 25, 30 years. And if everybody would give up a little bit about a little bit of what they want, then we will all get a lot of what we need,\" said Charles Wingard, vice president of field operations at WP Rawl, a major produce grower based in South Carolina.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bill itself balances the needs of migrant workers, large and small producers, long-term and seasonal workers, and of newly arrived foreign labor versus undocumented workers with years of experience on American farms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnder the bill, the guest visa process would be streamlined and many undocumented workers would get a chance to regularize their status, potentially taking the first step toward a path to citizenship.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile the need for a steady stream of qualified labor is a constant throughout the food production industry, there are a plethora of factors that affect the specific needs of farmers, distributors, packers and ranchers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor instance, dairy farms require year-round labor that's not covered by the seasonal visas, which means the dairy industry employs a disproportionate number&nbsp;of undocumented workers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother distinction is that producers on the East Coast are generally more likely to employ more recent arrivals who've applied to the H-2A program, while West Coast producers are more likely to rely on long-term undocumented employees.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile the bill's sponsors have long clamored to simplify immigration processes for agricultural workers, post-pandemic food inflation and food security concerns have added urgency to pass the bill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Now when you sit in an office in Washington within 30, 40 miles — you take a 30-mile radius around DC – with millions of people that can't feed themselves, they need rural America to be successful. They need U.S. farmers to have access to labor so we can continue to allow Americans to feed Americans,\" said Wingard.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Farm Bureau spokesperson said the lobbying organization shares that sense of urgency, with caveats.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"It’s important the Senate continues these bipartisan discussions to ensure a Senate ag labor solution does not include provisions that would harm American farmers and ranchers,\" said the AFBF spokesperson.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"There is a sense of urgency from Farm Bureau and other agricultural stakeholders to finally accomplish ag labor reform. However, it’s also critically important the legislation that is put forward in the Senate addresses these issues in a substantive manner,” added the spokesperson.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, many state and local Farm Bureaus are bucking the national group's opposition to the bill, citing different policy priorities between large, medium and small farmers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Any large organization, and the Farm Bureau is no different, is going to capitulate to the requests of its largest donors,\" said Shay Myers, the CEO of Owyhee Produce, an onion grower in Oregon and Idaho.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd national political sentiment plays a factor, as many congressional Republicans view immigration and the border as key electoral issues.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Republicans are keen to use immigration as a cudgel against Democrats ahead of November, often intermingling border and immigration policy, Myers said many of their constituents in agriculture see a clear division between the two issues.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"I feel like the Republican Party is maybe a little bit more right of center than the voting bloc that they actually are trying to represent,\" said Myers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd Myers warned that agriculture ultimately depends on the availability of a skilled workforce.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Without immigrant workers, without these ag workers, these guest workers, we don't put food on the American table. And that's just an open secret. And we need to realize that that's the case and fix the problem,\" said Myers.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "description": "Republicans are playing the blame game as they watch their chances of winning back control of the Senate shrink two months before Election Day.\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is citing “candidate quality” as a reason why GOP hopes are fading, an implicit criticism of former President Trump and his support for several controversial GOP candidates who are faltering in polls.\n\n\n\nTrump, for his part, for weeks has been setting the stage to blame McConnell if Republicans fail to win back the Senate at a time when they are widely expected to win the House majority.\n\n\n\nThe finger-pointing goes beyond the nation’s two most powerful Republicans, too.\n\n\n\nMcConnell’s remarks doubled as a not-so-subtle critique of the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) and its leader, Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), who has also been at loggerheads for much of the year with the Senate GOP leader.\n\n\n\nScott has come under scorching criticism himself for vacationing on a luxury yacht off the Italian coast during the August recess and for his expensive attempt to expand the NRSC’s online donor pool.\n\n\n\nUnder his leadership, the committee raised $181.5 million by the end of July but spent 95 percent of it, leaving it with far less cash on hand than the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC), according to a New York Times analysis.\n\n\n\nFor his part, Scott last week fired back at fellow Republicans “trash-talking our Republican candidates,” calling it an “amazing act of cowardice” and “treasonous.”\n\n\n\nIt’s not the best backdrop for Republicans to return to Washington, and senators getting back to work on Tuesday sought to play down the internal frictions.\n\n\n\nScott told reporters after the Senate GOP leadership meeting that his Sept. 1 op-ed in the Washington Examiner accusing fellow Republicans of undermining “the conservative cause” was not aimed at McConnell but instead anonymous Republican sources who have criticized Senate GOP candidates in the media.\n\n\n\n“I said people that do anonymous quotes to the liberal media,” he said. “People are doing anonymous quotes and trashing our Republican candidates.”\n\n\n\nAsked if he was referencing McConnell, Scott replied: “No.”\n\n\n\nOther Republicans in the meeting said&nbsp; McConnell and Scott did not talk about their public spat.\n\n\n\n“It’s a non-issue, everybody is focused on November,” insisted Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D.).\n\n\n\nOne Senate Republican strategist said Scott’s scathing criticism of Republicans was an attempt to deflect blame from his own track record.\n\n\n\n“He’s embarrassed he was caught on an Italian vacation 100 days from the most consequential election in a decade and he’s reaching for someone to blame other than his travel agent,” said the source.\n\n\n\nThe strategist said the Times’s in-depth report on the NRSC’s fundraising woes “raises more questions than anything Republicans have seen thus far” about the Democrats’ money advantage and called it a “serious cause for concern.”\n\n\n\nMcConnell declined to answer a question about his public clash with the NRSC chairman as he walked from the Senate floor to his office Tuesday afternoon.\n\n\n\nBut Sen. John Cornyn (Texas), one of McConnell’s deputies on the GOP leadership team, said he’s concerned that Democrats have substantially more cash on hand at the DSCC.\n\n\n\n“It concerns me a lot that Democrats are going to vastly outspend Republicans across the board, but as long as we have enough money to tell our story and defend our position, we’ll be fine,” he said, noting “there are multiple sources of funds for elections,” such as individual campaign committees and super PACs.\n\n\n\nCornyn, however, downplayed the public feud between McConnell and Scott.\n\n\n\n“I think we all want the same thing. We want to get the majority back and that’s what I’m focused on. And I think both of them, that’s what they both want to do,” he said.\n\n\n\nBrian Darling, a GOP strategist and former Senate aide, said Senate Republican powerbrokers are positioning themselves in case their battle to win back the majority falls short.\n\n\n\nHe said he couldn’t ever remember a Senate Republican leader and the Senate GOP campaign arm chairman engage in such open warfare before.\n\n\n\n“Seeing them battle like this, publicly, is not helpful,” he said. “Ultimately I think it’s a lot of noise with regard to what’s actually going to happen in the election, but it definitely makes Republicans look like they’re in disarray.”\n\n\n\nMore broadly, Senate Republicans are concerned that Trump’s legal troubles are consuming too much of the national spotlight, diverting public attention from what they want to make the 2022 midterm election about: President Biden’s economic record.\n\n\n\nThe polling and political handicapping website FiveThirtyEight now gives Democrats a 69 percent chance of keeping their Senate majority.\n\n\n\nPolitical handicappers now rate retiring Sen. Pat Toomey’s (R) Pennsylvania Senate seat as a likely Democratic pick-up because of the struggles of celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz, the GOP nominee.\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report rates the Pennsylvania Senate race as leaning Democratic, while FiveThirtyEight rates it as a likely Democratic win.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Republican candidates in other battleground states such as Arizona, Georgia and Ohio are seen as underperforming, either by making costly gaffes or falling behind fundraising expectations.\n\n\n\nIn Georgia, former NFL star Herschel Walker, the Republican Senate nominee, has committed a string of gaffes, such as a false claim that he had worked as an FBI agent and a head-scratching argument that federal money spent on limiting pollution will allow “our good air” to “float” over to China and be replaced by “China’s bad air.”\n\n\n\nWalker is one of several candidates, along with Republicans Blake Masters in Arizona and J.D. Vance in Ohio, who were backed by Trump. Plenty of Republicans will blame the former president’s influence if they fail to win back the Senate given high inflation and gas prices and Biden’s faltering approval ratings.\n\n\n\nGOP strategists still think they’re favored to win in Ohio and feel confident of their chances in Georgia, predicting that incumbent Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s voter mobilization work will help turn out Republicans and carry Walker to victory.\n\n\n\nBut the remarks by McConnell and Scott, along with Trump’s unceasing criticisms of his party’s Senate leader, signal the finger-pointing may continue if the GOP has a disappointing Election Day.\n\n\n\n“McConnell is basically hedging his bets in case things don’t go right,” Darling said.&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3631596-yellen-will-vow-to-rid-us-from-dependence-on-fossil-fuels-in-detroit-speech/",
        "description": "Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen will call out the fossil fuel industry in a Thursday speech on the Biden administration’s economic agenda to be delivered in Detroit, Mich., where oil and gas companies have long held influence in the U.S. auto manufacturing sector.  The visit to Detroit comes on the heels of the Democrats’ passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes $14.2 billion worth of subsidies for electric vehicles meant to wean the auto industry off of gasoline in an effort to reduce U.S. transportation emissions that are contributing to a rise in global temperatures. \n\n\n\n“We will rid ourselves from our current dependence on fossil fuels,” Yellen’s prepared remarks say.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Our plan — powered by the Inflation Reduction Act — represents the largest investment in fighting climate change in our country’s history. It will put us well on our way toward a future where we depend on the wind, sun, and other clean sources for our energy,” her remarks continue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYellen’s speech will also emphasize the role that private capital can play in addressing climate change, putting her generally in line with the economic, social and corporate governance (ESG) movement. The ESG movement in the financial sector pursues environmental and social equality objectives through divestment practices and getting board members with particular political views elected to company boards.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“By mobilizing private capital, the clean energy tax credits implemented by Treasury will propel our economy and workers to a leadership position in the fastest growing markets and technologies of today and the future, with positive spillovers to the rest of the world. And in the process of boosting domestic clean energy production, the law will support our energy security and insulate us from the type of fossil fuel-driven energy volatility that we’ve seen in the past year,” her remarks say.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublicans at the state level have been mobilizing to block ESG practices, which they view as harmful to their economies, with various initiatives in states like West Virginia and Texas that include a blacklist of financial firms that “[boycott] energy companies” and a request for documents from certain institutional investors on Wall Street.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTexas state Sen. Bryan Hughes (R), whose State Affairs Committee sent letters to asset management giant Blackrock and three other firms asking for information on ESG practices, said in an interview with The Hill that he is concerned about corporate power advancing a “left-wing agenda.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You know how it goes. Blackrock comes to Company X and says we own however many million shares in your company, and if you want us to vote for your directors and your compensation, then you better do what we say,” Hughes said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s one thing for that power to exist, but when we see a handful of firms control this amount of the stock market and we see them moving in lockstep using that power for this left-wing agenda, it’s just something we’ve never seen in America,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBlackrock previously stated it does not boycott fossil fuel companies, but CEO Larry Fink has said that he believes capitalism can change the way societies operate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Capitalism has the power to shape society and act as a powerful catalyst for change,” he wrote in a 2022 open letter to CEOs, adding that “companies perform better when they are deliberate about their role in society” and that “the relationship between a company, its employees, and society is being redefined.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, critics of ESG say that the institutional requirements of the private sector — namely, short-term returns on investment — make it a haphazard strategy for dealing with a problem as urgent and large-scale as climate change.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe main international proposal for emissions reductions to address climate change is a carbon tax — an idea that has repeatedly failed to gain political traction in the U.S.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut even economists who support the carbon tax, including Yellen, are still neglecting the role that direct public investment, rather than industry-specific private sector investments, should play in climate change mitigation, critics say.\n\n\n\n“These economists offer no support for increases in public investments in renewable energy and energy efficiency, thereby surrendering the power of the public sector, amounting to 35 percent of GDP in the U.S. and higher shares elsewhere, to push the clean energy transformation forward at the most aggressive possible rate,” University of Massachusetts economist Robert Pollin wrote in a 2020 book titled “Climate Crisis and the Global Green New Deal.”\n\n\n\nIn an interview, Pollin said that the IRA represents a step forward but is still too focused on the private sector.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The IRA is almost entirely geared toward incentivizing private investment. Between federal, state and local governments, we’re talking about $7 trillion of public spending. Why not take a tiny slice of that and do things like investing in, say, retrofitting every single public building to raise energy efficiency standards, or investing in 100 percent renewable energy to supply public buildings, or having public sector purchases of electric vehicles for public transportation significantly?”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTransportation sector emissions reductions resulting from the IRA constitute the smallest segment of reductions overall, beaten out by improvements in agriculture, electricity, industry and building technology, according to an analysis of the law by climate think tank Energy Innovation Policy and Technology.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the next eight years, transportation emissions are expected to drop due to the IRA by about 21 million metric tons’ worth of carbon dioxide, compared to a reduction of 610 million metric tons in the electricity sector and 113 million metric tons in the agriculture and waste sector, according to the think tank.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWall Street analysts say it’s still too soon to tell how the IRA will affect individual companies in the auto sector, since the legislation has yet to be interpreted by regulatory agencies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s too soon to say what impact the Inflation Reduction Act will have for Tesla,” analysts for Goldman Sachs wrote in a Monday note. “A lot will depend on guidance from the government about how the law will be interpreted. However, we note that the IRA does seek to encourage a North America based EV [electric vehicle] supply chain and Tesla has more local manufacturing than average.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We believe this will be a positive for Tesla to potentially qualify for at least partial credits on some vehicles over time (and Tesla could potentially benefit as well in our view from incentives for solar, batteries, charging, and commercial vehicles),” they wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile voting for the IRA, congressional Democrats from Michigan have expressed doubts about how exactly the EV tax credits meant to shake up the auto industry were designed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Let me say that the consumer tax credit was certainly not written in a way that I would write it or want it to be,” Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) said in an August briefing to local reporters in Michigan. “And I know Sen. [Gary] Peters feels the same way. There’s a lot of wonderful things in here for us on EV production and clean energy manufacturing, but this is the one area for me that was very, very concerning.”",

        "description": "Congress is staring down a critical stretch of time to cinch a funding bill to prevent a government shutdown before September comes to a close.Lawmakers are already armed with a list of political land mines they have to carefully navigate — from an energy permitting proposal to Ukraine and COVID-19 funding — or risk blowing past the Sept. 30 deadline. \n\n\n\nThey are again this year expected to pass a continuing resolution (CR), which would allow the government to remain funded at the previous fiscal year’s spending levels to buy enough time for a deal.\n\n\n\nSo far, the House has passed six of the 12 annual appropriation bills for fiscal 2023, which begins Oct. 1, but leaders have yet to indicate when they’ll bring the remaining funding bills to the floor or if it will happen at all.\n\n\n\nFunding talks are moving even slower in the Senate, where Democrats hold a slim majority and need GOP support to pass such measures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne issue that could stand in the way of a government funding bill has to do with a fast-tracking federal energy permitting agreement reached by Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and other Democratic leaders in exchange for Manchin’s support of a long-sought reconciliation bill that passed over the summer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA potential standoff could come in the form of Democratic leaders in the House facing pressure from liberals who are demanding the permitting agreement be kept out of a CR, arguing that it would weaken environmental reviews.\n\n\n\nAnd while a proposal by Manchin, aimed at speeding up energy projects that could set up a two-year maximum timeline for environmental reviews, enjoys some GOP support, it’s not guaranteed Republicans would vote to pass it as part of a CR.\n\n\n\nAs Republicans railed against a Democratic effort to pass their signature party-line reconciliation bill, dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act, over the summer, a few also vowed to withhold support for a short-term CR including any so-called sweeteners for Manchin.\n\n\n\nIn comments to The Hill on Tuesday, Manchin pushed back on claims he struck a “side deal.”\n\n\n\n“There was never a side deal. It was all part of it, it just didn’t fit in reconciliation,” Manchin said.\n\n\n\nEven if Democrats get the entire caucus to support the CR, 10 GOP votes are needed to bypass a filibuster.\n\n\n\nOther funding issues could also sideline government funding proposals.\n\n\n\nA White House request for more than $47 billion in emergency funding could make efforts to reach a bipartisan deal on a short-term funding bill more difficult. The request calls for $13.7 billion to help address the ongoing Russian invasion of Ukraine, as well as funding to bolster the nation’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, monkeypox and disaster relief.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have shown support in the past for Ukraine funding and disaster relief. However, previous Democratic-led pushes for coronavirus funding have hit roadblocks amid staunch GOP opposition for the lack of specified plans to pay for it. There has also been pushback by some vulnerable Democrats who saw certain proposals posing risks for winning back competitive seats in their primaries.\n\n\n\nAdding to the pressure in the Democratic-led Congress includes an end-of-month deadline for the Food and Drug Administration’s user fee program, as well as a shortage of legislative time in the current session to tackle outstanding priorities such as protecting same-sex marriage.&nbsp;",

Now, there are coaches for almost every aspect of our lives.\r\n\r\nDivorce, retirement, career, intimacy, leadership, weight loss, finance, you name it, someone says they can coach you through it.\r\n\r\nBut as a completely unregulated field, it's hard to know exactly what a coach offers and what makes them qualified to offer it.\n\nHilary Harper speaks with Dr Sean O&#8217;Connor and Carly Dober about the different iterations of coaching. With very few regulations and uniform training, there are quite a few approaches when it comes to coaching, such as cheerleading, advice, solution-focused and cognitive behaviour therapy. O&#8217;Connor touches on the history stemming from John Whitmore and the GROW approach. They discuss the limits of coaching and how it differs from working with a psychologist.  \nFor me this reminds me of the discussions around the rise of mindfulness.\n\nUltimately, in different contexts and communities, mindfulness will be defined differently, practised differently, and used toward different goals. But, while these divergent definitions and purposes remain unexamined, and until there is open, clear conversation about this, there is the risk of confusion and misunderstanding as programs are implemented and evaluated.\nChristopher T. McCaw, Winky Lee and Nicholas Van Dam https://www.aare.edu.au/blog/?p=13874\n\n\nIn both cases it feels like it is important to examine the purpose of the practice so that everyone is clear.The post 🎧 Should we be wary of so-called coaches?

Or they could acquiesce to the order in hope that a special master could swiftly review the core documents at issue, which could get the investigation moving again sooner.”",

        "description": "“I think that this order may be problematic, in that it allows the special master to review for executive privilege without really defining what that means. A special master doesn&#8217;t make legal decisions. A special master does sorting work… It&#8217;s really nonsensical to think that a former president can assert executive privilege against the executive branch. We have seen some courts recognize a residual privilege in a former president that can be requested and then asserted by the incumbent president, if he agrees, but only as to third parties, like Congress, when they&#8217;re asking for information.”\n\n\n\n— Former U.S. attorney Barbara McQuade, quoted by PBS.",

Obama loyalists are frustrated that Biden’s aides regularly boast of how they have avoided the mistakes of the Obama White House, such as failing to sufficiently tout the president’s accomplishments.”",

        "description": "Dan Brink\n    \n\n  The Yankees were rained out yesterday, but with two ahead today, we’ll check in on Game 136 anyway. Welcome back to the Aaron Judge Home Run Record Tracker! We’re taking a daily look at where Aaron Judge’s monster season tracks compared to some of the other historic single-season home run leaders in anticipation of Judge potentially joining their ranks. We’ll be going by Team Game because not every player’s seasons were in sync with the calendar days and everyone didn’t play all of the team’s games, which makes this our universal standard.\nThe Yankees didn’t play their scheduled Game 136 yesterday, but since they’ll play two today, we’ll go through how the rest of the field did in their respective Game 136’s and then hit Game 137 as scheduled tomorrow.\nAaron Judge through Game 135 of 2022: 54 HR\nThe Yankees didn’t play, so obviously, No. 99 did not homer. That said, as you’ll see with the results of the rest of the players on this list, even an off-day couldn’t lose Judge much ground in his chase of history.\nRoger Maris through Game 136 of 1961: 53 HR\nTeam Game 136: 9/3 — 1-for-4, 1 1B, 1 R, 2 K\nMaris wasn’t able to follow up his big game from the day before, managing just a single and a couple of strikeouts in four times at the plate. Instead, it was Mickey Mantle’s turn to surge, with Mantle putting together a two-dinger game of his own. Mantle remained three behind at 50 dingers, but stayed in contact with his teammate in the home run race.\nBabe Ruth through Game 136 of 1927: 49 HR\nTeam Game 136: 9/9 — 2-for-3, 2 1B, 4 RBI, 1 R, 1 BB, 1 SF\nNo dinger for Ruth today, though he had one of his best games of the year in which he didn’t go deep. Ruth had both a go-ahead and game-tying single at various points in the game, as the Yankees eventually pulled away to win 9-3 over the St. Louis Browns.\nBarry Bonds through Game 136 of 2001: 57 HR\nTeam Game 136: 9/1 — 0-for-1, 1 BB\nIt was mostly an off-day for the 37-year-old, who pinch-hit in the bottom of the eighth of a tie game and was promptly intentionally walked by Mike Hampton. Hampton would get the desired double play ball after the IBB, but Andrés Galarraga delivered a walk-off homer off Justin Speier the next inning to deliver San Francisco the win. Here’s a look at that one so that we don’t risk going through this whole article without footage of an actual dinger:\n\nMark McGwire through Game 136 of 1998: 54 HR\nTeam Game 136: 9/3 — 0-for-1, 1 K\nLike Bonds, McGwire only came up once in this game, but for a much different reason: McGwire struck out and blew a gasket in the batter’s box, getting himself ejected and costing himself precious plate appearances. McGwire had been arguing a strike call by umpire Sam Holbrook, who you may remember as the ump that made the controversial infield fly rule in the first NL Wild Card Game. McGwire actually defended Holbrook after the game, and was critical of the St. Louis crowd for littering the field with objects after the ejection:\n\nSammy Sosa through Game 136 of 1998: 53 HR\nTeam Game 136: 8/28 — 1-for-4, 1 1B, 2 K\nNo homer for Sammy, and thus all five of the players we’re monitoring in relation to Judge went homerless for Game 136. The Cubs did get a homer from Glenallen Hill on this day, so I’ll take the chance to link to a different Hill dinger, his iconic Wrigleyville rooftop home run from May of 2000:",

        "description": "Scores, news, and notes, from around the Detroit Tigers’ farm system for Tuesday, September 6, 2022. St. Paul Saints 2, Toledo Mud Hens 1 (F/9)(Gm 1)(box)\nThe first of two was a makeup game for a rainout back on July 17. Elvin Rodriguez pitched well, but the offense had a brutal day at the plate. The only run they managed came courtesy of Derek Hill and Josh Lester back in July.\nE-Rod the Younger tossed five innings of two run ball with no walks and six strikeouts. Way back in July, Derek Hill tripled and scored on a Josh Lester sac fly, and they didn’t add to that when play resumed on Tuesday afternoon. Jonathan Schoop and Andrew Lipcius had the only hits today, with Schoop’s a double as his rehab assignment moved to Triple-A today. \nSt. Paul Saints 1, Toledo Mud Hens 0 (F/7)(Gm 2)(box)\nThe second half of this doubleheader saw a bullpen day go pretty darn well, but the offense only managed three hits. Zack Short and Andre Lipcius each collected a double, while Schoop added a single and a walk.\nJoe Navilhon got the start and pitched three perfect innings with four strikeouts. Shea Spitzbarth took over to get five outs without a run despite a lot of traffice on the basepaths. Finally Angel De Jesus allowed the only run of the game in the sixth inning, and the Hens had no answer.\nSchoop: 1-2, BB\nLipcius: 1-3, 2B\nComing Up Next: The Saints will look to make it three in a row with RHP Ronny Henriguez (2-4, 5.94 ERA) on the mound. The Hens, will be improvising a bit again.\nAltoona Curve 8, Erie SeaWolves 1 (box)\nFortunately, the Bowie Baysox also lost on Tuesday night, but the SeaWolves lost an opportunity to steal the division lead as the two clubs stayed locked atop the division with only 11 games remaining on the schedule.\nSawyer Gipson-Long was rocked for five runs in 4.2 innings of work, taking the loss. Andrew Magno, an interesting lefty reliever we’ve been following more closely, was also knocked around in his Double-A debut giving up a pair of runs in relief. \n\n\nAndrew Magno was called up to Double-A today and he brought his hook with him. @Greg_Gania calls this strikeout.   pic.twitter.com/VlrDy3YRVa— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nThe SeaWolves got on the board in the bottom of the second when Quincy Nieporte led off with a walk. Dane Myers struck out, but Bryant Packard singled, and an error on the play allowed the runners to advance to second and third. Daniel Cabrera lifted a fly ball to center field for a sacrifice fly, as Nieporte scored, but it turned into an inning ending double play when Packard got caught too far off second base to get back in time. \nThe offense wouldn’t do much more in this one.\nMyers: 2-4, 2B, 2 SO\nRosoff: 2-3\nGipson-Long (L, 2-2): 4.2 IP, 5 ER, 5 H, 2 BB, 2 SO\nComing Up Next: No starters are announced yet for Tuesday night’s matchup at 6:05 p.m. EDT at UPMC Park.\n\n\nJust a hard single for Dane Myers, but as @Greg_Gania point out, that gives him a 15-game hitting streak.   pic.twitter.com/jAGEmiVwgX— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nWest Michigan Whitecaps 3, Great Lakes Loons 0 (box)\nThe Whitecaps opened their final series of the season at home with a victory. Their third straight win, coupled with two straight losses by Lake County, has the Whitecaps just a game behind them atop the Midwest League East with only five games left in the regular season. This is a good week to head out to Comstock Park to see Izaac Pacheco and Jace Jung try to lead their teammates to the second half division crown in a big game atmosphere.\nCarlos Guzman was excellent, closing out a strong second half with six innings of shutout ball with just two hits and a walk allowed, while ringing up six more strikeouts. Guzman’s WHIP is sub-.90 since the beginning of July. Now 24, he was in the wilderness for most of 2020 and 2021, but really got his control back over the past two months and has maintained pretty good strikeout rates. He may yet be worth tracking next season.\nThe Whitecaps put two on the board in the bottom of the first and never looked back. Carlos Mendoza led off with a single, and Ben Malgeri followed with one of his own. Jace Jung went the opposite way for an RBI single to score Mendoza and advance Malgeri to third, where Izaac Pacheco brought him home with a sacrifice fly to center. \n\n\nJace Jung hits it where they ain’t and Carlos Mendoza scores from 2nd to give the Whitecaps a 1-0 lead. @ThatDanHasty on the call. pic.twitter.com/wsB0nEUjqs— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nA sac fly from Izaac Pacheco makes it 2-0 Whitecaps in the 1st inning. @ThatDanHasty calls it. pic.twitter.com/e2cvEXl8yr— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Whitecaps got an add-on run in the fifth when Austin Murr led off with a walk. A pair of bunts moved him to third, and a wild pitch scored him. The bullpen kept the Loons off the board over the final three innings to lock this one down. The ninth inning did get dicey before reliever Jack Anderson got a fly out to put this one to bed. Here is the call from the voice of the Whitecaps’ Dan Hasty.\n\n\nJack Anderson gets the potential tying run to fly out to deep center and secure a huge win for the Whitecaps. @ThatDanHasty on the call. pic.twitter.com/E8b37eyD4y— Tigers Minor League Report (@tigersMLreport) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nMendoza: 2-4, R, SO\nJung: 1-3, RBI, BB, SO\nMurr: 1-2, R, 2 BB\nGuzman (W, 9-6): 6.0 IP, 0 R, 2 H, BB, 6 SO\nComing Up Next: The Whitecaps have yet to announce for Wednesday’s 6:35 p.m. EDT meetup with the Loons. \nLakeland Flying Tigers 4, Jupiter Hammerheads 2 (box)\nThe Flying Tigers fell behind early but poured it on eventually to take the first of six in Jupiter, FL on Tuesday. \nVeteran minor leaguer J.T. Hintzen allowed a pair of runs in three innings of work as the Hammerheads jumped out to an early lead in the third inning. However, RHP Ulices Campos shut them down for five solid innings to set up a comeback.\nIn the fifth, Dom Johnson led off with a single, and two batters later Peyton Graham ripped a triple to the wall in center field to score Johnson. In the sixth, it was Johnson, and then Cristian Santana with RBI singles as the Flying Tigers seized a 3-2 lead.\nIn the seventh, Manuel Sequera reached on an error to lead off, and Roberto Campos followed with a sharp single. Andrew Jenkins drew a walk, loading the bases, and a fly ball from Luke Gold scored Sequera, though Campos was caught trying to advance to third for a double play to squander the chance at a rally. Ultimately, they didn’t need any more.\nGraham: 1-4, RBI, 3B, BB, SO\nSantana: 2-4, RBI, BB\nCampos (W, 1-0): 5.0 IP, 0 R, 3 H, BB, 3 SO\nComing Up Next: It will be a 6:30 p.m. EDT start on Wednesday night. No starters are announced yet.",

        "description": "Photo by George Gojkovich/Getty Images\n    \n\n  A thrice-weekly digest, replete with #Cubs, #MLB, and #MiLB factoids, gathered from reputable sources. Oh, what could have been... the star-crossed Mark Prior. On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Bleed Cubbie Blue is pleased to present a light-hearted, Cubs-centric look at baseball’s colorful past, with plenty of the lore and various narratives to follow as they unfold over the course of time. Here’s a handy Cubs timeline, to help you follow along. We also include Cubs’ player birthdays and a bit of world history, for context.\nToday in baseball history:\n\n\n1889 -  In the most controversial game in American Association history, the Browns walk off the field in Brooklyn while leading, 4-2, in the ninth inning. They claim it is too dark to play, but the lighted candles in front of their bench by owner Chris Von der Ahe make umpire Fred Goldsmith determined to finish the game no matter what. Several St. Louis players are hit with bottles as they leave the grounds. (1,2)\n\n1918 - On one day’s rest, Hippo Vaughn gives up only seven hits, but Carl Mays wins a 2-1 duel. Wally Schang has two hits for Boston. Game three of the World Series ends with the Cubs’ Charlie Pick caught in a rundown between third base and home while trying to score on a passed ball. (2)\n\n1951 - In an 18-inning game with the Cubs, the Reds’ Lloyd Merriman records 12 putouts in CF, tying the National League mark. The Reds prevail, 7-6. The game is tied at 3-3 after regulation, but both teams score three runs in the 15th inning. Dixie Howell’s sac fly with the sacks full drives in the winner. (2)\n\n1984 - On his way to hurling a one-hitter, Doc Gooden fans Cub Ron Cey for his 228th strikeout, setting a National League rookie record. The Met phenom passes Grover Cleveland Alexander, who established the mark in 1911 with 227. The only hit is Keith Moreland’s slow roller in the 5th inning, which 3B Ray Knight fields but can’t get out of his glove. For Gooden, he will win another nine straight over the Chicago Cubs, lose, then win 12 straight. (1,2)\n\n1992 - Baseball commissioner Fay Vincent resigns three days after failing to receive a vote of confidence by the owners at a meeting in Rosemont, Illinois. (2)\n\n1999 - The Cubs and Reds split a pair with Chicago taking game 1, 2-1 and the Reds coming back, 10-3. When the Cubs Brian McNichol pitches in game 2, he is the 25th pitcher the Cubs have used this season. (2)\n\nCubs birthdays: Bill McAfee, Reggie Otero, Wade Rowdon, Mark Prior*, Wade Davis.\nToday in world history:\n\n\n1566 - Sultan Selim II succeeds to the Ottoman throne.\n\n1630 - City of Boston, Massachusetts, is founded.\n\n1888 - Edith Eleanor McLean is 1st baby to be placed in an incubator at State Emigrant Hospital on Ward’s Island, New York.\n\n1927 - Philo Farnsworth demonstrates the first use of his electronic television in San Francisco.\n\n1988 - Guy Lafleur, Tony Esposito &amp; Brad Park inducted in NHL Hall of Fame.\n\nCommon sources:\n\n(1) — Today in Baseball History.\n(2) — Baseball Reference.\n\n(3) — Society for American Baseball Research.\n(4) — Baseball Hall of Fame.\n(5) — This Day in Chicago Cubs history.\n\nFor world history.\n\n*pictured.\nThere is a very active baseball history community and there are many facets to their views. We strive for clarity. Please be aware that we are trying to make the historical record as represented by our main sources coherent and as accurate as is possible. No item is posted here without corroboration. Some of these items spread from site to site without being verified. That is exactly why we ask for reputable sources, so that we can address them to the originators.\nAlso please remember that this is supposed to be fun.",

That’s his 11th homer in 76 games this year, after he hit 14 in 97 in 2021. \nSalem, L 15-5\n\nBonaci, 2B: 2-5, 2B, 2 R, 1 K, 2 SB\nRomero, SS: 1-5, 1 RBI, 2 K\nLopez, DH: 0-4, 1 BB, 1 K\nAnthony, CF: 2-3, 2 RBI, 1 K\nMiller, 1B: 2-4, 1 R, 1 RBI, 1 K\n\n\n\nSena: 0.2 IP, 6 H, 8 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 1 K, 1 HR\nValera: 2 IP, 5 H, 4 ER, 3 BB, 2 K\nDe La Rosa: 4.1 IP, 6 H, 3 ER, 1 BB, 3 K\nCepeda: 2 IP, 0 H, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K\n\nDamn — eight runs allowed by Reidis Sena, with only one of them earned.

        "description": "Stephen Joseph theatre, ScarboroughSkipping between three generations from the 50s to the present, this occasionally poignant play pulls back from the emotional force of its conceptAt 83, Alan Ayckbourn is making the most of one advantage he has over nearly every other playwright: perspective. Where last year’s The Girl Next Door contrasted the war-torn Britain of his youth with the era of lockdown, his 87th play skips lightly across the last seven decades to present a thoughtful, occasionally poignant view of shifting generational attitudes to the home, to work and to the role of women.His conceit is to play three timeframes simultaneously in one upper middle-class living room. The space is delineated by an LED lighting strip on Kevin Jenkins’s set, switching from turquoise to beige to red as we move from 1952 to 1992 and 2022. At the most resonant moments, a parent from one era will stand unseen alongside the daughter from another time, emotionally present and physically absent.At Stephen Joseph theatre, Scarborough, until 1 October Continue reading...",

        "description": "A civil rights activist, a business owner, a lawyer, an engineer and the founder of a winery and his family were on the floatplane that crashed in the waters of Washington state&#x27;s Puget Sound, killing 10.The U.S. Coast Guard released the names of the victims early Tuesday. The body of one of the dead was recovered after Sunday afternoon&#x27;s crash, but the other nine remain missing despite an extensive search.The Northwest Seaplanes flight was on its way from Friday Harbor, a popular tourist destination in the San Juan Islands, to a Seattle suburb when it went down without sending out a distress call. The cause of the crash was not immediately known, but the Federal Aviation Administration earlier this year issued a safety directive for the type of aircraft involved.A team from the National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the crash of the DHC-3 Otter. At a Tuesday evening news briefing, Tom Chapman from the NTSB said investigators on scene wouldn&#x27;t speculate on a cause of the crash and crews were collecting information about the approximately 35-minute flight.Chapman said the agency is directing the search for the wreckage and sonar equipment was being used.The dead include pilot Jason Winters, activist Sandy Williams, winemaker Ross Andrew Mickel, his pregnant wife Lauren Hilty and their child Remy Mickel. Also killed were passengers Joanne Mera, Patricia Hicks, Luke Ludwig, Rebecca Ludwig and Gabrielle Hanna. The Coast Guard did not provide hometowns.Williams, from Spokane, Washington, was a lecturer, filmmaker, founder of the Carl Maxey Center and editor of The Black Lens, an African American-focused newspaper.“Sandy was a voice for the voiceless, a tireless advocate for marginalized people in Spokane, a journalist unafraid to speak truth to power, a builder of hope in her vision for the Carl Maxey Center, and a beloved friend to countless members of our community,” The Spokane County Human Rights Task Force said on Facebook.Thayne McCulloh, president of Gonzaga University, said the community lost a leader, teacher, activist and powerful voice.The Ludwigs, a couple from Minnesota, also perished in the crash. Luke Ludwig was an engineering leader with Arizona-based HomeLight Home Loans.“The entire HomeLight team extends our deepest sympathies to both Luke and Becca’s families, friends, and loved ones,” the company said in an email. “Luke was a deeply devoted father, husband, outdoorsman, and coach for his kids’ sports teams, known for his remarkable kindness and generous spirit.”Also from Spokane, Hicks was a retired teacher.Mickel was the founder of the Ross Andrew Winery in Woodinville, Washington.“We are deeply saddened and beyond devastated at the loss of our beloved Ross Mickel, Lauren Hilty, Remy and their unborn baby boy, Luca,” the Mickel and Hilty families said in a statement. “Our collective grief is unimaginable. They were a bright and shining light in the lives of everyone who knew them.&quot;The Washington State Wine Commission said in an email that Ross had &quot;an incredible impact on the Washington wine community&quot; and will be greatly missed.Mera was a business owner from San Diego, The Seattle Times reported. Her niece, Sami Sullivan, said she was visiting family in Seattle. She leaves behind three children and a husband of more than 30 years, Sullivan said.“Joanne Mera was someone everyone gravitated towards,” Sullivan said in a statement. “She was the life of any party and the soul of our family.&quot;Seattle lawyer Gabby Hanna was returning from a friend&#x27;s wedding when the plane went down, The Seattle Times reported.“She was a fierce, fierce young woman, in the best of ways,” her father, Dave von Beck, said. “There are no words to describe the pain.&quot;The Coast Guard ended the search for survivors Monday afternoon. The plane went down in Mutiny Bay off Whidbey Island, about halfway between Friday Harbor and its destination in Renton.The owner of the seaplane company was aboard one of two flights that took off on Sunday, Scott Giard, director of the U.S. Coast Guard’s search and rescue for the Pacific Northwest, said at a news conference.The owner told authorities he saw the other plane divert slightly off course and he tried to make radio contact but was unable to.“Shortly after that, he noticed on his flight tracker that the flight had stopped tracking and notified authorities,&quot; Giard said.Officials received reports that “the aircraft dropped suddenly at a fair amount of speed and hit the water,” Giard said.There was no distress call or distress beacon from the crashing plane, he said. The aircraft has an electronic locating transmitter onboard, but they have not received any transmission.Steven Wallace, former director of FAA Office Accident Investigations, said the NTSB will look at all other accidents with this type of aircraft, any safety directives and the company’s maintenance records as it tries to learn why the plane hit the water.“Early in the investigation every possibility is on the table,” Wallace said.One accident that will be of interest is the 2019 crash of the same model of floatplane in Manitoba, Canada, he said. A DHC-3 Otter with a pilot and two passengers was headed to Family Lake when the plane’s right wing came off. The aircraft took a nosedive into the lake, killing everyone onboard, according to the accident report.Following the lead of Canadian authorities, the FAA issued an Airworthiness Directive for these planes in March that required inspections of lugs, bolts and plates to ensure the wing strut is secure, according to the agency’s order.“Failure of a wing strut could result in a catastrophic in-flight breakup of the wing,” the report said.Coast Guard searchers found “minimal debris,” Giard said.Without a clear picture of the actual crash, and not knowing whether it exploded on impact or immediately sank to the sea floor, 150 to 200 feet below, it&#x27;s difficult to know what happened to the plane, he said.",

        "description": "Suseela Kandasamy, left, watches Montgomery County Board of Elections official Ruel Michelin hand her 13-year-old son, Aadhavan Muralidharan, an application to be a student aide to poll workers in Wheaton, Md.Amanda Andrade-Rhoades for NPRHelp is wanted at many voting sites around the U.S. as the general election season gets underway this month.In some communities, however, the ongoing COVID pandemic and current political climate are not making it easy to find paid and volunteer poll workers, forcing election officials to count on creative ways to staff up for democracy.For the 2020 elections, some longtime poll workers dropped out of the ranks because they needed to quarantine or faced higher COVID risks related to their age, according to a report by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission. Special campaigns urging voters to serve at polls that year helped many officials find workers who stepped up.This year, high school students, military veterans and lawyers are among the potential applicant pools some local and national recruiting efforts are targeting to make sure there&#x27;s enough staff to check in voters, issue ballots and process votes.Ruel Michelin talks to Keisha Tullonge about becoming an election worker at a recruiting table at the Westfield Wheaton Mall in Wheaton, Md. &quot;I have a son, and he&#x27;s African American,&quot; Tullonge says about why she&#x27;s interested in becoming a poll worker for the first time. &quot;I have to put forth the effort in helping to make change so he has a better life.&quot;Amanda Andrade-Rhoades for NPRBut making a call to serve can be tricky in 2022 with election officials and workers in many parts of the U.S. facing an unprecedented level of scrutiny — along with harassment — driven by election deniers.&quot;This is an unfortunate factor,&quot; said New Jersey Secretary of State Tahesha Way, president of the National Association of Secretaries of State. &quot;After 2020, we are now seeing an increased level of threats towards election officials and workers, which, of course, causes concern and hesitation for those who may want to serve.&quot;For Anil Nathan, though, it&#x27;s a source of motivation.The former U.S. Air Force captain co-founded the nonprofit organization We the Veterans, which has started a new project called Vet the Vote to encourage former service members to work at polling sites.&quot;I think a lot of veterans and military family members would feel the same way about helping to continue to protect and serve the institutions and the process that we wore a uniform to support in our previous lives,&quot; Nathan said.The American Bar Association is also trying to tap into its professional networks by bringing back the Poll Worker, Esq. initiative it used to promote poll working among lawyers and law students for the 2020 elections.Oulimata Toure and Codou Wade-Drakeford sign up to work the polls for the midterm elections in Maryland&#x27;s Montgomery County.Amanda Andrade-Rhoades for NPRIn the suburbs of Washington, D.C., Maryland&#x27;s Montgomery County Board of Elections has been focused on younger demographic groups. Local teenagers ages 16 and up can serve as poll workers, and kids as young as sixth graders can volunteer as aides to poll workers the night before and on Election Day, when the county&#x27;s public schools are not in session.The student aides are part of Future Vote, a program that Gilberto Zelaya, the community engagement and public relations officer for the county&#x27;s board of elections, started in 2004 in part to help out the workers stationed at polling places.&quot;They really like the fact that there&#x27;s this younger generation handing out &#x27;I voted&#x27; stickers, making sure that the signs are posted and that the tables are lined up,&quot; Zelaya said.Sometimes, aides get on the floor of polling places with blue painter&#x27;s tape to lay out arrows pointing voters toward the right direction.&quot;Our poll workers, especially our older poll workers, they prefer that the students do that as opposed to them because I&#x27;m 50 and my knees are starting to crack,&quot; Zelaya added.Codou Wade-Drakeford turns in her poll worker application as her 7-year-old daughter, Touty S. Drakeford, grabs onto her with her nephew Mouhamadou Tall and sister Oulimata Toure watching. &quot;I want to thank the country for allowing me to be part of the country,&quot; says Toure, who recently became a U.S. citizen and also applied to be an election worker.Amanda Andrade-Rhoades for NPRSixteen-year-old Danny Dominguez, though, had something else in mind when applying to be an election worker — a more exciting way to rack up community service hours for a graduation requirement in Maryland.&quot;I&#x27;ve always been interested in how the election process works. And so for the 25 hours, I get to see how people come in, sign up for the elections and vote,&quot; said Dominguez, who recently stopped by a recruiting table at a back-to-school fair held inside a mall parking garage.At the same event, Adaobi Oniwinde filled out an application herself and guided one of her sons toward one as well.&quot;Honey, I really want you to do this. This is the most important thing,&quot; Oniwinde said, eying 16-year-old Layi with a clipboard in hand.Layi Oniwinde, 16, fills out an election worker application as his mother, Adaobi Oniwinde, looks on with a smile in Wheaton, Md. &quot;I love the way the system here allows everybody to be involved,&quot; says Adaobi about the U.S. election system.Amanda Andrade-Rhoades for NPRThis year&#x27;s midterms will be the first U.S. general election Oniwinde&#x27;s children will experience while in the country, after years of living abroad.&quot;The beauty about the system here is the fact that you really can get involved at any level,&quot; Oniwinde said. &quot;People are going out with their kids. I love the way the system here allows everybody to be involved.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "Twin sisters Tripti and Pari, who lost both their parents to COVID-19, play at a relative&#x27;s home in Bhopal, India on May 11, 2021. A new study estimates that 8 million kids lost a parent or primary caregiver to a pandemic-related cause.Gagan Nayar/AFP via Getty ImagesA new international study estimates that from January 1, 2020, to May, 1, 2022, nearly 8 million kids age 18 and under lost a parent or primary caregiver to a pandemic-related cause. When the researchers included the deaths of secondary caregivers like grandparents or other older relatives, the number of kids affected rose to 10.5 million. That&#x27;s a big jump from the prior estimate of 5.2 million children who lost a parent or caregiver to COVID-19 from the start of the pandemic until Oct 31, 2021. The findings are &quot;heartbreaking and disturbing,&quot; says Susan Hillis, the main author of the new study, and a co-chair of the Global Reference Group on Children Affected by COVID-19 and Crisis, an international team that&#x27;s been tracking the indirect toll of the pandemic on children. Some nations are beginning to address these catastrophic losses with new programs that offer support to the bereaved families — although the U.S. lags in this effort. Why have estimates gone up?Asked why the numbers are far higher than previously thought, Hillis answers: &quot;Part of the increases are because we just have more accurate death data on which to model our estimates. And of course, the other aspect of the increases is that deaths have continued.&quot;The study, published in JAMA Pediatrics, also found that the greatest numbers of kids affected by these losses were in Africa and Southeast Asia. India has seen the most suffering, with 3.5 million children grieving the loss of a parent or primary/secondary caregiver. However, Bolivia and Peru have the highest rates of kids affected, with 1 out of every 50 children in both countries losing caregivers during the pandemic. These children face potentially devastating consequences. The emotional toll may be what people think of first but the impact hits many areas of a child&#x27;s life.&quot;This enormous bereavement is an economic loss,&quot; explains Lorraine Sherr, a psychologist at the University College London, and a member of the Global Reference Group, who wasn&#x27;t involved in the latest estimates. That&#x27;s especially true when the parent or primary caregiver who died was the main breadwinner in the family. A family&#x27;s loss of income can put kids at a higher risk of food and housing insecurity. If a child moves to a new community or family because of the death of a parent, &quot;it&#x27;s a separation,&quot; she says. &quot;And then there&#x27;s disengagement at school and then disengagement with friendships, with things previously that made them happy or helped them learn. So you have this kind of huge cascade of losses.&quot;Bereavement is one of the top predictors of poor outcomes at school, says psychologist Julie Kaplow, executive vice president of trauma and grief programs at the Meadows Mental Health Policy Institute. Studies also point to the lasting mental and physical health impacts from losing a parent or caregiver.&quot;It increases the risk of mental health problems, suicide, prolonged grief complications, sexual exploitation and abuse, even physical abuse of children,&quot; says Hillis. Finding ways to help bereaved childrenMany countries and organizations are finally recognizing the urgent need to help children and families deal with this loss, says Sherr.&quot;Some efforts are being put in place, especially in South Africa, in Eswatini and Kenya and Botswana,&quot; says Joel-Pascal Ntwali N&#x27;konzi, a co-author of the new study and a researcher at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Kigali, Rwanda. In South Africa and Eswatini, 1 in 100 children have lost a parent or caregiver. Sometimes the solution is in the form of cash aid. Providing cash payments to such families can ensure that families can afford school fees in countries where education comes with a price tag. N&#x27;konzi and his co-authors are hopeful that other countries will join these efforts. The World Bank is also looking into providing countries with funding for &quot;cash plus care initiative,&quot; says Sherr.&quot;That means that you provide the family with a stipend or a small cash injection, but you twin that with care — some kind of social support services, linking to school and education.&quot;These kinds of support programs would also connect bereaved families with grassroots organizations or nonprofits that can provide mental health care and psychological support to children and the surviving parent or caregivers.Past research on children orphaned by the HIV-AIDS epidemic shows that such efforts can buffer the impact of the trauma on kids, says Sherr, who has done research on this topic.&quot;We looked at educational risk, things like missing school, dropping school year achievement,&quot; she explains. &quot;We looked at emotional outcomes such as depression, stress, identity, anxiety, trauma. We also looked at positive outcomes like coping and resilience.&quot;She says projects that included cash transfer plus connection to community-based supports and services improved these outcomes among grieving children.However, there have been no federal efforts to address the crisis here in the United States, notes Rachel Kidman, a social epidemiologist who has studied the long-term impacts of the HIV-AIDS epidemic on children. The new study found that more than 250,000 American children had lost a parent or caregiver due to the pandemic as of May 1, 2022.And yet, says Kidman, who was not involved in the new research: &quot;I&#x27;m not seeing any concerted efforts or even a lead by the federal government&quot; to address the needs of these children.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3631195-when-big-was-not-bad-lessons-from-congresss-decisions-not-to-enact-antitrust-reform/",
        "description": "One of the most important decisions facing Congress as it returns from its recess is whether to enact legislation that would impose antitrust liability on large companies without requiring any showing of wrongful conduct. Members evaluating these proposals should remember that Congress has rejected similar efforts in the past. Prominent examples include the Concentrated Industries Act initiated by Lyndon Johnson to bolster his later-abandoned presidential reelection campaign, the Industrial Reorganization Act, first introduced by Philip Hart in 1972, and the congressional inquiry recommended by the Carter administration.\n\n\n\nAll of them would have found companies in violation of the antitrust laws simply for being persistently large. None was enacted into law for reasons that still resonate today.\n\n\n\nOne of antitrust law’s central conundrums is that companies can grow large and even achieve market dominance in one of two ways. On the one hand, companies often succeed because they are more innovative — that is, by building the proverbial “better mousetrap” or, in the words of the landmark Alcoa decision, “by virtue of superior skill, foresight and industry.” In other words, their expansion may be the result of successfully competing on the merits. Congress should design laws to encourage this type of conduct. On the other hand, a company’s expansion may be the product of harmful actions that deviate from the type of business rivalry that benefits all of society, conduct that the law should be designed to suppress.\n\n\n\nThe challenge is how to devise rules that separate the wheat from the chaff. Rules that penalize companies that succeed because of pro-competitive conduct that benefits society run the risk of discouraging them from undertaking the type of innovation that long has been the hallmark of the U.S. economy. To again quote the words of Alcoa, “The successful competitor, having been urged to compete, must not be turned upon when [it] wins.” Any other rule threatens to disincentivize precisely the type of innovation and entrepreneurial risk-taking on which our nation’s continued growth and innovative edge depends.\n\n\n\nAntitrust law traditionally has solved this problem by finding violations only when companies engage in conduct that causes harm through means other than competition on the merits. The precise contours of what falls within this category are a subject of enduring debate. \n\n\n\nWhat is so radical about the current antitrust proposals under consideration is that by removing conduct as a relevant consideration, they would punish companies without considering whether their size resulted from attempts to evade or frustrate competition or from the type of beneficial rivalry that drives economic growth. These proposals would render what normally would be the critical question would be rendered irrelevant, and consumers would pay the cost in higher prices and less innovation.\n\n\n\nIn short, enactment of these proposals would mark a return to the structuralist paradigm that held sway with courts through the 1960s and that based antitrust liability purely on companies’ size without considering the conduct that led to that structure. Thankfully, legislative efforts to enshrine that approach in statutes failed, allowing for its eventual rejection by the judiciary in favor of a conduct-based analysis better designed to foster business acumen and innovation. The structuralist school of thought has been disavowed by essentially every mainstream judge, scholar and antitrust advocate, and by the 1970s, support for it had collapsed.\n\n\n\nAny legal regime that treats large companies as violating the antitrust laws without any evaluation of their conduct would represent a return to a long-superseded perspective that all-too-often punished businesses simply for being successful. Enacting such legislation would ignore the negative effect on innovation that led Congress to reject similar proposals in the past. Worse yet, it risks removing a key cornerstone of U.S. economic success at a time when every American business is facing a global market that is becoming increasingly competitive, one in which countries skew the playing field in favor of their own companies.\n\n\n\nCongress would do well to heed the well-known admonition that those who forget history are doomed to repeat it and not to allow the heat of the “techlash” moment to overshadow lessons that are as important now as they were then. The innovation that serves as the foundation for our country’s future prosperity depends on it.\n\n\n\nChristopher S. Yoo is the John H.

        "description": "The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) is launching a mobile billboard around Pittsburgh reminding voters of the contentious GOP Senate primary in Pennsylvania as Republican nominee Mehmet Oz and former candidate David McCormick reunite for an event on Wednesday. \n\n\n\nThe billboard, which was first seen by The Hill, highlights McCormick’s criticisms of Oz during the primary earlier this year. \n\n\n\n“Has flip-flopped on every major issue we’re talking about in the campaign,” reads one McCormick quote hitting Oz.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother quote says Oz has been “part of the Hollywood machine for decades,” while another calls Oz a “phony” and accuses him of having “absolutely no credibility.” \n\n\n\n&nbsp;“As Oz and McCormick hold an event together, we’re happy to remind Pennsylvanians how McCormick really feels, in his own words,” DSCC spokesperson Patrick Burgwinkle told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOz and McCormick are set to appear alongside each other for a national security panel near Pittsburgh hosted by Trump-era State Department spokesperson under Morgan Ortagus. While the event is not a campaign event,  it marks their first appearance together since the contentious primary earlier this year. \n\n\n\nThe intraparty contest was marked by a myriad of attacks from the two Republicans. McCormick ended up losing to the celebrity doctor by less than 1,000 votes after a recount took place.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s now clear to me with the recount now largely complete that we have a nominee,” McCormick said when he conceded in June. “Tonight is really about all us coming together.”\n\n\n\nPennsylvania’s Senate race is gearing up to be one of the most closely watched races of the midterms. Oz is facing off against Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D) in the general election. Recent polling shows Fetterman leading Oz. The non-partisan Cook Political Report recently moved the race’s rating from a “toss-up” to “lean Democratic.” ",

        "description": "States and cities are trying to get ahead of an anticipated autumn and winter surge in COVID-19 infections with entreaties to the public to roll up their sleeves for the newest booster doses targeting the most infectious omicron spinoffs that are now in wide circulation.\n\n\n\nModified COVID-19 boosters developed by Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna, approved by the government last month, are designed to fortify immune responses against the BA.4 and BA.5 strains while remaining effective against the original coronavirus, according to scientists.\n\n\n\nThe Food and Drug Administration says the newest jabs are advised at least two months after getting the most recent booster or primary vaccination. The FDA approved Pfizer’s updated booster for anyone 12 and older and Moderna’s version of the booster shot for anyone 18 and older. The newest doses are expected to reach health departments, pharmacies and stores beginning this week. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention advises those who have contracted COVID-19 to consider waiting three months after testing negative before getting a tailored booster dose.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ CNBC: Where to find the new omicron-specific COVID-19 boosters, from Walgreens and CVS to local pharmacies and clinics.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: The White House stresses a need for additional COVID response funds from Congress as federal appropriations run low.\n\n\n\n▪ NBC News: New boosters look a lot like the old ones. Doctors worry that could lead to errors.\n\n\n\nJabs, which are free for now, will be available beginning Wednesday in Washington, D.C., throughout Maryland (locator info HERE), and in Virginia beginning on Sept. 14, for example (WUSA9).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany governors and public health officials throughout the country are working to spread the message about boosters (both the new and older versions) because they are still not widely embraced. To date, just 32 percent of the U.S. population chose to receive a booster dose to pump up immunity if they got an earlier jab, according to the Bloomberg News tracker.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“This new bivalent booster shot is another important tool in our toolbox,” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said last week. “While federal guidance has made it confusing at times for people to know if and when they’re eligible, everyone 12 and older will be able to get to this new shot.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, top White House health officials said the public will likely need annual COVID-19 boosters, which people can add to their appointments to obtain seasonal flu shots. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical adviser to President Biden who is leaving government in December, said it’s “becoming increasingly clear” that a COVID-19 jab will need to be received annually, assuming no “dramatically different variant” crops up (The Hill).&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Barring any new variant curveball,” said White House coronavirus coordinator Ashish Jha, “for a large majority of Americans, we are moving to a point where a single annual COVID shot should provide a high degree of protection all year.”\n\n\n\nBiden’s written invitation to get boosted was succinct on Tuesday: “Winter is not that far away. The past two years, we have seen COVID-19 cases and deaths soar. It does not have to be that way this year. If you are 12 and older, go get your new COVID-19 shot this fall.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n▪ Leana S.

That was the message Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) tried to convey on Tuesday after a week of seemingly simmering tensions with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) over the GOP’s faltering chances to retake the Senate majority this fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nScott, the chairman of the Senate GOP’s campaign arm, penned a scathing op-ed late last week calling it “treasonous” for Republicans to be “trash-talking” the quality of the party’s stable of Senate candidates ahead of the midterms. However, he told reporters that McConnell was not the target of his ire, despite the leader’s comments critical of the party’s “candidate quality.”\n\n\n\n“I said people that do anonymous quotes to the liberal media,” Scott said on Tuesday. “People are doing anonymous quotes and trashing our Republican candidates” (The Hill).\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the ongoing feud has taken on a life of its own. Republicans on Capitol Hill were particularly unenthusiastic about discussing the back-and-forth upon returning to the Capitol on Tuesday from the August recess. When pressed whether it was problematic for the party, Sen. John Thune (S.D.), himself a member of GOP leadership, simply responded “yes.” Others said even less.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I have complete confidence that [Scott] wants to do what we all want to do, which is win the majority back,” Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a McConnell ally, told reporters (Punchbowl News).\n\n\n\nThe chances for Republicans to win back the majority after a two-year stint in the minority have grown slimmer in recent weeks and months as a number of Trump-backed candidates have struggled to keep up financially and in the polls with a number of Democratic incumbents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlexander Bolton, The Hill: Senate Republicans point fingers as majority hopes slip.\n\n\n\nOne of those states is Pennsylvania, where Mehmet Oz has been unable to make a dent in the lead created by Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D). On Tuesday, Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) appeared at a campaign event alongside the GOP’s Senate nominee in Philadelphia, criticizing Fetterman’s continued refusal to debate the ex-television doctor and cardiologist after suffering a stroke in May.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If John Fetterman were elected to the Senate, and he's not able to communicate, if he's not able to engage with the press, if he's not able to engage with his colleagues, he would not be able to do his job,” Toomey said. “It’s just not plausible” (The Philadelphia Inquirer).\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Oz says he would have certified Biden’s win over former President Trump.\n\n\n\n▪ Washington Examiner: Toomey stays out of Pennsylvania governor's race, declines to endorse state Sen. Doug Mastriano (R).\n\n\n\n▪ Salena Zito: The realities of covering Fetterman.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ Julia Manchester and Caroline Vakil, The Hill: Nevada could cost Democrats their Senate majority.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn the House side, The Hill’s Emily Brooks spoke with Rep. Tom Emmer (R-Minn.), the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, who cautioned against any thinking on the GOP side that flipping the majority is a “done deal.” However, he argued against the conventional wisdom that the Supreme Court’s decision reversing Roe v. Wade has handed Democrats a boost and a potential lifeline to keep hold of the lower chamber.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There are only two countries on the face of the planet that are that onerous with their abortion laws, and that’s China and North Korea,” Emmer said, referring to the House-passed bill that would codify Roe. “Again, I hope they center their elections on that one issue.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPhilip Bump, The Washington Post: What we don’t know about the effect of abortion on the midterm elections.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a federal judge’s ruling to allow a special master to examine documents and items collected by the FBI during the search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate could have a greater effect on the midterm elections.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs The Hill’s Brett Samuels notes, Judge Aileen Cannon’s decision is likely to slow the investigation into the former president’s handling of classified materials removed from the White House and stored at his residence. Additional time allows Trump to publicly describe the documents probe as partisan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ The Washington Post: Some seized documents from Mar-a-Lago detail top-secret U.S. operations so closely guarded that only the president, some Cabinet members or near-Cabinet level officials could authorize other government officials to know the contents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Florida judge throws Trump, DOJ curveball with special master decision.\n\n\n\n▪ Mychael Schnell, The Hill: Five things to know about Cannon, the judge who granted Trump a special master.\n\n\n\n▪ NBC News: Legal experts on Tuesday described Cannon’s ruling as a deeply flawed and unworkable mess.\n\n\n\nThat process could be prolonged even further if prosecutors appeal Cannon’s ruling. Former Attorney General William Barr on Tuesday told Fox News that if the Justice Department’s potential appeal is not expedited, it could take “several months” for a decision. He added that Cannon’s call was incorrect.\n\n\n\n“The opinion I think was wrong, and I think the government should appeal it,” Barr told the network. “It's deeply flawed in a number of ways. I don't think the appointment of a special master is going to hold up, but even if it does, I don't see it fundamentally changing the trajectory.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"I think the fundamental dynamics of the case are set,” Barr added. “The government has very strong evidence of what it really needs to determine whether charges are appropriate” (Insider).\n\n\n\n▪ Rebecca Beitsch and Mike Lillis, The Hill:&nbsp; Five things to watch as a special master looks at FBI’s seized Trump documents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ The Associated Press: Trump-backed Geoff Diehl to take on state Attorney General Maura Healey (D)  in Massachusetts governor race.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES\n\n\n\n➤ CONGRESS&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Democratic push to include language to codify same-sex marriage in the must-pass government spending bill hit bipartisan speed bumps on Tuesday as influential lawmakers involved in the codification effort criticized the plan.\n\n\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), who Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) has tasked with winning the needed 10 Republicans to put the same-sex marriage bill over the finish line, said on Tuesday that attaching it to a continuing resolution to fund the government by month’s end is not her “preferred path” to passage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That is not the Senator's preferred path as she would like to see it taken up sooner,” a Baldwin spokesperson said. “The Senator's goal is to pass the Respect for Marriage Act and she will do whatever it takes to get there” (Politico).\n\n\n\nAdding to the issues, Republicans are steadfast against the idea. Sen. Thom Tillis (N.C.), one of the two Senate GOP members working with Baldwin and Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.) on winning bipartisan support for the same-sex marriage bill, told reporters that attaching it to the continuing resolution is a “non-starter.”\n\n\n\nAt least four Senate Republicans — Portman, Tillis, Susan Collins (Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (Alaska) — back the legislation.

Ron Johnson (Wis.), who is considered the most endangered GOP senator up for reelection this fall, continued to give mixed signals on Tuesday over whether he would support it (NBC News).\n\n\n\nAris Folley, The Hill: Congress confronts funding deadline.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, Sen.

She is expected to unveil her energy plans on Thursday. According to the news media in Britain, Truss, 47, a one-time accountant and former foreign secretary who finds herself in a pressure cooker domestic environment, plans to cap energy bills. The cost to taxpayers of that step could cost the equivalent of $116 billion (The Associated Press).\n\n\n\nBiden congratulated Truss during a Tuesday phone call and in a White House tweet.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I look forward to deepening the special relationship between our countries and working in close cooperation on global challenges, including continued support for Ukraine as it defends itself against Russian aggression,” he said.\n\n\n\nUkraine: In a report on Tuesday, the International Atomic Energy Agency called on Ukraine and Russia to agree to a demilitarized safety zone around the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant and detailed a range of damage the site has sustained.

        "description": "Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Managing like it’s already the postseason, Araúz DFA’d, the bullpen gets reinforcements, and a rivalry brewing. Good morning, Birdland!\nNow that felt like playoff baseball. Neither starting pitcher made it beyond the fourth inning. There were endless calls to the bullpen. There was a fight! And of course it took forever to complete, with a short rain delay pushing the time of the game over four hours. Now if only it could have started at 8:30 p.m. so that almost no one on the east coast got to watch more than half the game. Ah, yes, that would have the executives at MLB and FOX salivating.\nIn seriousness, this was a monumental game for both teams, but particularly the Orioles. The 9-6 win drew them within 3.5 games of the Blue Jays for that final wild card spot, and it eases some of the pain from the doubleheader sweep on Monday. \nBrandon Hyde managed this game with the seriousness it needed. Kyle Bradish was coming off of two phenomenal starts, but was not as sharp last night. If it was June, maybe Hyde lets him work through the difficulties he had early in this one. But it’s September against a team the Orioles need to beat. There’s no time for rookie rough patches. So instead the skipper went to his bullpen, and he pulled out all the stops.\nHis continued use of the big three (Dillon Tate, Cionel Perez, and Felix Bautista) in outings longer than one outing feels a bit precarious. They rarely look as fine-tuned in inning number two, and it possibly burns them for the next night. But, again, at this point in the season, Hyde needs to go with what works, and a less fresh version of Bautista is a better option than giving Jake Reed or Yennier Cano their Orioles debut in that spot.\nThe job is not done here. The O’s probably need to nab another victory on Wednesday. That would get them back to where they started the series, 2.5 games back. That’s not a bad place to be with three off days and five games against sub-.500 teams over the next week before taking on these Blue Jays yet again. Keep the chaos comin’!\nLinks\nRipken becomes Iron Man: An oral history | Orioles.comIt’s been 27 years since Cal Ripken Jr. broke Lou Gehrig’s record for consecutive games planned. Will Ripken’s record of 2,632 ever be bested? It feels unlikely. Last year MLB.com published a list of each team’s “Iron Man” at the time. White Merrifield topped the list of active streaks with a paltry 347.\nOrioles Designate Jonathan Araúz For Assignment | MLB Trade Rumors Now that Gunnar Henderson is up full-time, there really wasn’t any more room on the Orioles roster for a middle infield option. Hopefully Araúz gets a shot in another organization to fill a utility role.\nOrioles add relievers Reed and Cano to active roster | Roch KubatkoAs good as the Orioles bullpen has been this year, you get the feeling that they have been a pitcher or two short for a while now. Perhaps one of these two can provide a little more than the team has gotten from the likes of Rico Garcia, Logan Gillaspie, Louis Head, and Beau Sulser.\nAfter getting ejected, Blue Jays manager Schneider rips Orioles reliever Baker | SportsNetThe makings of an Orioles-Blue Jays rivalry are right there. Both teams are relatively young and should be on the upswing for a few seasons now. It is unclear how long Bryan Baker will be a part of that rivalry, but it is interesting that he has already played for both teams.\nOrioles birthdays\nIs it your birthday? Happy birthday!\n\nDusten Knight turns 32. The back-flipping reliever appeared in seven games for the 2021 Orioles. He’s now doing his thing in the Rays organization.\nDavid Newhan celebrates his 49th birthday. The utility man spent three seasons with the Orioles from 2004 through 2006. His 2004 season was particularly wild as he came out of nowhere to slash .311/.361./.453 in his age-30 season.\nWillie Morales turns 50. The catcher’s MLB career spanned three games, all with the 2000 Orioles.\nWade Rowdon is 62 years old. He played in 20 games with the 1988 Birds, going 3-for-30 in that time.\nOrlando Sánchez is 66 today. The catcher made his way into four games with the ‘84 O’s.\nThe late Tommy Matchick (b. 1943, d. 2022) was born on this day. The infielder played in three games for the Orioles in 1972.\n\nThis day in O’s history\n1996 - The Orioles get their first shutout of the season as Mike Mussina tosses a complete game to beat the Tigers 6-0.\n2018 - For the third time in franchise history the Orioles have lost 100 games, falling 14-2 to the Rays. It is also the fastest a team has ever gotten to 100 losses in a season, taking just 141 games to do so.",

        "description": "Updated at 11:50 a.m. ET on September 7, 2022Fox News is in legal trouble. The media giant is facing lawsuits from two voting-machine companies over segments it aired with Donald Trump surrogates parroting the former president’s made-up allegations that the 2020 presidential election had been thrown by compromised voting machines—insinuations that Trump’s own advisers told him did not hold water.Defending their client, Fox News’s attorneys have relied heavily on free-speech doctrines established by the 1964 landmark Supreme Court case New York Times v. Sullivan—specifically, the standard of “actual malice.” This standard says that when it comes to public figures, a speaker must know their statements are false or display “reckless disregard” for whether the statements are true in order to meet the requirement for defamation. In that particular case, the Montgomery, Alabama, public-safety commissioner, L. B. Sullivan, sued The New York Times over an ad it had published calling for donations on behalf of the civil-rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. Although the ad made some factual errors regarding the police department Sullivan oversaw, the Court ruled that the Times was not liable, because the purpose of the First Amendment was to guarantee that “debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open,” and that such debate “may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials.”This standard has protected the right of Americans of all political persuasions to make absurd, hyperbolic, and sometimes even false statements about their political leaders. This is how it should be. The bar is not unreachable, but it is justifiably high in order to protect public criticism of powerful people. Following former President Trump’s calls to “open up our libel laws,” gutting the free-speech protections of Times v. Sullivan has become a right-wing cause, presumably because some conservatives imagine that the “fake-news liberal media” will be swiftly bankrupted for saying mean things about the smart and handsome Mr. Trump. But the Fox News lawsuits show that conservatives’ enthusiasm for gutting Times v. Sullivan would leave right-wing media outlets more vulnerable than perhaps they appreciate.[Read: Do you speak Fox?]In a dissent last year, the conservative federal judge Laurence Silberman called for Times v. Sullivan to be overturned, complaining that the Times and The Washington Post “are virtually Democratic Party broadsheets” and adding that “nearly all television—network and cable—is a Democratic Party trumpet.” This is false, but even if it were true, one strains to see what relation it has to defamation law. Like most frustrated news consumers, Silberman’s complaints regarding the mainstream press are about framing, emphasis, and story selection—not facts.Silberman’s position is nevertheless shared by some very powerful people. Three years ago, Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in a concurring opinion that the Supreme Court should overturn New York Times v. Sullivan and rethink the actual-malice standard. That case was a particularly compelling one for his point: It involved a woman who had sued Bill Cosby for libel after the disgraced comedian’s lawyer accused her of lying about being assaulted by Cosby. The Court declined to take the case, leaving in place a lower-court decision in Cosby’s favor on the grounds that the plaintiff had become a “limited-purpose public figure”—a term describing an otherwise private citizen who finds themselves at the center of a public controversy—and that the attorney’s statements therefore did not meet the actual-malice standard.“New York Times and the Court’s decisions extending it were policy-driven decisions masquerading as constitutional law,” Thomas wrote. “If the Constitution does not require public figures to satisfy an actual-malice standard in state-law defamation suits, then neither should we.”In a 2021 case, Thomas reiterated his call for Times v. Sullivan to be overturned and was joined by Justice Neil Gorsuch, who lamented the spread of disinformation on social media and argued that if the actual-malice standard “had force in a world with comparatively few platforms for speech, it’s less obvious what force it has in a world in which everyone carries a soapbox in their hands.” It’s always interesting to see which contemporary developments originalists decide are relevant to their constitutional interpretations.Thomas’s and Gorsuch’s arguments are more compelling and sophisticated than Silberman’s, but it’s also clear that Silberman is closer to the mainstream conservative view on the subject, which is that Times v. Sullivan should be overturned in order to discipline the liberal media.[Joshua A. Geltzer and Neal K. Katyal: The true danger of the Trump campaign’s defamation lawsuits]“The First Amendment guarantees a free press to foster a vibrant trade in ideas. But a biased press can distort the marketplace,” Silberman wrote. “And when the media has proven its willingness—if not eagerness—to so distort, it is a profound mistake to stand by unjustified legal rules that serve only to enhance the press’ power.” Again, this is an editorial, not legal, analysis, an expression of desire to punish the press for its misbehavior—a rather ironic frame for a so-called defense of free speech. None of Silberman’s concerns, to the extent you take them seriously, would be addressed by overturning Times v. Sullivan—diverging ideological interpretations of the same facts would persist without a stronger liability shield. In Britain, where there is no actual-malice standard, major media outlets are widely considered to be more explicitly aligned by ideology and hardly free of distortions.The irony of Trump’s complaints about the permissiveness of American libel law, and right-wing jurists’ support for gutting the actual-malice standard, is that many conservative media outlets would suffer without it—perhaps more than the mainstream press outlets they hope to bring down. Those institutions would survive. But all the right-wing shitposters calling for the media’s downfall? Might not be so great for them.The loss of the concept of a “limited-purpose public figure” would make things very hard for outlets and personalities who thrive on finding new targets for opprobrium. Beyond the legal trouble facing Fox News, the parents of a child murdered in the Sandy Hook massacre recently successfully sued Alex Jones, the far-right proprietor of Infowars who counts Trump among his admirers, after he alleged that the incident was a “false flag” operation orchestrated by the government. The verdict was taken in conservative circles as an attack on free speech, notwithstanding the insistence that it should be easier to sue the media for saying things that are false. In 2020, a federal judge dismissed a defamation lawsuit against the Fox News host Tucker Carlson filed by a woman who claimed to have had an affair with Trump. Carlson accused her of “extortion” on his show, but the judge dismissed the suit on the grounds that the host is “not ‘stating actual facts’ about the topics he discusses and is instead engaging in ‘exaggeration’ and ‘non-literal commentary.’”The actual-malice standard has enabled the creation of an alternate universe of conspiratorial disinformation about political figures conservatives oppose—such as the birther myths around Barack Obama and the dark, elaborate fantasies concocted about the Clintons. In plain English, conservative media have gotten used to being able to say outrageous things without any adverse legal consequences and have built devoted audiences under the umbrella of this protection. Tens of millions of Americans trust and believe the things they hear from these outlets, viewing nonconservative media sources as untrustworthy. These outlets have abused that trust by consciously misleading the population about serious matters, such as the risks of the coronavirus pandemic and the origins of the Capitol riot. Again, this is their First Amendment right, however infuriating their conduct might be.[David French: Free speech for me but not for thee]Even with the current high standard, some—such as Jones—still face legal consequences for their actions. But without that standard, conservative outlets that engage in similar conduct would be much more likely to face legal threats. On the other hand, if Britain offers any example, mainstream media outlets such as The New York Times and The Washington Post would survive Times v. Sullivan’s demise. These organizations can afford strong legal representation and, crucially, maintain much stricter rules about what they publish. That does not make them infallible or above criticism, and it doesn’t mean that they never make libelous errors. But their institutional standards ensure that the overwhelming majority of the time, their coverage is rooted in facts. Many of their detractors in the right-wing press are much more reliant on, to use a technical term, bullshit.Overturning Times v. Sullivan would undoubtedly have a chilling effect on free speech. We can infer this simply from the era before Times v. Sullivan, during which public officials—many of them segregationists—used libel law to stifle criticism of their official conduct, a practice that weighed heavily on the unanimous majority in Sullivan. Fox Corporation’s chief executive is suing an outlet in Australia that has been critical of the network’s coverage of the 2020 election, taking advantage of the absence of speech protections it is eagerly availing itself of in the United States. This is how good legal representation works, but it also reflects an approach to free speech that is more mercenary than principled.Even if they were unsuccessful in intimidating large outlets such as the Times or the Post, wealthy and powerful people would likely find it much simpler to use the threat of litigation to silence those without deep pockets or institutional support. It would be little trouble to target the average person shooting their mouth off on social media, but the media outlets that conservatives hate would continue to exist and continue to cover public affairs in a way they disapprove of—that is, without sounding like the Trump advisers at Fox News.Without the actual-malice standard, the strong would likely find it easier to silence the weak. It is not hard to understand why the justices, powerful people who are frequently subject to withering public criticism, might be sympathetic to that outcome. But conservatives who believe that the end of the actual-malice standard would fatally injure the mainstream outlets they loathe should probably be careful what they wish for.This article originally misidentified the entity whose chief executive is suing an outlet in Australia.",

        "description": "The study, design and testing of aerospace vehicles, including some aviation studiesWhat you’ll learnAerospace engineering explores the design, analysis and testing of aeronautical and aerospace vehicles. You will study aircraft design, flight mechanics and fluid dynamics, as well as reliability, safety and airworthiness. It will also include aviation studies, covering topics such as the environmental impact of airlines, operational efficiency and time-keeping in the industry.How you’ll learnTypically, you would have a lot of traditional lectures, supported by tutorial work to applied learning. Group assignments also encourage team work, problem-solving and organisational issues. Universities are increasingly using interactive sessions, such as flipping the classroom, where students ask what they need rather than the old style one-way delivery. Institutions such as City University bring in guest lecturers to provide industry experience. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Tom Bonier, CEO of data and polling firm TargetSmart and a nationally respected elections expert, recently wrote a guest op-ed in the New York Times titled: “Women are so fired up to vote, I’ve never seen anything like it.” \n\n\n\nIt seems likely that when the midterm votes are counted, women will be viewed as the superstars of the 2022 elections, rallying in large numbers, with high turnout, after enormous voter registration.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis will include women of all ages, races, religions and political ideologies. This will include principled female conservatives and Republicans who will battle with their votes for the soul not only of our country but, in the case of moderate and principled conservative Republicans, of their party.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt is fine to criticize far-right Republicans, but President Biden and Democrats should reach out to moderate and moderately conservative independents, as well as moderate and principled conservative Republicans, to join them for this one election, at this one moment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis would make an outstanding prime-time address for the president, going the distance supporting the movement to register all voters, but female voters especially, to lift our country with decency and protect our country from extremism.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd — this is critically important — every reference to “MAGA Republicans” should be accompanied by an equal, or greater reference, extending Democratic hands to moderate Republicans and principled conservatives who publicly or privately would vote to protect the GOP from falling into the hands of extremism.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith one of the most important midterm elections in a century rapidly approaching, major events that explain what is happening are in progress across the landscape of American politics.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden and Democrats have enacted an impressive range of major initiatives that have elevated the president’s political standing and the performance of Democrats in match-up polling, a trend I have emphasized in recent columns. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt is imperative to inform voters, again and again and in depth, of these important initiatives, which will lower the cost of prescription drugs, improve health care for veterans and other Americans, combat gun violence, protect Earth from climate change and create American jobs that will help rebuild our nation and restore our technological leadership.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer President Trump has succeeded in dominating the Republican Party, leading to countless nominees for state and federal office who are far to the extreme right compared to historic Republicans and conservatives. Many outright deny the results of the 2020 presidential election. Others aggressively threaten retribution against those they treat as political enemies, including moderate Republicans, if they win the 2022 midterms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn one of the most politically and legally radical and consequential events in modern history, the Supreme Court, defying five decades of legal precedent, overturned Roe v. Wade and destroyed the constitutional right to abortion for women.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs I and numerous other analysts have been suggesting for months, the backlash from women and other aggrieved groups has been dramatic and powerful. There is now an extraordinary surge of women, young people and others, outraged and alarmed by the movement to the far right by Trump, Republicans and the Supreme Court, registering to vote in the coming midterms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBonier is right. An internet search for stories about “female voter registration” will find numerous stories documenting a significant rise in voter registration from women,&nbsp; young people and others who are outraged, fearful and alarmed by the consequences of electing a far-right Republican Congress operating alongside a far-right Supreme Court majority.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy working with women’s groups, Democrats can turn a trend into a wave by mobilizing female Hollywood stars, female teachers and workers, female athletic stars and courageous female veterans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWomen will be the midterm superstars if they register and vote as though the future of our country depends on it. It does. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBudowsky was an aide to former Sen. Lloyd Bentsen (D-Texas) and former Rep. Bill Alexander (D-Ark.), who was chief deputy majority whip of the House of Representatives.&nbsp;",

And they will have to make up the shortfall.”",

Obama loyalists are frustrated that Biden’s aides regularly boast of how they have avoided the mistakes of the Obama White House, such as failing to sufficiently tout the president’s accomplishments.”",

According to Google, Android 13’s redesigned “work profiles” build upon last year’s enhancements to keep an employee’s personal data separate from their work data and make the user experience better and more productive, all while still adhering to an IT department’s admin policies.\nOne improvement in Android 13 lets employees specify if an app should be opened in their personal or work profile. This can be useful to keep corporate videos out of personal YouTube watchlists, suggests Google in one example.

        "description": "Chris Sweda/Chicago Tribune/Tribune News Service via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Anne Rogers has more on the $100 bet between Zack Greinke and Drew Waters, where Greinke wagered Waters wouldn’t hit a homer all season:\n\nAccording to Waters, who told the story after the Royals’ 6-5 loss in 10 innings to the Guardians, Greinke bet Waters shortly after he was called up that the rookie wouldn’t hit a home run for “the rest of the season.”\n“I was like, ‘All right, I hope he’s not putting the bad juju on me,’” Waters said. “But as soon as I went deep, that was the one guy I was looking for in the dugout. He actually wasn’t in the dugout, but as soon as he came back in, I was sure to go up to him and tell him he owed me a hundred.”\nGreinke hasn’t paid up yet, Waters said, but the veteran pitcher — who’s slated to come off the IL and start on Wednesday — did mention the wager when Waters found him in the dugout.\n“He was like, ‘That’s awesome, nice swing. I owe you,’” Waters said. “... I’m sure I’ll get a small piece of his fortune.”\n\nAdditionally, Rogers explored what Carlos Hernández’s role is going forward:\n\nBut there is something to how his stuff plays up in short stints, and how his personality fits into the bullpen mentality of throwing multiple days a week and giving everything in that one- or two-inning stint. Starters have to manage their effort across what they hope is a six-inning outing or more. The focus, routine and preparation is different than a reliever.\nHernández, an easygoing person who is always on the go, likes that difference.\n“I like it a lot,” Hernández said. “It works better for me. It’s different, but it’s good. The preparation is different, trying to be ready every time they call you, that is fun for me.”\n\nThis is huge: more than 50% of minor league players have signed union authorization cards from the MLB Players Association. Evan Drellich at The Athletic reported this news and much more: \n\nIn just a week-and-a-half’s time, more than 50 percent of minor leaguers have returned signed union authorization cards, Major League Baseball Players Association officials told The Athletic. Now, with that majority’s support, the MLBPA has taken another significant step: it has asked MLB and the 30 teams to formally recognize the MLBPA as the minor leaguers’ collective bargaining representatives, Players Association officials said. \nMLBPA deputy executive director Bruce Meyer made that request for voluntary recognition in a letter sent to deputy MLB commissioner Dan Halem on Tuesday morning. The Players Association sent over what’s known as a card-check agreement, where the league would agree to voluntary recognition, contingent on independent verification of the cards. From here, the next move might belong to commissioner Rob Manfred and the owners, who have yet to publicly comment on the fast-moving unionization effort. MLB did not immediately return a request for comment from The Athletic on Tuesday.\n\nDavid Lesky talked to a scout who saw some Royals prospects at Single-A, including this on Gavin Cross:\nHe called the swing a “ten-time All Star swing” and thought in the small sample he saw that some of the contact questions were a little overrated. He was very impressed with his quick swing and believes it might take some tweaks to access big power, but he could see a couple 28-35 home run seasons with him settling in the low-20s as a higher average bat. He was a little disappointed that Cross walked six times in the three games because he didn’t get to see him swing the bat as much, but he felt that at least two of the walks were on his plate discipline and not simply bad pitching. Cross wasn’t really tested in center field, but he looked the part. Maybe he’s not quite fast enough to stick there in Kauffman Stadium, but he won’t hurt you. He compared it to Max Kepler’s ability to play center.\nWell this is absurd:\n\n\nAaron Judge currently has an 18-HR lead over Kyle Schwarber for the @MLB leadThat would be the 6th-largest diff between Nos. 1 &amp; 2 in HR for a season, behind only:1921 Babe Ruth: +351920 Babe Ruth: +351926 Babe Ruth: +261928 Babe Ruth: +231924 Babe Ruth: +19— Sarah Langs (@SlangsOnSports) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Yankees placed Anthony Rizzo on the IL, and recalled Ronald Guzmán.

But it is a Pyrrhic victory of little practical significance.\n\n\n\nOn Aug. 8, the FBI seized 11,000 documents, with and without classification markings, as well as 1,800 other items from Trump’s office and storage room in his Mar-a-Lago home.\n\n\n\nAmong the documents seized were roughly 500 documents that the FBI deemed potentially subject to the attorney-client or executive privileges. The executive privilege documents purportedly reflected communications between Trump and his advisers while he was in the White House.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrue, Judge Cannon temporarily enjoined the government from reviewing and using the seized material pending the special master’s review. But the Justice Department had told Cannon that the review had already been completed, and the judge was careful to exempt from her injunction Department of National Intelligence (DNI) screening of the seized materials to assess the potential damage to national security coming out of disclosure of the seized documents. DNI Director Avril Haines said that she is in the throes of that screen and will report her findings to Congress.\n\n\n\nMoreover, the injunction only enjoined “further review and any use of the materials seized…for criminal investigative purposes.” So, prosecutors should be free to continue to present other evidence to the grand jury, interview witnesses and follow leads derived from sources independent of the documents.\n\n\n\nBut the case is by no means “doomed.” It is merely the first lap around the track.\n\n\n\nThe government will undoubtedly appeal the order to the 11th Circuit as it is dead wrong. Enjoining an ongoing criminal investigation, even temporarily, is an extraordinary remedy, which should raise eyebrows in the court of appeals.\n\n\n\nIn any event, unless reversed, the appointment of the special master and the review will proceed expeditiously. The FBI performed its review of the seized documents in three weeks.\n\n\n\nThe crimes involved in the search and seizure are serious. Implicated are three criminal statutes carrying heavy jail time: Title 18 USC §793 dealing with espionage; 18 USC §2071 dealing with mishandling of government documents; and 18 USC §1519 dealing with obstruction of the investigation of the other two offenses.\n\n\n\nViolation of any of these statutes, however, does not turn on the contents of any of the seized documents. The documents were contraband. It was illegal for Trump to possess them as they were government documents belonging not to him but to the United States.\n\n\n\nTrump will claim executive and attorney-client privileges with regard to some, but not all, of the documents found in the boxes, closet and desk drawers of his Mar-a-Lago headquarters, and the special master will make recommendations to Judge Cannon resolving any disputes. The FBI did what it does in all cases involving the seizure of arguably privileged documents. It established a “Chinese Wall” between the investigative team and a special team of agents who would review arguably privileged documents. \n\n\n\nOf course, there is the possibility of a leak, and the special master review will lend the appearance of credibility to the privilege screen, thus assuring that the government’s document case is taint free. In fact, Judge Cannon may have done Attorney General Merrick Garland a favor.\n\n\n\nIt is significant that Trump did not assert executive or attorney-client privilege when he turned over 15 boxes of documents to the National Archives in January 2021. He waited until April 2022 to raise the issue when the Archives advised him that it intended to provide the 15 boxes to the FBI.\n\n\n\nWhen President Biden waived any executive privilege, the FBI obtained access in May. Trump never sued at that time to enjoin the transfer on grounds of executive, attorney-client privilege or any other grounds.\n\n\n\nBut it really doesn’t matter, and it bears repeating, the investigators were not inquiring into the contents of the documents (with the possible exception of the classified documents) but whether Trump’s possession of government documents at Mar-a-Lago was criminal.\n\n\n\nLast March, Federal Judge David Carter in California reviewed attorney-client documents himself in a case relating to the events of Jan. 6. He did not appoint a special master. He found that the privilege didn’t apply because “more likely than not,” Trump’s attorney-client communications involved the commission of a crime.\n\n\n\nTrump’s claim of privilege is weak with regard to the government documents. There is a tort-crime exception to attorney-client and executive privileges, which holds that there is no privilege if there is a crime involved in the communication. There is also no attorney-client privilege between Trump and White House lawyers since the client is not Trump but the United States.\n\n\n\nSo, what does a special master add to the mix? It strikes me as a lawyer as an abuse of discretion. Trump has a full inventory of the documents seized, and could easily advise the Justice Department of those presumably few documents he claims are privileged. It does not appear that Judge Cannon would be overburdened in reviewing these herself as she put the outside number at 500 — about the volume of a best-selling novel. Then, she could decide what is privileged and what is not. She will have to decide the issue anyway since she must inevitably pass on the special master’s recommendation.\n\n\n\nA special master might be subject to more political pressure than a federal judge. A special master might be threatened, as was Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, who signed the search warrant.\n\n\n\nA former president, like a sitting president, is not above the law. Yet, Judge Cannon treated him differently from you and me. Believe me, we don’t get a special master with all the delay that might entail, and an injunction against a criminal investigation.\n\n\n\nJudge Cannon has apparently swallowed the Trump line that the FBI and the Department of Justice are out to get him. He has just called them “vicious monsters.” What will he have to say about a special master who makes adverse recommendations to the court?\n\n\n\nThe point is that there should be no delay in a criminal investigation. If Trump is ever indicted, he can then make a motion to suppress evidence he contends was privileged or illegally obtained.\n\n\n\nJudge Cannon has stood criminal procedure on its head by ordering a threshold special master screening of documents that may never be offered in evidence. If indicted, Trump will have the opportunity afforded to every other criminal defendant to question the introduction of the documentary evidence against him.\n\n\n\nAs the iconic Federal Judge Learned Hand aptly said: “Our dangers do not lie in too little tenderness to the accused. Our procedure has been always haunted by the ghost of the innocent man convicted. It is an unreal dream. What we need to fear is the archaic formalism and the watery sentiment that obstructs, delays, and defeats the prosecution of crime.”\n\n\n\nToobin is wrong. We have not seen the end of the case of the Mar-a-Lago documents.\n\n\n\nJames D. Zirin is a former federal prosecutor in the Southern District of New York.",

        "description": "A majority of Americans in a&nbsp;new Gallup poll&nbsp;said that inflation-driven price increases are causing moderate or severe financial hardship.\n\n\n\nFifty-six percent of respondents said they are facing financial hardship, according to the survey giant, which noted that the percentage has steadily increased in recent months, rising from 45 percent in November and 49 percent in January.\n\n\n\nWhile lower-income families are experiencing fairly similar levels of financial hardship as last fall, middle-income and upper-income families are starting to feel the pinch more than before, the polling shows.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince last November, the percentage of middle-income families experiencing financial hardship went up 17 points and the percentage of upper-income families reporting hardship rose 12 points, according to the poll.\n\n\n\nGallup characterizes lower-income families as making less than $48,000, middle-income families as making between $48,000 and $89,999, and upper-income families as making more than $90,000.\n\n\n\nAlong party lines, Republicans are more likely than Democrats to say that inflation is causing financial hardship, with 67 percent of Republicans reporting financial hardship compared to 44 percent of Democrats.\n\n\n\nIn response to rising prices, Americans facing financial hardship are trying to reduce their spending, travel less or cancel vacations, and drive less or use less gas, according to Gallup.\n\n\n\nInflation will likely remain a key factor in the upcoming midterm elections, as a central part of Republicans’ critique of the Biden administration and Democrats.\n\n\n\nWhile inflation dipped slightly in July as gas prices dropped, it remained abnormally high at 8.5 percent. \n\n\n\nAnd while an August Gallup survey found that confidence in the economy had improved, most Americans still rated the economy negatively. \n\n\n\nThe new survey of 1,570 respondents, conducted Aug. 1-22, has a margin of error of 3 percentage points.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/3631537-pavlich-the-lefts-electric-vehicle-push-is-about-freedom/",
        "description": "Since last week, the California electric grid operator has been sending out frantic messages warning residents to avoid using electricity, or charging their electric vehicles, as the system becomes overloaded due to continuing heat.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“#ISO has issued an Energy Emergency Alert (EEA) 1 effective today, from 4 p.m. – 9 p.m. Consumers are strongly urged to use less #energy to avoid rotating #poweroutages,” the California ISO tweeted out Tuesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe timing was impeccable.\n\n\n\nJust days before the crisis started, which is expected to continue in the coming weeks, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) announced a ban on all gas-powered vehicles by 2035.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We can solve this climate crisis if we focus on the big, bold steps necessary to cut pollution. California now has a groundbreaking, world-leading plan to achieve 100 percent zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035,” Newsom declared in a statement. “This plan’s yearly targets — 35 percent ZEV sales by 2026, 68 percent by 2030, and 100 percent by 2035 — provide our road map to reducing dangerous carbon emissions and moving away from fossil fuels.”\n\n\n\nA number of Democratic-controlled states are expected to follow Newsom’s lead.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm applauded the move, telling Fox 11 Los Angeles she thought it “could be” used as a national model for the rest of the country. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Yeah, I do. I think California really is leaning in,” Granholm said about the idea. “And of course, the federal government has a goal of — the president has announced — by 2030 that half of the vehicles in the U.S., the new ones sold would be electric.”\n\n\n\nThe left’s current push for a rapid transition from gas-powered cars to electric vehicles is being done under the guise of fighting climate change and cleaning up the environment. This is a nice idea, but it’s far from the truth when it comes to how electric vehicles are made and the toll they take on the environment, starting in production and ending with battery waste.\n\n\n\nFor example, the production of electric vehicles causes more “dangerous” carbon emissions, which Democrats like Newsom claim they will eliminate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Compared with traditional internal combustion engine, or ICE, vehicles, greenhouse gases released while manufacturing battery-electric cars account for a higher portion of life-cycle emissions. As the EV hype gains momentum, battery production and research is powering ahead and sales are growing. That means material emissions are going to rise to more than 60 percent by 2040 from 18 percent today, according to consultancy firm McKinsey &amp; Co.,” Bloomberg reports. \n\n\n\nAnd what happens when the batteries, made with slave labor through strip mining in China and Africa, go bad? Where do they go? \n\n\n\n“Breaking up is hard to do, and in few places is that more true than breaking up and reclaiming the materials in an EV battery. These are big, heavy, complex arrays of materials and packaging that don’t recycle like a water bottle,” CNET explained last year. “The lithium, nickel, cobalt and other elements inside an EV battery present a toxic challenge that recycling attacks by keeping batteries from ever being truly discarded.”\n\n\n\nUsing the standard of carbon emissions, electric vehicles aren’t necessarily cleaner or greener than traditional vehicles. Technology will evolve to tackle the issue, but should be done through the private sector on a logical timeline, not through government force or mandates to ban gas vehicles they falsely claim are worse for the environment. A number of start-up companies are already looking into ways to recycle batteries and manufacture more efficiently. They’re also using fossil fuels to get them there.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Realistically I think we need to use oil and gas in the short term, because otherwise civilization will crumble,” Tesla CEO Elon Musk, leader of the world’s largest and most successful electric vehicle company, recently told a conference. “One of the biggest challenges the world has ever faced is the transition to sustainable energy and to a sustainable economy. That will take some decades to complete.”\n\n\n\nElectric vehicles don’t exist without fossil fuels and neither does a functioning, modern world. This reality is running right into decrees to ban fuels that work to keep society functioning. How will people get to work if they can’t charge their electric vehicles in places like California?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe current and rapid push for electric vehicles isn’t about saving or cleaning up the environment for future generations, it’s about controlling how people travel and their freedom of movement. Total reliance on the grid with electric vehicles ensures government bureaucrats, coming off of their power highs from the COVID-19 pandemic, will have total control over how much people travel, when they travel, how far they can go and when they can work. Saving the environment, a noble idea, is just an excuse.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPavlich is the editor for Townhall.com and a Fox News contributor.",

You might be involved in immunisation programmes, helping new mums feed their baby, working in child protection and safeguarding or working with children in intensive care.How you’ll learnChildren’s nursing is a three-year degree. The Nursing and Midwifery Council have certain standards that apply to all courses. It will be 50% theory and 50% practice and you have to experience care for children in a variety of settings. Each university is slightly different, but in the main you will find there are lectures, seminars and clinical skills, where students have the ability to develop expertise by practising them in a safe environment. There is self-directed study as well as working with experts. Sometimes you will be at university, sometimes in hospital or other settings.

It is a degree that can open doors to graduate roles in healthcare, one of the world’s largest and fastest-growing industries, and it offers an excellent alternative to standard medicine degrees.In the first year, many courses take a broad approach, including practical lab training and a range of units that introduce them to biochemistry, such as cell biology, medical microbiology and infectious diseases, pharmacology and physiology. Students can then go on to choose optional units. At many universities, final-year students will complete an original research project, applying their skills to real-life problems.

        "description": "Photo by Mike Ehrmann/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Recapping how the Yankees’ top AL opponents fared on September 6th. The Yankees were rained out last night in the Bronx, setting up a doubleheader against the Twins today. The rest of the American League pretty active, though, so here’s what happened with their potential playoff rivals.\n\nTampa Bay Rays 8 (76-58), Boston Red Sox 4 (67-70)\n\nThe bad weather in New York allowed the Rays to gain half a game on the Yankees, as they took care of business at the Trop against the Red Sox. Boston had a chance for a moment in the second, when recently-promoted rookie Triston Casas belted his first career homer to help Boston counter Randy Arozarena’s three-run bomb. That cut Tampa’s lead to 3-2, but the perhaps-finally-toast Rich Hill couldn’t stop the bleeding.\nManuel Margot and Arozarena led off the third with a single and double, respectively, and Harold Ramírez promptly plated them both to give the Rays a three-run lead. It was never close again, as the Rays used Johnny Wholestaff (six different pitchers) in place of the paternity-listed Drew Rasmussen to shut down the Red Sox offense until the eighth, by which time Christian Bethancourt and Yu Chang had belted back-to-back homers and Tampa was up, 8-2.\n\nTommy Pham’s two-run shot in the eighth was ultimately meaningless and Jason Adam closed out the Red Sox in the ninth to move the Rays within 4.5 games of the Yankees. Regardless of how the Rays and Red Sox fare tonight, New York can get that half-game back with a doubleheader sweep, but those are easier said than done (even against the Twins).\n\nBaltimore Orioles 9 (72-64), Toronto Blue Jays 6 (75-60)\n\nSpeaking of doubleheader sweeps, if the Orioles had any hope of hanging in the Wild Card race after suffering one at the hands of Toronto on Monday, they needed to stand their ground at home today. At the start, it was more of the same, with the Jays jumping ahead, 3-0, on the strength of a three-run blast by Bo Bichette, his fourth in his previous six at-bats. However, the O’s stormed back with five runs off Mitch White in the third, capped by an RBI hit from rookie Gunnar Henderson.\n\nToronto got back to within one and tensions were pretty high in the seventh, when Brayan Baker’s strikeout of Chapman set off some fiery words between the two bird teams’ benches:\n\nPer MLB.com reporter Joe Trezza’s best guess, this had been the result of simmering frustrations from the Jays toward both the O’s and the umpiring crew, so it seems like things just boiled over. No punches were thrown, and an inning after play resumed, Baltimore put this one to bed with a three-run eighth that featured one of the best slides you’ll ever see by former Yankee Rougned Odor.\n\n\nHOW ODORpic.twitter.com/f4zoyXDbKV— Dillard Barnhart (@BarnHasSpoken2) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nFélix Bautista gave up just his second run in the past month but still threw two solid innings to close it out. The Orioles now sit 3.5 games behind the Blue Jays for the final spot in the Wild Card chase and can at least cut their deficit back to what it was before this four-game set began at 2.5 with another big win tonight.\n\nTexas Rangers 4 (59-76), Houston Astros 3 (87-49)\n\nHey, the Rangers actually beat the Astros for once! They’ve gone a miserable 20-45 against their interstate rivals since the start of 2019, but Texas registered win No. 21 on Wednesday night. Although former Baby Bomber Glenn Otto was thoroughly whatever for Texas with three runs allowed in four innings (albeit one unearned on catcher’s interference), his bullpen backed him up with five shutout frames of Houston offense. That enabled the Rangers to weather the loss of their early 3-0 lead and score the go-ahead run in the seventh on a bases-loaded walk off Framber Valdez. It might have been all that the ‘pen got, but it was all that it needed, as Matt Moore and José Leclerc no-hit the Astros over the final 2.1 innings.\n\nFor those still keeping the faith, the Astros’ loss cut the Yankees’ deficit on the No. 1 seed to 5.5 games.\n\nSeattle Mariners 3 (77-59), Chicago White Sox 0 (68-68)\n\nThe Mariners are just playing really well lately. Logan Gilbert was electric against the White Sox on Tuesday night, firing six shutout innings with nine strikeouts in a game that didn’t feature much support. Veteran Johnny Cueto didn’t make it easy for Gilbert or Seattle, as the only run he gave up in six frames of his own came on a sacrifice fly. Still, Gilbert blew Chicago away:\n\nIt took until the bottom of the eighth, but Cal Raleigh finally gave Seattle some insurance with a two-run missile off Reynaldo López. That all but ensured a stress-free save for Paul Sewald, who clinched the Mariners’ 15th win in their last 20 games. They remain tied with the Rays for the top Wild Card spot (and also 4.5 back of New York if that becomes a factor).\nOther Contenders\n\nCleveland Guardians 4 (70-64), Kansas City Royals 1 (55-82): The Twins’ top division rival gained a half-game on them, too, as Shane Bieber kept the Royals off the scoreboard over eight innings of work outside of a Salvador Perez solo shot. Cleveland got on the board with a two-run single by José Ramírez in the third, and that was all they really needed to move 1.5 games up in the AL Central (and three up on Chicago).",

        "description": "Updated: 7:25 a.m.Target is dropping the mandatory retirement age for its CEO and extended its contract with Chief Executive Brian Cornell for three years.Cornell, 63, would have passed the age of 65 in that span.“In discussions about the company’s longer-term plans, it was important to us as a board to assure our stakeholders that Brian intends to stay in his role beyond the traditional retirement age of 65,&quot; said Monica Lozano, the lead independent director of Target&#x27;s board in a release on Wednesday.Sales at the discount retailer have grown steadily since Cornell took the top job in 2014.The Minneapolis-based chain had been accelerating its online services such as curbside pickup and same-day services while sprucing up its stores well before the pandemic. During the height of the health crisis, Target became a lifeline to millions of people trying to limit their exposure during the pandemic.The company has also been out front with its investment with workers. It raised its minimum wage to $15 per hour in 2020, a commitment it pledged in 2017 and well ahead of many grocery rivals. Earlier this year, Target adopted minimum wages that range from $15 to $24 an hour, with the highest pay going to hires in the most competitive markets.But now the company, like other retailers, is trying to navigate tremendous shifts in consumer behavior with the worst of the pandemic in the rear view mirror while it wrestles with soaring prices and rising wages for workers. Target reported solid sales for the fiscal second quarter, but its profit plunged nearly 90% after it was forced to slash prices to clear unwanted inventories of clothing, home goods and electronics.Before joining Target, Brian spent more than 30 years in escalating leadership positions at retail and consumer-product companies. Roles included chief marketing officer at Safeway Inc. and CEO at Michaels, Walmart&#x27;s Sam’s Club and PepsiCo Americas Foods.The company also announced Wednesday that Arthur Valdez, executive vice president and chief supply chain and logistics officer, will retire. Valdez will be succeeded by Gretchen McCarthy, senior vice president, global inventory management.Shares of Target were virtually unchanged in premarket trading.",

        "description": "Harry Styles’s high-end lockdown album is surprisingly of a piece with other longlisted albums by artists as distinct as Joy Crookes and GwennoIt was perhaps inevitable that so many records born of the last couple of years should possess a certain interiority. Tours halted, venues closed, the world on hiatus. Meanwhile Britain was in a period of self-examination: its history of slavery, its attitudes to gender, its post-Brexit reckoning and repositioning.Accordingly, many of the albums shortlisted for this year’s Mercury prize reflect this time: preoccupying themselves with ideas of belonging, identity, home. From Little Simz’s Sometimes I Might Be Introvert to Joy Crookes’ Skin, Fergus McCreadie’s Forest Floor to Sam Fender’s Seventeen Going Under, they have captured something of our containment and our scrutiny. They bring us south London, Cornwall, North Shields, rural Caledonia; gentrification, race, the Department for Work and Pensions. Kojey Radical winds his album down with the voice of his mother. Gwenno opens Tresor with a homely invitation: “Welcome, sit down / Fancy a cuppa?” These are songs that move close, closer, closer still. Continue reading...",

        "description": "After COVID-19, young people have increased cholesterol, high body mass index, and less physical stamina for a time, research finds.\nAs a result, they may be more likely to develop metabolic disorders and cardiovascular complications in the long term.\nThe intermediate-term and long-term effects of SARS-CoV-2 infections on young adults have scarcely been investigated. Available original research tends to focus on sufferers who were hospitalized, elderly, or who have multiple morbidities. Or, existing research restricts evaluations to a single organ system.\nThe new study, conducted under the leadership of Patricia Schlagenhauf, professor at the Epidemiology, Biostatistics and Prevention Institute of the University of Zurich, appears in the journal The Lancet Infectious Diseases. The work took place between May and November 2021 with 29 female and 464 male participants with a median age of 21.\nOf the participants, 177 had confirmed COVID-19 more than 180 days prior to the testing day, and the control group was made up of 251 SARS-CoV-2 serologically negative individuals. Unlike other studies the novel test battery also evaluated cardiovascular, pulmonary, neurological, ophthalmological, male fertility, and psychological and general systems.\nThe findings show that young, previously healthy, non-hospitalized individuals largely recover from mild infection and that the impact of the SARS-CoV-2 virus on several systems of the body is less than that seen in older, multi-morbid, or hospitalized patients.\nHowever, the study also provided evidence that recent infections—even mild ones—can lead to symptoms such as fatigue, reduced sense of smell, and psychological problems for up to 180 days, as well as having a short-term negative impact on male fertility. For non-recent infections—more than 180 days back—these effects were no longer significant.\nFor those with non-recent infections, however, the study–which had a long follow-up–provided evidence of a potentially risky constellation: &#8220;Increased BMI, high cholesterol, and lower physical stamina is suggestive of a higher risk of developing metabolic disorders and possible cardiovascular complications,&#8221; says Schlagenhauf.\n&#8220;These results have societal and public-health effects and can be used to guide strategies for broad interdisciplinary evaluation of COVID-19 sequelae, their management, curative treatments, and provision of support in young adult populations.&#8221;\nThe study, conducted in collaboration with clinics at the University Hospital Zurich and Spiez Laboratory, is novel in that it quantitatively evaluated multi-organ function using a sensitive, minimally invasive battery of tests in a homogenous group of people several months after a COVID-19 infection. A valuable facet of the study was the control group, serologically confirmed to have had no SARS-CoV-2 exposure.\nThe Swiss Armed Forces funded the work.\nSource: University of Zurich\nThe post Even mild COVID has lingering effects on young adults appeared first on Futurity.",

I hope the long weekend treated everyone well, and the shortened week I just a nice four-day slide into another relaxing weekend.\nRather than lead off with anything deep, how about a Wednesday smile, with a Twitter story in two parts.\nThe Tigers were, predictably, doing poorly against the Angels on Monday when Kody Clemens was brought into pitch. Unlike his very famous father Roger, Kody is not a pitcher by trade, but maybe some skills wore off because he faced off against Shohei Ohtani and you should see his reaction to striking out the Angels superstar.\n\n\nSave that ball!

End-to-end encryption lets users of the company’s video cameras keep their footage locked down, making it accessible only on their enrolled iOS or Android device. Separately, Ring is also making it easier to save recorded videos when an owner sells or disposes of a Ring device\nWith end-to-end encryption enabled, no one but the camera’s owner can access recorded footage. Even if law enforcement asked Ring, or its parent company Amazon, for the video, they couldn't provide it.

        "description": "Photo By Winslow Townson/Getty Images\n    \n\n  In this episode of the show Jake and Bob discuss the Kiké Hernandez extension and why we should appreciate Xander Bogaert’s greatness.  What else is left to say about Xander Bogaerts? He came up through the system as a top prospect. He enjoyed immediate postseason success. He then went on to improve year over year of his major league career while carrying himself with the utmost professionalism on and off the field. Seems like a guy we should keep here for the long haul, don't you think?\nOn this episode I am joined by Bob Osgood to discuss not only Xander, but also the extension to Kiké Hernandez and what that means for the club headed into 2023. We also take a look at the performance of all of the recent September callups, discuss what it might cost to keep Michael Wacha, and decide whether or not Aaron Judge or Shohei Ohtani is more deserving of the AL MVP. \nLastly, we answered a bunch of your listener questions before ending the show.\nWe hope you enjoyed the show and if you did, make sure you subscribe to us on iTunes, Google Podcast, Spotify, or Stitcher. Also give the show a review. Five star reviews help us get in more ears and grow the show. Be sure to also follow us on Twitter. You can find Bob  @BobOsgood15  and you can find me @DevJake. Thanks for listening!",

        "description": "After a strong showing for Bowie Tuesday, Grayson Rodriguez is that much closer to wearing an Orioles uniform in the MLB.  | Photo by Mark Brown/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Orioles’ top pitching prospect took another step closer to the majors, while 2022 No. 1 pick Jackson Holliday also shined in a Delmarva win.  Triple-A: Memphis Redbirds (Cardinals) 12, Norfolk Tides 0\nThere wasn’t a whole lot of good to come out of AutoZone Park Tuesday night, as the Tides were dominated from the opening frame in a loss to Memphis. Starter Ryan Conroy gave up four runs (three earned) off five hits in his three innings of work. Zac Lowther relieved him, and things then proceeded to get worse, as Lowther allowed six runs over two innings. It was the classic “death by a thousand singles” situation for Norfolk, as only six of Memphis’ 18 hits went for extra bases. \nOffensively, the Tides did get two-hit nights from Joseph Ortiz (Orioles #19 prospect), Jordan Westburg (Orioles #5, MLB Top 100 #80) and Brett Phillips. While Memphis certainly plated plenty of runs off singles, Norfolk couldn’t match the trick. Zero extra-base hits resulted in zero runs scored for the Tides. The bright spot in the gloomy evening was the continued hot hitting of Ortiz. Since being promoted to Norfolk at the end of August, the former fourth-rounder is hitting .414 with a hit in all seven of his appearances for the Tides. Tuesday also marked Ortiz’s fourth multi-hit game since joining Norfolk.  \nBox Score\nDouble-A: Richmond Flying Squirrels (Giants) 7, Bowie Baysox 3\nThe good news out of Bowie Tuesday night was that Grayson Rodriguez (Orioles #2, MLB #4) looked great in his rehab start. The Orioles’ crown jewel of pitching prospects struck out four over two innings, while only allowing one hit and one run. If the front office remains consistent, his next stop could be in Norfolk. \nNow the bad news: as soon as Rodriguez exited, everything fell apart for the Baysox. Cade Povich (Orioles #15) came in and allowed four runs on three hits while only collecting two outs. Povich—the centerpiece of the Orioles’ return for Jorge Lopez—has now allowed 12 runs over 16.2 innings since being promoted to Bowie. The lefty’s rough outing saw the Baysox down 5-0 after three innings and the offense could not dig Bowie out of that hole. \nCoby Mayo (Orioles #7) had the only RBI hit for the Baysox, with a run-scoring single in the fifth. The other Bowie runs scored via a wild pitch and a Toby Welk double play ball. The performance for Mayo continues a hot start to September, one that has seen the power-hitting corner infielder hit .350 over his last five games.  \nBox Score\nHigh-A: Aberdeen IronBirds @ Jersey Shore BlueClaws (Phillies), PPD. due to rain\nTuesday afternoon the IronBirds announced the promotion of Dylan Beavers (Orioles #8), Max Wagner (Orioles #17) and Adam Retzbach from Delmarva. This turned out to be the day’s only highlight for Aberdeen, as their game against the BlueClaws was rained out. They’ll make it up with a doubleheader Wednesday in Lakewood. \nLow-A: Delmarva Shorebirds 5, Down East Wood Ducks (Rangers) 2\nDelmarva was the only winner in the Orioles’ organization Tuesday, as they jumped out to an early lead to shoot down the Wood Ducks. Jackson Holliday (Orioles #3, MLB #14) got the scoring started for Delmarva in the first, lacing a double to left field to score Carter Young (Orioles #29). The Shorebirds would add two more runs in the opening frame off singles from Reed Trimble and Noelberth Romero. \nTrimble added two more RBIs—one on a double in the sixth that scored Holliday and another in the 8th that scored Creed Willems. Holliday and Trimble were the offensive stars on the evening, finishing a combined 4-8 with three RBIs, three runs scored and two walks. \nStarter Juan Nunez led the way in an impressive overall outing for the Delmarva pitching staff. The 21-year-old Dominican allowed only one hit over four innings while striking out four. Dating back to August 25, Nunez now has a scoreless inning streak of 11 innings over his last three starts.\nBox Score\nWednesday’s Scheduled Games\n\nNorfolk Tides @ Memphis Redbirds, 6:05pm. Starting pitcher: TBD\nBowie Baysox vs. Richmond Flying Squirrels, 6:35pm. Starting pitcher: TBD\nAberdeen IronBirds @ Jersey Shore BlueClaws, Game 1, 5:35pm. Starting pitcher: TBD\nAberdeen IronBirds @ Jersey Shore BlueClaws, Game 2. Starting pitcher: TBD\nDelmarva Shorebirds vs. Down East Wood Ducks. Starting pitcher: TBD",

        "description": "Photo by Dustin Bradford/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Colorado Rockies news and links for Wednesday, September 7th, 2022 It would be easy to look at Ryan Feltner’s surface level stats and dismiss his rookie season. The right-hander has put up a less-than-stellar 5.85 ERA across 72.1 innings (14 starts) and while his 4.85 FIP is a bit more shiny, it’s still not what you’d call great. He’s had issues with homers, giving up 13 of them, and his walk and strikeout rates haven’t been anything out of the ordinary. Behind that surface, though, there are some interesting things going on with his pitch mix that could lead him to future success. Let’s talk about Ryan Feltner’s fastballs.\nThe Curse of the Average\nIn baseball, throwing an average fastball in an average way is a death sentence. MLB hitters are too good at crushing heaters, and if a pitch moves in a predictable way, they’re going to destroy it. Ryan Feltner has experienced this up close in the majors: batters have hit a whopping .333/.432/.643 against his four-seam fastball. For reference, Albert Pujols hit .337/.435/.640 during his absolute peak between 2003-2009. I’m sure you don’t need me to tell you that your fastball being hit like the slash line of the greatest first baseman of the integration era is suboptimal. What’s wrong with it?\nWell, it’s just a very average fastball, even if it might not look like it right away. It’s been 94.3 MPH on average, after all (and he’s gained velo this year). And Feltner is not a short strider like, for example, Germán Márquez, so his perceived velocity doesn’t suffer more than usual. So what’s the deal? Well, the velocity and extension are virtually average. MLB four-seamers are about 94 MPH on average, and Feltner’s extension of 6.4 feet is the exact MLB average. Couple that with unremarkable movement (some of that being courtesy of Coors Field) and a pretty conventional release point (Feltner throws slightly less over the top than average but it’s not a big difference, just over half a foot), and you have a recipe for a pitch that’s destined to get destroyed. Average velocity + average extension + relatively flat shape + average release point + Coors + a lack of sniper-like precision when commanding it = take a good look, you won’t see it for long.\nThe Solutions\nSo how does one overcome a middling four-seam fastball? In general, there are three solutions:\n\n\nThrow less fastballs. This solution has been employed by MLB pitchers as a whole over the last 20 years or so. Fastball usage has dropped significantly since the early 2000’s, as pitching strategy has gone from “establish your fastball” to “establish your best pitch and don’t throw your bad ones”. While Feltner does throw a relatively high amount of fastballs, that’s not a Feltner problem -it’s a Rockies problem. The Rox as a whole throw too many fastballs, but we’re tackling Ryan Feltner and not the Colorado Rockies as a whole, so let’s “dismiss” this solution.\n\nThrow an improved version of that fastball. This is a bit tricky. Since drastic changes in mechanics that could lead to a better fastball (lower release point, more extension) are tough to make at this stage and we’re going to keep things relatively simple, the only ways to make your fastball better are increasing velocity, increasing movement, improving location/sequencing or a mix of them all. Feltner’s velocity has already seen an uptick this season compared to previous seasons, but it’s not reasonable to assume he can safely average 96-98 instead of 94-96. Improving movement is also difficult. Ideally, you want your four-seamer to “rise” thanks to backspin (think Justin Verlander, Dwight Gooden, etc). Feltner has a solid amount of raw spin on his heater (2352 RPM this year, 75th percentile), but he doesn’t spin his fastball efficiently -his active spin is below 80%, which means that of all his raw spin, less than 80% of it is contributing to pitch movement. This could be altered with a change in grip and release, but since I don’t have access to that data, we’re going to go off the asumption that Feltner’s natural way to release a baseball doesn’t lend itself to perfect backspin. Some pitchers are naturally predisposed (or not) to certain pitch types, after all. For example, you may pronate your wrist very naturally during ball release. If you do that, chances are you’ll be able to throw a wicked changeup. Different variations of that idea apply to breaking balls and fastballs.\n\nThrow a different fastball. This is what I believe (with the data I have available) could be a good solution for Ryan, and it’s worked for other pitchers in recent years. Corbin Burnes became an ace overnight after ditching his middling four-seamer and switching to a cutter, for example. Pitchers who throw four-seamers with poor spin efficiency (below 90% is a good threshold) and/or heaters with low spin in general (sub 2200 RPMs, more or less) are always good candidates to switch to a sinker. It’s likely that Feltner and the Rockies were aware of this solution, because he started throwing one this season. And while its velocity is average, its shape is not, and that is what we’re going to take a look at.\n\nThe Sinker\nWe’ve spent a long time talking about the need to avoid average fastball shape, right? Well, here’s Feltner’s pitch movement from the catcher’s POV. Two things: the gear-shaped circles are the league average movement for the pitch type and the smoother circles are Feltner’s movement. Red is his four-seamer, orange is his sinker, green is the changeup, yellow the slider and blue the curveball:\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \nAs you can clearly see, his four-seamer is pretty flat, but look at that sinker (and that changeup, but that’s a topic for another time). It’s a bowling ball sinker -it runs a bit less than average, as you would expect from a Rockies pitcher given that Coors is the destroyer of horizontal movement, but it also sinks noticeably more. It’s not quite Marcus Stroman’s sinker in terms of movement, but it’s also thrown harder (93-95 MPH on average). Plus, there is something interesting going on with this pitch in terms of spin.\nThe concept of seam-shifted wake is a very interesting and important aspect of modern pitch design. The long explanation is in the link here, but the short explanation is the following: sometimes, due to how a pitcher releases a baseball, the direction of the ball’s spin can change as it approaches home plate because of the way the seams interact with the air around them. These deviations in spin direction can generate unexpected movement in a pitch, causing it to behave in a way the batter does not expect, and its effect is very noticeable on sinkers, sliders and changeups especially. Seam-shifted wake is the secret behind many of the best sinkers in baseball (Framber Valdez is a prime example). \nRyan Feltner’s sinker has that deviation. Think of a clock. His sinker leaves his hand at an angle of roughly 1:00 and ends at an angle of 2:15. It’s tied for the 12th largest difference in that direction among MLB pitchers with at least 50 sinkers thrown this year. Some of the guys in his ballpark? Marcus Stroman, Kyle Hendricks, Camilo Doval, Michael King, Pablo López, Adam Ottavino... and so on. You get the idea. There’s a lot of great sinkers on that list, and pitches that behave in a manner different to what the batter expects have a strong chance to be successful.\nThe Final Mix\nThis is a fastball you can theoretically build an arsenal around. It has outlier movement, solid velocity, and Feltner’s feel for it is pretty good given how relatively new it is to him. I’m not saying Feltner should ditch the four-seamer and only throw sinkers, by the way. There is value in having a different fastball you can use to change a batter’s eye level, so he doesn’t sit on something low. But I would say he should probably throw significantly more sinkers than four-seamers, and it seems like Feltner and the Rockies have been doing this already. Check out his pitch usage through the months in 2022:\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \nHe’s throwing that sinker more and his four-seamer less, which is great. His secondaries have been pretty stable in usage throughout the year, and their improvement is the next step on the road to becoming a good starter. Feltner’s slider is another relatively average pitch, which isn’t as bad in this case, but a harder and more vertical slider could probably work even better off of his sinker. His curveball is more of a show-me pitch at this point, as it’s more of a loopy breaking ball than a sharp breaker you can draw bad swings with. With that type of curveball, throwing it for strikes is pretty important, and he doesn’t do that quite as much as he could right now (39.7% of his curveballs are in the zone, which is just average). Then there’s his changeup, which I’m sure you noticed as well on the pitch movement chart for its extreme vertical profile and lack of run. The relationship between his sinker and changeup is worthy of a piece all by itself, but just know that it’s entirely possible for a changeup that runs a lot less than a sinker to be effective (see: Webb, Logan).\nFeltner is still putting the pieces together, as he’s openly said, but there’s a lot of good elements to work with here -and a clear path to being a permanent fixture in the Rockies rotation moving forward if it all starts to take shape. The lack of rotation depth has been one of the Achilles heels of this Rockies team, but Ryan Feltner is quietly taking a step forward to be part of the solution. He has untapped potential, and he might be getting to it.\n★ ★ ★\nZac Gallen Continues to Chase History | Fangraphs\nFor those unaware, D-Backs ace Zac Gallen is on an incredible run of 41 1⁄3 innings of scoreless ball. And his next start, if he goes on regular rest, will be against the Rockies.\nAdjustments key for Carlos Estévez in turnaround | Rox Pile\nCarlos Estévez has been quite good for the Rockies this season, and fixing his fastball’s movement profile has been key. He’s one of the few Rockies hurlers to consistently attacks hitters with high heat at the letters, and it’s paying off.\nOn The Farm\nTriple-A: El Paso Chihuahuas 14, Albuquerque Isotopes 3\nThe Isotopes (56-71) got trounced, to put it mildly, allowing 17 hits (four of them home runs) and four walks against El Paso. Starter Riley Smith was hit hard in five innings of work (5.0 IP, 9 H, 8 R, 4 BB, 1 K, 1 HR) and the bullpen didn’t fare much better as a whole the rest of the way. There were some bright spots, with Coco Montes going 3-for-5 with a double, Wynton Bernard reaching base three times and Nick Kennedy striking out a pair in a scoreless inning of relief, but there were not enough to win. Albuquerque will send Brandon Gold (6-5, 6.50 ERA) to the hill in today’s ballgame, looking to even up the series with El Paso.\nDouble-A: Somerset Patriots (NYY) at Hartford Yard Goats (COL)\nThe ballgame was suspended due to poor weather. Hartford will play a doubleheader against Somerset today to make it up.\nHigh-A: Spokane Indians 0, Tri-City Dust Devils 5\nSpokane’s bats getting dominated and managing just five hits (none for extra bases) and two walks was the story in this one as the Indians dropped below .500 (62-63), a rarity over the past two seasons. The clear bright spot in this ballgame was the performance of the bullpen, as Robinson Hernández, Shelby Lackey and Will Tribucher combined for 4 1⁄3 hitless, shutdown innings, keeping the game reasonably close. Unfortunately, the lineup couldn’t muster up a comeback, going 0-for-5 with runners in scoring position on top of the lack of thump, and it all leaves Spokane scrambling to get back over .500 for the first time in a while. Their starter for today’s ballgame is TBD at the time of writing this piece.\nLow-A: Fresno Grizzlies 12, San Jose Giants 6\nThe offensive troubles of other Rockies affiliates clearly did not extend to the Grizzlies (80-47), who continued to dominate and reached win number 80 on the season, clinching the 2nd-half division crown to pair with the 1st-half crown they already had. They hit four home runs in this one, with catcher Braxton Fulford sending two over the fence as part of a three-hit, four RBI performance. Benny Montgomery went 2-for-5 with a home run and five RBI, and the homer was a laser shot to right center:\n\n\nCollect career-high 5 RBIs ✔️Clinch 2nd-half division crown ✔️@Rockies No. 6 prospect Benny Montgomery went deep during a huge night for the @FresnoGrizzlies: https://t.co/vTF9Ljvrze pic.twitter.com/owUwGdJyVw— MLB Pipeline (@MLBPipeline) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nThe torrent of runs hid what was a relatively subpar pitching performance. 18-year-old top prospect Jordy Vargas started and had his worst outing in Low-A, struggling with his command and striking out only one batter (4.0 IP, 5 H, 4 R, 3 BB, 1 K, 1 HR). The bullpen kept things a bit more tidy, but Fresno still walked nine opposing batters on the day against just five total strikeouts. It’s still a comfortable win for the Grizzlies, however, as their terrifying lineup keeps eating up rival pitchers. Top prospect Jaden Hill (0-0, 1.50 ERA) will take the mound today after being scratched from his last start due to a regular illness.\n★ ★ ★\nPlease keep in mind our Purple Row Community Guidelines when you’re commenting.

Studying the subject gives students a safe and supportive environment in which to grow and flourish as writers – be that in prose, poetry or creative nonfiction.How you’ll learnTeaching is a mix of lectures and seminars. Working in small groups helps you hone skills such as self-editing, so you can critique your own work, and close reading so you can get the most from the texts you’ll study. Most courses will also help you produce your own portfolio of creative work. At Royal Holloway, for example, you will be taught by a mix of experts, authors, playwrights and poets. In terms of assessments, most places are 100% coursework, but there are some institutions that do essay assessments. You will submit portfolios covering a range of genres, such as poetry, prose and plays. At London Metropolitan University, students work collaboratively with the theatre, art and photography departments to make a book. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Venice film festival: Japanese director Kôji Fukada has crafted a richly painful and quietly comic human dramaMight the title be an instruction? If so, it’s not so easy to obey, judging from this movie from Japanese director Kôji Fukada who made such an impression with his sweet, Rohmeresque feature Goodbye Summer in 2013. (In fact, the title is taken from a Japanese pop song.) Love Life is an inexpressibly tragic and painful human drama about complicated lives, a movie that interleaves the utter desolation with a dry understated comedy and a sense of emotional tangle and chaos, a film that moreover blindsides its leading female character – and us, the audience – with an entirely unexpected coda section away from Japan in South Korea. In Shakespearean terms, this could be a filmic “problem play”.A married young couple are living together in a small flat: Taeko (Fumino Kimura) and her husband Jiro (Kento Nagayama) and their lively eight-year-old son Keita (Tetsuda Shimada) who is a prize-winning national junior champ at the boardgame Othello. Keita is in fact Taeko’s son from her previous marriage to an expatriate Korean national named Park (Atom Sunada), a difficult, damaged man who is deaf; he abandoned Taeko and Keita and is now presumed to be living rough somewhere. Taeko and Keita learned sign language from their time with Park and use it to communicate secretly without Keita’s stepfather realising what they’re saying. Continue reading...",

        "description": "A New Mexico state district court judge on Tuesday disqualified county commissioner and Cowboys for Trump cofounder Couy Griffin from holding public office for engaging in insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.The judgment from state District Court Judge Francis Mathew permanently bars Griffin from federal and local public office. It arrived amid a spate of lawsuits aimed at sidelining political candidates and elected officials linked to the Capitol riots.Griffin was previously convicted in federal court of a misdemeanor for entering Capitol grounds on Jan. 6, without going inside the building. He was sentenced to 14 days and given credit for time served.The new ruling immediately removes Griffin from his position as a commissioner in Otero County in southern New Mexico. He also is barred from serving as a presidential elector.“Mr. Griffin aided the insurrection even though he did not personally engage in violence,&quot; Mathew wrote. &quot;By joining the mob and trespassing on restricted Capitol grounds, Mr. Griffin contributed to delaying Congress’s election-certification proceedings.”Griffin said he was notified of his removal from office by Otero County staff, who prevented him from accessing his work computer and office space at a county building in Alamogordo.Griffin, who served as his own legal counsel at a two-day bench trial in August, called the ruling a “total disgrace” that disenfranchises his constituents in Otero County.“The actions that are being taken are, I believe, perfect evidence of the tyranny that we&#x27;re right now living under,” Griffin said. “The left continues to speak about democracy being under attack, but is this democracy? Whenever you&#x27;re removed from office by the civil courts by the opinion of a liberal judge.”A flurry of similar lawsuits around the country are seeking to punish politicians who took part in Jan. 6 under provisions of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, which holds that anyone who has taken an oath to uphold the Constitution can be barred from office for engaging in insurrection or rebellion.The provisions were put in place shortly after the Civil War.“It was written to deal with former Confederates ... and it&#x27;s basically been dormant ever since with one or two odd exceptions,” said Gerard Magliocca, a professor at the Indiana University Robert H. McKinney School of Law. “There was nothing else that could be described as an insurrection against the Constitution until Jan. 6.”At trial, Griffin invoked free speech guarantees in his defense and argued that removing him from office would cut against the will of the people and set a “dangerous precedent.” Elected in 2018, Griffin withstood a recall vote last year but isn’t running for reelection or other office in November.Mathew wrote that Griffin&#x27;s arguments “disregard that the Constitution itself reflects the will of the people.”Griffin “overlooks that his own insurrectionary conduct on January 6 sought to subvert the results of a free and fair election, which would have disenfranchised millions of voters.”The lawsuit against Griffin was brought by three plaintiffs in New Mexico with assistance from the Washington-based Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. Supportive briefs were filed by the NAACP and progressive watchdog group Common Cause. A federal court declined a recent request to take up the case.Tuesday&#x27;s judgment is “a historic win for accountability for the January 6th insurrection and the efforts to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power in the United States,&quot; Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics President Noah Bookbinder said in a statement.Griffin, a Republican, forged a group of rodeo acquaintances in 2019 into the promotional group called Cowboys for Trump that staged horseback parades to spread President Donald Trump’s conservative message about gun rights, immigration controls and abortion restrictions.This year, Griffin voted twice as a county commissioner against certifying New Mexico’s June 7 primary election, in a standoff over election integrity fueled by conspiracy theories about the security of voting equipment in the Republican-dominated county.Two other commissioners eventually agreed to certify, but Griffin cast the lone dissenting vote while acknowledging that he had no specific basis for questioning the results of the election — attributing his decision to “my gut feeling and my own intuition.”Griffin is among a dozen people charged in the Jan. 6 riot that had either held public office or ran for a government leadership post in the two and a half years before the attack. Of those, seven have been convicted of crimes for their participation.Unlike Griffin, the members of Congress targeted for disqualification were neither charged nor convicted of crimes associated with the Capitol riot.In Georgia, a federal judge allowed a 14th Amendment challenge against Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green to advance, but a state administrative law judge found there wasn’t sufficient evidence to back voters’ claims that she had engaged in insurrection, and Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger said Greene was qualified to run.Greene won her primary, and the Georgia Supreme Court upheld the decision last week to leave her on the ballot. The federal appeal is pending.In North Carolina, a federal judge blocked the state elections board from formally examining whether U.S. Rep. Madison Cawthorn, who spoke at the rally that preceded the riot, should remain on the state&#x27;s May 17 primary ballot.Cawthorn narrowly lost that election, and later in May a federal appeals court reversed the lower court decision. The panel of the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals said the trial judge got it wrong when he ruled that an 1872 law that removed office-holding disqualifications from most ex-Confederates also exempted current members of Congress like Cawthorn. The lawsuit was ultimately dismissed as moot because Cawthorn isn’t on the November ballot.Arizona state courts have kept U.S. Reps. Paul Gosar and Andy Biggs and a state legislator on the ballot amid efforts to disqualify them. A judge agreed in April with the lawmakers that Congress created no enforcement mechanism for the 14th Amendment, barring a criminal conviction.",

Magnus about his book A Philosophy of Covers Songs. Throughout, they explore various aspects associated with cover songs. The way often start as cover bands, at the very least starting as a fan. The history of covers, including the notion of &#8216;coverage&#8217; and playing the music people wanted to hear, as well as covering/hiding over other artists, making black artists white. The choice between a straight note for note cover versus a rendition, with the challenge as to change and what to keep. Extending from this, the cover can serve as a meditation on the original or even an answer, which is the case with Aretha Franklin&#8217;s cover of Otis Readings Respect. According to Magnus, there are three aspects associated with experiencing a cover, turns the listening onto something new, shows the listener something new in the song and creates a communal experience.The post 🎧 Wherefore the Cover Song?

        "description": "Jonathan Bernstein: &#8220;A decision Monday by a federal judge granting former President Donald Trump’s request for an independent review of the FBI’s seizure of documents at Mar-a-Lago last month has prompted an unusually forceful backlash within the legal community. It isn’t just partisan analysts who are reacting with dismay; criticism of Judge Aileen Cannon’s decision has been widespread.&#8221;\n&#8220;I’ll leave the specific ways that the decision fell short to legal specialists. But suffice to say there were a lot. The good news is that the judge’s decision has been so widely faulted that it could encourage media to resist the common temptation to hear out &#8216;both sides&#8217; of the argument when one side is so evidently flawed.&#8221;\n&#8220;The ruling also could motivate some Republican judges to shy away from hard-line decisions in order to avoid being labeled partisan — that is, nothing but apologists for their party and for Trump.&#8221;",

        "description": "Photo by Alex Trautwig/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Could Jordan Westburg, Grayson Rodriguez or any other prospect join an already impressive rookie class with the Orioles this season?  This season will be remembered for Baltimore’s surprise run, but it will also mark the year that the prospects arrived in Birdland. Adley Rutschman, Gunnar Henderson, DL Hall and Kyle Stowers led an impressive class of rookies making their way to Camden Yards. \nEach player added something different to the team. Now, with the season winding down, it’s fair to wonder whether any other prospects could make their major league debut this season. \nHenderson forced his way to Baltimore with a dominant season that started at Double-A Bowie. The 21-year-old leapfrogged several infield prospects to become the youngest player in the majors. Did Henderson’s promotion eliminate the possibility of another infielder getting the call?\nMany expected Jordan Westburg to get the nod before Henderson prior to this season. Westburg, Baltimore’s fifth ranked prospect, has slashed .256/.346/.493 in 69 games at Norfolk. The Orioles promoted Henderson and Westburg to Triple-A at the beginning of June, but many thought the 23-year-old’s age could get him to the big leagues before Henderson. \nLike Henderson, Westburg has moved around the diamond this season. Westburg has split time between second, short and third base. The Orioles have a crowded infield, but they will need to make room for Westburg next season. The presence of Rougned Odor and Ramón Urías eliminate any need, but Baltimore could option Terrin Vavra or designate Jesús Aguilar for assignment. \nGrayson Rodriguez seemed to be minutes from a promotion before suffering a Grade 2 lat strain June 1. Baltimore’s top pitching prospect made his second rehab start for Bowie last night and should rejoin Norfolk soon. Rodriguez appeared to have checked every box before suffering the injury, but nobody could blame Baltimore for pushing his debut to 2023. \nIt remains to be seen how many innings the organization will give him in September. The Orioles will protect him from the Rule 5 draft this winter, and Rodriguez will be favored to break camp with the team in 2023. The 22-year-old has expressed a desire to pitch in the big leagues this season, but the Orioles could view it as an unnecessary risk. Rodriguez would retain his rookie eligibility if given a cup of coffee this year. \nWestburg and Rodriguez represent the highest ranked candidates to debut this season. Colton Cowser, Baltimore’s fourth best prospect, just received a promotion to Norfolk last week. Cowser started the year with Aberdeen, but a sizzling second half has brought him one level from the bigs. \nThe Orioles have plenty of depth in the outfield with Stowers and Ryan McKenna backing up the starting trio. Yusniel Diaz remains on the 40-man roster after debuting earlier this season, and DJ Stewart could be used if the club needed additional depth. \nCowser will not be Rule-5 eligible this offseason, so Baltimore does not need to add him to the 40-man until ready to promote him. Even a cup of coffee feels out of the question, but Cowser has put himself in a position for an early debut next season. \nJoey Ortiz, the Orioles 19th-best prospect, joined Cowser in Triple-A at the end of August. Ortiz has always received high marks defensively, but he slashed .355/.425/.634 in his final 47 games with the Tides. Ortiz impressed by going 10-for-25 in his first six games at Norfolk, but he likely sits behind Westburg in line for a promotion. \nThe Orioles claimed Chris Vallimont on waivers back in May. The former Twins prospect is on the 40-man roster, but likely ranks below Mike Baumann and Matt Harvey for any potential spot starts. The 25-year-old holds a 5.36 ERA and 1.356 WHIP in 12 appearances for Norfolk. \nDrew Rom and Kyle Brnovich will need protected prior to the Rule 5 draft but neither appears set to debut this season. Brnovich underwent Tommy John surgery earlier this year.\nThe third catcher was once a September staple, but reduced roster expansion has made the position increasingly rare. The Orioles will not need another catcher unless Adley Rutschman or Robinson Chirinos suffers an injury. Anthony Bemboom and Jacob Nottingham are both on the 7-day injured list, so Cody Roberts or Ramon Rodriguez could potentially sneak their way into a game if the perfect storm hit.\nA healthy September would likely prevent any additional big league debuts this season, but Grayson Rodriguez could be the exception if he gets his wish.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/yankees-dfa-luke-bard.html",
        "description": "11:43AM: The Yankees have made their host of moves official, including Rizzo&#8217;s IL placement, Bard&#8217;s DFA, and Guzman&#8217;s selection to the active roster.  In addition, third baseman Josh Donaldson was placed on the paternity list, right-hander Deivi Garcia was called up from Triple-A, and Miguel Andujar was called up as the 29th man for today&#8217;s doubleheader.\n8:02AM: The Yankees have designated right-hander Luke Bard for assignment, as first indicated on the team&#8217;s transaction log at MLB.com. Presumably, his 40-man spot will go to first baseman Ronald Guzman, who was in the clubhouse yesterday and is set to be selected to the big league roster to fill the spot of the injured Anthony Rizzo. However, the Yankees have yet to formally announce the move, so it remains to be seen whether there are additional transactions on the horizon.\nBard, 31, was a waiver claim out of the Rays organization a month ago but has appeared in just one game with the Yankees (during which he tossed a shutout inning). He&#8217;s spent the rest of his stint with the organization in Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, where he&#8217;s yielded four earned runs on nine hits and four walks with eight punchouts in eight innings of work.\nOverall, Bard carries a 1.80 ERA in 15 big league frames and a 4.78 mark in 32 Triple-A innings. The 2022 season as marked Bard&#8217;s first game action since 2020, as he missed the entire 2021 campaign while rehabbing from April hip surgery &#8212; an injury that ultimately ended a four-year stint in the Angels organization.\nBard has now appeared in parts of four minor league seasons and between the Halos, Rays and Yankees, recording a 4.44 ERA in 81 innings. This year&#8217;s 94.1 mph average on his fastball is right in line with previous seasons, as is his top-of-the-charts spin rate on the pitch; Bard led the Majors in four-seam spin in 2018-19 and is in the 99th percentile this season. That trait alone obviously isn&#8217;t going to lead to instant success, but it&#8217;s been appealing enough to keep Bard on 40-man rosters for the bulk of the past several years.\nAt this point in the season, the Yankees won&#8217;t have any choices with Bard other than to place him on outright waivers or release waivers. Either way, he&#8217;ll be made available to the 29 other clubs. He&#8217;s been outrighted once in the past, when he cleared waivers last October while still on the mend from that hip procedure. As such, even if he goes unclaimed on waivers, he&#8217;d have the ability to reject an outright assignment to Scranton in favor of free agency.",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Stanton needs to fix up his timing to break out of his slump. Typically we highlight the best of the best at-bats on this weekly series, but today, we’re taking this as an opportunity to figure out what’s wrong with Giancarlo Stanton. This has been the worst statistical season of his career, but it’s not exactly clear why. We know the injury has plagued him for the better part of the year, but even so, we know he has played banged up in the past and still been at least a 130 wRC+ hitter. \nHe is a streaky hitter. We know that as truth. However, even in his slumps he manages to be a decently productive hitter. This June was an extreme example of that (142 wRC+ and .176 batting average), but it’s still a good representation of him being able to find his pitch when his timing and/or pitch recognition is not at its finest. Anyways, I’m going to use an at-bat Big G had against Chris Archer as an opportunity to point out some the key things he needs to overcome to lift himself out of this slump.\n\nStandard take here on a 0-0 count. I’ve never been able to predict when Stanton will ambush the first pitch or not. He does on fastballs and breaking balls against all types of pitchers, making it very difficult to do so. There isn’t much to take away from this pitch, but I’ll leave you with this. Pay attention to when Stanton starts up his load on every pitch for the rest of the at-bat. 0-1 count.\n\nThe toe tap has always been something in Stanton’s game to keep him grounded. Many hitters do it and have done it, one of them being Derek Jeter. He obviously used it in a different way from Stanton, but the idea behind it is the same. Keep your rhythm and energy flowing as you prepare for the pitch to come in. \n\nIf you remember the AB of the Week from last week, you’d recall that Stanton had multiple good takes through the course of the at-bat. A similar theme carried on here. He isn’t chasing pitches he can’t do damage with or make contact with. He is doing a decent job at waiting for something to come to him, but simply isn’t able to do much damage when it does. In this 2-1 count, I was hoping for Stanton to get started early and get his barrel out in front of the plate. \n\nUnfortunately, Stanton did not. A very common saying to hear in the baseball community is to get your foot down on time. That cue never made much sense to me. I know it works for some, but it makes more sense to me to get your foot up on time. Rushing your swing is never a good idea. It throws off the kinetic chain and can lead to too heavy of a landing. I’m guessing this is a physical limitation Stanton is having. As a hitter with more bat speed than anybody on the planet, he doesn’t have to get up too soon. That can be a perfect explanation as to why he isn’t crushing backed up sliders like this one, or swinging through a 94-mph Chris Archer fastball like he did in his first at-bat.\n\nEven in giving himself less time to pull the trigger, he is still recognizing pitches well and laying off a nicely tunneled two-pitch sequence. In this full count, I want the same thing from Stanton. Get the barrel out in front of the zone and give yourself enough to do so!\n\nUgh. I know it’s a body thing, rather than a swing hole, but it’s still sad to see. Stanton hitting sliders for hard groundballs isn’t the best sign. He is going to hit rocket groundballs to second base frequently because of his flat swing, but those usually come on fastballs not sliders. T\nhis tells me his point of contact isn’t where it needs to be. His 109 mph exit velocity is useless if he’s making deep contact on sliders. Get the barrel out slightly more and you have a line drive up the middle or in the gap. I’m not sure he will be at 100 percent at any point for the rest of the season, so I hope he tries to make this timing adjustment to give himself a chance to lift these pitches. He is so strong and has such great pitch recognition that he doesn’t need to be 100 percent to give the Yankees what they need. Fingers crossed the ankle stays manageable and he can work around this.",

I think this is really interesting idea, the use of badges as stepping stones. My question though is what students do with these badges. For me, I am really intrigued by the idea of &#8216;constellations&#8217;.\n\nIn contrast to perspective badge ecosystems, constellations offer an open-ended approach where users can choose from a range of possibilities, carving out any number of pathways. This is conducive to lifelong learning and offers the potential to collected together different achievements to write your own learning story.

        "description": "Donmar Warehouse, LondonThe stage adaptation of Kavita Puri’s extraordinary oral history project is at times superficial and blunt but also deeply movingFew English-language writers have catalogued the real, lived experience of partition, that bloody historical watershed in 1947 when British rule came to an end in India but not before the Raj had carved up the land and redrawn boundaries that sparked communal violence and mass migration of epic proportions.Salman Rushdie fictionalised it in Midnight’s Children, Hanif Kureishi wrote of it in his memoir of 2004, but then, on the 70th anniversary of Indian independence, the journalist and broadcaster Kavita Puri began an extraordinary oral project, recording the experiences of British Asians, many of whom had hitherto kept silent. That became the immensely moving BBC radio series Partition Voices, which in turn became a book of the same name. Now comes the play adapted by Sonali Bhattacharyya, Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti, Ishy Din and Alexandra Wood as a third incarnation of the project. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The righthander acquired in trade a month ago made quite an impression in his MLB debut. Now THAT was a major league debut!\nHayden Wesneski, acquired August 1 from the Yankees for Scott Effross, threw five shutout innings in his first MLB game, striking out eight, helping lead the Cubs to a 9-3 win over the Reds on a beautiful Tuesday evening at Wrigley Field, ending a three-game losing streak.\nMuch, much more on Wesneski a bit later, but first let’s rewind to the beginning of this satisfying win.\nWade Miley came off the injured list Tuesday to make his first big-league start since June 10. It did not start well. Miley walked the first hitter he faced and then an error by Nick Madrigal put runners on first and second. Kyle Farmer blooped a ball into short right field that was misplayed into a triple by Seiya Suzuki and both runners scored to make it 2-0 Reds.\nYikes.\nMiley, though, settled down with no further damage in the first inning.\nThe Cubs got one of those runs back in the bottom of the inning. With two out, Ian Happ smashed a baseball into the bleachers [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nMiley got touched up for another run in the third on a solo homer by Farmer, but Farmer’s two hits were the only ones off Miley, who departed after four innings having thrown 69 pitches. It was a good outing, and I assume Miley will get more of them as September continues.\nUnless, of course, Wesneski has something to say about that after his stellar outing, and who knows?\nAnyway, Wesneski began his evening with a scoreless fifth, interrupted only by a walk, with a pair of strikeouts. Then the Cubs got to work and erased the deficit. Alfonso Rivas led off the bottom of the fifth with a walk. Christopher Morel sacrificed him to second, just the Cubs’ 11th sac bunt of 2023. One out later, Suzuki tied the game [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nSo it’s 3-3 entering the sixth. Wesneski dispatched the Reds 1-2-3 and then the Cubs took the lead. Nico Hoerner led off with a single and Rafael Ortega walked. Then Yan Gomes laid down a sacrifice, advancing the runners to second and third. That’s the second time this year the Cubs have had two sac bunts in one game; the other was that wacky 12-inning game against the White Sox May 29. Before this year, the last time the Cubs had two sac bunts in one game by position players happened September 23, 2017 against the Brewers.\nAnyway, Gomes’ sac paid off, as Nick Madrigal gave the Cubs the lead [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cubs extended the lead to 8-3 in the seventh. Franmil Reyes led off with a single and Hoerner was hit by a pitch. Two outs later, P.J. Higgins walked to load the bases. Christopher Morel brought two runs home with this hit [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nMadrigal walked to re-load the bases and Suzuki walked on a 3-2 count to force in another run [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cubs’ final run came in the eighth. Hoerner sent a triple down the left-field line with one out and scored on this sacrifice fly by Ortega [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile all this was going on, Wesneski was mowing down Reds hitters. After the fifth-inning walk he retired 11 straight Reds before allowing a pair of hits in the ninth. It was clear he was running out of gas and David Ross had Manuel Rodriguez warming up, but Wesneski reached back for a little more and struck out the last two hitters he faced. Here’s the final out, on a nasty slider [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the movement on this pitch!\n\n\nHayden Wesneski, Two Seamer and Breaking Ball Movement. pic.twitter.com/mV5naigWw6— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nI promised you much more on Wesneski and here are some fun facts courtesy of BCB’s own JohnW53!\n\nHayden Wesneski tonight became just the second Cubs pitcher since 1901 to pitch at least three innings in relief in his Major League debut and allow no runs.\nOn April 8, 1973, Ray Burris gave up two hits, walked two and struck out two in 3⅓ innings of a 2-5 loss at home to the Expos.\nThere had been 36 Cubs relievers before tonight who pitched at least three innings in their debuts.\nWesneski gave up no hits in his first 4⅓.\nFour of the 36 allowed just one hit: Al Carson (4⅔ IP in 1910), Ben Johnson (5⅔ IP in 1959), Bill Caudill (3 IP in 1979) and Adbert Alzolay (4 IP in 2019).\nWesneski’s eight strikeouts are the most among all 37 pitchers. Paul Erickson had six in 7⅓ innings in 1941 and Anderson Espinoza had six in four innings on May 30 against the Brewers. Both walked three. Wesneski walked one.\n\nBut wait, there’s more!\n\n\nPer the Cubs, Hayden Wesneski is the first reliever in MLB history (since at least 1901) to log 5+ shutout innings with no more than two hits allowed, plus 8+ strikeouts, in an MLB debut.A lot of qualifiers there, but... history!— Jordan Bastian (@MLBastian) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nHayden Wesneski is the 1st Cubs reliever with at least 5 scoreless innings and 8 strikeouts in a game since Tom Phoebus on June 3, 1972 at the Padres.— Meghan Montemurro (@M_Montemurro) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nWesneski talked about his debut after the game on Marquee [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nMore from Wesneski:\n\n\nHayden Wesneski, on Cubs fans after the final out:“They're loud. I didn't think Chicago on a Tuesday would get this loud. I can't even imagine the playoffs and stuff like that. I was so stoked.”— Jordan Bastian (@MLBastian) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nMiley on Wesneski:\n\n\nA smiling Wade Miley as he entered the media room for his postgame interview: “Why do you want to talk to me? Did you see what that kid (Wesneski) just did? I was just the opener.” #Cubs— Meghan Montemurro (@M_Montemurro) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat impressed Wade Miley about Wesneski's outing?\"Everything. I don't know if it gets a whole lot better than that. Maybe let him start next time and just let him have it.\"Miley said it was fun to watch the pitches on TV: \"The slider moves eight feet. He's got good stuff.\"— Jordan Bastian (@MLBastian) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nHere’s David Ross on this game and Wesneski’s debut [VIDEO].\n\n\n\n\n\nWill Wesneski get some starts in the time remaining this season? Cubs President of Baseball Operations Jed Hoyer was noncommittal:\n\nThe Cubs told Wesneski a few days ago they wanted to use him out of the bullpen to help control his innings.\n“They just want to give me options,” Wesneski said. “We’ll see how it goes the rest of the year. I mean, we still have a month to get to work, but for now I’m out of the pen. That’s fine. I’ve done it before and we’ll figure it out.”\nHoyer did not commit to the Cubs wanting to look at Wesneski in a starting role at some point over the final four weeks. He cited the health of the Cubs’ other starters as a factor in that decision.\n“Honestly, I could easily see that, but we’ll kind of take it game by game,” Hoyer said. “We’ll start him in the bullpen and you could easily see a scenario where that happens. But we’re not going to force that.”\n\nAs always, we await developments. But for now, the complaint department door is closed and locked up tight after this nicely-played win and excellent MLB debut.\nOne last fun fact about this game: Miley and Wesneski combined for 14 strikeouts. Cubs pitchers have struck out 14 or more in a nine-inning game five times this year. Four of those have been against the Reds.\nThe Cubs will go for two in a row over the Reds Wednesday evening at Wrigley Field. Another rookie who’s already made a good impression, Javier Assad, will start for the Cubs and Mike Minor will go for Cincinnati. Game time is again 6:40 p.m. CT and TV coverage will be via Marquee Sports Network.",

The good news is that the judge’s decision has been so widely faulted that it could encourage media to resist the common temptation to hear out &#8216;both sides&#8217; of the argument when one side is so evidently flawed.&#8221;\n&#8220;The ruling also could motivate some Republican judges to shy away from hard-line decisions in order to avoid being labeled partisan — that is, nothing but apologists for their party and for Trump.&#8221;",

        "description": "Will Donald Trump be charged with a crime? Will Hunter Biden be indicted? Those questions may be answered in due course, but due course is not likely to be anytime in the next two months.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith Labor Day behind us and the November midterm elections just over the horizon, the “60-day rule” against major prosecutorial moves is triggered, meaning … well, it’s not clear exactly what it means, probably because there is no rule.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the interests of avoiding the specter of having elections decided by law enforcement actions, the Department of Justice (DOJ) follows loose guidance that cautions against taking major public steps in investigations that could influence political campaigns. The objective is to forfend such scandals as Special Counsel Lawrence Walsh’s nakedly political and substantively meritless indictment of former Reagan Defense Secretary Casper Weinberger just four days before the 1992 presidential election. Shortly after President Reagan’s successor, then-President George H. W. Bush, lost that election to President Bill Clinton, a federal judge threw out the indictment over legal shortcomings. Bush ultimately pardoned Weinberger in connection with the Iran-Contra affair that Walsh spent years investigating.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt does not take much deliberation to grasp why the 60-day guidance is admonitory rather than mandatory. Plainly, there are some situations in which it would be irresponsible for the DOJ to refrain from law enforcement actions that could become public in a politically fraught case. For example, if there were legitimate fears of evidence-tampering and -destruction, or of witness intimidation, it would be irresponsible for prosecutors to turn a blind eye just because an election was on the horizon. Also, if the investigation involved a continuing crime, as opposed to a post facto probe of a completed crime, prosecutorial delay would contribute to additional law violations against innocent victims.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome politically fraught cases, moreover, involve potential threats to American national security — a concern the Justice Department has highlighted as its rationale for seeking a judicial search warrant to search former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate. We need not venture a premature judgment on whether that concern was valid. For present purposes, the point is that, in principle, it would be wrongheaded in national security cases for law enforcement officials to drag their feet in a manner that prioritized the political calendar over protecting defense secrets, and the methods and sources for obtaining them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn my many years in federal law enforcement, my objection to the 60-day rule was more basic: Failing to take action can be just as prejudicial as taking action. Let’s say the FBI had overwhelming evidence that a candidate for public office was taking bribes or involved in a fraud scheme, and let’s assume that the evidence was sufficiently compelling that, in an ordinary case, arrest and indictment would proceed. It would be perverse for the suspected politician to get extra solicitude — consideration that the average person would not get — because he is seeking an office of public trust that, the evidence shows, he is unfit to hold.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nObviously, I am not saying that consequential action ought to be taken on the basis of weak evidence or, a la Walsh, legal deficiencies. I am simply saying that when an investigation has reached the point where charges are appropriate, the presumption should be in favor of filing charges. Otherwise, the public would be denied information that would be given in a normal case, and we could end up with a corrupt person in office.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBecause there actually is no written 60-day rule, there is also some vagueness on the matter of to whom the “rule” purportedly applies. In the months before the 2020 election, for example, then-Attorney General Bill Barr took pains to say that no one potentially implicated in prosecutor John Durham’s “Russiagate” investigation was on the ballot; ergo, the guidance against taking major investigative steps (including possible charges) on the eve of an election did not apply. The public took this to mean that then-candidate Joe Biden was not a subject of the probe, but that Durham might file charges against other former officials.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNevertheless, an investigative subject need not be on the ballot for law enforcement actions to have an impact on elections. Obviously, Biden’s poll numbers have ticked up a bit, as have polls forecasting the midterm prospects of congressional Democrats, in the past four weeks during which controversy over the Mar-a-Lago search has been in the public spotlight. The fact that Trump is not on the ballot has not stopped Democrats from treating the midterms as if he were.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnalogously, Hunter Biden was not on the ballot in 2020 but Democrats and their media friends labored zealously to keep scandalous stories about him out of the public eye in the campaign’s closing weeks. They understood that potential law enforcement influence over the election’s outcome did not necessarily hinge on whether Biden fils was a candidate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn any event, rather than a 60-day-rule, we should see the Justice Department as aspiring to a rule of reason: In the absence of good cause, do not take unnecessary public action that could unfairly prejudice one side of an election campaign; but also, do not refrain from taking arguably necessary public action when omission would damage the public interest, even if that means the action may have some impact on elections.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrior to the midterms, I don’t expect consequential action, such as indictments, in the investigations involving Donald Trump and Hunter Biden. But proper law enforcement actions should not be seen as prohibited, either. Over the past eight years, we’ve had too many instances of investigators trying to game the electoral calendar. They should just stick to law enforcement. It’s a hard enough job.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Andrew C.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/wire/3632107-trump-ambassador-kelly-craft-joins-kentucky-governors-race/",
        "description": "FRANKFORT, Ky. (AP) — Former United Nations Ambassador Kelly Craft launched her long-anticipated campaign for Kentucky governor on Wednesday, saying the state's “best days are ahead of us” as she joined a crowded lineup of Republicans competing to challenge Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear next year.\n\n\n\nCraft has spent years cultivating connections within the GOP as she and her husband, coal magnate Joe Craft, donated millions of dollars to Republican candidates. Now as she transitions from party activist to political candidate, she enters the fray with advantages — the ability to tap into her family's wealth to finance her campaign and her resume from Republican Donald Trump's presidency.\n\n\n\nCraft touted her Kentucky roots and offered broad themes in her campaign announcement.\n\n\n\n“I’m running for governor because I know our best days are ahead of us,\" Craft said in a news release. “This movement is for all of us who still believe that we can lead in education, that government doesn’t get a seat at our kitchen table and that our kids should grow up in safe neighborhoods.”\n\n\n\nFor more than a year, political insiders from both major parties in Kentucky had wondered if, or when, Craft would enter the hotly contested GOP primary for governor. The party votes are in May 2023 and the general election is in November 2023.\n\n\n\nTrump first appointed Craft to serve as U.S. ambassador to Canada. During her tenure, Craft played a role in facilitating the U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, Trump’s long-sought revamp of the North American Free Trade Agreement. The updated trade deal has benefited workers, farmers and businesses in Kentucky and across the country, Craft's campaign release said Wednesday.\n\n\n\nIn 2019,&nbsp;Trump appointed Craft&nbsp;to serve as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations.\n\n\n\nBut her connections with Trump, who easily carried Kentucky in the 2016 and 2020 presidential elections, were neutralized&nbsp;by his endorsement&nbsp;this year of Republican Attorney General Daniel Cameron’s bid for governor in the Bluegrass State.\n\n\n\nCraft was born in Lexington — the state's second-largest city — and was raised on her family's farm near Glasgow in south-central Kentucky.\n\n\n\nThe Crafts have been major donors in supporting academic initiatives and institutions in the state, and she stressed her commitment to education in her campaign rollout. She pledged to direct “maximum financial resources” to support education, calling it the “most important duty” for government, while cautioning that it “has to be in partnership with parents.\"\n\n\n\nKentucky has tilted decidedly toward the GOP in recent years, but Beshear has consistently received strong approval ratings from Kentuckians in polls.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic governor is expected to highlight his management of the state’s economy in asking voters for a second term. Kentucky has posted records for job creation and investments during his term and has recorded its&nbsp;lowest-ever unemployment rates.\n\n\n\nBeshear also has won bipartisan praise for&nbsp;his administration's responses&nbsp;to epic natural disasters — tornadoes that tore through western Kentucky last December and historic flooding that inundated parts of eastern Kentucky in late July.\n\n\n\nBesides Craft and Cameron, the GOP candidates for governor include state Agriculture Commissioner Ryan Quarles, state Auditor Mike Harmon and state Rep. Savannah Maddox.",

        "description": "Sens. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine) on Tuesday penned an op-ed in The Washington Post urging their colleagues to pass legislation guaranteeing federal protections for marriage equality.\n\n\n\nThe two called on the Senate to pass the Respect for Marriage Act, which would guarantee legal marriage regardless of a couple’s sex, race, ethnicity or national origin.\n\n\n\n“Individuals in same-sex and interracial marriages need, and should have, the confidence that their marriages are legal,” Baldwin and Collins said in the op-ed. “These loving couples should be guaranteed the same rights and freedoms of every other marriage.”\n\n\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act, which passed the House in July, would repeal the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act that defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman and allowed states to refuse to recognize same-sex marriage.\n\n\n\n“While a wedding ceremony and party are rites of passage that everyone should be able to enjoy if they wish, a legally binding marriage comes with another set of amazing rights and responsibilities,” Baldwin and Collins added, noting the tax benefits and the right to visit spouses in the hospital.\n\n\n\nA 2013 Supreme Court ruling found that the portion of the Defense of Marriage Act that prevented the government from recognizing same-sex marriages for the provision of federal benefits was unconstitutional, effectively legalizing same-sex marriage. However, the law has remained in place.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFollowing the Supreme Court’s decision in June to overturn Roe v. Wade, the right to privacy — which was previously used by the courts to guarantee interracial and same-sex marriage without codification by Congress — has been called into question.\n\n\n\nSenate Democrats have recently considered adding the issue of marriage equality to the short-term government funding bill that Congress must pass by the end of the month. However, a spokesperson for Baldwin told Politico that the congresswoman is not in favor of this approach.\n\n\n\n“That is not the Senator's preferred path as she would like to see it taken up sooner,” Baldwin’s spokesperson said.",

        "description": "Just yesterday, Robby shared some exciting details on the latest 12th Gen Core i3 CPU that powers the 16-inch ASUS Chromebook Flip CX5601. It turns out that the raw CPU power of the Alder Lake Core i3 is nearly on par with its more-powerful Core i5 and Core i7 siblings. With Octane scores over 80,000, the new Intel Core i3 CPU offers up enough horsepower to handle practically any workload you may throw at it. \n\n\n\nThis is great news for those who want a powerful Chromebook but aren&#8217;t concerned about getting the Iris Xe graphics found on the Core i5 and Core i7 models. The only foreseeable drawback there is that you likely won&#8217;t have access to Steam gaming on ChromeOS with the Core i3 but most people aren&#8217;t going out to buy a new Chromebook at the moment with Steam gaming as their top priority. All this to say, the 12th Gen Intel CPUs are insanely fast and any Chromebook you buy with a Core i3 or better is going to outperform anything on the market. \n\n\n\nAnyway, we&#8217;ll be seeing more 12th Gen devices hitting shelves over the coming months but one particular model is available at Best Buy and it&#8217;s already on sale. The aforementioned  ASUS Chromebook Flip CX5601is powered by a 12th Gen Intel Core i3, 8GB of RAM, and a respectable 128GB of storage. Featuring a 16-inch, 16:10 display, the ASUS CX5601 is a whole lot of Chromebook for its relatively low retail price of only $649. The powerful internals alone make it well worth that MSRP but despite being new to the market, this powerful ChromeOS convertible is already on sale. \n\n\n\nThe $100 discount brings the ASUS CX5601 down to $549 which is an incredible value. Not only are you getting a large Chromebook with an immersive display, but you&#8217;re also getting tons of CPU power in a device that will continue to get updates through June of 2030. Yeah, you read that correctly. 12th Gen Intel Chromebooks are guaranteed seamless OS updates well into 2030. That takes the value of this Chromebook to a whole new level when you factor out the cost over the next eight years. This deal will likely be gone sooner than later. So, if you&#8217;re looking for the latest and greatest, this is a great option at an affordable price. Check out the ASUS Chromebook Flip CX5601 over at Best Buy. \n\n\n\n\nASUS Chromebook CX5601\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Men with low testosterone levels who are diagnosed with COVID-19 are more likely to become seriously ill and end up in the hospital than men with normal levels, a new study shows.\nResearchers analyzed the cases of 723 men who tested positive for COVID-19, mostly in 2020 before vaccines were available. The data indicate that low testosterone is an independent risk factor for COVID-19 hospitalization, similar to diabetes, heart disease, and chronic lung disease.\nThe researchers found that men with low testosterone who developed COVID-19 were 2.4 times more likely to require hospitalization than men with hormone levels in the normal range. Further, men who were once diagnosed with low testosterone but successfully treated with hormone replacement therapy were no more likely to be hospitalized for COVID-19 than men whose testosterone levels had always tested in the normal range.\nThe findings, in JAMA Network Open, suggest that treating men with low testosterone may help protect them against severe disease and reduce the burden on hospitals during COVID-19 waves.\n&#8220;It is very likely that COVID-19 is here to stay,&#8221; says co-senior author Abhinav Diwan, a professor of medicine at Washington University in St. Louis who treats patients at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. Diwan is also a professor of cell biology &amp; physiology, and of obstetrics &amp; gynecology.\n&#8220;Hospitalizations with COVID-19 are still a problem and will continue to be a problem because the virus keeps evolving new variants that escape immunization-based immunity. Low testosterone is very common; up to a third of men over 30 have it. Our study draws attention to this important risk factor and the need to address it as a strategy to lower hospitalizations.&#8221;\nDiwan and co-senior author Sandeep Dhindsa, an endocrinologist at Saint Louis University, previously had shown that men hospitalized with COVID-19 have abnormally low testosterone levels. However, severe illness or traumatic injury can cause hormone levels to drop temporarily.\nData from men who are already hospitalized with COVID-19 doesn’t really answer the question of whether low testosterone is a risk factor for severe COVID-19 or a result of it. For that, the researchers needed to know whether men with chronically low testosterone levels get sicker than men with normal levels.\nDiwan, Dhindsa, and colleagues—including coauthor Cosette Champion, an internal medicine resident at Barnes-Jewish—conducted a chart review of patients at SSM Health and BJC HealthCare, two major hospital systems in the St. Louis area. They identified 723 men whose testosterone levels had been measured between January 1, 2017, and December 31, 2021, and who had documented cases of COVID-19 in 2020 or 2021.\nIn some cases, testosterone levels were measured after the patient recovered from COVID-19. Since low testosterone is a chronic condition, men who tested low a few months after recovering from COVID-19 probably had low levels before as well, Dhindsa says.\nThe researchers identified 427 men with normal testosterone levels, 116 with low levels, and 180 who previously had low levels but were being successfully treated, meaning that they were on hormone replacement therapy and their testosterone levels were in the normal range at the time they developed COVID-19.\n&#8220;Low testosterone turned out to be a risk factor for hospitalization from COVID, and treatment of low testosterone helped to negate that risk,&#8221; Dhindsa says. &#8220;The risk really takes off below a level of 200 nanograms per deciliter, with the normal range being 300 to 1,000 nanograms per deciliter. This is independent of all other risk factors that we looked at: age, obesity, or other health conditions. But those people who were on therapy, their risk was normal.&#8221;\nMen with low testosterone levels can experience sexual dysfunction, depressed mood, irritability, difficulty with concentration and memory, fatigue, loss of muscular strength, and a reduced sense of well-being overall. When a man’s quality of life is clearly diminished, he is typically treated with testosterone replacement therapy. When the symptoms are mild, though, doctors and patients may hesitate to treat.\nThe two main concerns related to testosterone therapy are an increased risk of prostate cancer and heart disease. Prostate cancer is common in older men, and it is often driven by testosterone. Boosting testosterone could possibly speed the growth of such cancers, worsening the disease. For heart disease, the evidence for risk is more ambiguous. A large clinical trial on the relationship between heart health and testosterone supplementation is expected to be completed soon.\n&#8220;In the meantime, our study would suggest that it would be prudent to look at testosterone levels, especially in people who have symptoms of low testosterone, and then individualize care,&#8221; says Diwan, whose specialty is cardiology.\n&#8220;If they are at really high risk of cardiovascular events, then the doctor could engage the patient in a discussion of the pros and cons of hormone replacement therapy, and perhaps lowering the risk of COVID hospitalization could be on the list of potential benefits.&#8221;\nThis study is observational, so it only suggests—not proves—that boosting testosterone levels may help men avoid severe COVID-19, Diwan cautions. A clinical trial would be needed to demonstrate conclusively whether such a strategy works.\nNo funding was associated with this work.\nSource: Washington University in St. Louis\nThe post Low testosterone may boost risk of COVID-19 hospitalization appeared first on Futurity.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3632076-the-best-way-for-us-to-counter-china-in-the-indo-pacific/",
        "description": "Delegations from 14 nations will meet in Los Angeles this week to put some meat on the bones of Joe Biden’s Indo-Pacific Economic Framework. The grouping includes the largest economies in Asia, minus China, leading to the narrative that this is the administration’s attempt to lead a decoupling from China to rebuild American economic leadership and relevance.\n\n\n\nThere is truth in this, but it needs to be understood in its proper context. Economic decoupling is terminology that gained traction during the Trump administration when that administration levied tariffs and other executive order measures against China. While China does not use the term “decoupling,” it has been pursuing a far more ambitious and aggressive version of economic separation from America — long before the latter fell out of love with unfettered globalization.\n\n\n\nIndeed, Beijing has sought to restrict its economic exposure and dependence on America for decades. In more recent times, defense has turned into attack in China seeking to establish a Sinocentric economic order in Eurasia and the Western Pacific that excludes America in important respects and limits American involvement in others. The bad news is that Beijing has a considerable head start on Washington. The good news is that America retains powerful and even decisive options to ensure partial decoupling occurs on its terms.\n\n\n\nTake the Belt and Road Initiative which is not generally conceived as part of a Chinese decoupling grand strategy. There are understandable economic benefits for China to advance the BRI, not least to create projects and external markets for its large and lumbering capital-intensive infrastructure and construction firms. But consider what else it is designed to achieve.\n\n\n\nOne goal is to build regional Sino-centric infrastructure, platforms and institutions which will facilitate trade, investment and other beneficial economic exchanges between China and countries within the BRI. If this sounds all quite innocent, we need to look at what the Sino-centric model looks like in practice. The immediate goal might have been to create external capital investment opportunities for Chinese firms. But the greater and grander purpose is to ensure that roads, rail, ports, cables, digital networks, and infrastructure begin and end in Chinese provinces — and operate on terms favorable to Chinese interests.\n\n\n\nBear in mind that using state resources to build the vast Sino-centric economic system within which Chinese firms and entities dominate means the latter is in an insurmountable position of strength to negotiate the conditions for any deal. Disputes and disagreements will not be resolved by pre-existing laws and rules but though a negotiation where Chinese political and economic leverage is brought to bear, or according to BRI rules and processes drafted by Beijing.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, and with a greatly reduced commercial presence in Eurasia and the Western Pacific, the capacity for American firms and authorities to either set or revise commercial and quality standards in all sectors is greatly diminished. Once such standards are set, it is expensive and usually prohibitive for firms and economies to operate in a different economic ecosystem. When combined with Sino-centric infrastructure, institutions, logistical networks etc., regional economies become captive to China while outsiders such as America are in a much weaker position from which to enter or impose themselves.\n\n\n\nThat Chinese economic policy is the earlier and primary trigger for the unravelling of globalisation is further evidenced by complementary plans such as Made in China 2025 and the more recent Dual Circulation Policy (DCP). These plans seek not just technological self-sufficiency but Chinese control over — and dominance of — entire manufacturing processes, supply chains, and associated services in the most important and lucrative high-tech sectors. The explicit objective is not simply to ensure China becomes an advanced and innovative economy but that it controls the global supply chains, innovation, and know-how required to ensure Chinese firms permanently dominate these sectors in global markets.\n\n\n\nNow the good news. The IPEF is better than nothing, but the quick-fix way to outflank China is for America to find the political courage to join the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership and go from there. This would give regional nations better alternatives that avoid Chinese economic and technological capture.    \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, it is essential to prevent Chinese dominance in sectors such as artificial intelligence, advance robotics, new synthetic materials, and next generation integrated circuits. Fortunately, China is either a net importer of relevant technologies and know-how or else relies heavily on joint ventures with foreign firms in many of these sectors. One&nbsp;estimate&nbsp;is that about 80 percent of private-sector R&amp;D money spent in China in the previous decade was by non-Chinese multinationals, mainly headquartered in America.\n\n\n\nWashington should scrutinize and restrict capital into China that feeds directly into its MIC2025 and DCP plans. The administration should also consider onerous restrictions or outright bans on some categories of investment into China — or Chinese investment into America — such as computer systems design, biotechnology, and life sciences.\n\n\n\nGlobalization as we knew it is over, and partial decoupling is inevitable. The question is whether America can decouple on its preferred terms, or the reverse occurs.\n\n\n\nDr. John Lee is a senior fellow at the Hudson Institute in Washington, D.C. From 2016-2018, he was senior national security adviser to the Australian Foreign Minister. His monograph, “Countering China’s Approach to Decoupling from the United States” was launched on Sept. 6, and is available at&nbsp;www.Hudson.org",

        "description": "A political committee supporting Pennsylvania Republican Senate candidate Mehmet Oz is out with a new ad geared toward Black voters highlighting a 2013 incident in which Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman pulled a gun on a Black jogger he mistakenly thought committed a crime.\n\n\n\nThe 30-second ad, which was released by American Leadership Action, cites the incident that took place when Fetterman was mayor of Braddock, Pa. The spot includes clips of a local news interview with the jogger Fetterman confronted, as well as Fetterman himself.\n\n\n\n“I believe I did the right thing but I may have broken the law during the course of it,” Fetterman says in a clip from a 2013 interview.\n\n\n\nThe ad wraps by calling Fetterman “reckless,” “risky” and “wrong for Pennsylvania.”\n\n\n\nThe $500,000 ad campaign, which was first reported by NBC News, is airing on networks with robust Black viewership including the Oprah Winfrey Network, Black Entertainment Television, ESPN, and NBC. Additionally, NBC reported that the group has also rolled out a 15-second digital ad that will reach Black voters online.\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Fetterman’s campaign for comment.\n\n\n\nIn 2013, Fetterman followed the man in his pickup truck and used a 20-gauge shotgun to hold him in place. The man, Christopher Miyares, was wearing running clothes and headphones and was not found to have a weapon on him when police arrived. Miyares has said that Fetterman pointed the gun at his chest, which Fetterman denies.\n\n\n\nFetterman addressed the incident early on in his Senate campaign, rolling out a video explaining his recollection of it in early 2021.\n\n\n\n“There was an episode, over eight years ago, where I was outside with my young son who was four years old at the time, and I heard this crushing burst of gunfire coming from a corridor that was the scene of dozens of shootings,” Fetterman said.\n\n\n\nFetterman said in the video that he could “never forgive myself” if he hadn’t done anything.\n\n\n\n“So I made that decision at that point to intervene to stop him from going any further until the first responders could arrive,” Fetterman said. “It’s not something that I would want anybody to live through, but the fact of the matter is there are a lot of communities in America, including Braddock, where it is not uncommon to hear gunshots randomly during the day or at night.”\n\n\n\nThe ad is the latest attack in the contentious Senate contest. On Wednesday, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee (DSCC) launched a mobile billboard around Pittsburgh reminding voters of the raucous GOP Senate primary in Pennsylvania as Oz and former candidate David McCormick reunite for an event.\n\n\n\nRecent polling shows Fetterman leading Oz. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report recently moved the race’s rating from a “toss-up” to “lean Democratic.”",

        "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is voicing support for a safety zone around his nation's Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, echoing a call from a United Nations watchdog.\n\n\n\n“If the content of this proposal is to demilitarize the territory of the nuclear power plant — and this is logical, as it was the Russian military presence that put the Zaporizhzhia plant on the brink of a radiation disaster — then we can support such a demilitarized protection zone,” Zelensky said in an address to his country late Tuesday, referring to an International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) proposal announced earlier in the day.\n\n\n\n“I believe that the world not only deserves, but also needs the representatives of the IAEA to force Russia to demilitarize the territory of the [power plant] and return full control to Ukraine,” the Ukrainian president added.\n\n\n\nThe IAEA called for a&nbsp;“nuclear safety and security protection zone” around the plant in a report released on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe United Nations’ nuclear watchdog said there is an “urgent” need for measures to prevent a nuclear accident at the plant, which lies on the front line of the war in Ukraine and has already been damaged by shelling.\n\n\n\nRussian forces captured the Zaporizhzhia power plant in March — early on in Russia’s invasion of Ukraine — but it continues to be operated by Ukrainian technicians.",

Why does this vogue-ishly pro-Richard show, a tie-in with the Steve Coogan film, place a question mark over it?It’s always unwise to assume today’s history is better than yesterday’s. Interpretations change, and the current vogue for seeing Richard III, so long portrayed as a tyrant, as a nice guy who somehow lost track of his nephews’ whereabouts, just as he was having himself crowned in young Edward V’s place, may one day seem silly. I am prepared to bet that it will.The Wallace Collection in London is the last place I expected to encounter what amounts to a kind of historical populism. The same age that witnessed Brexit also saw the rehabilitation of Richard III after his skeleton was discovered under a Leicester car park in 2012. This has inspired an apparently universal assumption that Richard was a Good King, even though his skeleton provides no evidence about his deeds in life. That’s what this exhibition, a tie-in with the new Steve Coogan film The Lost King, also seems to take for granted. Thus it places a big sceptical question mark over the painting at its heart, while presenting prop armour used in the film as the last word in factual reconstruction. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Troy Babbitt-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  A recent feature in the Denver Post proves the wound Nolan left remains raw Travel back with me, if you will, to February of 2019. Times were simpler then, to be sure. Masks were only worn by medical professionals and bank robbers, and the only “tick tock” anyone concerned themselves with was of the clock. \nThings were looking up for the Rockies, as well. Fresh off their first playoff triumph since Rocktober 2007, the team signed their All-World third baseman to a record-setting contract extension. The team was willing to spend and some were discussing whether we were entering a golden age of Rockies baseball. \nSuddenly I understand how Jack felt when Kate got in the sedan and drove away.\nThis weekend, Patrick Saunders’ most recent column in the Denver Post made the rounds on Twitter, indicating that some segments of the fanbase seem stuck on a February two years later. Reflecting on Nolan Arenado’s MVP-caliber season, Saunders concludes “Arenado was too good for the Rockies.” Questions of loyalty notwithstanding, Arenado’s will to win outmatched owner Dick Monfort’s, as demonstrated by the Rockies’ lack of spending after taking the Dodgers to a tiebreaker game for the NL West crown in 2018. After all, they let DJ LeMahieu walk, and look what he’s done with the Yankees ever since! If anything, Arenado has been proven right since he left, especially once you factor in the relative competitiveness of the NL West and NL Central, both then and now.\nBut what of the counterfactuals? Perhaps the Rockies aren’t World Series contenders with Arenado in purple pinstripes, but many dominoes have fallen since 28 left. In order to properly untangle such counterfactuals, we have to practice good historical thinking and understand February of 2019—and 2021—in its own time. \n\n\nWho asked for this https://t.co/2OK0q2e5BG— Purple Dinosaur Podcast (@purpledinocast) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nOf course, there are plenty who agree with the fine folks at the Purple Dinosaur Podcast and might say it’s best we all just let it go. But, just in case it helps anyone with that process, I’ll venture to contribute to the noise a little bit and consider this departure with a little bit of context and hindsight. And, as Saunders alludes, one cannot understand the departure of Arenado without also understanding the departure of LeMahieu.\nIn 2018, LeMahieu had his worst offensive season in four years (87 wRC+) and became a free agent. The Rockies, meanwhile, had a slew of middle infield prospects, including then-no. 1 PuRP Brendan Rodgers, waiting in the wings. Rather than extend a costly extension that had the potential to block their prized prospect (who’d already moved off shortstop due to the presence of Trevor Story), they let LeMahieu walk. He ended up signing a contract with the Yankees to serve as a utility player (a deal almost nobody liked). Some better-informed coaching, a rash of injuries, and perhaps the presence of the juiced ball later, and LeMahieu turned himself into Ben Zobrist in his final form. Meanwhile, Rockies second basemen have struggled for consistency.\nIn hindsight, letting LeMahieu walk ranks as one of the worst front office decisions in team history, though it hardly seemed that way at the time. Though players reportedly balked at the non-signing, Arenado deemed the team competitive enough to sign the best contract of the offseason. $260 million over eight years proved to be a big outlay, and Monfort dropped hints that the team wouldn’t be spending much until new TV deals came up before  the 2020 season but were otherwise excited to build around Arenado for years to come.\nThe team then fell flat on their faces. A 71-91 campaign caused by a fiendish combination of injuries and regression and the Rockies looked more like fool’s gold. Details remain murky but an after-season meeting between then-GM Jeff Bridich and Arenado did not go well. (Perhaps it was at this time when Arenado began trying to send game tape to Cardinals brass?) Trade rumors starting flaring, “disrespect” became a household word among Rockies fans, and the honeymoon phase officially ended. \nThen the year 2020 became the longest decade in American history. The less said there, the better.\nAgain, with hindsight, Arenado’s fears of the Rockies collapsing in competitiveness seem correct, but that leaves out the potential impact of Arenado sticking it out in Denver (I disagree with Saunders’ assessment that Arenado would not be on a “best of all time” trajectory had he stayed). How would that particular flap of the butterfly’s wings impacted Jon Gray and Trevor Story, for example? It also omits Nolan’s agency in facilitating that collapse by forcing his way out less than a year after signing the most lucrative contract (by average annual value) in league history. Nolan’s frequent barbs and jabs at the Rockies organization since leaving, combined with revelations of just how much time he spent angling for a trade to Missouri, paint a different picture.\nFor Saunders’ article, “too good,” refers to Arenado’s talent but also his burning desire to win. Perhaps, when considered from all angles, “too good for the Rockies” can also be understood with a consideration of his attitude as well.",

        "description": "After months of waiting for a USI 2.0 to become available to use with the Lenovo Chromebook Duet 3, I am happy to report that the wait is over. I was casually checking on the status of this pen, which I&#8217;ve been doing almost daily for the past few weeks, when I noticed that it no longer said it was out of stock. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo my surprise, it is also on sale at 32% off, which brings down the cost of this stylus to $33.99 with free shipping. Be warned, however, that we don&#8217;t know how much stock Lenovo&#8217;s got this time around, so there are no guarantees on how long it will be listed as available on the Lenovo site. Knowing Lenovo&#8217;s track record on these things, I would act fast.\n\n\n\nAs a reminder, this is currently the only stylus available to be used with the new Duet 3. The reason for that is that this Chromebook was manufactured with a 2.0 in-cell display, which makes it incompatible with older USI 1.0 pens. This fact put this device at a unique disadvantage over its predecessor &#x2013; the original 10&#8243; Chromebook Duet &#x2013; despite having overall superior specs. Thankfully, we can now put this issue to rest, and hopefully, more USI 2.0 styluses become available soon to give Lenovo some competition.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUY THE LENOVO USI PEN 2\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

And Liz Truss clearly is. She looked like a prime minister, she performed reasonably well, and she even managed a decent joke (on Labour leaders and north London).

Primarily, it is about the study of animals, how they evolve and behave, their physiology and their place in natural ecosystems. But zoologists are increasingly valued for the understanding they bring to the conservation of these ecosystems as well as individual animal species. The subject is growing in popularity among students, who see the importance of understanding animals and their place in the world, and the way in which the subject integrates many aspects of modern bioscience. You’ll be studying a broad range of animal groups, both dead and alive, from social insects to reptiles, mammals and dinosaurs.How you’ll learnDegrees are taught by lectures and seminars, with practical and field work.

Environmental sustainability is embedded in design thinking and you will consider strategies to design things that can be separated or upcycled. The other important aspect is around social innovation and how you can design products people really need. For instance, Falmouth University students work in partnership with local special needs schools to develop sensory educational products.How you’ll learnSome content is taught through lecture programmes, but most is practical, such as a design project where you get a design brief to hone and test those skills. Many courses have a strong focus on employability and students will develop their own design brief and use the third year as a stepping stone into the industry they want to focus on.

        "description": "Denny Medley-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Good teams have good bullpens in this era of baseball In 2014 and 2015 Dayton Moore and Ned Yost showed the world that a great bullpen could be a game-changing tool, especially in the playoffs. From 2000 to 2015, starters were averaging just under six innings per start every year except 2011 when the average was slightly over six, but after 2015 that started to drop off precipitously. This was not a coincidence. \nRight now, 14 teams in baseball are still in the playoff hunt, 16 if you include the Orioles and White Sox. Of those 14, 11 are in the top half in baseball in bullpen ERA. Only the Twins (17th), Padres (18th), and Phillies (21st) are not. The Phillies and Padres are likely going to be the last two Wild Card spots in the National League. The Twins are only even in the playoff picture because they happen to be in the American League Central. They are six games back in the Wild Card having two teams to pass, so Fangraphs has them at 0.9% to get a Wild Card spot, so if they make it it will have more to do with happenstance than team quality.\nAll of the good teams have good bullpens. I cannot say for certain that this will be true every year going forward, but it has become much more common. In 2021 every playoff team had a bullpen in the top half of the league in ERA. If the Royals truly want to compete, they are going to need to be better at closing out games. This year they are 30th in ERA, and only slightly better at basically a tie for 29th if you go by bullpen WAR per Fangraphs. \nThe 2022 Royals bullpen has very few bright spots. The most obvious is Scott Barlow who has posted a 2.53 ERA and 21 saves with only 3 blown opportunities. His peripherals are not quite as good, but they are not saying he is getting incredibly lucky. We would assume that he will be the closer next year as well. The only other player that has had a good season that looks repeatable is Taylor Clarke who has a 4.02 ERA, but his FIP/xFIP/xERA all suggest he is better than that, mostly due to his walk rate being much better this season. After those two it is slim pickings with a lot of mediocrity and luck, or lack thereof. \nAmir Garrett - At times Garrett has been quite good this year in some ways, but when he blows up it tends to be for multiple runs. For instance, over his last 13 appearances he has had 11 where he did not give up any runs. In the other two he gave up 2 runs without recording an out and 4 runs with just one out. He has been an effective reliever for entire seasons in recent memory, so it is probably not time to write him off yet. \nJose Cuas - Cuas has been a nice surprise this year, but expecting his outcomes (3.48 ERA) to continue could be fool’s gold. His strikeout-to-walk ratio is 1.6, and anybody walking 5.35 per nine is concerning even if they do have swing and miss stuff, which he does not. \nDylan Coleman - See Jose Cuas...if one of these two can actually repeat what they have done this year it would be helpful, but I would not be counting on it. Both should get a shot, but they should also both be on pretty short leashes. \nDaniel Mengden - Talk about making the most of an opportunity, Mengden has looked like a different pitcher so far in the big leagues. It is only 7 innings, but he has struck out 10.29 per nine while walking only 1.29, so he has been great. Literally nothing in his track record suggests this is what he actually is. Again, he should get a chance to prove it through the rest of the year and spring training, but don’t count on him.\nBrad Keller - Early bullpen returns have been rough, but the velocity and strikeout rate improvements make me think he can turn it around. As long as he is not in the rotation next year I will call it a win.\nLuke Weaver - Based on peripherals he deserves a shot, but he has not been good at the Major League level since 2019. Does a .432 BABIP suggest he has been incredibly unlucky this season, sure, but the 55.3% LOB and 4% HR/FB rates are lucky in the other direction. \nJosh Staumont - Something is broken, but he is too talented with too recent a track record of success to throw out. He has to get the walk rate back down, which is of course the Achilles’ heel of Royals pitching development. \nOthers in the mix for next year should include Kris Bubic, Max Castillo, Angel Zerpa, Wyatt Mills, Jonathan Heasley, Carlos Hernandez, Foster Griffin, and Jake Brentz coming back from injury along with a handful of AA and AAA guys like Andres Sotillet or Patrick Halligan who have shown something at the minors this year, though none of them are very exciting in my opinion. The Royals are going to have to make some decisions on who are still starters and who needs to try out the bullpen. If out of all of this they can piece together a solid bullpen I will be very surprised. It seems like a lot of wish casting.\nEven the middle-of-the-road bullpens tend to have four or five solid options, but you can only get away with four if you have some elite eighth and ninth inning guys. The Royals have no elite bullpen arms right now, so they need to find three or four answers to the solid but unspectacular category. \nFree agency has some possibilities that I think the Royals should consider, though I would prefer they get a good starter to a reliever, they have the money for both. I am ignoring the ones that will require long contracts like Edwin Diaz because I don’t think the Royals can risk long-term dollars on relief pitchers. I am also ignoring huge injury risks since I think the Royals need to be safe in this arena, well as safe as you can be with relief pitchers. These are all solid options that should be short enough deals to make sense.\nRafael Montero - This is a little risky as Montero has not had a long track record of success, but he has had a very good 2022. He is almost 32, so that coupled with a spotty record in years before 2022 could create an opportunity for a one-year contract. He would not necessarily be my choice, but it’s an option.\nCraig Kimbrel - After a rough couple of years in Chicago, Kimbrel has returned to form. Not sure how long of a contract he will get offered, and he may want to focus on contending teams that need a closer since that is his preferred role. \nKenley Jansen - Another big name toward the end of his career, Jansen might cost a lot, but if it is for one year it might be worth it. He is about as consistent as a reliever can be, though again might want to focus on contenders.\nDavid Phelps - He showed that he is not done yet this year. He will be more expensive than last year for sure, but should be a one- or two-year deal going into his age-37-season. He has never been a full-time closer, which might keep him from being very expensive. I kind of like him as a target.\nMichael Fulmer - If you want to go younger Fulmer is an option, though he has yet to put up more than a fine season as a bullpen pitcher. Might want a longer-term deal, which I would avoid unless he is willing to sacrifice AAV for it.\nJesse Chavez - He will be 40 next year, but has been quite good the last two years. This only makes sense on a fairly cheap one-year deal.\nAdam Ottavino - He is having a nice bounce back this season. Another solid middle reliever in his mid-30s to look at. I would definitely be looking at Ottavino if I were the Royals.\nErasmo Ramirez - I am not sure he is actually good enough to count, but he has put up some good ERA numbers. The peripherals don’t back it up, and the strikeout rate is very low for this day and age, though 70 innings in 50 appearances is solid. I would not go this route, but he is an option. \nSeth Lugo - The last guy who is good enough to even consider in my mind. He has been consistently fine, but not dominant since 2019. He is 33, so a little younger than some of the options, but not young. Depends on the deal. \nThe bullpen needs help, that is clear, but the nice thing about bullpens is that they can be turned around a little easier and cheaper than rotations and lineups. What we need to see is the Royals actively doing something to accomplish this turnaround in the very near future if they would like to contend, as they always say they do. Money is one way they can do that, and the other is converting some of their starters who are marginal to try and add some more options to push out the bottom end of the pen this off-season.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/mets-max-scherzer-injured-list.html",
        "description": "10:12AM: Scherzer has been officially placed on the IL, retroactive to September 4.\n8:58AM: The Mets are placing ace Max Scherzer on the 15-day injured list, manager Buck Showalter announced to reporters Wednesday morning (Twitter link via Newsday&#8217;s Tim Healey). The team is hopeful that he&#8217;ll return after a minimum stint on the shelf. Scherzer departed his most recent start due to &#8220;fatigue&#8221; in the same left oblique muscle he strained earlier in the season &#8212; an injury that kept him sidelined for nearly two months.\nScherzer, 38, has been sensational for the Mets when healthy enough to take the mound. The three-time Cy Young winner has logged a 2.26 ERA while striking out 30.6% of his opponents against just a 4.6% walk rate. He&#8217;s averaged 6 1/3 innings per outing, even with a pair of early exits due to an increasingly problematic left oblique. Scherzer had been slated to start this Friday in Miami.\nThe injury to Scherzer comes in conjunction with a sequence of brutal losses to the last-place Pirates and Nationals. The Mets have dropped three in row while watching the Braves cruise to six straight victories, culminating in the evaporation of what was once a whopping 10.5-game lead in the NL East for the Mets; the two teams are currently tied with identical 85-51 records.\nEven with Scherzer sidelined, the Mets have a strong top four in the rotation, with Jacob deGrom, Carlos Carrasco, Chris Bassitt and Taijuan Walker all active. Walker has struggled of late, with a 6.25 ERA since the All-Star break, although the majority of the damage against him came in one appearance: an eight-run meltdown against Atlanta. Both David Peterson and Trevor Williams are stretched out enough to make starts in place of Scherzer. Peterson started for the Mets both on Aug. 27 and Sept. 2, working a combined 11 1/3 innings, so he&#8217;d certainly be an option to step in for Scherzer on Friday against the Marlins.",

        "description": "Richard Mackson-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Dodgers closer on a hot streak On Wednesday morning’s Leading Off with True Blue LA podcast, we look back at another Dodgers win, fueled by home runs from Max Muncy and Joey Gallo, lowering the club’s magic number to clinch the National League West to seven.\nCraig Kimbrel closed out the win with a perfect ninth inning, and since August 21 has pitched 6⅓ scoreless innings, allowing no hits and two walks, with six strikeouts. The only blip was the series finale in Miami when he followed a perfect ninth inning by walking two of the three batters he faced to start the 10th inning, asked to pitch a second frame with the rest of the bullpen taxed.\nAugust 21 was Women’s Day at Dodger Stadium, with wives and girlfriends of the players picking their walk-up songs, or in the case of Kimbrel, his entrance music. On that day he used “Let It Go” from Frozen, and has kept it ever since. Is his success with that song a coincidence? Almost certainly! But it’s a catchy tune, so if we get to hear more of it, cool.\nAlso on this episode, Tony Gonsolin suffers a setback, and Julio Urías will pitch for Mexico in the World Baseball Classic.\n\nPodcast links\nWays to listen\nRSS feed\nEpisode link (time: 14:49)",

        "description": "Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Seeing how the 2022 Dodgers stack up to history The Dodgers have the best record in baseball, and they are on pace for the most wins in franchise history. They’ve even got an outside chance at reaching the MLB wins record, though that would require a herculean stretch to finish the season.\nTuesday’s win gave the Dodgers a 93-42 (.689) record through 135 games. Let’s see how that stacks up with some of the teams they are chasing.\nMost MLB wins in a season\n116 is the number to shoot for here, accomplished by two teams nearly a century apart. The Cubs won 116 games in 1906, which is even more impressive considering they played just 152 games. Through Game 135, they were 103-32.\nIn 2001, the Mariners finished 116-46, and through Game 135 were 96-39.\nFor the Dodgers to match these clubs, they’d have to finish on a 23-4 run, an absurd expectation, but then again these Dodgers were 21-5 in July and 22-6 in August.\nBut perhaps there’s a more feasible mark they can shoot for. The 1975 Big Red Machine Reds and 1986 Mets were both 108-54. That’s the best National League record over a full season over the last 121 years. The last NL team to win more than two-thirds of their games — excluding the 43-17 (.717) Dodgers in the pandemic-shortened 2020 campaign — was the 1909 Pirates, at 110-42.\nThis year the Dodgers are on pace for 112 wins.\nBest Dodgers record ever\nLos Angeles has two marks to shoot for here. The 2019 and 2021 Dodgers both finished with 106 victories, when coupled with 2020 and this year makes for a ridiculous stretch of winning. Through 135 games, the 2019 team was 88-47 and 2021 was 85-50.\nTo beat that mark, the Dodgers need to finish 14-13.\nBut another record to shoot for is that of the 1899 Brooklyn Superbas, who finished 101-47. Their .6824 winning percentage narrowly beats out the 1953 team’s .6818 mark (105-49) for the best in franchise history over a full season (again, excluding the 60-game 2020 season).\nTo beat those two teams, these Dodgers need 111 wins, which would require an 18-9 finish.",

For without unity there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. No progress, only exhausting outrage. No nation, only a state of chaos. This is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward.\"\n\n\n\nThat was President Biden during his Inauguration Speech in January 2020. Nice words. Hard to argue against. After all, America has always been at its best when unified. During World War II and after 9/11. Division has never served us well.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFast forward to September 2022. President Biden is averaging around 42 percent approval, still the lowest of any first-term president in the history of polling, from Truman to Trump. Inflation, sitting at 8.5 percent (it was 1.4 percent in Jan. 2021), is still by far the public’s number one concern going&nbsp;into the midterm elections. FiveThirtyEight gives Republicans a 75 percent chance of taking back the House of Representatives. And six in 10 voters believe Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan will worsen inflation, per a new CNBC poll.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo it appears the White House strategy is to avoid talking about inflation or the economy in general, or still-way-too-high gas prices at nearly $4.00 per gallon (gas was about $2.40 per gallon when Biden took office), or the violent crime continually plaguing American cities, or the essentially open U.S. border or 300 Americans dying each day from opioid/fentanyl&nbsp;overdoses. Instead, the plan appears to be to make the midterms a referendum on Donald Trump voters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans! And that is a threat to this country,” Biden declared in a divisive&nbsp;speech in Philadelphia last week\n\n\n\n“Donald Trump and MAGA Republicans are a threat to the very soul of this country,” he tweeted afterward.&nbsp;So not only was the leader who promised to unify the country attempting to do the exact opposite of that, he did so flanked by ominous red-lighted walls and with two Marines as props behind him. Whoever at the White House thought that either of these optics was a good idea should seek employment elsewhere.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe speech wasn’t as warmly embraced as the White House had anticipated, either.&nbsp;“Whatever you think of this speech the military is supposed to be apolitical,” CNN’s Brianna Keilar tweeted. “Positioning Marines in uniform behind President Biden for a political speech flies in the face of that. It’s wrong when Democrats do it. It’s wrong when Republicans do it.”\n\n\n\nCaught off guard by the blowback, White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates responded to Keilar directly.&nbsp;\"Except it's not political. In the same way CNN isn't political but has made the same warnings,\" he retorted.\n\n\n\nAnd when Biden was asked by Fox News White House Correspondent Peter Doocy about the tone and divisiveness of his speech after he accused 74 million Trump voters of being a direct threat to democracy, the president pretended he never said such a thing.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You keep trying to make that case. I don't consider any Trump supporters a threat to the country,\" Biden said, contradicting what he had said less than 24 hours earlier.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe’ve heard this kind rhetoric from Biden for some time: If you oppose Biden and his party on federalizing voting laws, for example, you’re on the side of George Wallace, Bull Connor and Jefferson Davis. Biden later denied having made that comparison too.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a related story, a Quinnipiac poll taken earlier this year shows a plurality of Americans believe Biden has done more to divide than unite the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut another poll out last week should be more alarming. A YouGov/Economist poll shows more than 40 percent of voters believe the U.S. could be in a civil war before the end of the decade. Biden’s mixed messages about unity aren’t helping matters one bit.\n\n\n\nJoe Concha is a media and politics columnist.",

        "description": "Almost a quarter of all young adults received mental health care treatment last year, according to recently released data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). \n\n\n\nThe number of adults aged 18 to 44 who received mental health care in the past 12 months saw the biggest increase from 2019, rising from 18.5 percent to 23.2 percent. The percentage of all adults who received mental health treatment also increased from 19.2 percent in 2019 to 21.6 percent in 2021.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe percentage of adults aged 45 to 64 who received treatment saw a more modest increase from 20.2 percent to 21.2 percent, while the percentage of adults aged 65 and older decreased slightly from 19.4 percent to 18.9 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe CDC considered adults to have received mental health treatment if they reported taking prescription medication for their mental health, receiving counseling or therapy from a mental health professional or both.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWomen were more likely to have received mental health treatment during men during 2019, 2020 and 2021, but the amount who received treatment increased for both. The data shows 28.6 percent of women of all ages received treatment in the past 12 months in 2021, up from 23.8 percent, while 17.8 percent of men reported receiving it that year, up from 13.1 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearchers found differences in who was most likely to receive mental health treatment by race among adults aged 18 to 44. Non-Hispanic white adults were the most likely, with 30.4 percent having done so in 2021.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOnly 14.8 percent of non-Hispanic Black adults, 12.8 percent of Hispanic adults and 10.8 percent of non-Hispanic Asian adults reported receiving treatment in 2021.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNon-Hispanic Asian adults remained the least likely to receive treatment in each of the three years reviewed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe CDC reported increases among adults aged 18 to 44 regardless of the type of location where they live. The percentage rose from 16.8 percent to 22.2 percent among those living in large metropolitan areas, 21.1 percent to 24.6 percent among those in small or medium metropolitan areas and 20 percent to 25.2 percent among those in nonmetropolitan areas.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe CDC reviewed data collected by the National Health Interview Survey from 2019 to 2021 for its analysis.",

        "description": "Democrats hold a 3-percentage point lead over Republicans when it comes to registered American voters who say they will “definitely” vote in the November midterms, according to a new poll.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Yahoo News/YouGov poll released on Tuesday showed that 48 percent of registered Democratic voters said they \"definitely will vote\" in November, compared to 45 percent of registered Republican voters, according to the news outlet. \n\n\n\nThe poll also found that Democrats hold a 4-percentage point lead over Republicans on a generic congressional ballot among registered voters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nForty-five percent of registered voters said they would choose the Democratic candidate when asked which candidate they would vote for in their congressional district if the midterms were held today, compared to 40 percent who said the Republican candidate. \n\n\n\nWhile the poll shows Democrats maintaining some momentum against Republicans ahead of the midterms, President Biden is still plagued by low approval ratings. The poll found that 40 percent of respondents approve of Biden’s job as president, compared to 52 percent who said they disapprove. \n\n\n\nThose figures tick slightly upward on both ends when focusing on registered voters: Forty-three percent approve of his job as president compared to 53 percent who disapprove.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade, the political landscape has shifted for Democrats as the high court’s decision has energized voters from key ballot measure initiatives in Kansas to special elections in New York. \n\n\n\nHowever, Democrats are still expected to face a challenging midterm environment given Biden’s low approval ratings, inflation and the precedent that the president’s party generally suffers losses in the midterms.\n\n\n\nThe Yahoo News/YouGov poll was conducted Sept. 2-6 with 1,634 adults surveyed. The margin of error is 2.6 percentage points. ",

Gretchen Whitmer (D) has expanded her lead over Republican challenger Tudor Dixon in the state's gubernatorial race, according to a new Detroit News/WDIV-TV poll.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe poll, published on Wednesday, found that 48 percent of respondents said they’ll support Whitmer in November’s election while 35 percent of those surveyed said they back Dixon, a political commentator and first-time candidate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 13-point margin is a 2-point increase from a similar poll published in July that showed Whitmer with an 11-point lead over Dixon, who has the backing of former President Trump.\n\n\n\nFour percent of respondents said they’ll lend their support to a third-party candidate, and 13 percent of respondents said they are undecided on their choice for Michigan governor.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFifty-four percent of the poll's respondents said they approve of the job that Whitmer has done as Michigan’s governor,&nbsp;which marks a slight decline from previous polls.\n\n\n\nEighty-eight percent of respondents who identify themselves as a “strongly Democratic” approve of the job Whitmer is doing as the state’s governor, while 3 percent of respondents who identify themselves as&nbsp; “strong Republican” agree with the same sentiment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nForty-five percent of Independent respondents said they view Whitmer favorably.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen asked the same question, 40 percent of respondents said they view Dixon favorably as a gubernatorial candidate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmong hot-button issues, 34 percent of respondents said that abortion/women's rights were the issue that motivated them most in this year’s midterm, while other respondents noted inflation, jobs and the economy, threats to our democracy, and education as more important topics to them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Detroit News/WDIV-TV poll was conducted Aug. 29-Sept. 1 with 600 respondents participating in the survey.

        "description": "Three months ago, I wrote about the rather early reminder I received encouraging me to order new checks. At the time, I noted that in the 9+ months since I’d ordered my checks, I had used a total of 10 of them. Recently, I received another email from everyone’s favorite Vericast business:\n\n\n\nWell, Harland, it turns out it’s also been a while since I wrote a check! In fact, since I mocked you in my previous post, I’ve written exactly zero checks. That means I’m averaging fewer than one check per month. I now need to revise the estimate from June. It now looks like I’ll be due to order checks in 2038. Surely we won’t still be writing checks then, right?",

        "description": "Dale Zanine-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Mississippi and Augusta both scored convincing wins on Tuesday night Two rainouts dampened proceedings to kick off the week of the MiLB action, but the two Braves affiliates who did play notched convincing wins. Four homers led Mississippi to a blowout victory over Biloxi, while Jorge Bautista pitched seven innings of one-run ball to snag the win for Augusta. \nFrom Double-A down, this is the final week of the regular season and last time we will get to see some of the Braves top prospects take the field in 2022, so drink it in while you can. \n(61-66) Gwinnett Stripers at (66-62) Buffalo Bisons - Postponed\nThe first of two rainouts on the night mean that we will have to wait until Gwinnett’s Wednesday doubleheader to see Ozzie Albies’ next rehab appearance.\n(58-67) Mississippi Braves 13, (58-66) Biloxi Shuckers 2\nBox Score\n\nAndrew Moritz, RF: 4-5, HR, 2 2B, 2 RBI, 4 R, .268/.368/.362\nCody Milligan, 2B: 3-5, HR, 2B, 3 RBI, BB, R, .301/.371/.358\nJalen Miller, DH: 1-2, HR, 3 RBI, 4 BB, R, .237/.342/.400\nJustyn-Henry Malloy, LF: 2-6, 2B, RBI, .282/.397/.449\nAllan Winans, SP: 5.0 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 1 ER, 2 BB, 4 K, 3.06 ERA\n\nA five-run third inning completely broke the game open for the Mississippi Braves, who put up eight in the first three frames to take all the suspense out of the game. Cody Milligan foreshadowed what was to come when he led off the game with a solo shot. For good measure, Milligan tacked on to that lead in the second when he plated a pair with a two-out double. Cade Bunnell doubled the lead to 6-0 in the third with a three-run bomb, and Andrew Moritz added a two-run shot as the first seven Braves hitters reached base to start the third. \nJustyn-Henry Malloy got in on the fun with an RBI double in the firth. Jalen Miller took the top off with a three-run home run of his own in the seventh. A bases-loaded walk in the ninth for Drew Lugbauer capped the scoring on a night when Mississippi had 15 hits and 10 walks. \nMoritz ended the night only one base shy of a cycle as he homered, had two doubles and a single in his five at bats. Milligan was also a triple shy of a cycle himself with a homer, double and single. \nBacked by the bats, Allan Winans picked up his first win of the season with five innings allowing just two runs, neither of them earned. He scattered six hits and a walk over those innings and K’d six. After battling an injury through the first half of the year, Winans came back and was solid in the second half with a sub-3.00 ERA in seven starts with Mississippi over the season’s final two months. \n(70-53) Rome Braves at (65-61) Hickory Crawdads – Postponed\nWe’ll have to wait one more day before Rome’s quest for a 2022 playoff spot continues following a rainout on Tuesday. The High-A Braves’ magic number is six with six games left to play. \n(66-60) Augusta GreenJackets 6, (56-71) Kannapolis Cannon Ballers\nBox Score\n\nMakhi Backstrom, 1B: 1-3, HR, RBI, 2 BB, SB, 2 R, .204/.349/.408\nFrancisco Floyd, 2B: 2-4, 2 RBI, SB, R, .250/.343/.363\nStephen Paolini, RF: 1-4, 2 RBI, .220/.327/.336\nJorge Bautista, SP (W): 7.0 IP, 6 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 8 K, 8.78 ERA\n\nAugusta pounded out 12 hits and got seven innings of one-run ball from starter Jorge Bautista to coast to a series-opening win over Kannapolis. Francisco Floyd and Stephen Paolini backed Bautista with two-RBI nights, and Makhi Backstrom hit his 10th homer of the season in the victory. Paolini got the first big hit of the night when he drove in two runs in the second on a bases loaded single up the middle. \nBautista kept it 2-0 until the GreenJackets got him some insurance runs in the sixth. Backstrom’s solo home run preceded RBI singles from Floyd and Drake Baldwin. A double play with runners on the corners in the bottom half of the sixth for the Cannon Ballers scored a run and erased Bautista’s shutout, but Floyd got the run back in the eighth with his second RBI single on the night. \nIn what was likely Bautista’s final start of the season, the 21-year-old ended 2022 on a high note with one of the best outings of his campaign. Seven innings was his longest outing of the season while the eight Ks matched a season-high. \nOne unfortunate note from this one is that 2022 draft pick Ignacio “Nacho” Alvarez was removed from the game midway through the second inning. While the reason wasn’t immediately clear for the departure, Alvarez did foul a ball hard off his foot in his first inning at bat and might be what caused his early exit.",

        "description": "‘We did a shoot with sex dolls to go with a Vogue article about Botox, implants and people seeming artificial. But they looked like real models – so I went over and ripped off their faces’This is from a series of suburbia pictures I did for American Vogue. Anna Wintour, Vogue’s editor-in-chief, calls them “stoppers” – one or two images in the magazine that illustrate an idea. This one was for a story about the fear of ageing. At that time, in 2012, everyone was getting injections: Botox, fillers, things like that. It was the beginning of this idea of enhancing the body, but before the boom in butt implants. People were starting to look artificial.I had to convince Phyllis Posnick, the fashion editor, of my idea. We didn’t tell Anna. I didn’t want to use mannequins and the closest thing I could find were these realistic sex dolls, which I’d used once before for a shoot for Tom Ford. There’s a company in Los Angeles that makes them. They weigh about 70 kilos, so we had to wheel them around. They’re not easy to manipulate either. If you look closely, you’ll see I purposely made their fingers very crooked, so people would understand they weren’t real. Continue reading...",

        "description": "After seven-plus years of performing the same act, Donald Trump is finding it harder and harder to surprise his audience.But despite his noted laziness, he sure is trying. Last week, he used his Truth Social site to share (or “ReTruth,” in the platform’s tortured jargon) a series of messages promoting the QAnon-conspiracy universe. A day later, he told a conservative Pennsylvania radio host that if he was reelected president, he would “very, very seriously” consider pardoning people convicted for their roles in the January 6 insurrection, and said that he was financially assisting some defendants. (Don’t take it to the bank.) Then this past weekend, he hosted a rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, where—among other lowlights—he attacked the current president as an “enemy of the state” while praising the autocrats Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin. Trump also hit all the customary false notes about the 2020 presidential election being stolen, but he hit them harder than usual, including saying that Republican officials who didn’t aid him should be “ashamed of themselves.”Guessing the cause of all of this is not hard: Trump finds himself in a dicey situation over his alleged improper removal of presidential records, many of them classified, from the White House—the subject of an FBI search at Mar-a-Lago last month. Even after a federal judge issued an order Monday pausing the Justice Department’s review of the documents, the investigation is a real threat to Trump, and that’s only one of the many current political and legal dangers he faces. Meanwhile, numerous Republican candidates are struggling, among them two he was stumping for in Pennsylvania: Doug Mastriano, a true-believing Trumpist seeking the governorship, and Mehmet Oz, a stiffly phony Trumpist trying for the U.S. Senate.When Trump finds himself backed into a corner, he often responds with particularly extreme remarks. Whether this is simply a defensive reflex or is a conscious attempt to find something wild enough to change the subject is a question for a psychologist or, better yet, a psychic, not a journalist. The political effects of the pattern, however, can be explored here.These outbursts tend to bind Trump’s strongest supporters to him ever more closely while alienating the general electorate. This puts Republican officials in a dilemma: They can either preserve their immediate political future by aligning themselves with him or risk it by getting off the bus. They nearly always choose the first option. Sometimes, as in his two impeachment trials, that’s enough to save Trump. Other times, as in the 2020 election, it is not.[Peter Wehner: Why they still support Trump]Since before Trump was elected, pundits have puzzled over his tendency to do and say things that endear him to the base at the expense of broader popularity. Typically, politicians want to find a way to maintain a political identity while maximizing the number of supporters they can attract. Moving too far toward maximizing support can, ironically, backfire: You risk coming across as having no convictions. Trump has long erred in the other direction. He has not only stuck to a political identity but sometimes gone out of his way to convey it in the most pugnacious way he can, at the risk of turning off even some ideological compatriots.But Trump has sometimes succeeded anyway. He won the 2016 presidential election with a minority of the popular vote, thanks to some good instincts, a weak opponent, and good luck. Once he was in office, the antipathy of the general electorate was less important. Rallying his base had the effect of forcing Republican officeholders to back him too. It didn’t matter that Trump’s overall approval rating hovered in the low 40s. GOP officials understood that thanks to a decline in competitive constituencies, their fate would be decided by the most motivated primary voters, which often means the hardest-core Trump backers. As a result, even if many of them personally detested or distrusted Trump—and private quotes suggest that they did—they still gritted their teeth and lined up behind him.That dynamic helped Trump survive several serious scandals. When Republicans controlled the House and the Senate, they made no serious effort to restrain the White House. Once Democrats won back the House in 2018, they twice impeached Trump, but Republicans remained unified enough to prevent him from being convicted in the Senate, including after his post-election attempted autogolpe.But the trick is not perfect; reread that previous sentence: “Once Democrats won back the House …” Republicans took a beating in 2018 because Trump was very unpopular, and even though he was not formally on the ballot, he sought to make himself the focus of the election. This is not my interpretation, but Trump’s. As he said in October 2018: “I’m not on the ticket, but I am on the ticket, because this is also a referendum about me. I want you to vote. Pretend I’m on the ballot.”[Read: Trump already won the midterms]Two years later, Trump was literally on the ballot, and he again lost. It is true, as he has said, that he won more votes than any other Republican candidate in history. Trump is very good at turning out his voters. The problem is that revulsion to him also drives voters who oppose him, who turned out in even greater numbers to vote for Joe Biden, or perhaps for not–Donald Trump. Republican candidates actually outperformed Trump in many cases, but even if he had them in the palm of his hand, they couldn’t help him actually win—though it is true that some of them, in some states and in Congress, did their best to aid his election-subversion campaign.This week in the classified-documents case, Trump once again got help from a Republican in office, though not an elected one: On Monday, he received the very favorable ruling from Judge Aileen Cannon, whom he appointed to the bench, and whose decision drew incredulous reactions from a range of experts. One question that remains is how voters will respond. Polling suggests that a majority of Americans believe that the investigation into Trump’s handling of presidential records is justified. Polling also suggests that Republican hopes for a huge victory in November have dimmed somewhat: Democrats now stand a decent chance of holding the Senate, and the expected size of the GOP majority in the House has shrunk. That is in part a testament to Trump’s visibility, and also a testament to backlash to the Supreme Court’s overturning of abortion rights in Dobbs—a decision made possible by Trump’s focus on the courts.Though it seems fair to say that Trump is complicating Republican midterm efforts, isolating his role in the final result in November will be impossible. But his continued hints—if anything so blunt can be called a hint—that he intends to run for president again in 2024 mean that we’ll get another chance to observe the trend. That election may not work the same way, though. Trump and his allies have already shown that they have a workaround for the broad public antipathy toward him: They’re planning to make sure he goes back to the White House, even if it means rigging the election.",

        "description": "Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Yankees decided to risk bringing in aging veterans and dedicating playing time to older players. Was it worth it? Since the calendar turned to August, the Yankees have played terribly, irredeemably so. This  is not news to any of the fans who have tuned in at any point. It’s been a rough time as a fan, and it’s been an optimal one to think about what’s gone wrong from a team-construction standpoint.\nAn inescapable facts for this team is that it has the highest average batters age in the majors (30.5, according to Baseball Reference). At the same time, a number of players have gone on the injured list without any compelling alternatives available (at least that the Yankees are willing to use). This leads to the question of whether the roster for this version of the Yankees was flawed from the start, with its heavy reliance on aging hitters.\nComing into the 2022 season, the Yankees made the conscious decision to bet big on older imports like Josh Donaldson, Anthony Rizzo, and Marwin Gonzalez. They bet on Giancarlo Stanton, coming off his first relatively healthy season in four years, as well as DJ LeMahieu and Aaron Hicks, with DJ coming off an injury-plagued season, and Hicks potentially completely washed up. They made the assumption that at least some of these players would be able to stay healthy and hit like they were still in their 20’s. But none of these players are spring chickens (in the context of professional sports, as least). \n  \n        \n      Photo by Al Bello/Getty Images\n  \nDonaldson is 36, Stanton is 32, Gonzalez is 33, Rizzo is 33, LeMahieu is 34, and Hicks is 32. While this might not very old in regular human years, it is quite advanced for elite athletes. Each of these players has been an excellent contributor in years past. However, it is not controversial to say that the likelihood of injury and ineffectiveness increases as a player ages. \nIn essence, the Yankees have engaged in a high-risk and high-reward strategy. If everything works out, they could have All-Star hitters to propel the team. In fact, the 2009 Yankees did much the same. They had a team full of aging hitters (30.6 years old for average batter age), but they still managed to win 103 games. In 2009, the older players managed to both stay healthy and perform well. It is not impossible for a team to do well with this kind of strategy, but there remains a considerable risk attached to it.\nThe Yankees have found that out this year. Many of the older players have battled injuries and ineffectiveness, with the former often influencing the latter. The Yankees bet big on these brand name players being able to perform up to their previous standards, and that they would not get injured. For the most part, neither of these bets have panned out. \nEven the players that have had good years in Rizzo (.832 OPS), Stanton (.750 OPS), and LeMahieu (.739 OPS) have seen a pretty consistent battle with various nicks and ailments. The rest of aforementioned vets have OPS figures below .700, and Rizzo just went on the IL himself.\nIf the Yankees had some reliable minor league depth, or depth that they were actually willing to use, then this might be a different story. Unfortunately, the combination of a high-risk team construction and a lack of high end minor league depth has left the Yankees in a precarious position. They’ve either been reluctant to promote minor leaguers like Oswald Peraza, Oswaldo Cabrera, Anthony Volpe, and Estevan Florial, or they’ve been left handing at-bats to entirely inadequate fill-ins, like the aforementioned Gonzalez, Miguel Andújar, and Tim Locastro.\nThe Yankees should either get younger at the major league level, or at least mitigate the risk of injury and ineffectiveness by cultivating high end talent in the minor leagues. Simply engaging in a risky strategy of employing aging stars without a backup plan is unsustainable. With younger position players, the Yankees can mitigate the risk of injury and underperformance. In addition, younger players often are much easier to move on from in the event things do go awry (case in point: the 28-year-old Joey Gallo, approaching free agency, netted the Yankees a real prospect despite his horrid 2022 performance).\nThere is hope for a new, young wave of talent on the horizon with players like Cabrera, Peraza, Volpe, and Jasson Domínguez. However, the Yankees need to be more willing to dip into their pool of prospects to determine if they can help at the major league level. Simply hoping and waiting that an older player will recapture their previous form is not a sustainable form of roster construction. There is simply too much risk that having a team full of older players without any depth will result in flop.",

It was where he found his footing as an artist and grew into a new and fruitful life in the United States.\nBorn in Leoncin, Poland, in 1904, he spent his childhood in Warsaw and various Polish shtetls. In 1935 he emigrated to New York, after presciently deciding that the metastasizing Nazi threat in Germany was going to be very bad for the Jews. He landed in Brooklyn, and things were tough going at first. He felt lost in this foreign country, where literature written in Yiddish seemed dead. But then, around 1941, he and his new wife, Alma, whom he met a few years earlier in the Catskills, moved to 410 Central Park West near 100th Street. Soon after, Singer began to hit his stride — prolifically writing fiction as well as contributing journalism to the Yiddish-language newspaper, The Jewish Daily Forward (The Forward still publishes, in Yiddish and English).\nSinger stayed put on Central Park West for about 20 years until he was robbed at gunpoint in his apartment lobby. He moved briefly to West 72nd Street, then, in 1965, to The Belnord, a humongous Renaissance-style limestone rental building that takes up an entire square block on West 86th Street. When it was finished in 1909, it was the talk of the town, and according to this recent New York Times article about it, has been ever since.\nThe Belnord. Photograph by Daniel Krieger.\nToward the final years of his life, Singer began spending most of his time in Surfside, Florida, though he never gave up his rent-controlled apartment at The Belnord. One year before his death in 1991, West 86th Street from Broadway to Amsterdam was named Isaac Bashevis Singer Boulevard in his honor. (The street where he lived in Surfside was also named after him.)\nAt the center of the Upper West Side, as was Singer. Photograph by Daniel Krieger.\nDressed in a suit and tie, Singer was a common sight taking long walks around the neighborhood for decades — up to six miles a day, according to his personal assistant — and The New York Times once called him “the grand old man of the Upper West Side.” He was deeply connected to the local community, and had a reputation for being a talker, both in Yiddish and his heavily accented English. He liked going to restaurants, all now long gone, known for their Jewish fare, where he would mingle and gossip with other Yiddish-speaking refugees who flocked to New York in those days. There was The Famous Dairy Restaurant on West 72nd Street, where The New York Times reported in 1991: “He almost always had the $5.50 lunch special of vegetarian chopped liver — a concoction of carrots, peas, string beans and onions —and the soup of the day.”\nSinger also frequented the American Restaurant, his local coffee shop, on Broadway and 85th, which had “a false-brick facade and gilt chandeliers” and where he ate “several times a day, savoring the pea soup, boiled potato and rice pudding.” There was also Café Éclair, a Viennese pastry shop and restaurant on Broadway where, the Times reported, Singer often had “an open-face tuna-salad sandwich and a cup of coffee and occasionally a delicacy like borscht with a boiled potato and an extra dollop of sour cream.” Another of the modest places he frequented was the kosher luncheonette Steinberg’s Dairy Restaurant on Broadway between 81st and 82nd Street (now occupied by The Town Shop). Being vegetarian, like his literary ancestor, Franz Kafka, Singer was especially fond of veggie burgers.\nThe entrance to The Belnord looking into the interior courtyard. Photograph by Daniel Krieger.\nSinger made the Upper West Side the setting for some of his stories, such as “The Cafeteria,” published in The New Yorker in 1968. The narrator in the short story describes a life that is nearly identical to Singer’s: “I have been moving around this neighborhood for over thirty years — as long as I lived in Poland. I know each block, each house … and I have the illusion of having put down roots here. I have spoken in most of the synagogues. They know me in some of the stores and in the vegetarian restaurants … even the pigeons know me; the moment I come out with a bag of feed, they begin to fly toward me from blocks away.”\nHis most famous novel that took place on the Upper West Side is “Shadows on the Hudson,” which a New York Times reviewer called his “masterpiece.” The novel is infused with a harshness and the kinds of things that turned some Jews against him, like comparing God to a Nazi; themes of amorality and betrayal; self-loathing Jewish characters who say things like, “God Himself is the worst murderer.” It features an array of troubled, affluent Jews living on the Upper West Side after World War II, many of whom are portrayed unsympathetically – like the stockbroker obsessed with sex and money and the rich Orthodox man devoid of compassion.\nFor this reason, as with fellow Jewish Upper West Side writer, Philip Roth, Singer had his share of detractors who criticized him for portraying Jews darkly in his fiction. Over the years, he has been referred to as a “traitor to the Yiddish tradition,” “a pornographer,” “an Anglicizing panderer,” &#8220;a dirty old man” and his writing was said to be “bad for the Jews.”\nBut he also got heaps of praise and was widely seen as a literary genius. He won the National Book Award in 1970, and in 1978, he became the only Yiddish-language writer to win the Nobel Prize for literature. The Swedish Academy described his &#8221;impassioned narratives which, with roots in a Polish-Jewish cultural tradition, bring universal human conditions to life.’&#8217;\nA savvy promoter of his work, Singer understood early on that to be a successful American writer he had to get his writing translated into English. He worked closely with translators on the English versions of his work and came to call English his “second original language.” He would always publish first in Yiddish, and then later he would put out a more polished, sometimes even different, English-language version. This began in 1953 when critic Irving Howe came across Singer’s short story, “Gimpel the Fool.” Recognizing a major new writer, Howe convinced Saul Bellow, who himself spent some time living on the Upper West Side (where he set his novel “Seize the Day”), to translate it. Then Howe sent the translation to an editor at the Partisan Review. Singer was off and running from that point, as the translations of his work flowed. He was published regularly in magazines such as the New Yorker, Playboy, and Harper’s.\nIn the first Singer biography, “The Magician of West 86th Street,” Paul Kresh poses the question, “What is Isaac Bashevis Singer?” His answer, in part: “He is a man of many paradoxes and contradictions, yet withal a man, like Whitman&#8217;s poetical self, large enough to ‘contain multitudes,’ reconciled  to the war of forces within himself and somehow at ease with himself.”\nIsaac Bashevis Singer Boulevard, part of the landscape.

        "description": "Danielle Allen, \nDemocratic Knowledge Project, Harvard University, \nSept 07, 2022\n\n\n\t\t           \n\t\t           This paper is a good overview of the case for badges and a description (with some case studies) of their potential application, but aside from a one-sentence nod to Mozilla it does not get into any detail at all about a badging infrastructure in general, but rather, the institutional changes (for example, replacing the Carnegie unit) that badges would support. It's very much focused on the competency-based approach to badging, and with it, a formal and structured approach. I wish it had looked more widely at the discussions around badges over the years, and especially their application in a decentralized system of skills recognition (which it calls the 'first generation' approach to badging). Were I a cynic I would say that this is another example of an elite university taking a novel concept developed elsewhere and reforming it into something harmless and benign to existing entrenched interests.\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

        "description": "Erik Williams-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The minor league season is winding down here in September as the playoffs are quickly approaching. It’s possible that three of the four affiliates for the Dodgers will make the postseason.\nAs for Tuesday, two of the four won their series opener with two of the four starting their last week of games.\nPlayer of the day\nNick Biddison launched a pair of homers in a 3-for-4 effort Tuesday for Low-A Rancho. A three-run homer in the fifth and a solo shot in the seventh helped the Quakes take control in the later innings.\nIn 27 games since joining Rancho, Biddison is 33-for-108 (.306) with four homers, six doubles and two triples, driving in 20 runs and walking 16 times. That's good for a .915 OPS.\n\n\n101 mph off the bat of Nick Biddison on a skyscraper to left field for a THREE-RUN HOMER  Quakes take their second lead 8-5Bot 5th pic.twitter.com/XXaj7fqaZk— Rancho Cucamonga Quakes (@RCQuakes) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Dodgers drafted the 22-year-old in the fourth round of the 2022 draft less than two months ago. Playing mostly corner outfield in college at Virginia Tech, Biddison has spent most of his time with Rancho over at third base.\nTriple-A Oklahoma City\nOklahoma City had at least one runner in every inning Tuesday but did all their scoring in the second inning. They were already behind after two innings and Tacoma (Mariners) pulled away late as the Dodgers dropped the series opener 7-3.\nAfter the Rainiers put four runs on the board in the top of the second, OKC came right back with three in the bottom of the third on a pair of singles. With two on and two outs, Andy Burns singled to right for the first run. \nA wild pitch moved the runners to second and third for Drew Avans to cash in both on an infield single and throwing error by Tacoma starter Justus Sheffield.\nThe Rainiers plated three in the sixth to give them plenty of insurance to send OKC to their fifth loss in their last five games. With Round Rock (Rangers) winning Tuesday, the Dodgers now cling to a 1.0-game lead in the Pacific Coast League East.\nDanny Duffy and Tommy Kahnle both continued their rehab assignments with mixed results. Duffy allowed a double and a single to the first two batters in the sixth with a run coming in on a passed ball. \nThe lefty struck out two of the next three batters but was lifted after 23 pitches with two on and two out. Daniel Zamora allowed a double to the next batter to score a pair which closed the books with three on Duffy’s ledger.\nKahnle needed only six pitches to retire all three batters he faced in a scoreless eighth.\nDouble-A Tulsa\nThe Drillers had no problems scoring all night and put up four runs in the final two innings to secure an 11-7 win over Frisco (Rangers).\nTulsa touched up the Rangers top pitching prospect Jack Leiter for four runs in the first three innings, including a two-run homer for Justin Yurchak in the first inning. But they found themselves down 5-4 after four innings thanks to a Kellen Strahm three-run homer in the third that helped the RoughRiders to four runs in the inning.\nAbiatal Avelino put the Drillers ahead for good in the fifth with a two-run double. The second baseman finished his night 3-for-5 with four runs driven in, including an RBI-double in the second inning and an RBI-single to start a three-run ninth for Tulsa.\nRyan Ward cracked his 28th homer of the year, a solo shot in the eighth that kept Tulsa out front when the two clubs traded runs in the inning.\n\n\nThat's 2⃣8⃣ on the season for @rwardo12 and the Drillers have TIED the franchise record for most HRs in a regular season. You read that right- 184 Drillers dingers for this 2022 team ☄️ pic.twitter.com/eM6luvt1NP— Tulsa Drillers (@TulsaDrillers) September 6, 2022\n\n\n\nThe homers from Yurchak and Ward brought Tulsa’s season total to 184, matching the franchise record for the most home runs in a season set by the 2018 team. There are still 11 games remaining in the regular season for Tulsa to set a new season high.\nHigh-A Great Lakes\nThe Loons were shutout for the fourth time in the last nine games, this time in a 3-0 loss to West Michigan (Tigers).\nYunior Garcia and Austin Gauthier each had two hits down near the bottom of the lineup for Great Lakes. The team only had six hit total on the night and ended up 0-for-5 with runners in scoring position.\nLow-A Rancho Cucamonga\nOn the strength of two four-run innings, Rancho came away with a 10-6 victory over Lake Elsinore. Despite the win, the Quakes were officially eliminated from the postseason with Inland Empire (Angels) also winning Tuesday.\nFalling behind 2-1 early, the Quakes put four up in a hurry in the third when Yeiner Fernandez singled in a run to tie it and Alex Freeland — another 2022 draft pick making contributions — smashed a three-run homer to the right of center field.\nWith a run in the top of the fourth and two in the fifth, the Storm tied it at five apiece. But that’s when Biddison’s big night kicked in and the Quakes pulled away for the win.\nBubba Alleyne, also drafted in 2022, hit his third homer with the Quakes, a solo blast in the fifth to go back-to-back with Biddison.\nTransactions\nTriple-A: RHP Nick Robertson assigned to Oklahoma City Dodgers from Tulsa Drillers.\nLow-A: Rancho Cucamonga Quakes activated RHP Darlin Pinales.\nTuesday Scores\n\nTacoma 7, Oklahoma City 3\nTulsa 11, Frisco 7\nWest Michigan 3, Great Lakes 0\nRancho Cucamonga 10, Lake Elsinore 6\n\nWednesday Schedule\n\n10:05 a.m. PT: Oklahoma City (Gavin Stone) vs. Tacoma (Konner Wade)\n3:35 p.m.: Great Lakes (Adolfo Ramirez) at West Michigan (Carlos Pena)\n4:35 p.m.: Tulsa (John Rooney) at Frisco (Tim Brennan)\n6:30 p.m.: Rancho Cucamonga (Justin Wrobleski) vs. Lake Elsinore (Victor Lizarraga)",

        "description": "Women with disabilities are nearly twice as likely to rate their diet as poor and are more likely to experience food insecurity compared to women without disabilities, according to a new study.\nNearly one in five United States women age 18 to 44 reports having at least one disability related to hearing, vision, cognition, mobility, self-care, or independent living. However, there has been limited research on the diets of women with disabilities.\n&#8220;Eating a nutritious diet is central to preventing many chronic diseases. For women of reproductive age, a healthy diet can also support good outcomes during and after pregnancy,&#8221; says Andrea Deierlein, associate professor of public health nutrition at New York University School of Global Public Health and lead author of the study in the Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.\n&#8220;But a healthy diet requires access to healthy foods and the resources or ability to prepare them, and women with disabilities may face obstacles due to medical conditions or physical limitations.&#8221;\nTo better understand the diets of these women, the researchers analyzed data from the 2013 through 2018 waves of the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys, conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThe researchers asked 3,579 women, ages 18 to 44, about their food intake on a given day (which was calculated into diet quality scores) and other diet-related factors, including food security and participation in food assistance programs.\nWomen were also asked if they have a disability, which was defined as serious difficulty hearing, seeing, concentrating, walking, dressing, and/or running errands due to physical, mental, or emotional conditions. Sixteen percent of respondents reported having a disability and 6% reported having two or more types of disabilities.\nThere were few differences in women&#8217;s diet quality scores by their disability status, with the exception that women with two or more types of disabilities had slightly lower diet quality scores related to their intake of fruit and protein-rich foods like meat, nuts, and seafood.\nCompared to women without disabilities, women with disabilities were more likely to rate their diet as poor and report their food security as low or very low. They were also more likely to consume frozen foods and participate in food assistance programs.\nWomen with disabilities were also less likely to be the main person in their households responsible for meal planning, preparing, and food shopping.\nThe researchers note that more studies are needed—particularly research that examines the intersection of disability status and social determinants of health like neighborhood food environment, housing conditions, and social support that affect food storage and preparation—to identify potential areas for intervention among all individuals with disabilities.\n&#8220;Learning more about the diets of women with disabilities will help us to better assess this population&#8217;s diet quality and nutrient intake, identify barriers to improving diet, and develop tailored nutrition programs and policies, with the goal of reducing health disparities,&#8221; says Deierlein.\nAdditional coauthors are from NYU. The New York University Research Challenge Fund Program funded the work.\nSource: NYU\nThe post Women with disabilities report more food insecurity appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Bank Australia recently announced that it will stop granting loans for new fossil fuel cars from 2025 forward to force more people to purchase electric vehicles. Justifying the bank’s move, its chief impact officer proclaimed, “We think that the responsible thing for us to do … is to ensure that our vehicle lending doesn’t lock our customers in to higher carbon emissions and increasingly expensive running costs in the years ahead.” \n\n\n\nBut is making it more difficult for hard-working men and women to obtain affordable vehicles that run on reliable energy really the “responsible thing” to do? That’s exactly the premise that environmental extremists would have everyone believe, even though electric vehicles are significantly more expensive to purchase than vehicles that run on gasoline. Not to mention the fact that the asking price of an electric vehicle does not appear to be going down anytime soon. \n\n\n\nThe cost of the raw materials for electric vehicles more than doubled during the COVID pandemic thanks to increases in costs of materials such as cobalt, nickel and lithium, which are essential to produce electric vehicle batteries. There’s also the high price tag associated with replacing an electric vehicle battery, as well as to install or use a charging station and pay for the electricity used to charge the battery, which often is, ironically, powered by fossil fuels. \n\n\n\nAnd even if the overall price tag of an electric vehicle were equal to or less than that of a gasoline-powered vehicle, as the woke crowd asserts, the true costs go beyond mere dollars and cents. While liberal elitists are quick to point to the alleged environmental benefits of driving an electric vehicle, many conveniently turn a blind eye to the instances of child and forced labor that have been identified in the electric vehicle supply chain. It’s no secret that cobalt mining in the Congo for electric vehicle batteries has placed countless children in harm’s way, and that ethnic minorities suffer in forced labor camps at the hands of the Chinese Communist Party. \n\n\n\nSo, let’s get this straight. It costs families more money to purchase an electric vehicle; many electric vehicles batteries are charged by coal and natural gas; and there’s an ongoing humanitarian problem of child and forced labor being used to source the materials for electric vehicles. Nonetheless, making it more difficult for Australians to purchase a new vehicle other than electric is the “responsible” thing to do?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the absurdity of professing the moral and fiscal superiority of electric vehicles isn’t contained to Australia. California regulators recently took the farce to the next level here in the U.S. by banning the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles starting in 2035. And if you’re worried your state may be next, you probably should be. As of May, 17 states have adopted California-style vehicle emissions requirements, making it only a matter of time, perhaps, before overzealous legislators and regulators in those states seek to follow California off the electric vehicle cliff. \n\n\n\nStates such as California and its disciples stand in stark contrast to their brethren in West Virginia and Texas, who have been leaders in protecting their citizens from those who oppose reliable and affordable sources of energy. For example, West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore deemed five financial institutions ineligible for state banking contracts after being empowered by the state legislature to cut off banks that boycott fossil fuels. In doing so, Moore blocked giants such as BlackRock, JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo from access to $18 billion in annual state inflows and outflows. Texas Comptroller Glenn Hegar also recently cut off from state contracts several institutions that are similarly hostile to fossil fuels, including BlackRock and UBS.\n\n\n\nSadly, federal lawmakers in the U.S. seem to be following the California-model of hypocritical environmental “elitist first and everyday American last” policy when it comes to electric vehicles. The dubiously titled Inflation Reduction Act that President Biden signed into law provides tax credits for the purchase of new and used electric vehicles. So, while Biden takes a victory lap for this latest Democrat spending spree on electric vehicles and other climate-related initiatives, the American people will be left to ponder: Was this really the responsible thing to do?\n\n\n\nSarah Rehberg is the Free Enterprise Project program coordinator for the National Center for Public Policy Research.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/latino/3632235-immigrant-legal-aid-group-launches-endorsement-campaign/",
        "description": "A top legal immigrant aid group on Wednesday announced its first-ever midterm endorsement program backing \"candidates who support pro-immigrant policies at the federal level.\"\n\n\n\nThe National Immigration Law Center (NILC) is launching the seven-figure program through its political arm, the NILC Immigrant Justice Fund, with endorsements of Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Rep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.).\n\n\n\nNeither Padilla nor Jayapal are facing difficult reelection prospects, but they are both longtime proponents of immigration reform and members of the immigrant community – both of Padilla's parents immigrated from Mexico, and Jayapal herself immigrated from India.\n\n\n\n“We are proud to endorse Senator Alex Padilla and Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal – two steadfast champions for immigrant communities who have exercised bold leadership in the fight for pro-immigrant policies in Congress,\" said Bri Gillis, political director of the NILC Immigrant Justice Fund.\n\n\n\n\"Through our endorsements in the 2022 cycle, we look forward to working with candidates who are committed to building a fair, 21st-century immigration system and who recognize that immigrants are a strength to our nation,” she added.\n\n\n\nAlthough NILC's political arm spent millions of dollars supporting President Biden in the 2020 race, the midterm endorsement program represents a political turn for a group known mainly for its legal advocacy and social aid programs for immigrants.\n\n\n\nBoth Jayapal and Padilla welcomed the NILC endorsement, saying they would continue to push for immigration reform in Congress.\n\n\n\n\"As the proud son of Mexican immigrants, I know the contributions immigrants make to our nation, and why we must fight for a vision of America that welcomes immigrants with dignity and humanity. It’s past time for Congress to fix our broken immigration system and fully recognize the essential contribution of immigrants to our country,\" Padilla said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\"I immigrated to this country when I was just 16 years old, sent by my parents so I’d have opportunities to thrive and a life that would not have … been possible otherwise – the same dreams that have drawn countless immigrants to this country and led to our nation’s growth and success,\" said Jayapal.\n\n\n\n\"That is why, as an activist and in Congress, I have never stopped fighting for just and humane immigration policy reform that welcomes and integrates immigrants into our communities. This is about who we are as a country and I will continue to use every opportunity to lead our efforts in Congress,\" she added.\n\n\n\nGillis told The Hill the endorsement program will expand ahead of November's midterms, including to more competitive races with immigrant-friendly candidates.\n\n\n\n\"It's important to look at some of the races that are going to be in contention this election cycle – Nevada, Arizona, those are two really big ones that will determine control of the Senate and even just the power of the immigrant vote in those races could be determining the outcome,\" said Gillis.\n\n\n\nNILC's turn toward politics is in part based on polling the group released in February that shows U.S. voters increasingly want to see immigration reform, particularly actions like making it easier for undocumented people to legalize their status, register to pay taxes or defend their rights in court.\n\n\n\n\"We actually see that quote-unquote 'moderate' or persuadable swing voters care a lot about where candidates stand on immigration and we know that the Republican Party is out of touch with that segment of the electorate,\" said Gillis.",

        "description": "Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said the push to pass her antitrust legislation targeting the largest tech companies isn't dead, despite the bill still waiting for a scheduled floor vote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKlobuchar made her latest endorsement for the future of her American Innovation and Online Choice Act in an interview with Vox’s Kara Swisher at the Code Conference on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), aims to limit tech companies from preferencing their own products and services over rivals'. It advanced out of the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support earlier this year, but has yet to be called for a floor vote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKlobuchar, who chairs the antitrust subcommittee, did not give an exact date or guarantee the vote will happen before the midterms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It is really hard to take on these subjects when you have the biggest companies the world has ever known, that control an inordinate part of the economy, opposed to it,” she said in the interview. “It is an incredible amount of money I’m up against. I have two lawyers. They have 2,800 lawyers and lobbyists. So I’m not naive about the David versus Goliath.”\n\n\n\nShe also told Swisher the upcoming midterm elections may not be a hard deadline for the legislation to pass, even if Republicans gain control of the House and Senate, since the bill has bipartisan support in both chambers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA version of the bill advanced out of the House Judiciary committee last year along with a slate of other antitrust bills targeting the tech giants.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn August a spokesperson for Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said he plans to call the bill to a floor vote but did not provide a timeline.\n\n\n\nSchumer’s statement came roughly a week after Bloomberg reported that the senator told donors he doesn’t think the bill has the votes to pass.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSupporters of the proposal in the Senate and House have dismissed criticism that the bills do not have the votes to pass and have been pushing strongly for votes in both chambers.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3632215-mccarthy-to-unveil-commitment-to-america-plan-of-house-gop-priorities-in-pittsburgh/",
        "description": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) will roll out a four-part plan dubbed “Commitment to America” that outlines priorities for House Republicans at a Pittsburgh event on Sept. 19.\n\n\n\nMcCarthy has said the midterm elections will be a referendum on Democratic control of Washington, but with the plan he also aims to give voters a reason to vote in favor of the GOP. \n\n\n\nAxios was first to&nbsp;report on&nbsp;the planned Pittsburgh rollout event.\n\n\n\nThe “Commitment to America” has been in the works for more than a year. McCarthy assigned more than half of the members of the GOP conference to different issue “task forces,” some of which have released legislative text and plan frameworks.\n\n\n\nMessaging memos distributed by McCarthy’s office before the August recess outline four priorities: “An economy that is strong,” focusing in part on moving supply chains from China to the U.S.; “A nation that is safe,” highlighting migration policies and the U.S.-Mexico border; “A future that is free,” outlining policies concerning public schools; and “a government that is accountable,” promising oversight and investigation into the Biden administration.\n\n\n\nMcCarthy previewed the plan in a speech from Scranton, Pa. last week ahead of a prime-time address from President Biden that warned about threats to Democracy from “MAGA Republicans.”\n\n\n\n“We will fight to stop inflation and lower the cost of living. We will fight to lower the cost of gas. We will stop taxpayer dollars from being wasted on failed programs,” McCarthy said. “We will pass the parents bill of rights so parents have a say in their children's education. We will defend American sovereignty. We will conduct vigorous oversight, check abuses of power and hold all wrongdoers accountable, including our Department of Justice. We will move the supply chain from China back to America. We will pass tough laws and legislation to make our communities safer.”\n\n\n\nThe \"Commitment to America\" title references former GOP Speaker Newt Gingrich's (Ga.) “Contract with America” plan that preceded the “Republican revolution” House takeover in 1994. Gingrich spoke to House Republicans at their annual retreat in March of this year.\n\n\n\nBut it is also not an entirely new concept for McCarthy. He also revealed a “Commitment to America” plan in 2020.",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Helge Thomas (CC-BY-2.0))  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEcotoxicologist Craig Downs describes his main work goal as “preventing zombies”—communities of coral or other marine creatures that appear to be thriving, but upon closer inspection, turn out to be composed only of adults lacking the ability to reproduce. These populations are like the “living dead,” a generation away from vanishing, according to scientists who discovered them in dying reefs across the Caribbean in 2016.\nGlobally, coral reefs are in decline for a number of reasons, including climate change, coastal development, and pollution. Over the years, Downs, executive director of Haereticus Environmental Laboratory in Virginia, has studied sunscreen, microplastics, and most recently, beach showers, in an effort to understand the effects of these human-made substances on some of the world's most popular vacation destinations. His latest study, published in July, could also breathe new life into an old law.\nIn April, the Clean Water Act, the keystone US law on water pollution, took what many environmentalists describe as a tough hit. In a controversial shadow docket decision, the Supreme Court voted to remove states’ power to block federally approved, but environmentally damaging, projects. Commentators decried the attempt to strip states of the right to protect their own waters, one of the core principles enshrined in the act.Read 28 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge / Familiar Splatoon faces show up to usher players through a confusing, unsatisfying campaign. (credit: Nintendo)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the crustacean-filled universe of Nintendo shooter series Splatoon (sorry for the impending pun), something fishy is going on.\nI'm not sure what Nintendo was thinking with its push of Splatoon 3, this week's new sequel, as a replacement for 2017's Splatoon 2. Where the last game added meaningful new weapons and modes to the series' quirky online modes, this year's new model adds a sprinkling of online-only content, which at best leaves the formula unperturbed and, at worst, is in dire need of rebalancing. And while Splatoon 2 and its 2018 expansion pack delivered some of the best solo campaign content of the Switch's generation, Splatoon 3's equivalent is a slapdash mess.\nDue to limited pre-release online testing, I can't definitively review that half of the game, and I'm wondering how much of it can be redeemed with post-launch support. But I'm comfortable enough to say that Nintendo has dropped the ball for series fans and created an unwelcoming mess for newcomers.Read 18 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

It’s a likably silly and relentlessly camp whodunnit spoof from screenwriter Mark Chappell, centred on Agatha Christie’s long-running play The Mousetrap, and an imagined brutal homicide that took place backstage in its London West End theatre in 1953 – when the production was a mere 100 performances old.A brash Hollywood director played by Adrien Brody, who is planning to bring The Mousetrap to the screen, is found horribly murdered in the costume department. Sam Rockwell and Saiorse Ronan have a droll sort of platonic police chemistry as the investigating officers: Inspector Stoppard (a nod to Tom Stoppard’s own spoof meta-mystery The Real Inspector Hound) and his overeager assistant with a silly peaked cap, Constable Stalker, possibly a homage to Tarkovsky or to the former deputy chief constable of Greater Manchester John Stalker. Tim Key (normally Alan Partridge’s sidekick on the parody show Mid- Morning Matters) is very funny as the glowering Met police commissioner. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The MIT professor was unequivocal.“If we had to stop producing CO₂, no coal, oil, or gas could be burned,” Carroll Wilson declared. The world would have to adopt nuclear energy en masse and perhaps even turn to “electric motor vehicles.”It was June 9, 1971. Wilson, a management professor, wasn’t speaking at an environmental rally or a scientific meeting. He was talking to a room full of engineers and businessmen who had gathered in Cleveland, Ohio, for the electricity industry’s annual conference.His speech was as up-to-date a discussion of climate science as you could find in the early 1970s. Although he said that global warming wasn’t yet a scientific certainty—which was true in those days—he was clear that it needed to be taken seriously. And the conference’s organizer, the Edison Electric Institute, seemed keen to get the best climate research in front of its members, even if it had radical implications for their business.Yet scarcely two decades later, virtually the entire electric-utility industry—including the Edison Electric Institute, its flagship lobbying group, and the Electric Power Research Institute, its leading R&amp;D alliance—united against any effort to understand or stop climate change. In 1992, an EEI article said that global warming would not portend disaster, but bring “cooler days, warmer nights, and better vegetables.”Why has it taken so long for the United States to treat climate change seriously, much less adopt serious efforts to stop it? Over the past few years, the public has come to understand at least one cause: A handful of oil companies understood the reality of climate change years before the general public, but waged an expensive and secretive campaign through the 1990s and 2000s to muddy the science and play down the dangers.But oil companies did not act alone. “Utilities were also in the room,” Emily Williams, a researcher at UC Santa Barbara and a co-author of a new study about the electricity industry’s role in spreading climate denial, told me. Years after scientists had reached a consensus that global warming was real, dangerous, and caused by fossil fuels, utilities sold climate half-truths and untruths to policy makers and the public.The study, published this month in Environmental Research Letters, reveals the half-century arc that took electric utilities from feting the country’s top climate scientists in the 1960s to denouncing the importance of their research in the 1990s to reluctantly undertaking efforts to decarbonize their own grids in the 2010s.In the aftermath of the Inflation Reduction Act, the country’s first comprehensive climate law, much of this may seem like academic history. But utilities’ legacy of denial, doubt, and dawdling continues to hold back the country’s energy transition, Leah Stokes, an author of the study and a political scientist at UC Santa Barbara, told me. Many utilities still operate damaging, debt-ridden coal plants today because of the decisions that they made decades ago.Yet utilities remain crucial to fighting climate change. In many scenarios where America has a zero-carbon economy, utilities play a larger role, generating, distributing, and transmitting far more electricity than they do today. “We can’t do this without utilities onboard, honestly,” Stokes said.Electric utilities might be some of the most powerful and least understood companies in America. They count almost every American as a customer, and they bring in more revenue combined each year than Apple does. Yet utilities are so complicated—and, truth be told, so straight-up boring—that they escape public scrutiny. There are investor-owned utilities, publicly owned utilities, and utilities that are somewhere in between. Some utilities are regulated monopolies, generating their own electricity and selling it to captive customers, while others work as middlemen in a deregulated electricity market.But all stripes of utilities fought climate policy aggressively and enduringly, the study finds.The new research looked at 188 speeches, memos, articles, ads, and other industry documents from 1968 to 2019 that mentioned climate change, carbon dioxide, or other climate-related keywords. It isn’t the first study to look at the role of utilities in climate denial: The Brown University sociologist Robert Brulle and the Energy and Policy Institute, an energy-industry watchdog, have both done so.Together, the three studies clarify the root of that opposition. Electricity companies saw themselves as part of a coalition that included their biggest suppliers—namely coal and natural-gas firms—and their biggest customers—steel companies and heavy manufacturers. Freight railroads, which move coal around the country, joined the coalition as well. Because climate policy posed an existential danger to coal and other fossil fuels, utilities saw it as a threat to their own business. (But of course electricity can be generated in cleaner ways too.)This is the first peer-reviewed publication to survey the industry’s messaging specifically, Dave Anderson, an author of the Energy and Policy Institute report, told me. “This is a very important study,” says Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard science historian who has researched on the fossil-fuel industry’s climate denial, and was not involved in the study. “It reminds us that climate disinformation has not been the domain of just one, or even a handful, of fossil-fuel companies, but has been perpetuated by a network of cronyistic industries that support and depend on fossil fuels,” she told me.Neither the Edison Electric Institute nor the Electric Power Research Institute denied the new study’s findings.“The progress that EEI’s member companies have made speaks for itself. We are leading the world in reducing carbon emissions, and today, 40 percent of U.S. electricity comes from clean, carbon-free resources,” Brian Reil, an EEI spokesperson, told me in a statement.The Electric Power Research Institute “examines all risks to the grid, including climate, as part of an overall effort to drive innovation to ensure the public has clean, reliable, affordable, and equitable access to electricity across the globe,” Rachel Gantz, a spokesperson for the group, said.Utilities didn’t start out seeking to distort climate science. As the issue dawned in the 1970s, they treated climate change mostly as a scientific matter, the study finds.In 1977, an internal memo from the Electric Power Research Institute, or EPRI, straightforwardly described fossil fuels as the “principal manmade source of CO2 emissions” and warned that the amount of that gas in the atmosphere could double by 2030.That seriousness continued into the next decade. In 1986, an EPRI article about climate change warned that the “sweeping consequences of accumulating greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may turn out to be the greatest environmental problem of modern times.”But as the science became more concerning, utility executives began to downplay what they could do to stop climate change. By the late ’80s, the industry had started to channel a certain learned helplessness: Even if the greenhouse effect was real, executives argued, neither the power sector nor the United States could solve it alone. At the time, the U.S. power sector alone generated about 7 percent of all global emissions.Then the science became unmistakable. In 1988, one of NASA’s top climate scientists told a Senate panel that global warming had already begun. Two years later, the new United Nations–led Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that “immediate reductions” in greenhouse-gas emissions were needed.The industry’s leaders made a fateful decision: They began denying that climate change existed altogether. “You get this huge divergence where as the science becomes clearer, the utility messaging becomes muddier,” Stokes told me.The Edison Electric Institute and three utilities helped establish the Global Climate Coalition, or GCC, one of the most notorious advocates of climate denial and doubt. The GCC opposed any effort to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, attacked individual climate scientists, and ran an extensive, secretive campaign to tone down the IPCC’s research findings. Utilities made up more than a quarter of the GCC’s members at its peak; an EPRI employee also participated in GCC meetings.The GCC wasn’t the only group that utilities propped up. In 1991, the Edison Electric Institute helped start the Information Council on the Environment, a short-lived PR group that sought to discredit climate science. The group ran infamous ads in several cities that asked, “Who told you the earth was warming, Chicken Little?” and claimed there was “no hard evidence” that climate change “is occurring.”The efforts were successful. One of the GCC’s main goals was to prevent the United States from entering the Kyoto Protocol, an early climate treaty. In 1997, the Senate effectively blocked the U.S. from carrying out the protocol or any similar treaty; in 2001, President George W. Bush announced that the U.S. would not implement the treaty.Bush “rejected Kyoto, in part, based on input from you,” a State Department official later told the GCC’s leaders, according to a briefing memo from that year.After 2000, the industry switched to delaying climate policy rather than sowing doubt about it. The study finds that the industry embraced the promise of carbon capture and “clean coal” to combat climate change. Industry documents mention these largely notional technologies as often as they mention renewables or more proven ways of reducing emissions.At the same time, utilities also participated in at least three organizations that aimed to block climate policy, the study finds. EEI attended the meeting of one of these groups, the American Legislative Exchange Council, as recently as 2019; that group still publishes open climate denial on its website.Not until 2015 did EEI and EPRI consistently acknowledge the reality of climate change and the need for policy in their documents. And this year, EEI was “fairly constructive” during legislative negotiations over the Inflation Reduction Act, pushing for the most aggressive and generous version of the clean-energy tax credits, Stokes said.Still, despite that recent turn, utilities must confront their role in propping up climate denial for so long, Stokes told me. Many of them are still dealing with the afterlife of their denial: billions of dollars of debt tied up in uneconomic coal plants. Of the 10 utilities that did the most to spread climate denial, eight remain heavily invested in coal and fossil fuels and have the most inadequate transition plans, the study found.Fifty utilities in EEI now have “clear forward-looking carbon-reduction goals,” Reil, the institute’s spokesperson said, and “dozens … are aiming for net-zero or equivalent by 2050 or sooner.”“In general, the utility industry has not been visionary. They’ve been stuck in the past and have not been able to see the change that the clean-energy revolution could bring,” she added. Even though climate change represents the industry’s first pathway for growth since the 1970s, utilities resisted following it for years, Stokes said. Its objection to climate change was as much sociological as it was profit-driven.That backwards-looking attitude is exactly the opposite of what Wilson preached in his 1971 speech. Begging his audience to consider the next 30 to 50 years, he reminded them that the problems of the 21st century were not so far away.",

        "description": "Sometime in the spring of 2020, after centuries, perhaps millennia, of tumultuous coexistence with humans, influenza abruptly went dark. Around the globe, documented cases of the viral infection completely cratered as the world tried to counteract SARS-CoV-2. This time last year, American experts began to fret that the flu’s unprecedented sabbatical was too bizarre to last: Perhaps the group of viruses that cause the disease would be poised for an epic comeback, slamming us with “a little more punch” than usual, Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, in Tennessee, told me at the time.But those fears did not not come to pass. Flu’s winter 2021 season in the Southern Hemisphere was once again eerily silent; in the north, cases sneaked up in December—only to peter out before a lackluster reprise in the spring.Now, as the weather once again chills in this hemisphere and the winter holidays loom, experts are nervously looking ahead. After skipping two seasons in the Southern Hemisphere, flu spent 2022 hopping across the planet’s lower half with more fervor than it’s had since the COVID crisis began. And of the three years of the pandemic that have played out so far, this one is previewing the strongest signs yet of a rough flu season ahead.\r\nIt’s still very possible that the flu will fizzle into mildness for the third year in a row, making experts’ gloomier suspicions welcomingly wrong. Then again, this year is, virologically, nothing like the last. Australia recently wrapped an unusually early and “very significant” season with flu viruses, says Kanta Subbarao, the director of the WHO Collaborating Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute. By sheer confirmed case counts, this season was one of the country’s worst in several years. In South Africa, “it’s been a very typical flu season” by pre-pandemic standards, which is still enough to be of note, according to Cheryl Cohen, a co-head of the country’s Centre for Respiratory Disease and Meningitis at the National Institute for Communicable Diseases. After a long, long hiatus, Subbarao told me, flu in the Southern Hemisphere “is certainly back.”[Read: The pandemic broke the flu]That does not bode terribly well for those of us up north. The same viruses that seed outbreaks in the south tend to be the ones that sprout epidemics here as the seasons do their annual flip. “I take the south as an indicator,” says Seema Lakdawala, a flu-transmission expert at Emory University. And should flu return here, too, with a vengeance, it will collide with a population that hasn’t seen its likes in years, and is already trying to marshal responses to several dangerous pathogens at once.The worst-case scenario won’t necessarily pan out. What goes on below the equator is never a perfect predictor for what will occur above it: Even during peacetime, “we’re pretty bad in terms of predicting what a flu season is going to look like,” Webby, of St. Jude, told me. COVID, and the world’s responses to it, have put experts’ few forecasting tools further on the fritz. But the south’s experiences can still be telling. In South Africa and Australia, for instance, many COVID-mitigation measures, such as universal masking recommendations and post-travel quarantines, lifted as winter arrived, allowing a glut of respiratory viruses to percolate through the population. The flu flood also began after two essentially flu-less years—which is a good thing at face value, but also represents many months of missed opportunities to refresh people’s anti-flu defenses, leaving them more vulnerable at the season’s start.Some of the same factors are working against those of us north of the equator, perhaps to an even greater degree. Here, too, the population is starting at a lower defensive baseline against flu—especially young children, many of whom have never tussled with the viruses. It’s “very, very likely” that kids may end up disproportionately hit, Webby said, as they appear to have been in Australia—though Subbarao notes that this trend may have been driven by more cautious behaviors among older populations, skewing illness younger.Interest in inoculations has also dropped during the pandemic: After more than a year of calls for booster after booster, “people have a lot of fatigue,” says Helen Chu, a physician and flu expert at the University of Washington, and that exhaustion may be driving already low interest in flu shots even further down. (During good years, flu-shot uptake in the U.S. peaks around 50 percent.) And the few protections against viruses that were still in place last winter have now almost entirely vanished. In particular, schools—a fixture of flu transmission—have loosened up enormously since last year. There’s also just “much more flu around,” all over the global map, Webby said. With international travel back in full swing, the viruses will get that many more chances to hopscotch across borders and ignite an outbreak. And should such an epidemic emerge, with its health infrastructure already under strain from simultaneous outbreaks of COVID, monkeypox, and polio, America may not handle another addition well. “Overall,” Chu told me, “we are not well prepared.”[Read: The most important vaccine I’ll get this fall]At the same time, though, countries around the world have taken such different approaches to COVID mitigation that the pandemic may have further uncoupled their flu-season fate. Australia’s experience with the flu, for instance, started, peaked, and ended early this year; the new arrival of more relaxed travel policies likely played a role in the outbreak’s beginning, before a mid-year BA.5 surge potentially hastened the sudden drop. It’s also very unclear whether the U.S. may be better or worse off because its last flu season was wimpy, weirdly shaped, and unusually late. South Africa saw an atypical summer bump in flu activity as well; those infections may have left behind a fresh dusting of immunity and blunted the severity of the following season, Cohen told me. But it’s always hard to tell. “I was quite strong in saying that I really believed that South Africa was going to have a severe season,” she said. “And it seems that I was wrong.” The long summer tail of the Northern Hemisphere’s most recent flu season could also exacerbate the intensity of the coming winter season, says John McCauley, the director of the Worldwide Influenza Centre at the Francis Crick Institute, in London. Kept going in their off-season, the viruses may have an easier vantage point from which to reemerge this winter.COVID’s crush has shifted flu dynamics on the whole as well. The pandemic “squeezed out” a lot of diversity from the influenza-virus population, Webby told me; some lineages may have even entirely blipped out. But others could also still be stewing and mutating, potentially in animals or unmonitored pockets of the world. That these strains—which harbor especially large pandemic potential—could emerge into the general population is “my bigger concern,” Lakdawala, of Emory, told me. And although the particular strains of flu that are circulating most avidly seem reasonably well matched to this year’s vaccines, the dominant strains that attack the north could yet shift, says Florian Krammer, a flu virologist at Mount Sinai’s Icahn School of Medicine. Viruses also tend to wobble and hop when they return from long vacations; it may take a season or two before the flu finds its usual rhythm.Another epic SARS-CoV-2 variant could also quash a would-be influenza peak. Flu cases rose at the end of 2021, and the dreaded “twindemic” loomed. But then, Omicron hit—and flu “basically disappeared for one and a half months,” Krammer told me, only tiptoeing back onto the scene after COVID cases dropped. Some experts suspect that the immune system may have played a role in this tag-team act: Although co-infections or sequential infections of SARS-CoV-2 and flu viruses are possible, the aggressive spread of a new coronavirus variant may have set people’s defenses on high alert, making it that much harder for another pathogen to gain a foothold.[Read: Don’t worry, it’s not the flu]No matter the odds we enter flu season with, human behavior can still alter winter’s course. One of the main reasons that flu viruses have been so absent the past few years is because mitigation measures have kept them at bay. “People understand transmission more than they ever did before,” Lakdawala told me. Subbarao thinks COVID wisdom is what helped keep Australian flu deaths down, despite the gargantuan swell in cases: Older people took note of the actions that thwarted the coronavirus and applied those same lessons to flu. Perhaps populations across the Northern Hemisphere will act in similar ways. “I would hope that we’ve actually learned how to deal with infectious disease more seriously,” McCauley told me.But Webby isn’t sure that he’s optimistic. “People have had enough hearing about viruses in general,” he told me. Flu, unfortunately, does not feel similarly about us.",

        "description": "Sometime in the spring of 2020, after centuries, perhaps millennia, of tumultuous coexistence with humans, influenza abruptly went dark. Around the globe, documented cases of the viral infection completely cratered as the world tried to counteract SARS-CoV-2. This time last year, American experts began to fret that the flu’s unprecedented sabbatical was too bizarre to last: Perhaps the group of viruses that cause the disease would be poised for an epic comeback, slamming us with “a little more punch” than usual, Richard Webby, an influenza expert at St. Jude Children’s Research Hospital, in Tennessee, told me at the time.But those fears did not not come to pass. Flu’s winter 2021 season in the Southern Hemisphere was once again eerily silent; in the north, cases sneaked up in December—only to peter out before a lackluster reprise in the spring.Now, as the weather once again chills in this hemisphere and the winter holidays loom, experts are nervously looking ahead.

        "description": "In Italy all you get is Italian and we win hands down on variety. That is, until you stop off at a motorway service stationLast month in Croatia an old Serbian guy told me a joke about the British, the French, the Germans and the Swiss. I’m shaky on the details but it concerned a vision of paradise in which the engineers were German, the chefs were French, the lovers were Italian, the Swiss were in charge of organising everything and the police – or the “bobbies” as my Serbian friend Slobo called them – were British. I felt a light swelling of pride at this Dixon of Dock Green characterisation of law enforcement in my home country. As for the punchline, I’m not sure how we got to it but there was some kind of muddle in which the Italians were put in charge of organising everything, which led to the policing being done by the Germans, the engineering by the French, the British did the cooking and all the lovers were Swiss.Now, there’s a lot of crass national stereotyping to unpick here. German coppers seem OK to me, and our Renault drives very nicely. As for the Swiss, while I’ve never had a Swiss lover, I can’t imagine what they might lack for in the bedroom. My friend told me he once offended a Swiss bloke with this joke, and now he had offended me. It wasn’t the first time I’d heard my home country’s food casually disparaged in my earshot. And I’m not having it. Having spent three weeks travelling around Europe this summer, I know for sure that, depending on the criteria, we’re the best. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Eebbers, an 11-year-old explosive detection canine, has retired after nearly a decade of service.Transportation Security AdministrationA Transportation Security Administration K9 named Eebbers has retired after nearly a decade of service, during which he earned the distinction of being the agency&#x27;s oldest working bomb-sniffing dog, as well as its cutest. This is an objective fact (though it&#x27;s also true that every dog is the best dog): Eebbers won the TSA&#x27;s &quot;2022 Cutest Canine Contest&quot; in August, shortly before he celebrated his retirement with a treat-laden sendoff at his home base of Minneapolis-St.Paul International Airport (MSP).The 11-year-old vizsla-Labrador mix was born into TSA&#x27;s Puppy Program at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas and, at the time of his retirement, was the last remaining Puppy Program canine still working daily for the agency. He was named after U.S. Army Pvt. James Ebbers, who died at age 19 in Djibouti, Africa in 2002 while assigned to the 551st Military Police Company (based at Fort Campbell, Ky.). In addition to his work sniffing for explosives as a passenger screening canine at MSP, Eebbers also helped with security at major sporting events including two Super Bowls, the Indianapolis 500, an NCAA National Championship football game and the Special Olympics World Games. And he also makes time for fun.&quot;He stays very active every day, even during the cold Minnesota winters, and he loves swimming in any of Minnesota&#x27;s 10,000 lakes in the summer,&quot; according to TSA. Passenger screening canines like Eebbers are trained to detect the scent of explosives or explosive materials among travelers, typically in security checkpoint lines, and alert their handlers if they sniff something suspicious. They are tested regularly to make sure they are fit for service in busy airports — and while they are sociable, the agency says, they are working dogs who should only be touched and fed by their handlers.&quot;His ability to search out his trained odors amazes me every day,&quot; Jean Carney, Eebbers&#x27; handler and lifelong partner, told Minnesota&#x27;s Star Tribune.She described him as smart, gentle and polite, adding that he&#x27;d be waiting at the stairs at 3:30 a.m., ready to go to work.Most dogs retire when they&#x27;re 7 or 8 years old due to the demands of the high-pressure job, according to Carney, who is also retiring. She said she wanted Eebbers to &quot;enjoy his last few years just being a dog.&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s inevitable he was going to come to a point where he was going to start slowing down, and maybe start not being as proficient as he was when he was younger,&quot; she said, according to CBS affiliate KENS5. &quot;I didn&#x27;t want him to go out on a low note.&quot;That was definitely not the case. Last month Eebbers clinched the title of TSA&#x27;s cutest canine in a nationwide social media contest, in which he was chosen by public vote from among four finalists (narrowed down by TSA employees from a field of nearly 100). Days later, he and Carney celebrated their last day at work, with some special surprises. Eebbers&#x27; &quot;do not pet&quot; vest was replaced with a standard collar and leash, meaning he could finally get scratchies from his colleagues and admirers. He was showered with stuffed toys and celebrated with several bomb-shaped cakes, and both he and Carney received commemorative plaques.&quot;It was the pinnacle of what we&#x27;ve worked for for all of these years. Just to let him be the dog that he deserves to be,&quot; Carney told KENS5. &quot;He&#x27;s worked so hard all of these years. He&#x27;s been so dedicated, and such a hard worker, and the only thing he asked is [for] that toy.&quot;So what does post-retirement bliss hold in store for Eebbers? First things first, according to Carney, a swim in Iowa&#x27;s Lake Okoboji and a long walk with his sister Etti (who herself is retired from the FBI). Eebbers and his fans have much else to look forward to. Later this year, for instance, TSA will announce the availability of its 2023 Canine Calendar — which will feature Eebbers on the cover.

        "description": "Studies have repeatedly suggested that physical conditions like immunosuppression and hypertension can increase a person&#x2019;s risk not only for severe Covid but also long Covid. But in a new study, researchers found that psychological stressors such as depression, anxiety, and loneliness were more predictive of Covid patients&#x2019; likelihood of experiencing long Covid than classically associated physical factors.\n&#x201C;Unfortunately, there&#x2019;s a long history of people not taking these conditions as seriously as they might take physical health conditions that might be easier to measure or easier to see,&#x201D; said Andrea Roberts, a senior research scientist at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the senior author on the study, which was published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry. &#x201C;For long Covid, obviously, then, it becomes very important to look at psychological health, and it raises more broadly the question of the importance of identifying and treating mental health issues.&#x201D;Read the rest&hellip;",

        "description": "Kamil Krzaczynski-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Cubs pound Reds 9-3 in their return home to Wrigley Field. We say “baseball happened” when some lousy team beats one of the better teams. That scenario plays itself out basically every day somewhere across baseball. The reality that it is hard to sweep a series leads to these outcomes. It’s essentially a baseball meme to hold up what is essentially an exception as almost an expected occurrence. Fans and media romanticize these occurrences and really, who can blame them? Everyone loves an underdog, particularly if isn’t your favorite team they are upsetting. \nNo words are spent romanticizing when a poor Cubs team heads to St. Louis and gets stomped most of the weekend. Before that, they did hang in against two fringe contenders in Milwaukee and Toronto. They won one game in each location and hung in there for the most part across six games in those two stops on their road trip. Again, nothing too shocking there, the Cubs hung in there against the two middle of the road teams and got knocked around by the one very good team. \nAnd so it is no real surprise that the Cubs came home and beat up on a team playing out the string. This isn’t to say that I don’t appreciate the win. Writing about winning is so much better than writing about losing. It’s funny to me, thinking back to the days before I regularly wrote about baseball. There is a perception that exists that writers like to write about gloom and doom. I can tell you for sportswriting, that couldn’t be further from the truth. \nWhen the Cubs were good, I could fill this space with talk about a single issue. Who should lead off? Lineup questions in general. Who should the fifth starter be? Is the bullpen being over used? Whatever, there are so many words to be written about ways to optimize a good team. 500 words about why Christopher Morel should lead off over Zach McKinstry feels totally accurate like rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic. \nMy wife would laugh to hear me say this, but I don’t like to just harp on an issue. This year, while the Cubs were playing poorly, I aired frustration with David Ross and with the front office as a whole. I will certainly revisit those issues again if there is a new reason to be frustrated about them. But I’m never going to use this space to just lash out day after day against one person or a group of people. That just feels mean and petty. We’ve all seen exceptions through the years, but by and large everyone involved is working their butt off trying to be better. No one likes losing. \nSo, now that I’ve gotten us way off topic, let’s circle back. The Cubs returned home Tuesday after a rough trip. They found the Reds waiting. The Reds are pretty clearly playing out the string at this point. They are squarely in the middle of another rebuild and their cupboard is a little barren just now. Ostensibly, this Cubs team is on the rise. We can probably debate how fast they are rising and/or how far away they are. But the Cubs did what a team on the rise should do, they took care of business. \nTo be fair, this wasn’t a full walkover. Kyle Farmer drove in two in the first with a triple off of ex-Red Wade Miley, who was making only his fifth start of the year due to injury. Farmer returned to the scene of the crime to hit a solo homer in the third and the Reds led 3-1. For what it’s worth, those were the only two hits Miley allowed over four innings, but they were damaging blows. \nThe Cubs got their offense in gear in the fifth inning and never looked back. They scored in each of their last four at bats, totaling eight runs. Seven different Cubs had hits and seven also scored at least one run. So this was a team effort.\nThere were definitely some positives in this one. We start with the new guy. Hayden Wesneski, how do you do? Wesneski made his Cubs debut with five innings of outstanding relief work. For his efforts, he won his first game in his first appearance. We can all cringe at that stat, but this is one we don’t quibble with. There were two pitchers, Miley threw four innings and allowed three runs (two earned). Wesneski threw five innings and allowed two hits and one walk while striking out eight. That’s my top performance of the night. \nNick Madrigal did a heck of a job in the leadoff spot, as he has largely done down the stretch of this season. He had a pair of hits and a walk, one a double. He stole a base and he even drove in two runs. In 105 plate appearances since coming off the injured list, Nick has a line of .301/.375/.344 (wRC+ 109). \nIn this one, Nico Hoerner was in the middle of the lineup. Ironically, Madrigal led off and drove in runs and Nico batted in the middle and scored runs, three of them to be exact. He too had a pair of hits and a walk, his extra base hit was a triple and he was also hit by a pitch. Yes, he also matched the stolen base. It’s not hard to imagine Nico and Nick  being a real terror in a more menacing lineup. They aren’t going to beat you with 450-foot homers, but if you don’t have good execution of your plan against them, they are going to be a menace. \nCertainly, on a night like this, there were many to choose from, but those were my three top performances of the night. Let’s see how WPA scored it. \nGame 135, September 6: Cubs 9, Reds 3 (57-78)\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs\n  \nReminder: Heroes and Goats are determined by WPA scores and are in no way subjective.\nTHREE HEROES:\n\n\nSuperhero: Nick Madrigal (.235). 2-4, 2B, 2RBI, BB, SB\n\nHero: Seiya Suzuki (.217). 1-3, HR, 3RBI, 2BB, K\n\nSidekick: Hayden Wesneski (.196). 5IP (18 batters), 2H, BB, 8K (W 1-0)\n\nTHREE GOATS:\n\n\nBilly Goat: Yan Gomes (-.146). 0-4, SH, DP\n\nGoat: Wade Miley (-.135). 4IP (17 batters), 2H, 2BB, 3R (2ER), 6K\n\nKid: P.J. Higgins (-.105). 0-1, BB, R\n\nWPA Play of the Game: Seiya Suzuki batted with a runner on third and two outs in the fifth, the Cubs down two. He homered and the Cubs were tied. (.253)\n*Reds Play of the Game: Kyle Farmer was just the third batter of the game when he batted with two on and nobody out. He tripled to give the Reds an early lead. (.171)\n\nRizzo Award Cumulative Standings: (Top 5/Bottom 5)\nThe award is named for Anthony Rizzo, who finished first in this category three of the first four years it was in existence and four times overall. He also recorded the highest season total ever at +65.5. The point scale is three points for a Superhero down to negative three points for a Billy Goat.\n\nDavid Robertson +22.5\nScott Effross +17\nNico Hoerner +16.5\nChristopher Morel +15\nPatrick Wisdom +13.5\nDaniel Norris/Frank Schwindel/Rowan Wick -9.5\nRafael Ortega -13.5\nYan Gomes -15\nJason Heyward -15.5\n\nUp Next: Game two of the three-game set. Javier Assad (0-0, 0.90) will make another start for the Cubs. He’ll be opposed by Mike Minor (3-10, 5.98). Minor is surely ready for this season to end.",

        "description": "Derek Thompson: &#8220;The first fact was sadly unsurprising: The coronavirus pandemic killed so many people that U.S. life expectancy fell from roughly 79 in 2019 to 76 in 2021—the largest two-year decline in nearly a century. The drop was sharpest among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, whose life expectancy fell to 65, close to the national average during World War II.&#8221;\n&#8220;Life expectancy is perhaps the most important statistic on the planet, synthesizing a country’s scientific advances, policy errors, and social sins into a single number. The number is built on a weird hypothetical. The formula for life expectancy says: If Americans lived their entire life in one year—say, 2021—repeating it over and over again like an extended Groundhog Day experiment, how long would the typical person survive? It’s a useful exercise for the purpose of capturing one year’s conditions. But it imagines a life that nobody will ever live. U.S. life expectancy will almost certainly surge in 2022 and beyond, not only because the worst of the pandemic is over, but also because the disaster accelerated technology like mRNA vaccines that could raise life expectancy in future decades.&#8221;\n&#8220;The second fact was perhaps more alarming: The U.S. fared worse in life expectancy than other high-income countries. While most of the developed world saw conditions improve in the second year of the pandemic, more Americans died of COVID after the introduction of the vaccines than before their invention.&#8221;",

Moreover, it is the first time that a 50-50 Senate has been controlled by Democrats.&nbsp; In the prior three instances, a Republican vice president broke the tie in favor of a Republican Senate leader. As everyone knows, Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), was anointed the Senate majority leader in a tie-breaking vote by Vice President Kamala Harris, after she and President Joe Biden were sworn into office. But this almost two-year run of a 50-50 Senate deserves some historical context, particularly if the results of the November elections lengthen the historical record.\n\n\n\nThe most recent occurrence of an evenly split Senate was between 2000 and 2001. Vice President Al Gore had the tie-breaking vote during the final weeks of President Clinton’s administration. After President George W. Bush was sworn in, Republicans held the tie breaking vote, with Vice President Dick Cheney presiding over the Senate. But this only lasted until June 2001 when Sen. Jim Jeffords (I-VT) left the Republican Party and caucused with Democrats. Previously, the only other times the Senate has had even partisan representation was in 1954, when Vice President Richard Nixon held the tie-breaking vote, and in 1881 when Vice President Chester Arthur and the Republicans held the tie-breaking vote. The current makeup is by far the longest running evenly matched Senate in U.S. history.\n\n\n\nFrom a legislative productivity perspective, closely divided Senates have delivered some major bills to the president’s desk. In fact, from 1951 TO 1959 the Senate was comprised of 49-47 (D-R), 48-47-1 (R-D-I), 48-47-1 (D-R-I) and 49-47 (D-R) during the 82nd to 85th Congresses. During that period Congress passed the $500-billion interstate highway system, the Small Business Act of 1953, the National Housing Act of 1954, the Air Pollution Control Act of 1955, and the Civil Rights Act of 1957. And in 2001, a month after the Sept. 11 attacks on our nation, a split Senate passed the Patriot Act as well, as the No Child Left Behind education bill in 2002.\n\n\n\nBut this Senate has accomplished even more — on both a partisan and bipartisan basis. On a more partisan basis and in the midst of a global pandemic in March 2021, using the budget reconciliation process, Congress narrowly passed the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan (ARP). This bill was largely in the form of COVID relief directed at families and businesses, and it is credited with the largest drop in poverty in 50 years. And last month, the Senate again used the budget reconciliation process to pass the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The IRA included provisions to reduce drug prices, increase renewable energy tax credits and grants for energy and manufacturing jobs, bolster the IRS and reduce the deficit, while modestly raising corporate taxes and closing some loopholes.\n\n\n\nOn a bipartisan basis, the Senate may have accomplished even more than it did via party-line votes. In November 2021, the Senate passed a $1.2 trillion Bipartisan Infrastructure Law with broad Democratic and Republican support (69-30). That legislation invested massively in transportation and communications infrastructure. Last month, the Senate passed the CHIPS and Science Act (64-33) to provide $200 billion in federal funds for domestic semiconductor production. Those funds will not solve the short-term chip shortages, but will incentivize the construction of U.S. factories to stabilize and secure a better technology supply chain. Some have called the legislation the “largest industrial development program the federal government has ever administered.”\n\n\n\nThe 50-50 Senate also acted in two health and safety areas where there had been no real Congressional action in 30 years — veterans’ health and gun violence. The Senate passed the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act (PACT Act) (86-11) in last month to expand veteran’s health care benefits, particularly those exposed to burn pits and other toxic chemicals while serving our country. And in response to another horrific school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, the Senate passed the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act in June 2022 (60-33), which expanded background checks for those under 21, increased mental health services, added gun purchase restrictions for felons, and provided over $2 billion in grant funding for states and community-based violence prevention.\n\n\n\nPassing big bills in Congress is hard work. Getting members of your own party to agree on solutions to public policy problems, as we have seen over the last 18 months, is not a given.&nbsp; Getting members of the other party to agree on solutions and processes is even harder. But this Congress, particularly this 50-50 Senate, has done so repeatedly, on big issues, and with no margin for error.\n\n\n\nIsrael “Izzy” Klein is Co-Founder &amp; Principal, Klein/Johnson Group LLC.

The man was killed following an hours-long standoff with police.\n\n\n\nEven though the Tech Transparency Project saw a resurgence accompanying the Mar-a-Lago search, several boogaloo accounts were created in the spring after President Biden announced efforts to curb gun violence, the report noted.\n\n\n\nThe accounts appear to be evading Facebook’s detection by using coded keywords and variations of boogaloo like “bogaloo” and “big igloo,” according to the report. The Tech Transparency Project also found several new boogaloo memes, which the movement often uses for recruitment and propaganda.\n\n\n\nThe “boogaloo bois” are an anti-government extremist group that believes in a coming second U.S. civil war, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Facebook labeled the boogaloo movement a “dangerous organization” and&nbsp;banned it from the platform&nbsp;in 2020.\n\n\n\nThe movement “appeared to fracture” after the 2020 election and became less active on social media, according to the Tech Transparency Project.\n\n\n\nThe report criticized Facebook’s apparent lack of response, saying it demonstrates “yet again how the platform fails to deal with extremist activity that violates its policies.”\n\n\n\nFacebook’s parent company Meta noted when it first banned the boogaloo movement in 2020, that it was aware the group would likely attempt to “return to using our platform and adopting new terminology.”\n\n\n\n“This is an adversarial space, with perpetrators constantly trying to find new ways to evade our policies, which is why we work with a number of organizations to flag content and stay ahead of evolving trends,” a Meta spokesperson said on Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Collaborations like these are only effective when organizations work with us,” the spokesperson added, noting that the Tech Transparency Program did not previously share its research with the company.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmployers are looking to fill pandemic-era job vacancies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose who switch jobs now are positioned to gain the highest pay hikes seen in 20 years.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMillennials and Gen Zers are already known to job hop and data show these young workers are taking advantage of the current hot market.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWage increases for those who switch jobs are at their highest point in 20 years, and job-hopping Millennial and Gen Z workers are taking advantage of this market while reaping the economic benefits.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThanks to a combination of pandemic-era job vacancies and employers sweetening offers with inflation-adjusted wages and premiums, it’s shaping up to be an opportune time for young workers eyeing greener pastures.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn April 2022 Gen Z job transitions were nearly 30 percent higher than the total reported a year earlier, compared with a 9.6 percent increase among Millennials.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Bank of America Institute report published in May found, “it has paid off to move jobs,” especially for younger generations, who appear to have done “exceptionally well” by doing so. Researchers found that between May of last year and April of this year, younger generations saw the largest pay raises.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Generation Z and Millennials received pay increases of 19.9 percent and 11.3 percent, respectively, over this period,” researchers wrote, noting Millennial increases were significantly higher than those recorded for Gen X.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe annual pay raise associated with job switches was around 17.6 percent, according to Bank of America data. For younger workers, that raise was even higher – Gen Z job changers secured an average 29.7 percent rise and Millennials received a 20 percent rise.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In other words, and perhaps unsurprisingly, it has paid off to move jobs,” researchers wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFigures also suggested individuals who earned less than $50,000 per year were more likely to switch jobs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn July, inflation was measured at 8.5 percent. For those whose wages have not grown to reflect the shift, everyday costs of living have cut deeper into salaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPew data show the majority of individuals who did switch jobs between April 2021 and March 2022 saw an increase in inflation-adjusted earnings.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn addition, new data from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta show workers who recently switched jobs netted an annual raise of around 8.5 percent in July compared with 7.9 percent in June. In comparison, those who remained at the same job saw a median annual wage increase of just 5.9 percent in July.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFurther research from ADP found median change in annual pay rose by 7.6 percent for job stayers, but by 16.1 percent for job switchers. \n\n\n\nBoth Millennials and Gen Z have a reputation as job hoppers. According to a recent report from Pew Research Center, “young adults are more likely to change jobs in any given month.” The report showed those between the ages 16 to 24 switched employers at a monthly rate of 4.1 percent in 2019 and 4.4 percent in 2022, while those ages 55 to 64 moved at a rate of just 1.9 percent in 2022.\n\n\n\nGen Z and Millennials face a myriad of economic challenges that make the potential of a higher salary enticing and could in part explain their trend of job switching. High student debt and rent prices, along with stagnant wages at their current jobs, are just a few of these challenges.\n\n\n\nYounger individuals and those with lower incomes are also more likely to take on independent freelance work out of financial necessity or because it offers increased flexibility, underscoring the shortcomings some see in more traditional roles.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEagerness to switch jobs among these younger cohorts could also reflect concerns outside of wages. Many members of Gen Z, the most recent college graduates, may have higher aspirations than their current positions which could be entry-level jobs. A lack of children, houses, or other major financial responsibilities enables job flexibility at this early career stage. \n\n\n\nTech-savvy and skilled Millennials who have been in the workforce longer can also be attractive candidates for recruiters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYoung workers tend to seek out jobs that align with their personal values, as a survey from Deloitte shows around 37 percent of Millennial and Gen Z workers have turned down a job or assignment based on their personal ethics. Aligning both personal and company values could result in younger professionals being more selective when deciding which opportunities to pursue. \n\n\n\nBenefits like flexible work hours, vacation time, and retirement contributions can also sway workers from company to company.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRegardless of the reason, changing jobs does come with a set of risks. Should a recession occur, those newest to the company might also be the first to get let go. And switching a job in and of itself does not guarantee a wage increase, while employees could run into similar challenges present at their old job, or not enjoy the new position.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFilling jobs cut during the pandemic may also slow in the coming months, leaving less opportunities available for those wishing to switch.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Our data suggests a shift toward a more conservative pace of hiring, possibly as companies try to decipher the economy's conflicting signals,\" explained Nela Richardson, chief economist at ADP in a statement.\n\n\n\n\"We could be at an inflection point, from super-charged job gains to something more normal.\"",

Ron DeSantis (R) holds a narrow three-point lead over Democratic Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.) in a new poll commissioned by AARP for Florida's gubernatorial race. \n\n\n\nThe poll, conducted by Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research, found DeSantis receiving 50 percent support among likely voters compared to Crist at 47 percent. The polling falls within the margin of error, effectively tying the two candidates.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmong voters polled between the ages of 18 and 49 years old, Crist holds an edge with 51 percent compared to DeSantis’ 46 percent. But the Florida governor holds a 7-percentage point lead among voters aged 50 years and old, receiving 52 percent support from that age demographic compared to Crist’s 45 percent.\n\n\n\nAmong Independents, a critical voting bloc that will help determine if the governor gets another term in the swing state, DeSantis received 49 percent support while Crist received 45 percent.\n\n\n\nWhile the gubernatorial race will be a test for Democrats heading into one of the competitive gubernatorial races this cycle, it’s also being closely watched for how well DeSantis performs as he’s been widely floated as a potential 2024 GOP presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nDeSantis has won close races in the past. He squeaked out a win for his first term in 2018 by less than half a percentage point.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe AARP-commissioned poll was conducted between Aug. 24 and Aug. 31 with 1,626 likely Florida voters surveyed, including a statewide sample of 500 and a sample of 860 aged 50 years and older. \n\n\n\nThe margin of error for the statewide sample is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points and the margin of error for the older voting sample is plus or minus 3.3 percentage points.&nbsp;",

        "description": "The U.S. National Security Council (NSC) on Wednesday called for Iran to be held accountable for an “unprecedented” cyberattack it said the country committed against Albania in July.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a release the United States condemns Iran’s actions and plans to hold Iran accountable for threatening the security of an ally and setting a “troubling precedent” for cyberspace.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA cyberattack temporarily shut down multiple Albanian government digital services and websites on July 15. Prime Minister Edi Rama said in a statement addressed to the Albanian people on Wednesday that an investigation confirmed “without a shadow of a doubt” that the attack was not conducted by individuals or independent criminal organizations, but state-sponsored group.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRama said investigators reviewed “indisputable” evidence that Iran ordered the attack and engaged four groups that conducted it, including one that has previously launched cyberattacks on Israel, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait and Cyprus.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said Albania has cut diplomatic relations with Iran effective immediately and ordered all diplomatic, technical, administrative and security staff at the Iranian embassy to leave within 24 hours.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWatson said the U.S. government has been working alongside private sector partners for weeks to support Albania’s efforts to recover from and investigate the attack. Albania is an ally of the U.S. as a member of NATO.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWatson said Iran’s conduct ignores established peacetime norms of a state refraining from damaging infrastructure that provides a service to the public.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Malicious cyber activity by a State that intentionally damages critical infrastructure or otherwise impairs its use and operation to provide services to the public can have cascading domestic, regional,&nbsp;and global effects; pose an elevated risk of harm to the population; and may lead to escalation and&nbsp;conflict,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRama said damages from the attack are minimal as all systems returned fully operational and no irreversible wiping of data occurred.",

Kennedy’s famous \"moonshot\" speech.\n\n\n\nBiden’s remarks will be held at the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum.\n\n\n\nBiden relaunched his cancer moonshot initiative in February with the goal to cut the cancer death rate in half over the next 25 years, as well as improve the lives of caregivers and cancer survivors.\n\n\n\nIn his remarks on Monday, the president will provide an update on steps the administration is taking to end cancer as we know it and improve Americans’ health and decrease the burden of disease, according to a White House official.\n\n\n\nKennedy’s speech in 1962, which took place at Rice University in Texas, outlined his plan for the U.S. to become an international leader in space exploration.\n\n\n\n“When President Kennedy committed to putting a man on the moon and bringing him back, the United States had the building blocks to know that was possible,” a White House official said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Today, we have many of the building blocks needed to make significant progress treating cancer, but we must come together to deliver on the promise. And because of incredible advances in science, technology, and medicine, we can already begin to see what is possible,” the official added.\n\n\n\nBefore the speech on Monday, Biden will make remarks on the investments in the bipartisan infrastructure law in Boston.",

        "description": "The FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are warning cyberattacks may increase against schools as the academic year begins.In a joint cybersecurity advisory published on Tuesday, the agencies detailed that a criminal syndicate known as Vice Society is “disproportionately” targeting the education sector with ransomware attacks.\n\n\n\n“School districts with limited cybersecurity capabilities and constrained resources are often the most vulnerable; however, the opportunistic targeting often seen with cyber criminals can still put school districts with robust cybersecurity programs at risk,” the advisory reads.\n\n\n\nThe agencies outlined a series of recommendations for school districts to mitigate cyber threats, like maintaining a strong relationship with their local FBI field office and maintaining password standards.\n\n\n\nThe advisory came after the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD) announced it had experienced a ransomware attack over the weekend.\n\n\n\nSchools in the district opened as scheduled on Tuesday following the Labor Day holiday, but school officials said they required all students and employees to reset their passwords.\n\n\n\n“I want to thank our students, families and employees for doing their part in the ongoing recovery from this weekend’s cyberattack,” LAUSD Superintendent Alberto Carvalho said in a statement on Tuesday evening. “While all critical systems are now active, it is imperative for our students and employees to reset their passwords to regain access.”\n\n\n\nThe advisory did not directly tie the LAUSD incident to the Vice Society group, which first appeared in May 2021 and has previously targeted the School District of Elmbrook in Wisconsin and the Savannah College of Art and Design.\n\n\n\nThe agencies suggested schools take steps like maintaining encrypted, offline backups of data, reviewing the security of their third-party vendors and implementing a recovery plan.\n\n\n\n“Impacts from these attacks have ranged from restricted access to networks and data, delayed exams, canceled school days and unauthorized access to and theft of personal information regarding students and staff,” the advisory reads.",

        "description": "Photo by Julio Aguilar/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The right-hander is challenging hitters in the strike zone more than ever before. Yankees’ starter Domingo Germán lost most of the season while rehabbing a shoulder problem that appeared early in the year, during the lockout. But he returned to the rotation in July, and when Jordan Montgomery was surprisingly sent to St. Louis, Germán became an important arm at the back of the staff. After nearly two months with the team, it’s a good time to look at what he is doing.\nHis surface numbers look good so far, with a strong 3.12 ERA in 49 innings. However, there is more to pitching than just ERA, and Germán’s FIP is 4.32, about the same as last year (4.31 in 98.1 frames). Notably, his strikeout rate has collapsed from 23.9 percent last year to 15.9 percent in 2022. That’s a curious difference; Germán went from striking out batters at an above average level, to doing so at a rate befitting bygone eras.\nLet’s remember that while Germán’s control has been good for most of his career, his command usually betrays him in certain situations. Perhaps in an effort to take advantage of the Yankees’ improved defense, and an impressive movement profile on his breaking pitches, the organization appears to be encouraging the right-hander to pitch to contact instead of looking for strikeouts. \nThe Yankees may have their fair share of offensive issues, but at some point in September, they could have Josh Donaldson at third, Oswald Peraza (or Isiah Kiner-Falefa) at short, DJ LeMahieu at second, Anthony Rizzo at first, Aaron Judge in right field, and Harrison Bader in center, not to mention Jose Trevino as the catcher. That’s a really strong defensive team, the kind that allows the Yankees to encourage a pitcher like Germán to pitch to contact.\nClearly, the right-hander is missing fewer bats than ever before: not only has his strikeout rate plummeted, but so did has swinging strike rate, now at 9.5 percent in 2022, after oscillating between 13 and 15 percent from 2018 and 2021. Importantly, he also increased his zone rate from 40.1 percent last year to 44.1 percent in 2022, by far a career high.\nIt appears that the Yankees realized that his stuff is not overpowering, but it’s good enough for him to induce relatively weak contact if he works within the zone. While he isn’t among the league leaders in preventing overall hard contact, he is in the 65th percentile in barrel percentage, per Statcast. Thus far, Germán has been able to keep hitters from making the ideal kind of contact, hard and on a line.\nGranted, there are also a few other factors that may be contributing to Germán’s diminished strikeout tally. For example, he has lost some velocity on his four-seamer: he is averaging 92.8 mph this season, after checking in at 93.4 mph in 2019-2021. But he also appears to be throwing more strikes and challenging hitters to make contact.\nHis horizontal and vertical movement profiles haven’t suffered much in comparison to last year, with his changeup, sinker, and four-seamer looking pretty similar by both vertical and horizontal movement:\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \nWith that said, it’s hard to explain the whiff rate of his curveball dropping from 42 percent to 32.3 percent and his changeup’s falling from 31.6 percent to 16.3 percent (!) other than looking at the zone he is now looking to attack.\nLast year, he went for the kill with his changeup:\n\n\nDomingo Germán is getting great results on his changeup since making it back from the Yankees alternate site pic.twitter.com/h3tl3obVey— Nick Pollack (@PitcherList) May 10, 2021\n\n\n\nThis year, he is throwing it more in the zone and using it early in the count often:\n\nHere, you can see he is throwing more strikes in 2022 while targeting the lower part of the strike zone, letting the movement of his breaking stuff forcing hitters to just miss on ideal contact:\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \nHe threw more balls last year, and his heatmap looks a bit more varied when it comes to the location of his strikes:\n  \n        \n  \nWhether this is a sustainable strategy will likely be dictated by more than just Germán’s own performance from this point forward. With such a low strikeout rate, he will likely depend on a strong defensive performance to make it. Luckily, the Yankees have multiple standout defenders. We’ll see if they can help Germán succeed even without the whiffs.",

        "description": "They felt otherworldly, my morning runs in the early days of the pandemic in March 2020. They felt almost like the aftertimes. There were hardly any signs of life in Washington, D.C., as I ran in the same area where Zora Neale Hurston had started her literary run a century ago.Most known for her novel Their Eyes Were Watching God, Hurston, a product of rural central Florida who emerged in the 1920s as one of the lights of the Harlem Renaissance, is now considered one of the greatest American creators of the 20th century. A folklorist, an anthropologist, a short-story writer, a filmmaker, a novelist, and an essayist—in many ways she captured the many ways of life. She captured signs of everyday Black life brazenly thrusting forth in love and joy despite the murderous and miserable shadows of racism cast over Black lives a century ago.Want to hear more from Ibram? Join him, the author Nic Stone, and our senior editor for books, Gal Beckerman, at The Atlantic Festival on Thursday, September 22. Register and find out more here.“I am not tragically colored,” Hurston wrote in 1928. “There is no great sorrow dammed up in my soul, nor lurking behind my eyes.”Is this why whenever a great sorrow arrives and starts lurking, I know whose writings to turn to? Is this why whenever I start to think that we, Black people, are the problem, I know whose stories to turn to? Is this why …? I could go on.“Her work had a sense of black people as complete, complex, undiminished human beings and that was crucial to me as a writer,” said the novelist Alice Walker.[Read: The power of untold slave narratives]Hurston has been crucial to me as a writer ever since I read Mules and Men in graduate school. In this collection of southern Black folklore, Hurston “speaks the language of her subjects and places herself in the action,” as the scholar Imani Perry, who writes a newsletter for The Atlantic, explains. I regretted not being turned on to her stories earlier—as a child, as soon as I’d started reading. Because when life seems lost or found, Hurston always helps me rediscover or witness the ampleness and exquisiteness of life. And the funk and lore of rural and urban, southern and northern folk. And the presence of Afro-Indigeneity. And the customariness of fighting for freedom from toxic masculinity and racial capitalism. And the bountifulness of joy and love through it all.Love, the fuel of life. Joy, the destination.Hurston created life as she loved it, to the fullest. What a lesson for people, especially for children being weighed down by the tragedies of the world right now. What a lesson for my 6-year-old daughter, who, like other children, should not have to wait to read Hurston. It all inspired me to produce six children’s books adapted from the writings of Zora Neale Hurston in partnership with her descendants. The first, a love story titled Magnolia Flower and illustrated by Loveis Wise, is out this week.Hurston’s profound message for children is this: No matter what tragedies befell me and my family and my history and my world, I am not a tragedy. I am not tragically Indigenous. I am not tragically Black. I am not tragically Asian. I am not tragically white. I am not tragically Latina. I am not tragically Muslim. I am not tragically Jewish. I am not tragically girl or boy or nonconforming. I am not tragically trans or disabled or gay. I am not tragically American, despite the tragedy that is the American political economy right now, a tragedy that resembles what caregivers were brooding over when Hurston was writing a century ago.Economic inequality is growing as it was in the 1920s. Forced sterilizations were growing then as forced births are growing now.Periods of resurgent white supremacy in the United States are especially tragic, whether in the 1920s or the 2020s. White supremacists shared an ideological affinity with Adolf Hitler then and share one with Vladimir Putin today. In March 1938, Hitler’s German army invaded Austria with the same imperial logic that Putin’s Russian army used to invade Ukraine almost exactly 84 years later. “People of the same blood should be in the same REICH,” Hitler wrote in Mein Kampf.But that’s not the only echo of earlier eras. A century ago, the United Confederate Veterans established the Rutherford Committee to prohibit educators from teaching the truth about the cornerstone of the Confederacy. “Its foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition,” Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens said in 1861.The committee and its namesake, Mildred Lewis Rutherford, encouraged state divisions of the United Daughters of the Confederacy to ban particular books “because history as now written will condemn the South to infamy.” Rutherford wanted books to teach that “the North Was Responsible for the War Between the States,” that “the War Between the States Was Not Fought to Hold the Slaves,” and that “the Slaves Were Not Ill-Treated.” Similar propaganda found its way this year into a proposed law in Oklahoma that would withhold state funding from public institutions teaching “that one race is the unique oppressor in the institution of slavery” or “that another race is the unique victim in the institution of slavery.” In total, lawmakers in 36 states have proposed 137 measures this year that would limit teaching about history, sexism, homophobia, or racism. According to Pen America, 19 of these bills have become law.[Read: The students of sex and culture]All the more reason for that profound Hurston message for children facing our political times: Though they treat me like I am nothing, I am something. Though poverty is dehumanizing, I am not subhuman. Though they want me to be their mule, I am not an animal. Though the world can be miserable, I am joy. Though they are hateful, I am love. Though tragedy stalks my identity like a shadow, I am not a running tragedy.As I ran in late March 2020, the shadows had already overtaken Ahmaud Arbery and Breonna Taylor, were already overtaking Black patients in New Orleans with COVID-19. But shadows not only cover reality; they cover up its harm. So, at the time, I did not know about Arbery’s lynching, about Taylor’s slaying, about Black patients already dying at the highest rates from COVID-19.I was running from the uncertainty, worry, confinement, and tragedy that had so many causes. The deaths from a novel virus. The foolhardy words of the 45th president about that virus. The “great equalizer” talk of other politicians. Not knowing who the coronavirus victims were. My partner going to the emergency room to fight COVID-19. Our juggling of full-time work with full-time child care. Our fears that our daughter would fall behind in preschool. Worrying what would happen if my partner or I had recurrences of our cancers. Our empathetic reminders that countless people had it worse than we did, were losing their jobs and livelihoods and elders. My early-morning runs were like some of Hurston’s stories—releases, exhales, rainbows in storms. They set my mind at peace.It was peaceful. Stillness met me except for my deep breaths and churning legs, and I watched the green lights turn yellow. No one walked to the bus stop or train. No cars dashed by giving me an extra breeze. No staff walked to Howard University. No business owners opened up shops. No dog walkers or sleepwalkers. No construction workers. Only an occasional woman in scrubs. Or a lone smoker. Or a homeless person. Even the police, thank goodness, were nowhere to be found. No sirens and stops and fears arresting Black life.Silence, however, didn’t meet me as I ran on. Outside my personal space it did. Not inside. Inside I listened and laughed and loved the audiobook of Hurston’s Hitting a Straight Lick With a Crooked Stick as I ran. Weeks earlier, Amistad Books and the Zora Neale Hurston Trust had released this latest edition of Hurston’s work, a collection of her short stories from the Harlem Renaissance. “Although racism and ‘white folks’ present real challenges to the characters that people this collection, oppression is not the center of their lives,” the novelist Tayari Jones explained in the foreword.I can still remember that day I was jogging up 13th Street, away from Howard, toward the Petworth neighborhood. I jogged by the recently renovated Theodore Roosevelt High School, a structure planned in 1920 at about the time Hurston entered Howard. I usually glared at the historical architecture, the sweeping staircases that come around to an outdoor landing and the four huge columns that guard the front entrance.But on this day, I hardly looked at the school; I was too engrossed in the imagery and agency and naturality of “Magnolia Flower.” Hurston published the story in the July 1925 issue of The Spokesman. She once described the expression “hitting a straight lick with a crooked stick” as “making a way out of no-way,” which is precisely what Magnolia, the main character, did. Her story is told by a mighty river to a little brook, “a story of love conquering all,” as Hurston’s biographer Valerie Boyd described it.The narrator in my ear finished “Magnolia Flower” as I approached the next intersection. The mighty river finished telling Magnolia’s story to the brook, which had been “thrilled to its very bottom at times.”I was thrilled to my very bottom as I listened. I stopped running as Dorothy I. Height Elementary School caught my eye to the left. Deep thought parked me at the intersection, in the middle of the street. The otherworldly and the worldly converged. I didn’t worry about cars coming. I didn’t worry about the anxiety of tragedy returning. I didn’t worry about anyone seeing my smiles as “Magnolia Flower” ended. I just stood there with a profound feeling of love and joy, what I wanted my daughter to have, all children to have.I thought to myself how beautiful it would be to read a child-friendly version of “Magnolia Flower” (as well as other Hurston stories) to my daughter. Since the start of the pandemic, my partner and I had been searching for more joyous and love-filled and hope-filled and humor-filled and freedom-filled books than normal. Books for kids of kids “making a way out of no-way.” Books of “love conquering all.” I realized as the sun rose on the tragedies of the world that my family had been searching for Zora Neale Hurston.“No, I do not weep at the world,” Hurston once wrote. “I am too busy sharpening my oyster knife.”",

        "description": "The MIT professor was unequivocal.“If we had to stop producing CO₂, no coal, oil, or gas could be burned,” Carroll Wilson declared. The world would have to adopt nuclear energy en masse and perhaps even turn to “electric motor vehicles.”It was June 9, 1971. Wilson, a management professor, wasn’t speaking at an environmental rally or a scientific meeting. He was talking to a room full of engineers and businessmen who had gathered in Cleveland, Ohio, for the electricity industry’s annual conference.His speech was as up-to-date a discussion of climate science as you could find in the early 1970s. Although he said that global warming wasn’t yet a scientific certainty—which was true in those days—he was clear that it needed to be taken seriously. And the conference’s organizer, the Edison Electric Institute, seemed keen to get the best climate research in front of its members, even if it had radical implications for their business.Yet scarcely two decades later, virtually the entire electric-utility industry—including the Edison Electric Institute, its flagship lobbying group, and the Electric Power Research Institute, its leading R&amp;D alliance—united against any effort to understand or stop climate change. In 1992, an EEI article said that global warming would not portend disaster, but bring “cooler days, warmer nights, and better vegetables.”Why has it taken so long for the United States to treat climate change seriously, much less adopt serious efforts to stop it? Over the past few years, the public has come to understand at least one cause: A handful of oil companies understood the reality of climate change years before the general public, but waged an expensive and secretive campaign through the 1990s and 2000s to muddy the science and play down the dangers.But oil companies did not act alone. “Utilities were also in the room,” Emily Williams, a researcher at UC Santa Barbara and a co-author of a new study about the electricity industry’s role in spreading climate denial, told me. Years after scientists had reached a consensus that global warming was real, dangerous, and caused by fossil fuels, utilities sold climate half-truths and untruths to policy makers and the public.The study, published this month in Environmental Research Letters, reveals the half-century arc that took electric utilities from feting the country’s top climate scientists in the 1960s to denouncing the importance of their research in the 1990s to reluctantly undertaking efforts to decarbonize their own grids in the 2010s.In the aftermath of the Inflation Reduction Act, the country’s first comprehensive climate law, much of this may seem like academic history. But utilities’ legacy of denial, doubt, and dawdling continues to hold back the country’s energy transition, Leah Stokes, an author of the study and a political scientist at UC Santa Barbara, told me. Many utilities still operate damaging, debt-ridden coal plants today because of the decisions that they made decades ago.Yet utilities remain crucial to fighting climate change. In many scenarios where America has a zero-carbon economy, utilities play a larger role, generating, distributing, and transmitting far more electricity than they do today. “We can’t do this without utilities onboard, honestly,” Stokes said.Electric utilities might be some of the most powerful and least understood companies in America. They count almost every American as a customer, and they bring in more revenue combined each year than Apple does. Yet utilities are so complicated—and, truth be told, so straight-up boring—that they escape public scrutiny. There are investor-owned utilities, publicly owned utilities, and utilities that are somewhere in between. Some utilities are regulated monopolies, generating their own electricity and selling it to captive customers, while others work as middlemen in a deregulated electricity market.But all stripes of utilities fought climate policy aggressively and enduringly, the study finds.The new research looked at 188 speeches, memos, articles, ads, and other industry documents from 1968 to 2019 that mentioned climate change, carbon dioxide, or other climate-related keywords. It isn’t the first study to look at the role of utilities in climate denial: The Brown University sociologist Robert Brulle and the Energy and Policy Institute, an energy-industry watchdog, have both done so.Together, the three studies clarify the root of that opposition. Electricity companies saw themselves as part of a coalition that included their biggest suppliers—namely coal and natural-gas firms—and their biggest customers—steel companies and heavy manufacturers. Freight railroads, which move coal around the country, joined the coalition as well. Because climate policy posed an existential danger to coal and other fossil fuels, utilities saw it as a threat to their own business. (But of course electricity can be generated in cleaner ways too.)This is the first peer-reviewed publication to survey the industry’s messaging specifically, Dave Anderson, an author of the Energy and Policy Institute report, told me. “This is a very important study,” says Naomi Oreskes, a Harvard science historian who has researched on the fossil-fuel industry’s climate denial, and was not involved in the study. “It reminds us that climate disinformation has not been the domain of just one, or even a handful, of fossil-fuel companies, but has been perpetuated by a network of cronyistic industries that support and depend on fossil fuels,” she told me.Neither the Edison Electric Institute nor the Electric Power Research Institute denied the new study’s findings.“The progress that EEI’s member companies have made speaks for itself. We are leading the world in reducing carbon emissions, and today, 40 percent of U.S. electricity comes from clean, carbon-free resources,” Brian Reil, an EEI spokesperson, told me in a statement.The Electric Power Research Institute “examines all risks to the grid, including climate, as part of an overall effort to drive innovation to ensure the public has clean, reliable, affordable, and equitable access to electricity across the globe,” Rachel Gantz, a spokesperson for the group, said.Utilities didn’t start out seeking to distort climate science. As the issue dawned in the 1970s, they treated climate change mostly as a scientific matter, the study finds.In 1977, an internal memo from the Electric Power Research Institute, or EPRI, straightforwardly described fossil fuels as the “principal manmade source of CO2 emissions” and warned that the amount of that gas in the atmosphere could double by 2030.That seriousness continued into the next decade. In 1986, an EPRI article about climate change warned that the “sweeping consequences of accumulating greenhouse gases in the atmosphere may turn out to be the greatest environmental problem of modern times.”But as the science became more concerning, utility executives began to downplay what they could do to stop climate change. By the late ’80s, the industry had started to channel a certain learned helplessness: Even if the greenhouse effect was real, executives argued, neither the power sector nor the United States could solve it alone. At the time, the U.S. power sector alone generated about 7 percent of all global emissions.Then the science became unmistakable. In 1988, one of NASA’s top climate scientists told a Senate panel that global warming had already begun. Two years later, the new United Nations–led Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) said that “immediate reductions” in greenhouse-gas emissions were needed.The industry’s leaders made a fateful decision: They began denying that climate change existed altogether. “You get this huge divergence where as the science becomes clearer, the utility messaging becomes muddier,” Stokes told me.The Edison Electric Institute and three utilities helped establish the Global Climate Coalition, or GCC, one of the most notorious advocates of climate denial and doubt. The GCC opposed any effort to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, attacked individual climate scientists, and ran an extensive, secretive campaign to tone down the IPCC’s research findings. Utilities made up more than a quarter of the GCC’s members at its peak; an EPRI employee also participated in GCC meetings.The GCC wasn’t the only group that utilities propped up. In 1991, the Edison Electric Institute helped start the Information Council on the Environment, a short-lived PR group that sought to discredit climate science. The group ran infamous ads in several cities that asked, “Who told you the earth was warming, Chicken Little?” and claimed there was “no hard evidence” that climate change “is occurring.”The efforts were successful. One of the GCC’s main goals was to prevent the United States from entering the Kyoto Protocol, an early climate treaty. In 1997, the Senate effectively blocked the U.S. from carrying out the protocol or any similar treaty; in 2001, President George W. Bush announced that the U.S. would not implement the treaty.Bush “rejected Kyoto, in part, based on input from you,” a State Department official later told the GCC’s leaders, according to a briefing memo from that year.After 2000, the industry switched to delaying climate policy rather than sowing doubt about it. The study finds that the industry embraced the promise of carbon capture and “clean coal” to combat climate change. Industry documents mention these largely notional technologies as often as they mention renewables or more proven ways of reducing emissions.At the same time, utilities also participated in at least three organizations that aimed to block climate policy, the study finds. EEI attended the meeting of one of these groups, the American Legislative Exchange Council, as recently as 2019; that group still publishes open climate denial on its website.Not until 2015 did EEI and EPRI consistently acknowledge the reality of climate change and the need for policy in their documents. And this year, EEI was “fairly constructive” during legislative negotiations over the Inflation Reduction Act, pushing for the most aggressive and generous version of the clean-energy tax credits, Stokes said.Still, despite that recent turn, utilities must confront their role in propping up climate denial for so long, Stokes told me. Many of them are still dealing with the afterlife of their denial: billions of dollars of debt tied up in uneconomic coal plants. Of the 10 utilities that did the most to spread climate denial, eight remain heavily invested in coal and fossil fuels and have the most inadequate transition plans, the study found.Fifty utilities in EEI now have “clear forward-looking carbon-reduction goals,” Reil, the institute’s spokesperson said, and “dozens … are aiming for net-zero or equivalent by 2050 or sooner.”“In general, the utility industry has not been visionary. They’ve been stuck in the past and have not been able to see the change that the clean-energy revolution could bring,” she added. Even though climate change represents the industry’s first pathway for growth since the 1970s, utilities resisted following it for years, Stokes said. Its objection to climate change was as much sociological as it was profit-driven.That backwards-looking attitude is exactly the opposite of what Wilson preached in his 1971 speech. Begging his audience to consider the next 30 to 50 years, he reminded them that the problems of the 21st century were not so far away.",

        "description": "Three weeks before he faced sentencing, the Malaysian defense contractor at the center of one of the biggest bribery investigations in U.S. military history made an escape as stunning and brazen as the case itself: U-Haul trucks were seen at his home in a tony San Diego neighborhood before Leonard Glenn Francis, known as “Fat Leonard,” snipped off his ankle monitor and disappeared.Nearly a dozen U.S. law enforcement agencies were searching for Francis on Tuesday. But officials acknowledged he may already be in Mexico, and possibly on his way back to Asia.Four years ago, U.S. District Court Judge Janis Sammartino feared Francis might run off when she turned down his lawyer’s request to allow him to be under house arrest without round-the-clock security guards watching the ailing defense contractor. At the time, Francis was cooperating with prosecutors as they pursued charges against dozens of Navy officials who accepted bribes in exchange for classified information that gave Francis’ ship servicing business in Asia an edge in getting military contracts.When asked about the bold escape Tuesday, his lawyer, Devin Burstein, who pushed for more leniency for his client, said: “At this time, I have no comment, sorry.&quot;Sammartino repeatedly maintained that Francis, who was in poor health and needed medical care, could only remain under house arrest if private security guards were on site. At one point she expressed concern that if he were to escape and ended up “back in Malaysia for whatever reason,&quot; her name would come up if anyone asked “who let somebody do this without any security,&quot; according to a transcript of a closed-door hearing in February 2018 that was unsealed in January.She raised similar concerns in another hearing on Dec. 17, 2020, after receiving a report that the home was left without anyone guarding it for nearly three hours, according to the court transcript. The guard said he had been on a long lunch break, and Francis apologized to the judge for the mishap.It was unclear if round-the-clock security guards were still in place this weekend.The U.S. Attorney&#x27;s office in San Diego declined to comment, referring calls to the U.S. Marshals Service. Supervisory Deputy U.S. Marshal, Omar Castillo, said his officers found no security officers at the home when they arrived Sunday afternoon, nearly seven hours after Francis is believed to have removed his ankle monitor with heavy scissors. The device was found in the home.Castillo said someone called the San Diego police department, which sent officers to the home shortly before 2 p.m. to check on it. Castillo said he did not know who made the call. After finding the home empty, police contacted U.S. Pre-Trial Services, the federal agency in charge of his confinement, which then called the U.S. Marshals Service.Castillo said he did not know if security guards were still ordered to be there. He said neighbors reported seeing U-Haul trucks coming and going from the home one or two days before the escape. Pre-Trial Services declined to comment or answer questions.The home is about a 40-minute drive from the Mexican border, where vehicles stream into Tijuana and are only stopped randomly. Castillo said Mexican authorities have been put on alert and 10 U.S. law enforcement agencies at local, state and federal levels were searching for Francis on Tuesday.Castillo said GPS ankle monitors are easy to remove and do not stop people from escaping. He added that he would not be surprised if Francis was already in Mexico since it is easy to drive into the country and not be stopped.“That&#x27;s the risk that is taken when defendants are on GPS monitoring, you know,&quot; he said. “They don’t all cut off their GPS bracelets, but this can happen.&quot;It was a surprising turn in a case already full of shocking revelations.Nearly a decade ago, Francis was arrested in a San Diego hotel as part of a federal sting operation. Investigators say he and his company, Glenn Defense Marine Asia, bilked the Navy out of more than $35 million by buying off dozens of top-ranking Navy officers with booze, sex, lavish parties and other gifts. In exchange the officers, including the first active-duty admiral to be convicted of a federal crime, concealed the scheme in which Francis would overcharge for supplying ships or charge for fake services at ports he controlled in Southeast Asia.The case, which delved into salacious details about service members cheating on their wives and seeking out prostitutes, was an embarrassment to the Pentagon. It was prosecuted by the U.S. attorney&#x27;s office, which offered an independent authority from the military justice system.Francis was scheduled to be sentenced Sept. 22 after working with prosecutors for years, leading to dozens of convictions.All that cooperation will mean nothing now, but Francis may be hard to catch, given his wealth and vast worldwide connections, said Jason Forge, a former federal prosecutor in San Diego who worked on a number of high-profile corruption cases.“He doesn&#x27;t strike me as the type of person under these circumstances to make a spontaneous decision,&quot; Forge said. “I&#x27;m assuming this means he has planned things out and he has the wherewithal to do so. He will probably be a free bird for awhile.&quot;",

        "description": "Brittany Martin, center,  confronts police as demonstrators march in protest of George Floyd&#x27;s death May 2020 in downtown Sumter, S.C. Martin, a pregnant Black activist serving four years in prison for her behavior at racial justice protests, is scheduled to have her sentence reconsidered as she struggles to reach her due date behind bars.Micah Green/The Item via APCOLUMBIA, S.C. — A pregnant Black activist serving four years in prison for her behavior at racial justice protests will have her sentence reconsidered as she struggles to reach her due date behind bars.Raising questions about free speech and equal justice, Brittany Martin, 34, was found guilty this spring of breaching the peace in a high and aggravated manner over comments she made to police. Her lawyers have been pushing for a lesser sentence amid increasing concerns about her health and that of her baby, due in November.Advocates with Black Voters Matter have been circulating a petition calling for her release. Civil rights attorney and former state lawmaker Bakari Sellers will tell the judge on Sept. 12 that the punishment is unjust.&quot;She&#x27;s in jail because she talked in America,&quot; said Sybil Dione Rosado, her trial attorney. &quot;She&#x27;s a dark-skinned Black woman who is unapologetically Black and radical.&quot;Martin moved with her four younger children to Sumter, South Carolina, from Iowa in spring 2020 and was &quot;ready to go and protest&quot; after the police killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd sparked a nationwide movement that year, her sister said.But Martin also had someone else on her mind: In 2016, Sumter police fatally shot her brother-in-law 19 times when officers said he fired a gun after a chase in a stolen car. When she took to the streets, she carried grief over her family&#x27;s past.In court, prosecutors presented police body camera recordings including snippets of those demonstrations. Shared with the AP, they don&#x27;t show her laying hands on any officers. Videos from May 31, 2020 show Martin chanting &quot;No justice, no peace,&quot; in an officer&#x27;s face. Police donned riot gear and discussed using tear gas before letting the crowd disperse.Martin used stronger language days later.&quot;Some of us gon&#x27; be hurting. And some of y&#x27;all gon&#x27; be hurting,&quot; Martin told officers. &quot;We ready to die for this. We tired of it. You better be ready to die for the blue. I&#x27;m ready to die for the Black.&quot;The jury acquitted Martin of inciting a riot and reached no verdict on whether she threatened officers&#x27; lives. Her legal team was &quot;elated&quot; when jurors found her guilty only of breaching the peace, punishable by no more than a $500 fine and 30 days in jail, investigator Tony Kennedy recalled.State law defines breachers of the peace as any disturbers, &quot;dangerous and disorderly persons&quot; or people who utter &quot;menaces or threatening speeches.&quot; But prosecutors presented the charge as a &quot;high and aggravated&quot; crime, which carries up to 10 years imprisonment. Rosado said Judge Kirk Griffin did not allow her to explain the distinction, and the possibility of a much stiffer penalty, to the jury.Prosecutors did not respond to interview requests. Sumter police said it would be inappropriate to comment, given the potential for additional action.Sellers called the sentence &quot;beyond the pale.&quot;&quot;The fact is you have people who stormed the Capitol, who led to the death of law enforcement, who tried to overturn an election and fracture democracy. And they&#x27;re getting two months, three months, six months,&quot; Sellers said. &quot;And Brittany Martin gets four years.&quot;Of the roughly 850 people charged with federal crimes related to the Jan. 6 insurrection, more than 330 have pleaded guilty to receive lesser sentences, mostly misdemeanors punishable by no more than a year.In a court filing, Sellers points to others convicted under the same charge who had their sentences reduced. A more high-profile case involved an intoxicated University of Alabama football fan who punched a University of South Carolina fan unconscious after the Gamecocks upset the Crimson Tide. The man was pronounced dead after a motorist unknowingly drove over his body. The fan got three years in prison, the rest of his 10-year sentence suspended.Brittany Martin, founder of Mixed Sistaz United, rides a horse at the organization&#x27;s inaugural Juneteenth celebration in 2021 in Sumter, S.C.The Item via APMartin said her body &quot;can&#x27;t get comfortable with the baby&quot; and as of July, she lost 12 pounds while incarcerated, despite the pregnancy. She was taken twice by ambulance to a hospital that month, once after experiencing contractions and again after entering preterm labor at 25 weeks, according to her sister Whitney Martin and Rosado. Martin&#x27;s prison report shows she went to eight outside medical appointments throughout July and August.Martin recently got sent to solitary confinement for refusing to cut her dreads, a violation of a policy Rosado called &quot;racially biased.&quot; According to the grooming policy, which seeks to &quot;promote safety,&quot; the prison allows neatly braided, corn-rowed hair only when worn straight back and individual braids but not dreadlocks or twists.Martin said she&#x27;s been verbally harassed by guards and injured by inmates. Rosado reported seeing scratches on Martin&#x27;s face and a bloody right eye during a recent visit. Martin&#x27;s prison report shows she was sent to detention for 35 days on June 5 over threatening to inflict harm on an employee and again for 22 days on July 28 over refusing or failing to obey orders.National Racial Justice Network President Dr. Candace Brewer wants to ensure Martin &quot;does not end up where Sandra Bland&quot; did, referring to the Black Chicago woman who died in a Texas jail after a trooper said she failed to signal a lane change.A lot changed during the two years since the protests.In November 2020, Martin received 7 years probation for willful intent to injure and leaving a crime scene in Iowa, where in August 2019, her teenage son had accused her of purposely hitting him with her SUV and driving away. Iowa court documents allege that Martin told her son — who wound up hospitalized with minor injuries — that she hoped he would die. Rosado said the South Carolina judge — who did not respond to an interview request — did not mention the Iowa conviction in his sentencing decision.In 2021, Martin co-founded Mixed Sistaz United, a local group that served meals for homeless people, organized voter registration drives and hosted a Juneteenth celebration.This January, Martin&#x27;s 18-year-old son was shot and killed in his car outside a Waterloo, Iowa convenience store — a loss Martin and her family are still mourning.Martin&#x27;s sister has been caring for the younger children, who she said are &quot;missing their mom.&quot; The 5-year-old hasn&#x27;t sounded like his happy self on the phone, Martin said.&quot;It&#x27;s been times in this prison where I have started giving up for a second, mentally and emotionally,&quot; Martin said. &quot;It seemed like the Holy Spirit just put that spoon in my mouth, like &#x27;Come on, you&#x27;ve got to eat. You&#x27;ve got to get up.&#x27;&quot;\n&quot;I had to think about my babies. I had to think about my love for them, which is why I&#x27;m even in this situation,&quot; she said.\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "The Mets designated right-hander Adonis Medina for assignment, and also made Max Scherzer&#8217;s 15-day IL placement official.  In corresponding moves, New York selected the contract of left-hander Alex Claudio and called up right-hander Yoan Lopez from Triple-A.  Lopez will be the 29th man for today&#8217;s doubleheader against the Pirates.\nMedina has been up and down from Triple-A multiple times this season, and all of the shuttling may have had an adverse effect on his performance.  The righty has a 6.08 ERA over 23 2/3 innings with the Mets and a more palatable 3.71 ERA in 26 2/3 frames for Triple-A Syracuse, though Medina&#8217;s minor league walk rate is a troubling 12.1%.\nThis is the third time that Medina has been designated for assignment within the last year, with the first of those DFA stints keeping Medina in transactional limbo throughout the entirety of the offseason lockout.  The Pirates claimed Medina off waivers from the Phillies once the lockout was over, and a subsequent DFA from Pittsburgh resulted in Medina being traded to the Mets just prior to Opening Day.\nMedina received some top-100 prospect attention as recently as 2019, but he has yet to make a big impact in the majors, pitching only 11 2/3 innings with the Phillies prior to this season.  Generally a below-average strikeout pitcher, Medina has posted grounder rates around the 50% mark during his career, usually relying more on soft contact and keeping the ball in play rather than missed bats.  Medina has worked as a starter for much of his career but he primarily been a reliever this season in Syracuse, and his 14 Mets appearances were all out of the bullpen.\nClaudio inked a minor league deal with the Mets during the offseason, and the southpaw is now on the verge of making it a ninth consecutive season with some MLB action.  Speaking of low-strikeout grounder specialists, Claudio has a 17% strikeout rate and 59.8% groundball rate over his 344 1/3 career innings in the majors.  Claudio was a generally reliable bullpen arm throughout his time with the Rangers and Brewers from 2014-20, posting a 3.44 ERA and eating plenty of innings &#8212; his 83 appearances led the big leagues in 2019.\nThe Brewers opted to non-tender Claudio following the 2020 season, in part due to his lack of strikeouts or high velocity, as well as the idea that Claudio (who has pretty big career splits) would be hampered by the three-batter rule.  Signing with the Angels in the 2020-21 offseason, the southpaw had only a 5.51 ERA over 32 2/3 innings with Anaheim in 2021, and also pitched in the Red Sox farm system after the Angels cut him loose midway through the campaign.\nThe Mets&#8217; lack of left-handed relief depth has been an ongoing story of their season, with Joely Rodriguez being the only southpaw regular within the bullpen mix.  Such left-handed pitchers as Chasen Shreve, Nate Fisher, Rob Zastryzny, Sam Clay, and Thomas Szapucki have all gotten some looks, and Claudio will become the latest southpaw to get a shot at catching on as extra depth.",

But the writing is on the wall. This article raises the question of whether people whose voices were used as samples deserve royalties (especially if their voice is distinctive and already famous). \"Today,\" writes Grossman, \"voice actors really could find themselves competing for work against synthesized versions of themselves.\" True, but that's only today. AI synthesizers will soon generate genuinely unique voices, and the market for human voice actors will disappear. Bad news for them, but good news for people who depend on (say) access to inexpensive audio recordings of learning materials.\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

        "description": "Wilfred Chan, \nThe Guardian, \nSept 07, 2022\n\n\n\t\t           \n\t\t           When I entered university in 1981, after scoring an A in my first math class, my progress ground to a halt after back-to-back classes in calculus taught by professors with thick accents. I'm a lot better with accents now, but at that age I had no experience with accents and was out of my depth. Would I have been perpetuating bias had I asked for something like this software that would have erased the instructor's accents? I never did finish that second calculus class, which also ended my aspirations to study physics. It's one thing to use such software in a call centre, but quite something else when we're looking at doctors, teachers and other professionals where clear communication is vital.\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

        "description": "Alex Usher, \nHigher Education Strategy Associates, \nSept 07, 2022\n\n\n\t\t           \n\t\t           Though he's focused rather more on economics than on learning and technology, Alex Usher's analyses of higher education in Canada are always a good read. This post summarizes his latest report (136 page PDF) once you get past the advertisements. His main focus in this summary is \"recent changes in the provision of student aid, and specifically the massive run-up in student grants which has been occurring.\" Now the graphic he runs is very misleading, as it makes it look like grants are up across the board, while in fact only one grant program has increased over the last few years, the Canadian government Canada Student Financial Assistance Program's (CSFAP) (formerly the Canada Student Loans Program (CSLP)), while everything else has been shrinking. Usher also looks at institutional research, though while he mentions \"Memorial University's intriguing research profile\" there's nothing in that chapter that would warrant such a remark (perhaps he means the quip about health funding in chapter 4). More telling, I think, is the data that shows (once again) that the Canadian private sector far underperforms its counterparts in other OECD nations.\n\nWeb: [Direct Link] [This Post]",

        "description": "Derek Thompson: &#8220;The first fact was sadly unsurprising: The coronavirus pandemic killed so many people that U.S. life expectancy fell from roughly 79 in 2019 to 76 in 2021—the largest two-year decline in nearly a century. The drop was sharpest among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, whose life expectancy fell to 65, close to the national average during World War II.&#8221;\n&#8220;Life expectancy is perhaps the most important statistic on the planet, synthesizing a country’s scientific advances, policy errors, and social sins into a single number. The number is built on a weird hypothetical. The formula for life expectancy says: If Americans lived their entire life in one year—say, 2021—repeating it over and over again like an extended Groundhog Day experiment, how long would the typical person survive? It’s a useful exercise for the purpose of capturing one year’s conditions. But it imagines a life that nobody will ever live. U.S. life expectancy will almost certainly surge in 2022 and beyond, not only because the worst of the pandemic is over, but also because the disaster accelerated technology like mRNA vaccines that could raise life expectancy in future decades.&#8221;\n&#8220;The second fact was perhaps more alarming: The U.S. fared worse in life expectancy than other high-income countries. While most of the developed world saw conditions improve in the second year of the pandemic, more Americans died of COVID after the introduction of the vaccines than before their invention.&#8221;",

Two hundred and sixty individuals have been charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement during the riot.",

        "description": "Photo by David Berding/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Money. A LOT of money. Bobby Witt Jr. is enjoying a solid rookie season, becoming the fifth player to hit at least 20 home runs and steal at least 20 bases in his very first season. He has had some ups and downs but it is clear he at least has the skillset to be a cornerstone player for this franchise, if not a league star. \nHaving made the Opening Day roster, Witt is guaranteed to get a full year of service time this year (and he might have anyway had he finished in the top two of Rookie of the Year balloting under a new provision in the labor deal). So his service time clock is ticking, with just five years left before he is eligible to entertain free agency. \nThe Royals might be wise to keep Bobby in Kansas City a bit longer with a long-term deal. This season there have already been rookies who have signed long-term deals before even completing their first season- Seattle’s Julio Rodríguez and Atlanta’s Michael Harris II. Could those market-setting contracts give us a clue as to what it would take to sign Bobby?\nFirst of all, let’s compare how the rookies have done this year.\n\nIt has been a very strong season for rookies (in addition to this trio, Braves pitcher Spencer Strider, Orioles catcher Adley Rutschman, Guardians outfielder Steven Kwan, Astros shortstop Jeremy Peña, and Mariners pitcher George Kirby have all had Rookie of the Year-caliber seasons, and the Royals have had strong starts from MJ Melendez, Vinnie Pasquantino, and Nick Pratto). These three in particular have enjoyed a strong season at a very young age - all would be eligible for free agency before their 28th birthday, meaning teams should want to get as much of their prime as they can.\nBy the numbers Witt has not been as good as Harris nor Rodríguez, but the gap isn’t that large. Witt is hurt by having a pretty low walk rate - only six qualified hitters in baseball walk less. But it’s not like Rodríguez or Harris let many pitches go by either. Both Witt and Harris are near the top of the league in chase rate, while Rodríguez is not far behind.\nWitt has also been a bit BABIP-unlucky, while Rodríguez and especially Harris (.381 BABIP!) have been pretty fortunate. All three possess terrific power with good average exit velocity, although Bobby’s hard hit percentage is a bit behind the other two. Bobby is one of the best baserunners in baseball, while the other two are not far behind.\nAll three play premium defensive positions - at least when Witt is not playing third. Harris has been Gold Glove-caliber in center, while Rodriguez has been below-average in center by many metrics and Witt has been pretty shaky at shortstop while a bit more capable at third. \nThe Braves signed Michael Harris II in mid-August, and if anything, people were surprised by his long-term deal wasn’t more lucrative, with some saying he left as much as $200 million on the table. But Harris never hit for this kind of power in the minors, and there may be some skepticism that he can continue to hit like this. Here is the breakdown of the eight-year, $72 million deal.\n2023 - $5 million\n2024 - $5 million\n2025 - $8 million\n2026 - $8 million\n2027 - $9 million\n2028 - $10 million\n2029 - $10 million\n2030 - $12 million\nThe Braves have two club options after that worth $15 million in 2031 and $20 million in 2032, with a $5 million buyout for each year, giving Harris an average annual value (AAV) of $9 million. \nThe Julio Rodríguez deal came a bit over a week later, and while there was a lot made over the fact it could be up to $470 million, at its essence it is a seven-year, $104 million guaranteed deal, with five player-option seasons worth $18 million per year and a $15 million signing bonus with a ton of escalators and options and incentives that could inflate the deal over time. \n2023 - $4 million\n2024 - $10 million\n2025 - $18 million\n2026 - $18 million\n2027 - $18 million\n2028 - $18 million\n2029 - $18 million \nThe Mariners can also opt-in to an extension after the 2028 season that could be as much as ten years and worth $350 million, depending on how Rodríguez has fared in MVP voting. So there are a lot of sweeteners, but if Rodríguez were to be unable to play baseball anymore, he would still receive at a minimum, $209 million over the next 12 years (base salary plus player options plus signing bonus), an AAV of $17.4 million, which is just a bit above the $16.7 million AAV the Rays gave then-first-year player Wander Franco in 2021 when they signed him to an 11-year, $184 million contract. \nWhat can we expect from each player going forward? Dan Szymborski at Fangraphs updated his ZIPS projections for Harris and Rodríguez after their signings, and has Harris worth about 6 WAR over the next two seasons - a great glove man who can hit, but not a big slugger. Julio projects to be basically a superstar, worth over 11.5 WAR over the next two seasons. He has not given an update for Witt, but Bobby has pretty much matched his 2022 projection, so if he continues on that trajectory, he projects for a combined 9.4 WAR over 2023-24, about halfway between Harris and Rodríguez.\nThat seems about right. Witt has more star potential than Harris certainly, but he hasn’t achieved yet what Rodríguez has. He has been a very solid player with some good variance possibilities that he could erupt and become a superstar. Let’s start with this framework:\n2023 - $5 million\n2024 - $6.5 million\n2025 - $9.5 million\n2026 - $14.5 million\n2027 - $17.5 million\n2028 - $22 million\n2029 - $25 million\n2030 - $27 million mutual option with a $5 million buyout\nSeven years, $105 million, an AAV of $15 million. That buys out two years of free agency, and Bobby can still become a free agent before age 30, in time to get another good long-term deal. And the Royals can add some sweeteners and incentives for MVP voting, All-Star selections, and Silver Slugger awards. \nI would be hesitant for them to add player options the way the Mariners did with Rodríguez. Player options are only ever exercised if something has gone terribly wrong for the player, and the Royals really cannot afford to pay $20+ million to a player for which something has gone terribly wrong. An opt out is also a possibility, but that would defeat the purpose of getting him to commit to a long-term deal. \nTo be clear, Witt would likely be underpaid even with this deal if he continues to play up to his projections. ZIPS projects him to be a 4+ WAR player for the next few seasons, such a player is worth over $30 million in the open market. But he won’t be on the open market. This reflects more than what he could get under club control, with the trade off being the two years of free agency he is giving up. \nWitt is also getting the security of $105 million guaranteed. How likely is it that he sustains his rookie performance for several years? (Royals fans have seen at least two Rookie of the Year Award winners flame out rather quickly in Bob Hamelin and Angel Berroa) Does his chase rate catch up with him?  Does he ever figure it out defensively? Does he stay healthy? If he makes it to 2029 having put up 4 WAR seasons each year, he will have put up more WAR by age 30 than any other Royals hitter in history other than George Brett and Willie Wilson. \nWould Bobby be amenable to such a deal? It’s hard to say. He already has $7.7 million owed to him through his draft signing bonus, and he comes from an affluent family, the son of a former big leaguer. He is represented by Octagon, where his dad works as an agent and is likely heavily involved in any negotiations. Players can also make more money in their pre-arbitration years than they could before, and Bobby has the chance to earn a few million even before he hits arbitration. He will have more financial cushion to bet on himself for that mega-deal. \nOn the other hand, Julio Rodríguez was also an Octagon client, had made a decent $1.75 million amateur bonus and already looked ready to hit super-stardom. The Mariners were very creative in structuring a deal that could be both beneficial for him and for them. It will probably take that same kind of creativity to keep Bobby Witt Jr. in Royals blue for the next decade.\nThe Royals have the closest thing to a potential superstar on their roster for the first time since Carlos Beltrán first broke into the big leagues. If they don’t want to make an uncomfortable trade like they did with Beltrán, they would be wise to get Witt to the bargaining table for a long-term deal. Whether Bobby and his representation are open to that is another matter. But money can make a lot of things happen, the only question is how much money will it take?",

        "description": "Wired visited professional GeoGuessr player Trevor Rainbolt to learn more about the tips and tricks he uses to identify the location from a Google Street View photo anywhere around the world. Rainbolt explains how he is able to determine the place from the construction of the roads, utility poles, license plates, traffic markers, street signs, and bollards.  \n\n\n\nBollards are pretty much just road markings in different countries. Every country, for the most part, has a distinct bollard. So pretty much if you see one bollard, you know you&#8217;re gonna be in that country. &#8230;License plates are extremely helpful as well. It&#8217;s worth mentioning all license plates are blurred, so you have to learn what blurred license plates look like. A lot of times it&#8217;s easier when it&#8217;s a very distinct color like yellow, where if it&#8217;s yellow front and back. …\n\n\n\nRainbolt also looks for natural indicators such as vegetation, soil, and his own intuition.\n\n\n\nYou&#8217;re looking at the color of the soil and overall the vegetation that&#8217;s within the soil and around it as well. Are there more pebbles? Is there more grass? Is it more green?&#8230; I probably really couldn&#8217;t describe it, but some things just look like South Chile soil.\n\n\n\n\n  @georainbolt eye tracking #geo #geography #geoguessr #geowizard #CVSPaperlessChallenge ?

        "description": "In a rare outtake from the 1967 Disney film, Mary Poppins, actors Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews amusingly traded vocals while lip-synching the song &#8220;Chim Chim Cher-ee&#8221;. The pair had so much fun that it appeared difficult for each to keep a straight face throughout.\n\n\n\nAn outtake/blooper from the 1964 film Mary Poppins. The actors are Dick Van Dyke and Julie Andrews, and the song played is Chim Chim Cher-ee.\n\n\n\nHere&#8217;s another outtake in which Andrews yodels in order to bring out a smoke staircase.  The scene was cut from the film but it contains a delightful blooper.\n\n\n\nJulie Andrews also recorded a brief yodel which breaks into the first line of &#8220;A Spoonful of Sugar&#8221; which was to have been used to &#8220;activate&#8221; the smoke staircase prior to the &#8220;Step in Time&#8221; number. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nvia Digg",

        "description": "David Richard-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Can “Clutch Hutch” help the Tigers avoid the sweep? The Tigers overcame a shaky start and early three-run deficit to force extra innings and briefly took a lead only to bobble and literally throw the game away in the bottom of the tenth. Now they will need to try for a win to avoid yet another sweep in Los Angeles and they will need to go through one of the Angels’ toughest pitchers to do so. \nWith 26 games remaining in the regular season, the Tigers remain in serious danger of finishing with 100 losses. In fact, it’s looking quite likely the way they’ve played recently...well okay, all year long. Their current .375 season winning percentage has them on course for 101 losses. There may be little to play for, but there are no prizes for being awful anymore, as the draft lottery is coming in 2023. Frankly, tanking for top picks was always badly oversold as some kind of strategy. It would be great if the Tigers could find something to motivate themselves over the final weeks of the season. Avoiding finishing with a sub-60 win total, or more than 100 losses, may be all they have left in this unsalvageable season.\n\nDetroit Tigers (51-85) at Los Angeles Angels (60-76)\nTime/Place: 4:07 p.m., Angel Stadium of AnaheimSB Nation Site: Halos HeavenMedia: Bally Sports Detroit, MLB.TV, Tigers Radio NetworkPitching Matchup: RHP Drew Hutchison (2-7, 4.06 ERA) vs. LHP Patrick Sandoval (5-9, 3.02 ERA)\n\nPatrick Sandoval would be the unquestioned ace of the Angels’ pitching staff if not for Shohei Ohtani. He leads the league in the lowest HR/9 rate at 0.44 and has a nearly identical ERA and FIP in the very low 3.00s. He features a five-pitch mix but mostly uses the slider, changeup, and fastball to get results. He has very much above-average marks in K%, hard hit %, chase %, whiff %, and curveball spin. Quite simply, he has nasty stuff and is rarely hit hard. About the only chink in the armor is a high BB% but a few more walks than normal won’t hurt you if you aren’t letting the ball leave the yard. \nDrew Hutchison will take the mound once again for the Tigers looking to deliver another solid start. He still doesn’t have overpowering stuff, and he still doesn’t strike many guys out yet he’s strung together several quality outings in a row. He’s pitched between five and six innings and given up three runs or fewer in his last seven outings back to late July. The Angels’ bats have been red hot so far in the series so he’ll need to be his most clutch self yet to give the Tigers a chance. If he can manage to keep Trout and Ohtani in check, he has a good chance, but that’s much easier said than done.\nKey Matchup: Can the Tigers look like they care\nFor all of Hutchison’s clutch work with unremarkable stuff, it won’t mean anything if the Tigers can’t put runs on the board. and frankly, they haven’t looked much up to that task. They had a brief offensive outburst in Texas where it looked like maybe they would finish the year strong but now that simply looks like a minor blip on the radar as they have plunged back into a 1-7 record in their last 8 games. They simply look outclassed and outmatched in every aspect and they play like a team that is ready for the season to be over. \nObviously, it’s different for all the young guys in their first looks at the majors, including Riley Greene. But most of the club feels like they’ve checked out. Instead of watching this one, let Dan Dickerson’s soothing voice serenade you and your family on the radio as you cook out on your patio or deck this evening. Even if the Tigers lose, you’ll still win.",

Most notably, it includes a fix for the battery drain issue that has been plaguing devices on Android 13 since it launched. It also fixes an issue affecting wireless charging on a small subset of devices. There are also improvements to the fingerprint reader on the Pixel 6a; However, as mentioned earlier, that won&#8217;t be released until later. Check out the full list below of the included fixes:\n\n\n\nBattery &amp; Charging&#x2022; Fix for issue occasionally causing increased battery drain from certain launcher background activities&#x2022; Fix for issue preventing wireless charging mode to activate in certain conditions &#x2014; on Pixel 4, Pixel 4 XL, Pixel 5, Pixel 6 &amp; Pixel 6 ProBiometrics&#x2022; Additional improvements for fingerprint recognition and response in certain conditions &#x2014; on Pixel 6a, once it receives the updateBluetooth&#x2022; Fix for issue occasionally preventing certain Bluetooth devices or accessories from connectingUser Interface&#x2022; Fix for issue occasionally causing notifications to appear truncated on the lock screen\n\n\n\nThis update is currently available for Pixel models 4 (XL), 4a, 4a (5G), 5, 5a (5G), 6, and 6 Pro. The rollout will continue over the next week in phases, so if your eligible device doesn&#8217;t show the update available yet, you may just need to wait a few more days. However, once the OTA (over-the-air) update becomes available for your device, you will receive a notification.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Photo by Kevin C. Cox/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Strider looks strengthen his Rookie of the Year resume this afternoon against the A’s After pulling out a wild 10-9 win Tuesday night, the Atlanta Braves will go for a series sweep against the Oakland Athletics. Tuesday’s win was Atlanta’s sixth straight overall and moved them into a tie with the Mets at the top of the NL East standings. New York is 51-34 since June 1, but has watched a 10.5 game lead evaporate because the Braves have gone 62-24. \nThey will look to keep the streak going Wednesday afternoon when Spencer Strider makes his 18th start of the season. Strider is coming off of a record setting performance where he broke John Smoltz’s Atlanta era record for strikeouts in a game with 16 against the Rockies. He allowed just two hits while throwing a season-high eight scoreless innings. Strider has allowed a total of three runs over his last four starts (25 innings) and has 36 strikeouts over that span. Since joining the rotation, he has been among the best starters in the game. \nLeft-hander Ken Waldichuk will make his second major league start for the A’s Wednesday afternoon. Oakland acquired Waldichuk from the New York Yankees along with Cooper Bowman, Luis Medina and JP Sears in exchange for Frankie Months and Lou Trivino at the deadline. He made his debut on September 1 against the Nationals where he allowed five hits and one run in 4 2/3 innings. He walked four and struck out six.\nThe Braves battered Tuesday’s starter Cole Irvin for nine runs. They have feasted on left-handed pitching this season hitting .272/.349/.458 as a team with a 124 wRC+ which is the second-best mark in the majors trailing only the Cardinals. \nKenley Jansen worked a perfect ninth in Tuesday’s win just days after admitting that he had a mechanical flaw in his windup that was causing him issues. Jansen had allowed five runs in just three innings over his last four appearances before Tuesday and had four walks and just one strikeout. \nWednesday’s game has a scheduled start time of 3:37 p.m. ET and can be seen on Bally Sports South. \nGame Info\nGame Date/Time: Wednesday, September 7, 3:37 p.m. ET\nLocation: Oakland Coliseum, Oakland, California\nTV: Bally Sports South\nStreaming: MLB.tv\nRadio: 680 AM / 93.7 FM The Fan",

Now, TAG says that profit-seeking cybercriminals are becoming active in the area in greater numbers.\nFrom April through August 2022, TAG has been following “an increasing number of financially motivated threat actors targeting Ukraine whose activities seem...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

While only a small group of users have been able to view Birdwatch notes in the past, all notes have been publicly available on the Birdwatch website.\nTwitter has its own policies addressing misinformation on its platform and has started labeling false tweets and manipulated videos over the last few years.

        "description": "As it celebrates 75 years of independence, India has become the world’s&nbsp;fastest-growing large economy&nbsp;and a global leader and trendsetter that will soon&nbsp;overtake China&nbsp;as the world’s most populous country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. strategy in Asia cannot neglect India’s importance or growing economic weight. To shape the next phase of development for a free and open Indo-Pacific, it’s vital that the United States deepen commercial engagement with the world’s largest democracy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs vice president, Joe Biden set a target of&nbsp;$500 billion&nbsp;in U.S.-India trade, but too little progress has been made toward this goal. As strategic concerns in the region escalate, it’s time to shore up our joint strategy to incorporate a more robust trade agenda.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIndia is moving forward fast without meaningful U.S. government engagement. In the digital economy, the architecture for the next five decades is being built over the next five years: The Indian parliament recently introduced a&nbsp;Competition Bill&nbsp;with provisions on mergers and acquisitions that would give it greater control over American technology companies. India is also launching an “Open Network for Digital Commerce” that will transform how e-commerce companies compete for customers in the country.\n\n\n\nIndia is well positioned to export these frameworks: Just as we’ve become familiar with the “Brussels effect,” Washington has to prepare for the “Delhi effect” throughout the region. Without constructive commercial engagement between the two countries, we may find ourselves competing rather than collaborating on the next phase of Indo-Pacific development.\n\n\n\nOur allies recognize the strategic imperative of closer business ties with India. Australia recently signed an interim&nbsp;trade agreement&nbsp;with India, the first India has signed with a developed country in a decade. Since 2016, the United Kingdom has invested significant political capital to advance trade talks with India, negotiating a&nbsp;trade deal&nbsp;in the context of strengthening strategic ties and remaining open to increasing visas to Indians as part of the bargain. The European Union relaunched talks for a free trade agreement with India last month, recognizing the “unprecedented urgency” for greater cooperation to counter rising authoritarianism around the world. Our allies see that their trade doctrines must service their strategic interests and that limited deals are better than none.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. needs to catch up before it can lead. The relaunched&nbsp;U.S.-India Trade Policy Forum&nbsp;(TPF) is not making sustained progress on market access. Biden’s new&nbsp;Indo-Pacific Economic Framework&nbsp;(IPEF) will not address tariffs or market access for American workers and the goods and services they produce. India’s decision to participate as only&nbsp;an observer&nbsp;in the last IPEF ministerial signals that the framework is failing to secure critical buy-in from one of its most important stakeholders.\n\n\n\nA robust trade strategy with India must fully leverage the TPF, IPEF, and the Quad platforms to address market access in bilateral and multilateral contexts. The digital space is ripe for a “mini-deal.” Elements like technical standards and cross-border data flows can be unbundled and negotiated on separate platforms, serving as building blocks for a comprehensive Digital Trade Agreement between the two digital giants. Additionally, with U.S. businesses clamoring to attract high-skill talent, liberalized visas for Indian workers and students could be a potent incentive in trade negotiations that could help address the skills gap in our own workforce.\n\n\n\nIndia has been a historically difficult trading partner, retaining some of the&nbsp;world’s highest tariff&nbsp;barriers and presenting significant concerns for U.S. firms in intellectual property, digital governance and public procurement. Constructive trade engagement from Washington can encourage India to take further steps to be a positive stakeholder in the multilateral trading system and address concerns articulated by American investors and firms.\n\n\n\nMini deals in critical sectors can serve as stepping stones to an eventual trade agreement. In the long run, a free trade agreement with India would be a monumental achievement enabling us to work as economic partners in securing a free and prosperous Indo-Pacific.\n\n\n\nThe “pivot to Asia” has been an elusive goal for Washington across administrations. If the Biden administration is going to stick the landing, it must advance a bold trade agenda with a democracy that can be as messy as our own. But, unlike us, that democracy is moving ahead with vigor to expand trade partnerships in its own national interest.\n\n\n\nMyron Brilliant is executive vice president and head of international affairs of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.  ",

The school board said it continues to pursue housing opportunities for educators, including \"private homeowners with rooms to rent.\"\n\n\n\nNearly 50 people in the community have offered up a room, NewsNation affiliate KRON reported.  \n\n\n\n\"This is evidence that our entire MUSD Team, which includes our teachers and classified support staff, is valued by our Milpitas community members, parents and caregivers,\" the school district said in a statement as reported by KRON.\n\n\n\nThose with an available room can submit their information through a form on the school district's website.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tVittert: ‘Nothing’s changed’ as Uvalde students return\t\n\n\n\n\nThe Bay Area has notoriously become one of the most expensive places in the United States to live, and San Jose is the second most expensive place in the country to rent, according to San Jose Spotlight.\n\n\n\n\"Many of the Milpitas Unified School District moderate-income employees are working families and are finding it increasingly difficult to purchase or rent a home within a 15 mile radius or close to the Milpitas Unified School District where they work,\" the school district said in its resolution.\n\n\n\nTeacher salaries have remained stagnant across the country since 1996, and a report from the Economic Policy Institute shows California teachers were paid 17% less than comparable college-educated workers last year. \n\n\n\nA recent report by Airbnb found that 20% of hosts identified as an educator or lived with one in 2021. Teachers made nearly $280 million from hosting last year.",

        "description": "A new ad released on Tuesday by Georgia Senate candidate Herschel Walker’s (R) campaign accuses Democrats, including his opponent, Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), of using “race to divide us.”\n\n\n\n“Democrats use race to divide us,” the ad begins, before showing clips of Democrats like Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, Vice President Harris, President Biden and Walker talking about race.\n\n\n\nThe ad plays a clip, for example, of Biden saying “You ain’t Black,” followed by a clip of Warnock saying “America has a preexisting condition. It’s called racism.”\n\n\n\n“Senator Warnock believes America is a bad country full of racist people. I believe we’re a great country full of generous people. Warnock wants to divide us. I want to bring us together,” Walker, who is Black, concludes.\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Walker’s campaign for further details about the ad and Warnock’s campaign for comment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWalker has been considered a controversial candidate, garnering scrutiny from reports that the Senate hopeful had more children than previously publicly known; abuse allegations from ex-wife Cindy Grossman, which he has previously addressed; and false claims that he worked for the FBI.\n\n\n\nThe ad comes two months out from the midterms, where voters will see two Black candidates on the ballot for Senate for the first time. Warnock’s seat has been rated as a “toss-up” by the nonpartisan Cook Political Report and polling shows a tight race. \n\n\n\nAn Emerson College Polling survey found that Walker received 46 percent support among very likely general election voters compared to Warnock at 44 percent, though the polling falls within the margin of error.",

        "description": "Photo by Maddie Malhotra/Boston Red Sox/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The most impressive swing Triston Casas took last night wasn’t the one that went out of the ballpark.  By now you’ve probably seen the home run that Triston Casas smacked in last night’s game against the Rays, the first homer of his Big League career. He got a mid-90s fastball up and in, whipped his bat around much quicker than someone his size looks capable of, and turned on it, depositing it over the right field fence. It was a hell of a swing, displaying the bat speed and power that have made him one of the top prospects in baseball.\nAnd it wasn’t even my favorite Triston Casas swing of the night. \nIn the seventh inning, Casas stepped in to face lefty Brooks Raley with two outs and the bases empty. Making contact against lefties is the last developmental step Casas has to take, the final piece in the complete hitter puzzle. He’s never hit lefties well, and he actually regressed a bit against them as he made the move up to AAA Worcester. In 256 plate appearances against righties this year, he hit 13 home runs with a .975 OPS – that’s the statistical equivalent of Stan Musial. Against lefties, though, he didn’t hit a single homer in 90 plate appearances, with an OPS of .598 – that’s Rey Ordonez.\nRaley started him off with two hard sinkers that dove towards Casas’s knees. Casas swung over both of them, and wasn’t particularly close to getting the bat on the ball. Raley probably figured he could get him out by throwing the exact same pitch three times in a row, but his slider is his put-away pitch. He throws it more than any other pitch, hitters whiff at it 36% of the time they see it, and he’s recorded more strikeouts via the slider than anything else in his arsenal. He probably wanted to show the kid what a big league wipeout slider looks like. So he threw him a sweeper that started in over the plate and broke all the way across the zone, ending up on the outer edge. Here’s what Casas did with it:\n\nA foul ball to the left side! Ok, that’s probably not the dramatic payoff you were looking for. Sorry about that – I have a tendency to overpromise and underdeliver. But, actually, I’m not all that interested in what happened to the ball. I’m interested in Casas’s swing. \nTake another look:\n  \n        \n  \nThat’s an inside-out swing! Short, quick to the ball, an attempt to simply pop one into shallow left. Let me ask you: how often do you see a major leaguer shorten his swing these days, trading in power for contact? How about when that hitter is a 6’4”, 250-pound moose of a first baseman? How about when that hitter is a 6’4”, 250-pound moose of a first baseman who just hit his first career homer a few innings earlier?\nIt’s extremely rare to see a hitter employ two different swings in modern baseball. Players have become too finnicky, too attuned to every little moving part of their mechanics to risk having their whole swing fall apart because they got too cute. And further, in the Three True Outcomes Era, this isn’t what’s supposed to get you the money and attention. It’s the home runs that everyone wants, from the fans on up into the front offices. No one has time to appreciate a subtle shift in approach that, even if it did result in a base hit, probably wouldn’t have led to a run anyway.\nBut Triston Casas, as we’re learning, isn’t most hitters. This is a guy who started his big league career by doing half-naked Pilates in the outfield. This is a guy who has the confidence to call out the home plate umpire in his second game. This is a guy who, last night, said sure, shots to straight-away rightfield are cool, but have you ever considered the subtle beauty that’s inherent in a soft liner to left?\n Triston Casas is a baseball hipster, and I couldn’t love it more.",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Mets made a series of roster moves as they work around an increasingly beat up roster. Ahead of their Wednesday doubleheader with the Pirates, the Mets have made several roster moves. Most importantly, Max Scherzer will be heading back to the IL with fatigue in the same side that led him to miss several weeks earlier in the season. Alex Claudio has been activated to fill Scherzer’s spot on the roster with Yoan Lopez added as the 29th man. Finally, Adonis Medina has been DFA’d.\nIf you’re looking for a silver lining here, this appears to be a precautionary IL stint for Scherzer rather than a reactive one. This morning, he told reporters this was a “days, not weeks” situation, so he’ll hopefully rest up for a couple weeks before being activated after the minimum IL time. Otherwise, these moves are mostly marginal, though they do serve to highlight the current state of the Mets’ bullpen. Spoiler alert it’s pretty bad.\nAt least the Mets did receive some good news, as the official word on Starling Marte is “so far so good.” Nothing appears to be broken in Marte’s right hand, which was hit by a pitch on Tuesday. The Mets are still waiting for one more reading of his imaging, but it seems the Mets may have dodge a potentially crippling bullet at a time when they’re already dealing with several injuries and a severely slumping offense.",

        "description": "The Pirates have designated infielder Josh VanMeter for assignment.  In other moves, right-hander Hoy Park and left-hander Eric Stout were called up from Triple-A, with Stout acting as the 29th man for today&#8217;s doubleheader with the Mets.\nAcquired in a trade with the Diamondbacks in March, VanMeter&#8217;s first season in Pittsburgh has resulted in a .187/.266/.292 slash line over 192 plate appearances, a step down even from the modest offense VanMeter produced in 649 PA with the Reds and D&#8217;Backs in 2019-21.  VanMeter&#8217;s biggest asset has been his defensive flexibility, as he has mostly played first and second base this season while also making a few appearances as a third baseman, left fielder, catcher, and three mop-up pitching cameos.\nThis versatility has kept VanMeter in part-time and bench roles over the last four seasons, though with the season winding down, the Pirates will now open up more playing time for their younger players.  VanMeter is out of minor league options, so the DFA route had to be pursued in order to remove the 27-year-old from Pittsburgh&#8217;s roster.  A team in need of infield depth could potentially have VanMeter on the radar for a waiver claim, and the expanded September rosters create a bit of extra leeway for VanMeter&#8217;s out-of-options status.",

        "description": "New research shows what the loss of land mammals has done to food webs over the past 130,000 years.\n&#8220;While about 6% of land mammals have gone extinct in that time, we estimate that more than 50% of mammal food web links have disappeared,&#8221; says ecologist Evan Fricke, lead author of the study in Science. &#8220;And the mammals most likely to decline, both in the past and now, are key for mammal food web complexity.&#8221;\nA food web contains all of the links between predators and their prey in a geographic area. Complex food webs are important for regulating populations in ways that allow more species to coexist, supporting ecosystem biodiversity and stability. But animal declines can degrade this complexity, undermining ecosystem resilience.\nAlthough declines of mammals are a well-documented feature of the biodiversity crisis—with many mammals now extinct or persisting in a small portion of their historic geographic ranges—it hasn&#8217;t been clear how much those losses have degraded the world&#8217;s food webs.\nAbove, all the mammal species that would inhabit Southern California (top), New South Wales, Australia, (middle) and central Colombia (bottom) today if not for human-linked range reductions and extinctions from the Late Pleistocene to present. (Credit: Oscar Sanisidro/U. Alcalá)\nTo understand what has been lost from food webs linking land mammals, Fricke led a team of scientists in using machine learning to determine &#8220;who ate whom&#8221; from 130,000 years ago to today. Fricke conducted the research during a faculty fellowship at Rice University and is currently a research scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.\nUsing data on modern-day observations of predator-prey interactions, Fricke and colleagues trained their machine learning algorithm to recognize how the traits of species influenced the likelihood that one species would prey on another. Once trained, the model could predict predator-prey interactions among pairs of species that haven&#8217;t been directly observed.\n&#8220;This approach can tell us who eats whom today with 90% accuracy,&#8221; says Rice ecologist Lydia Beaudrot, the study&#8217;s senior author. &#8220;That is better than previous approaches have been able to do, and it enabled us to model predator-prey interactions for extinct species.&#8221;\nThe research offers an unprecedented global view into the food web that linked ice age mammals, Fricke says, as well as what food webs would look like today if saber-toothed cats, giant ground sloths, marsupial lions, and wooly rhinos still roamed alongside surviving mammals.\n&#8220;Although fossils can tell us where and when certain species lived, this modeling gives us a richer picture of how those species interacted with each other,&#8221; Beaudrot says.\nBy charting change in food webs over time, the analysis reveals that food webs worldwide are collapsing because of animal declines.\n&#8220;The modeling showed that land mammal food webs have degraded much more than would be expected if random species had gone extinct,&#8221; Fricke says. &#8220;Rather than resilience under extinction pressure, these results show a slow-motion food web collapse caused by selective loss of species with central food web roles.&#8221;\nThe study also shows that all is not lost. While extinctions caused about half of the reported food web declines, the rest stemmed from contractions in the geographic ranges of existing species.\n&#8220;Restoring those species to their historic ranges holds great potential to reverse these declines,&#8221; Fricke says.\nHe says efforts to recover native predator or prey species, such as the reintroduction of lynx in Colorado, European bison in Romania, and fishers in Washington state, are important for restoring food web complexity.\n&#8220;When an animal disappears from an ecosystem, its loss reverberates across the web of connections that link all species in that ecosystem,&#8221; Fricke says. &#8220;Our work presents new tools for measuring what&#8217;s been lost, what more we stand to lose if endangered species go extinct and the ecological complexity we can restore through species recovery.&#8221;\nStudy coauthors are from the University of Sussex, the University of Washington, the University of Alcalá, the University at Albany, and Aarhus University.\nThe research had support from Rice University, the Villum Foundation, and the Independent Research Fund Denmark.\nSource: Rice University\nThe post Loss of land mammals decimated food webs over 130,000 years appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Photo by Julio Aguilar/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Josh Donaldson doesn’t seem to provide much value for the Yankees, but do they have any real alternatives? When the Yankees acquired Josh Donaldson as part of March’s blockbuster deal with the Minnesota Twins, fans thought that the team was getting a power bat who didn’t strike out a ton, played strong defense at the hot corner, and injected fire into a team that looked rather lifeless at times last season. While he has certainly held his own defensively — his glove at third has helped the Yankees turn one of the worst defenses in 2021 one of the best this season — he’s fallen flat at the plate, and his attitude hasn’t so much injected fire so much as make him look like a fool on more than one occasion. With the Yankees lineup in need of a spark of some kind, I continue to wonder: what purpose does Josh Donaldson serve on this current team?\nDonaldson’s bat has been worse than lackluster, especially of late. Since his four-hit game on August 8th, he has slashed just .169/.281/.247 with four extra-base hits (although one of them was admittedly pretty grand). After a stint on the injured list in late May, he has posted just an 85 wRC+. To put in perspective how bad that is, not only is it worse than Isiah Kiner-Falefa, it’s worse than Joey Gallo performed in the weeks leading up to his trade! And unfortunately, the Statcast data does not offer much that looks promising.\n  \n        \n  \nIf his bat can’t be counted on to turn it around, the most obvious place where Donaldson provides value to the Yankees at the moment is on defense, where he has veritably been one of the premier defenders in baseball this season. His 8 DRS and 6 OAA are each tied for 5th among those who have played at least 100 innings at the hot corner. Even so, however, the argument can still be made that JD is the third-best third baseman on the team, at least defensively. DJ LeMahieu matches his 8 DRS and ranks just behind him in OAA (4, tied for 8th) in almost 350 fewer inning. And although he has not manned the hot corner so far this season, shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa won a Gold Glove there in 2020, courtesy of his 7 DRS, 6 OAA performance in 366.1 innings (roughly as many as LeMahieu has this season).\nOn top of that, Donaldson has not exactly been slick with the leather lately, and has been mired in what you might call a “defensive slump” over the last two months, one that has gotten worse in the last few days.\n\n\n\nAnd so, I ask again: what exactly does Donaldson bring to the team at the moment? At this point in time, would it be better for the Yankees to employ an infield that puts LeMahieu at the hot corner daily, or perhaps even slide IKF back to third and let Oswaldo Cabrera and Oswald Peraza spend time at shortstop? Perhaps — we’d only know for sure if they were to try either. It’s unlikely that either scenario plays out. \nLeMahieu has been spending less time at the hot corner of late: since the start of August, he’s made just four starts at third, compared to 13 at first and eight at second. Although part of that has to do with Anthony Rizzo’s injuries, the team is likely also managing his workload there as he plays through a toe injury that has essentially sapped his performance at the plate. Additionally, although Aaron Boone did mention the possibility of IKF playing third (with Peraza at shortstop) while Donaldson is on the paternity list (which should be any day now), it seems like something the Yankees, who have repeatedly insisted that Kiner-Falefa is their starting shortstop down the stretch, are unlikely to do as more than a short-term measure.\nAll of this to say that, although Donaldson has not been very good, it seems like the Yankees are stuck with him at third base for the time being. Let’s hope that he can run into a few homers to justify his spot in the lineup.",

He sent me the music and my Indian music-trained ears found the description of the eponymous battle excitingly familiar. With no libretto to hand I had no idea what was being sung. The cut and thrust of the words and the almost palpable physical energy it produced reminded me of the jathi used in Indian classical dance, vocal syllables patterned to create rhythmic energy.So for me dance and Monteverdi were linked from the very start – though probably not in the way that the composer might have intended.

        "description": "New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) on Wednesday announced the state’s health department will lift its mask mandate for public transit, shelters and correctional facilities.\n\n\n\nHochul declared the move “a new normal” in the state’s fight against COVID-19, adding that officials will still encourage mask-wearing on transit and the mandate remains in effect for health care facilities.\n\n\n\n“Getting vaccinated, boosted is our best shot, but also we have to restore some normalcy to our lives,” Hochul said at a press conference. “And so, we’ll be talking about a new normal starting today.”\n\n\n\nThe mask mandate for public transit in the state has been in effect since April 2020. State and local officials have gradually scaled back New York’s initial requirement to wear face coverings in public when social distancing wasn’t possible as the pandemic progressed.\n\n\n\nHochul on Wednesday said she expected many to still wear masks on public transit and urged the public to follow newly posted signage in subway stations that reads, “let’s respect others’ choices.”\n\n\n\n“You make your own determination, but do not judge your fellow passengers on what their choices are,” Hochul said.\n\n\n\nHochul in early February rolled back the state’s indoor mask mandate in most settings and weeks later lifted the requirement for schools. New York City dropped its mandate for schools in March following Hochul’s decision, but mask requirements remained for public transit and other limited settings statewide.\n\n\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) had long implemented a mask requirement on planes, trains and buses nationwide, but a federal judge struck down the rule in April.\n\n\n\nMultiple transit systems, including Washington D.C.’s Metro, quickly dropped their mask requirements, but masks remained mandatory on New York City’s subway and other public transit in the state.\n\n\n\n“I want to thank everyone who's been complying on our transit systems for 28 months — a long time,” Hochul said on Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I know for many it became second nature, but it's always been a visible reminder that something is not normal here, and it was there for the right reason,” she continued. “It protected health, and now we're in a far different place than we had been.”",

        "description": "New York state Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou (D), who finished second in the House primary for New York's 10th Congressional District last month, is opting against a progressive challenge to Dan Goldman, the Democratic nominee for the district.\n\n\n\nNiou, who has served in the New York State Assembly since 2017, narrowly lost the Democratic primary to Goldman, an attorney who served as the lead counsel during former President Trump’s first impeachment trial, by 2.1 percentage points. Days after her defeat she said she was mulling a run for the seat as a member of the Working Families Party.\n\n\n\nThe progressive Working Families Party in June endorsed Niou in the Democratic primary.\n\n\n\nBut on Tuesday, Niou announced that she is sitting out the race.\n\n\n\n“Enough of the absentee ballots have been counted, and we are conceding the primary. And I will not be on the WFP line for the general,” Niou said in a video posted on Twitter.\n\n\n\nShe put off formally conceding the race because of outstanding absentee ballots.\n\n\n\n“We simply do not have the resources to fight all fights at the same time, and we must protect our democracy now. This starts with keeping insurrectionists from taking control of Congress in November,” she added.\n\n\n\nSochie Nnaemeka, the director of the New York Working Families Party, said the decision to keep Niou off the ballot in the general election was made “after careful deliberation” between the candidate and the party.\n\n\n\n“As we approach November, we’ll collectively turn our efforts to defending our democracy against an increasingly extremist GOP. We’re proud of Yuh-Line and know she will continue to be a courageous voice and a beloved leader in the WFP,” Nnaemeka said in a statement.\n\n\n\nBoth Niou and the Working Families Party took jabs at Goldman, an heir to Levi Strauss &amp; Co. who put millions of his own personal wealth into the race and secured the coveted New York Times endorsement.\n\n\n\nAnd at the end of the primary, progressive candidates in the race appeared to team up against him.\n\n\n\nNiou and Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), whose third-place finish will end his time in Congress, campaigned together to try to counter Goldman.\n\n\n\nJones, who currently represents New York’s 17th congressional district, moved into the 10th District after redistricting, which left the latter seat open. Jones decided to move to the 10th District after Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), the chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, opted to run in a newly drawn district that encompassed a large part of Jones’s old area.\n\n\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) was also in the primary for the 10th Congressional District but dropped out of the race in July.",

Valentyn Reznichenko said.“There are fires, blackouts and other things at the (plant) that force us to prepare the local population for the consequences of the nuclear danger,” Reznichenko said. Officials in recent days have distributed iodine pills to residents to help protect them in the event of a radiation leak.In Enerhodar, where the power plant is located, Dmytro Orlov, the pre-occupation mayor, reported the city coming under Russian attack for a second time Wednesday and was without power. “Employees of communal and other services simply do not have time to complete emergency and restoration work, as another shelling reduces their work to zero,” he said on the Telegram messaging app.The Russian side blamed the Ukrainians. Vladimir Rogov, the head of the Russia-installed Enerhodar administration, said on Telegram that heavy Ukrainian fighting had caused the city&#x27;s blackout, and Russia&#x27;s Defense Ministry blamed the outage on Ukrainian forces attacking a power substation.Russian rockets on Wednesday hit the village of Mala Tokmachka some 55 miles northeast of Enerhodar, killing three people and injuring five, Zaporizhzhia regional Gov. Oleksandr Starukh reported.It&#x27;s not possible to independently reconcile the conflicting reports of the fighting, which has caused international alarm.The head of the U.N.&#x27;s International Atomic Energy Agency, Rafael Grossi, warned the U.N. Security Council on Tuesday that “something very, very catastrophic could take place” at the Zaporizhzhia plant. The IAEA urged Russia and Ukraine to establish a “nuclear safety and security protection zone” around the plant.The fear is that the fighting could trigger a disaster on the scale of the Chernobyl disaster in Ukraine in 1986.Neither Moscow nor Kiev officials would immediately commit to the idea of a safety zone.Because of damage from the fighting, the plant is generating electricity only to power its safety systems, a senior Ukrainian official said. The plant normally relies on external power to run the systems that keep the reactor cores cool and prevent them from melting down.Any further power disruption could force the plant to use back-up diesel generators, but that would entail bringing four diesel fuel trucks a day through the fighting, said Oleh Korikov, Ukraine&#x27;s acting chief inspector for nuclear and radiation safety.“We could potentially be in a situation where we run out of diesel,” he said. “And this can lead to an accident with damage to the active zone of the reactors and, accordingly, the release of radioactive products into the environment.”The plant also had to activate its diesel generators late last month because of damage, according to Ukrainian officials.Authorities could consider shutting down the plant, Korikov said, without offering details about how that would work.The plant’s operator, Energoatom, said that despite the shelling, Ukrainian staff still working at the Russian-occupied plant will try to restore external power through at least one of the seven outside lines.Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday defied pressure to halt the war, saying Moscow will forge ahead with its offensive in Ukraine and mocked Western attempts to stop Russia with sanctions.Putin told an annual economic forum in the far-eastern port city of Vladivostok that even though the IAEA didn&#x27;t assign blame for the shelling around the Zaporizhzhia plant, claims that Russian forces are responsible are “absolute nonsense.” He asked rhetorically, “Well, are we shooting at ourselves or what?”He claimed fragments of Western weapons have been found at the plant, denied that Russia has placed military equipment there and said he doesn&#x27;t understand why Ukraine would fire on the facility, other than &quot;to create an additional crisis.”Heavy fighting was reported on three fronts: in the north, near the city of Kharkiv; in the east, in the industrial Donbas region of mines and factories; and in the south, in the Kherson region, where Ukraine has mounted a counteroffensive to try to retake territory the Russians seized early in the war.Ukrainian forces have taken control of an unspecified number of towns in the Kherson region, military spokesperson Nataliya Humenyuk said.The eastern city of Sloviansk came under Russian fire on Wednesday morning, and a school and another building were damaged, according to mayor Vadym Lyakh.Firefighters dug deep into the smoldering rubble of an apartment building and removed at least one body. Chunks of bricks, masonry and concrete lay among torn tree branches, broken glass and roof tiles. Metal doors, buckled by the blast&#x27;s force, hung off their hinges.The strike came at around 4 a.m., said resident Raisa Smelkova, 75, who lives in another part of the building. She and her husband were unhurt. The couple lived through the fighting in Ukraine in 2014, when Russia annexed the Crimea region.“What is happening now is not just scary, it’s gruesome,” she said. “There is more destruction. Everything is worse. Just everything.”",

(credit: Getty Images | Angela Weiss)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo weeks after Elon Musk made a commitment to buy Twitter for $44 billion, he wrote in a May 8 text message to one of his Morgan Stanley bankers that he was thinking of exiting the merger agreement due to the possibility of World War III.\n\"Let's slow down just a few days. Putin's speech tomorrow is really important. It won't make sense to buy Twitter if we're heading into World War III,\" Musk wrote to Morgan Stanley's head of global technology investment banking, Michael Grimes. Twitter lawyer Bill Savitt read the text out in a court hearing yesterday, multiple news reports said. In the May 9 speech, Russian President Vladimir Putin defended his invasion of Ukraine. The invasion began in February, two months before Musk's April 25 agreement to buy Twitter.\nWhile Twitter called the Musk text a \"money quotation,\" Musk lawyer Alex Spiro \"said the characterization of the texts in court was 'utter nonsense as the full text chain shows.' The full text chain is expected to be filed on the court docket next week,\" Business Insider wrote. Spiro also \"responded by saying that any businessman would be anxious about the impact of a potential war on the stock market,\" The Wall Street Journal wrote.Read 14 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: Idrees Hassan)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina-based developer Idrees Hassan loves Minecraft so much that he recently created a monospaced font for programming based on the typeface found in the wildly popular video game. The result, Monocraft, gives programmers the feel of being in Minecraft without using any assets from the game.\n\n\"To be honest, I made this font because I thought it'd be fun to learn how fonts worked,\" Hassan told Ars. \"Existing Minecraft fonts were missing a bunch of small details like proper kerning and pixel size, so I figured I should make my own. Once that was done, there was nothing stopping me from going overboard and turning it into a 'proper' programming font. Plus, now I can write Minecraft plugins in a Minecraft font!\"\nTo adapt the Minecraft font for development purposes, Hassan redesigned characters to look better in a monospaced format, added a few serifs to make letters such as \"i\" and \"l\" easier to distinguish, created new programming ligature characters, and refined the arrow characters to make them easier to read. (Ligature characters combine popular operational character strings such as \"!=\" into a single new character, but they aren't always popular with developers.)Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit:  Jose Garcia (Garciartist) and Griffith University.)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchaeologists recently unearthed the remains of a young adult buried 31,000 years ago in a cave called Liang Tebo. Surprisingly, the person’s left leg ended a few inches above the ankle, with clean diagonal cuts severing the ends of the tibia and fibula (the two bones of the lower leg). This is the oldest evidence of surgical amputation ever found—and it suggests that the patient survived for years afterward.\nClear-cut evidence for Stone Age surgery\nWe don’t know the young person’s name (archaeologists have dubbed the patient Tebo 1), and the bones offer no clues about biological sex. What we do know is that injuries must have been a common fact of life in the young person’s community. Hunting, especially in mountainous terrain, is a dangerous way to make a living; the bones of Neanderthals and ancient members of our own species reveal that people got banged up fairly often during the Pleistocene.\nAlthough falling rocks or the chomping jaws of a large animal can definitely remove a leg, that kind of trauma crushes or shatters the bone. It doesn’t leave neatly angled edges—and the smoothly sliced ends of Tebo 1’s leg bones look like the work of sharp instruments in skilled hands.Read 21 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge / During the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre, the city's African American Greenwood district was destroyed by white rioters. (credit: Universal History Archive / Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn the night of May 31, 1921, a white mob descended on the affluent Black neighborhood of Greenwood in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The mob had gathered after the arrest of a Black teenager named Dick Rowland, who had been falsely accused of assaulting a white girl in an elevator. In one of the worst episodes of racial violence in US history, thousands of white vigilantes took to the streets of Greenwood with torches, guns, and bombs.\nIn a matter of hours, the rioters destroyed more than a thousand homes and hundreds of businesses across 35 blocks of the Greenwood district—so prosperous it was called “Black Wall Street.” Historians estimate that dozens to as many as 300 Black people were killed during the massacre. Some are believed to have been buried in unmarked graves. In 2020, the city of Tulsa finally began excavations to search for those graves. So far, archaeologists have exhumed 19 sets of human remains at a local cemetery that may be linked to the massacre.\nNow, scientists working for the city have obtained enough usable DNA from two individuals to potentially learn their identities. The researchers say genetic material from these two people’s living descendants could help identify the nameless victims. “These people deserve their names. They deserve to be identified. Their families deserve to know who they are,” says Danny Hellwig, director of laboratory development for Intermountain Forensics, a nonprofit laboratory based in Utah hired by Tulsa officials to do the DNA analysis.Read 20 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "link": "https://laughingsquid.com/yvonne-shortt-legally-blind-documentary/",
        "description": "In the first episode of a three-part series about living with disabilities, filmmaker James Robinson introduces Yvonne Shortt, a talented artist who is legally blind due to Retinitis pigmentosa, an optical disease that breaks down cells in the retina over time.  \n\n\n\nBut unlike the stereotype of the blind living in a lightless world, Ms. Shortt, like most other legally blind people, lives a nuanced existence between those who see well and those who can’t see a thing. Ms. Shortt has retinitis pigmentosa, a disease that causes progressive loss of sight. She can see some things some of the time, depending on various factors, including the amount of ambient light, her distance from the object and the object’s location in her field of vision.\n\n\n\nShortt talks about how she discovered she had trouble seeing, how she switched careers to become a full-time artist, how she comes into a room, and how, with the support of her peers, she came to feel empowered walking down the street with a cane.  \n\n\n\nYvonne’s refusal to use the white cane shifted when she joined a support group. “And this one amazing person, I told her my biggest fear, having to have a cane. As we were leaving, she put her cane in my hand. And she just held my arm here. There were people coming at us, a big group of people. And I just started whacking it on the floor. It was so amazing to have them just scatter to the right and left. I felt like Moses with the parting of the sea.\n\n\n\nAs with his documentary on stuttering, Robinson created a visualization that simulates how people with R.P. see the world. As noted, it&#8217;s a gradual loss of sight.  Shortt understands her physical limitations but also finds that her sight has developed in other areas, particularly in her art.\n\n\n\nIn this short film, Mr. Robinson simulates what it’s like to be Ms. Shortt, navigating her world with progressively declining eyesight but also recognizing what she has gained even as she has lost something so precious.\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by James Robinson (@byjamesrobinson) \n\n\n\nHere are several of Shortt&#8217;s powerful pieces.\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Workshop of Shortt (@yvonne_shortt) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Workshop of Shortt (@yvonne_shortt) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Workshop of Shortt (@yvonne_shortt) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Workshop of Shortt (@yvonne_shortt) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobinson was inspired to do this series by his own experience with a disabling eye condition.",

Luis Perdomo coughed up four runs without recording an out, and Peter Strzelecki allowed a game-tying home run. The Brewers put a run on the board in the top of the 10th to take the lead, but a walk-off blast by Randal Grichuk off Taylor Rogers sealed their defeat.\nCraig Counsell’s decision to pull Brandon Woodruff after seven strong innings drew plenty of criticism, especially when he didn’t provide much of an explanation in his post-game presser.\nThe Brewers should have played themselves out of a postseason spot weeks ago, but mediocre play by the Phillies and Padres leave them within striking distance of the final Wild Card spot. The clock is ticking, though, and the Brewers cannot continue to squander opportunities.\nYou can leave your questions in the comments section below or post them on Twitter. For those using the latter platform, make sure to tag me @baseball7310 to ensure that I see your submissions. I’ll answer as many questions as I can on Friday.",

        "description": "Photo by Nick Cammett/Diamond Images via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Or, what the Guardians could learn from the Chelsea Football Club This morning I woke up to news my favorite soccer team, Chelsea Football Club, had sacked (to use the British phrase) their manager, Thomas Tuchel. You don’t come here to read soccer analysis, but stay with me because it got me thinking about Terry Francona.\nOn the heels of back-to-back wins, the Guardians’ first since Aug. 24, it may seem incongruous to ponder Terry Francona’s future. I mean, with 28 games left this season Cleveland still has a 53.5% chance of making the playoffs and 52.7% chance of winning the division, which are both quite good!\nHowever, at the risk of repeating a Hacks joke, I think letting this be Terry Francona’s last year in charge of the Cleveland Guardians would be just fine. \nFrancona has always been the kind of manager who blended the advanced statistical information provided by the quants with the old-school, human-centered approach. As he told Jayson Stark in 2018, “They [Cleveland] know the stuff I really value, so they’ll build it [analysis] for me the way I understand it, because if you don’t understand it it doesn’t help anybody.” This kind of approach seems to hit the sweet spot in managing an MLB team, where you keep it simple but let smart guys help you get where you want to go. Lately, though, it does not seem like the messaging is either clear to Francona or having an impact on his game management, and he seems to be missing the process the front office is trying to implement.\nWe’ve long known that certain guys will get playing time regardless of statistics under Francona. Most fans can probably yell at length about guys like Mike Freeman or Ryan Raburn and why their playing time didn’t match their output or their splits. From Aug. 25 to Sept. 5, Cleveland went 2-8 and were outscored 37-16. In that span, the lineup that Francona submitted changed very little despite the team’s offensive ineptitude, including 13-, 27-, and 11-inning scoreless streaks. While lineups in late August and September are pretty static for contenders, the division of playing time has been confusing.\nThis stretch, Aug. 25 to Sept. 5, was brutal for all the Guardians’ hitters. José Ramírez couldn’t even log a hit in 13 PA against left-handed hitting during that span, but giving him those plate appearances is not questionable. To the contrary, giving Owen Miller (57 wRC+ in 132 PA vs. LHP and just 60 wRC+ in 78 PA against anyone since Aug. 1) 7 PA in similar situations is perplexing. If the argument for Miller’s time is that Josh Naylor can’t hit lefties (and he can’t, he has a 56 wRC+ in 104 PA), why was he given 13 PA (the most of anyone on the team over that span)? Further, why wasn’t Will Benson (.761 OPS against LHP in 72 AB at Triple-A) given a shot at first base, where he logged 24.2 innings in preparation for his promotion to Cleveland? \nWhen looking beyond just the splits, it seems fair to question why Tyler Freeman was limited to just 20 PA over this dismal stretch. Among all Guardians’ hitters from Aug. 25 to Sept. 5, he was the best hitter by average (.316), strikeout rate (5%), slugging (.368), second in wRC+ (84), and third in wOBA (.284). None of his numbers were particularly great, but compared to teammates, like Amed Rosario (46 PA, 19 wRC+), he looked like a much preferable option.\nAnd here’s where the comparison to Chelsea’s former coach comes into play. Chelsea are not a small market club like Cleveland — they were able to go out and purchase several top-class players this summer to reinforce their team — but they made a point to recruit many young players and give lucrative new contracts to their own academy players this summer. However, when Chelsea struggled early in the current season and lost a number of players at one position to injury, Tuchel didn’t trust those young players and instead turned to underperforming veterans to fill the role.\nAnd so, in the wee hours of the night in London, Chelsea’s new owners decided they needed a coach that would match their long-term ambition and not someone who will just fall back on his guys to try for short-term success. To me, this rhymes with what is happening in Cleveland: The front office decided against pricy free agents last winter or trade acquisitions at the deadline because they have a long-term plan and a window of contention that is only peeking open, but Francona continues to pursue victories with players he knows rather than testing the young options the front office is counting on.\nMLB is not the English Premier League, and I don’t want to throw Francona out of Cleveland tonight, but the continued existence of someone like Ernie Clement (44 wRC+ in 158 PA) on the roster makes it feel like Francona is getting further away from the process the Guardians front office is trying to work. If that really is the case, the front office might be wise to follow Chelsea’s lead and get a new manager, one who matches the club’s long-term goals more closely. Chelsea’s owners know a thing about this, after all: they’re the same folks who own the Dodgers.\nFrancona is likely headed to the Hall of Fame someday as a manager, and it will be deserved. But with all the above and the fact his health is constantly in question, he does not seem like the guy who will lead the Guardians to their next World Series if they don’t win one this year. With a lot of talented young players already in Cleveland and many more hoping to prove their worth in the next year or so, the timing seems right to find the next great manager. \nFinish this year — and hope for a few (or several) final playoff games to wrap up his tenure with the Guardians — and let Francona move to a front office role or something less intense than manager. One who trusts the process.",

        "description": "Lebanon is suffering in the throes of one of the largest economic collapses of modern times as it struggles to recover from a disastrous peacetime blast that devastated the Beirut port and whole neighborhoods in August 2020. Presidential elections in the fall could influence the course of the country for years to come. The next few months deserve particular domestic and international attention to help Lebanon move toward socioeconomic recovery.\n\n\n\nThe term of the current president, Michel Aoun, an ally of Hezbollah, ends on Oct. 31.  According to Lebanon’s precarious constitutional system, it is parliament’s role to elect a new president to a fresh six-year term. This occasion is pivotal and casts a long shadow over subsequent years because a new president is a key player in nominating a prime minister and participating in the formation of the next government.\n\n\n\nA new presidential term is also likely to be accompanied by appointments to such key posts as commander of the Army, heads of intelligence services, governor of the Central Bank, and other major positions. The replacement of a Hezbollah ally by a more independent, reform-minded, and nationalist figure would have an important, long-term impact on Lebanon’s chances of reclaiming its compromised sovereignty, implementing urgently needed reforms, pulling the country back from the brink of full-fledged collapse, and strengthening support for our shared interests in the region.\n\n\n\nThe current parliament, elected in May, is almost evenly split between allies and opponents of Hezbollah and neither side is likely to muster the necessary quorum in a timely manner to elect a president, potentially delaying the election for weeks or even months. But Lebanon can ill afford another long vacancy in its governing institutions. \n\n\n\nThe Hezbollah-allied coalition has its own client candidate — or candidates — lined up. Unfortunately, the reformist opposition coalition is less centralized and has yet to agree on its preferred candidates. It is imperative that this coalition try to agree on an effective strategy and identify presidential candidates to leverage votes in parliament and block the election of another Hezbollah client. The election of an independent, reform-minded president could help turn the country’s fortunes around.\n\n\n\nThe international community has an interest in helping Lebanon reverse its downward spiral. A fully failed state on the eastern Mediterranean is in no one’s interest. That would threaten U.S. ally Israel, generate new refugee flows westward to Cyprus and the European Union, open the ground for the potential return of ISIS and al Qaeda, and further strengthen Hezbollah’s and Iran’s powers in Lebanon.\n\n\n\nThe presidential election is an opportunity to adjust Lebanon’s course for the next six years and set the country on the path of recovery. The U.S. should not pass up the opportunity to lead a coordinated international effort to encourage the election of an independent, reformist president.\n\n\n\nFor the time being, the Lebanese Armed Forces (LAF) is the main institution standing in the way of a collapse of order and state institutions. Maintaining its operational readiness is in the interest of the United States, France, our European allies, and importantly, Saudi Arabia and other Gulf countries. And thanks to American and international support, the LAF has been able to perform this critical role. This support must continue, not only to maintain order and help counterbalance Iran’s influence in Lebanon, but also to keep Russian influence — which is only a drive of several hours away in Syria — out of the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has been critical in advancing talks between Lebanon and Israel on demarcating the disputed maritime border between the two countries. Amos Hochstein, U.S. special envoy for energy affairs, has made tremendous progress in bringing these countries close to agreement, in spite of their current conflicts. A final agreement, under American auspices, would enable both sides to take advantage of valuable offshore gas resources, and importantly, help calm the increasingly hostile rhetoric heard along the Lebanon-Israel border.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany eyes in Lebanon are attentive to the on-again, off-again talks between the U.S. and Iran in Vienna. A return to the Iran nuclear deal, the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), could calm tensions in Lebanon and might help enable a way forward between the two opposing coalitions. A collapse of the talks could escalate regional pressures and increase the risk of Israeli-Iranian tensions spilling over into another devastating Hezbollah-Israel war.\n\n\n\nImportantly, American interests are best served by supporting the people of Lebanon through programs that advance American values through education, humanitarian family and health care, and democracy programs that directly empower and support Lebanese citizens.\n\n\n\nA large cross-section of the Lebanese population launched an uprising in October 2019 to demand the replacement of a corrupt and colluding political class. The port explosion two years ago intensified the discontent and drew Hezbollah more directly into the public’s hostility.  Although this defiant movement has not managed to properly unify, or to put forward someone charismatic like Ukraine’s Volodymyr Zelensky to articulate its message, the country’s suffering yet defiant population deserves the attention and support of the international community.\n\n\n\nThe next few months will be seminal for this small but critical country’s future. It is up to the Lebanese people and their representatives to make the right choices in the selection of the next president and other leaders who will fill important positions and implement urgently needed policies in the months and years ahead. But the U.S. and international community have an interest in continuing to give Lebanon the attention and support it deserves, to help ensure that the country indeed turns a corner toward revival and does not slip into full state failure and decades of chaos and ungovernability.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEdward Gabriel is a former U.S. ambassador to Morocco and the current president of the American Task Force on Lebanon.

        "description": "Legendary actress and activist Jane Fonda said that she feels stronger than she has in years after being diagnosed with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma. \n\n\n\nIn a blog posted on her official website Tuesday, the 84-year-old Academy Award winner thanked her fans for sending well wishes since the announcement of her cancer diagnosis, adding that since completing her first chemotherapy treatment three weeks ago, she has been active.\n\n\n\n\"Many have asked how I am feeling. Well today, about 3 weeks from my first chemo session, I must tell you that I feel stronger than I have in years,” Fonda wrote in her blog post, also sharing a video of her doing a squat exercise routine.&nbsp;“The doctor told me the best antidote to the tiredness that chemotherapy can cause is to move. Walk. And I have been walking. Very early before the record heat kicks in. Also working out.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is not my first encounter with cancer,” Fonda added. “I’ve had breast cancers and had a mastectomy and come through very well and I will do so again.”\n\n\n\nFonda also noted in her blog post that other cancer patients might not have access to the “top-drawer treatment” she receives, adding that her goal is to continue the push for better health care in the U.S. \n\n\n\n“As I said in my statement last week, I am painfully aware that the top-drawer treatment I receive is not something everyone in this country can count on and I consider that a travesty,” Fonda said. “It isn’t fair, and I will continue to fight for quality health care for all.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFonda, who received acclaim for her portrayal of Grace Henson on the Netflix hit series “Grace &amp; Frankie,” announced her non-Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis last week. \n\n\n\nFonda recently created her own political action committee that is focused on climate change efforts. \n\n\n\n“This diagnosis has only made me more determined than ever to continue to end the deadly effects of fossil fuels,” Fonda said in his statement. “We have it within our power to change this and I intend to do everything in my power to do so. This cancer will not deter me.”",

Defense Secretary William Cohen said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” on Wednesday that former President Trump is a “clear and present danger to democracy.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCohen, a Republican who led the Pentagon under former President Clinton, pointed to remarks that former federal judge Michael Luttig made before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection in which he said Trump was a threat to democracy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCohen told Will Geist of MSNBC that the recent revelations about the documents that Trump had at his Mar-a-Lago residence confirmed Luttig’s portrayal of the former president “over and over.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The notion that the former president had documents, highly classified documents, in his possession and in unsafe circumstances, or any circumstances, puts our nation at risk, potentially,” he said. “So, I think there’s no justification.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post reported on Tuesday that FBI agents found a document that details a foreign nation’s nuclear capabilities and military defenses during the search.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCohen said no one can say that the documents being present at Mar-a-Lago is a mistake at this point, and anyone who claims that is “flat-out lying.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe former Pentagon chief said he would be “in handcuffs” if he had possession of the documents that Trump had at Mar-a-Lago after leaving office.&nbsp;He said the question of why Trump had the documents in his possession is not relevant to whether he broke the law.\n\n\n\nCohen added that the Justice Department is going about its investigation methodically and deferentially.\n\n\n\nA federal judge granted Trump’s request on Monday to have a special master appointed to review documents the FBI obtained during its search of his Palm Beach, Fla., property last month. The ruling effectively pauses the investigation while the special master examines documents to determine if they are protected by attorney-client or executive privilege.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department is investigating if Trump violated three federal statues — including the Espionage Act — for continuing to possess documents, some of which are classified, that he should have turned over to government record-keepers when he left the White House.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump allies have said the former president declassified the documents he had, but classification status of the documents is not a determining factor in some of the potential violations of the law.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree transgender minors are suing the Oklahoma Education Department and several state education officials over the enforcement of a new law that blocks them from using school facilities that align with their gender identity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Oklahoma Senate Bill 615, public schools and public charter schools are required to restrict access to multiple occupancy restrooms and locker rooms based on students’ sex assigned at birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit was filed Tuesday in federal court by Lambda Legal, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Oklahoma.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree transgender students in Oklahoma are suing the state Department of Education over a controversial law enacted in May that prevents them from using school restrooms or locker rooms consistent with their gender identity.\n\n\n\nIn a lawsuit filed Tuesday in federal court by Lambda Legal, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and the ACLU of Oklahoma, attorneys for transgender students attending Oklahoma City area schools claim Senate Bill 615 violates the U.S. Constitution and Title IX by discriminating on the basis of sex, gender identity and transgender status. \n\n\n\nUnder the measure, signed into law by Gov. Kevin Stitt (R) in May, all pre-K through 12th grade public schools and public charter schools in the state are required to restrict the use of multiple occupancy restrooms and changing rooms based on students’ sex assigned at birth.\n\n\n\nSchool boards under the law are charged with creating a disciplinary policy for transgender students who violate the new restriction, and the Oklahoma State Department of Education (OSDE) must penalize schools that do not comply with the law with a 5 percent reduction in state funding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTuesday’s lawsuit names OSDE, members of the state Board of Education, four Oklahoma school districts and Oklahoma Superintendent of Public Instruction Joy Hofmeister — the Democratic nominee for governor — as defendants.\n\n\n\nOklahoma Attorney General John O’Connor (R) is also listed as a defendant in the complaint. In a May statement following Stitt’s signature on the measure, O’Connor said he stood ready to defend the new law from any forthcoming legal challenges.\n\n\n\nO’Connor’s office said it could not comment on the complaint at this time.\n\n\n\nThe complaint filed Tuesday alleges the plaintiffs, all of which are transgender minors, will be “irreparably harmed” by the law and requests that the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma issue a preliminary injunction to block its enforcement.\n\n\n\nSimilar measures restricting public restroom use for transgender people have been blocked by court orders in North Carolina and Tennessee. An Alabama law preventing transgender students from using school facilities that match their gender identity took effect in May.\n\n\n\nProponents for such legislation have argued that it is necessary to protect students and others from predators that may take advantage of trans-inclusive policies. A 2018 study by researchers at the Williams Institute found that those fears are not “empirically grounded.”\n\n\n\n“I am a boy, and while living authentically hasn’t always been easy, it’s given me a sense of relief and happiness,” Andy Bridge, one of the plaintiffs in Tuesday’s lawsuit, said in a statement released by his attorneys at Lambda Legal.\n\n\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Bridge, a 16-year-old senior at Noble High School, used the school’s boys’ restrooms last year without issue. But prior to the start of the current school year, Bridge and his mother were informed by school officials that he would have to use a single-occupancy restroom this year because he is transgender.\n\n\n\nIf Bridge continues to use the boys’ restroom, he will be subject to disciplinary action, the school’s principal and vice principal told them, according to the complaint.\n\n\n\n“Being able to use the boys’ restroom might seem like a small thing to others, but it is a vital step in my transition,” Bridge said Tuesday. “Being barred from using it leaves me singled out and excluded from the rest of my friends and classmates, but also feeling like I’m being told that I’m not worthy of the same respect and dignity as everyone else.”",

Leonnig&nbsp;report that nuclear capabilities of a foreign nation were among the documents retrieved by the FBI from former&nbsp;President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome context to the documents — yikes: “Some of the seized documents detail top-secret U.S. operations so closely guarded that many senior national security officials are kept in the dark about them. Only the president, some members of his Cabinet or a near-Cabinet-level official could authorize other government officials to know details of these special-access programs, according to people familiar with the search.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n^ Tidbit on access to documents this classified: “Documents about such highly classified operations require special clearances on a need-to-know basis, not just top-secret clearance. Some special-access programs can have as few as a couple dozen government personnel authorized to know of an operation’s existence. Records that deal with such programs are kept under lock and key, almost always in a secure compartmented information facility, with a designated control officer to keep careful tabs on their location.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the full Washington Post report&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIT'S WEDNESDAY.

        "description": "Ramsey County District Court Judge Thomas Gilligan has rejected an attempt by Traverse County Attorney Matthew Franzese to intervene in the case of Doe v. Minnesota, a high-profile case challenging many of the state’s abortion restrictions.In July, Judge Gilligan ruled that many of those restrictions on abortion violate Minnesota’s constitution, including the mandatory 24-hour waiting period and a requirement that both parents be notified before a minor can get an abortion.Franzese filed the motion to intervene after Attorney General Keith Ellison decided not to appeal the ruling. In a hearing on Aug. 19, Minneapolis attorney William Mohrman, who represented Franzese and the Thomas More Society, argued that the judge’s decision only applies in Ramsey County, creating confusion about if the decision applies in the state’s other 86 counties, and that he has an interest in the case because Franzese is “charged with enforcing Minnesota state statutes.”But Gilligan rejected the motion Tuesday, saying that the county attorney “failed to demonstrate entitlement to intervene.”One central issue was the timeliness of the case, since litigation over this suit began in 2019. In the order, Gilligan said that the issue at hand “would have been well-known years ago.”“Instead of acting promptly to seek intervention, Franzese waited until the litigation was over to assert his stated interest. He waited until three years of extensive discovery and litigation had passed, four dispositive motions were briefed, argued and decided by this court, and several appeals of various decisions of this court were addressed by appellate courts, prior to seeking intervention,” the order reads. “Franzese has offered no reason for his delay in seeking intervention. Franzese is too late.”The judge also ruled that the Traverse County Attorney had not demonstrated sufficient interest in the case to justify intervention and rejected the argument over confusion about the ruling.“This court took great pains to make its declaration that certain abortion laws were unconstitutional and that their enforcement was permanently enjoined,” the decision said. “Having questions or confusion about its effect and reach is not an interest in the subject of this action.”That subject being the abortion restrictions, said Jess Braverman, legal director for Gender Justice, which originally brought the suit.“We’ve had a number of intervenors who&#x27;ve tried to step in, and they haven&#x27;t said, ‘Hey, I have an interest in the subject matter of the lawsuit which is these abortion restrictions, and so I should be allowed to intervene,’” she said. “[They’ve] said different things. You know, ‘I have an interest in the state raising a particular defense’ or I have an interest in … things other than abortion.”Representatives for Franzese did not immediately respond to a request for comment.Read the court order here",

        "description": "It has been almost a month since the Tigers parted ways with GM Al Avila, and since Lynn Henning of The Detroit News notes that ownership puts a high priority on keeping matters close to the vest, there hasn&#8217;t been much public news about potential targets to take over the front office.  However, Hennig lists current Tigers assistant GM Sam Menzin, Dodgers senior VP of baseball ops Josh Byrnes, and Cardinals special assistant to the GM Matt Slater as &#8220;three people are believed to be under heavy consideration&#8221; for the full-time general manager role.\nSeveral other front office members from multiple teams were also mentioned as plausible further candidates, though Henning was more circumspect about naming any of this group as surefire names in the hunt &#8212; Twins assistant GM Daniel Adler, Braves VP of scouting Dana Brown, Cardinals assistant GM Randy Flores, Guardians assistant GM James Harris, Orioles VP and assistant GM Sig Mejdal, Astros assistant GM Pete Putila, and Rays VP of baseball operations Carlos Rodriguez.  Former Tigers director of baseball operations Mike Smith could also potentially receive consideration.\nThere is no shortage of work ahead of Detroit&#8217;s next baseball operations leader, given how the Tigers have floundered in a season that was supposed to mark their return to contention.  While it isn&#8217;t expected that the Tigers will step back entirely into rebuild mode, the next GM will have to both make the big league team better while also bolstering the farm system at the same time.  According to league officials speaking with Henning, upgrading the Tigers&#8217; international development system will be a priority, and &#8220;trades are expected to be made with more aggression and more initiative than was practiced by Avila.&#8221;  The next front office will also need to focus on how to better apply analytics to development and on-field work.\nByrnes is the most familiar name to baseball fans, and the former Padres/Diamondbacks GM is also the only one of the known candidates with experience in leading a front office.  Byrnes ran the D&#8217;Backs from 2006-2010 and then the Padres from 2011-14, in both cases being fired around midway through his final season with the organization.  Of those eight full and partial seasons for Byrnes, only two (2007 and 2008 with Arizona) resulted in a winning record, and the 2007 NL West-winning Diamondbacks were the only Byrnes team to reach the postseason.\nStill only 52 years old, Byrnes&#8217; long career in baseball has also included stretches as an assistant GM and VP with the Rockies, Red Sox, and (since 2014) Dodgers, and Byrnes has been a part of two World Series-winning front offices.  Back in August, the New York Post&#8217;s Jon Heyman suggested Byrnes as a natural candidate for Detroit given Byrnes&#8217; past familiarity and working relationship with Tigers manager A.J. Hinch, who will be remaining with the team and will have some influence in the hiring of the next GM.\nMenzin is also naturally a familiar face for Hinch, and Henning writes that the assistant GM &#8220;is known to enjoy great favor with Hinch.&#8221;  Only 31 years old, Menzin already has a decade of experience in Detroit&#8217;s front office, starting as an intern and gaining experience working within several different departments of the Tigers&#8217; baseball operations.  Since Avila&#8217;s firing, Menzin has also been as the de facto interim general manager.\nSlater doesn&#8217;t have any ties to Hinch or the Tigers organization, and given the amount of work that might need to be done, it is possible he might be attractive to the club as a fresh voice.  The 51-year-old Slater&#8217;s specific role with the Cardinals is in player procurement, with the St. Louis website describing him as the franchise&#8217;s &#8220;senior talent evaluator.&#8221;  The Cards&#8217; excellent track record at finding and developing homegrown talent is certainly a point in Slater&#8217;s favor, and he has been with the team since 2007.  Before coming to St. Louis, Slater also worked in a number of different scouting and baseball ops roles with the Brewers, Orioles, and (for nine years) Dodgers.",

        "description": "Barbican, LondonSchneemann was inspirational, confrontational and joyously excessive, pulling art from her vagina and writhing naked through molasses and wallpaper paste. This thrilling show captures the sheer scope of a phenomenal artistThe semi-naked performers writhe about the floor, getting lewd and intimate with the dead mackerel, hotdogs, plucked chickens and other offerings being strewn among them by someone wearing an apron. There seems to be a lot of wet paint and plastic tarp lubricating all the flailing about in Meat Joy, which the artist, Carolee Schneemann, described as “an erotic rite”. The footage is grainy, the air of worthy transgression a picture of its time. It was 1964. Do not point that mackerel at me.Meat Joy was first performed at a festival in Paris, where a male spectator apparently attempted to strangle the artist. Schneemann – and her accomplices from New York’s Judson Dance Theater – performed again a few days later in London, and were chased off the stage by the police, before being exfiltrated in a fleet of cars. Some time later, London’s Whitechapel Gallery restaged the event, but without the police. Continue reading...",

        "description": "In the Season 2 opener of the OWN drama Queen Sugar, a teenaged Micah West (played by Nicholas Ashe) is pulled over in his luxury sports car for what appears to be an instance of driving while Black. After he’s released into the custody of his parents, the estranged couple argues in the parking lot. Meanwhile, when Micah’s Aunt Nova (Rutina Wesley) comes to comfort him, she notices that the boy has urinated on himself. “Ain’t nothin’ to be ashamed of,” she tells him, embracing her nephew while discreetly tying her sweater around his soiled pants. It isn’t until Episode 8 of the season that viewers discover what really happened: A still-traumatized Micah tells his father that before going to the precinct, the police officer drove him to a dark alley. The officer put what turned out to be an unloaded gun in the boy’s mouth and pulled the trigger, informing Micah that he hates privileged, “fancy-talking niggers.”“I think, for other shows, it would have been ‘a very special episode of Queen Sugar about police aggression,’ but for our show, [that arc] lasted for two seasons,” the creator, Ava DuVernay, told me. “We never forgot that this had happened to him, because he would have never forgotten it.” That extended story line explored police violence and the lingering effects of trauma on the show’s central family, the Bordelons, as Black Lives Matter protests erupted around them. It was groundbreaking television. This week, Queen Sugar returned for its seventh and final season, making it one of the longest-running Black family dramas in television history. Since the show’s 2016 debut, loyal Sugar viewers have followed the lives of siblings Nova, Charley, and Ralph Angel Bordelon—as well as their children; their Aunt Violet; and her husband, Hollywood—as they’ve fought to maintain ownership of their family’s 800-acre Louisiana sugar-cane farm. Over the show’s run, critics have praised it for being sexy and engrossing. They’ve also applauded DuVernay’s choice to hire an all-woman directorial team—several members of which had never before directed scripted TV—to help tell this story about race, class, and inheritance in the U.S. South. With its cinematic visuals and deep attention to the particularities of Black life, Queen Sugar has reimagined what television about the American family can look like.  \r\nOWN Communications; Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Hart / The Atlantic\r\nThe intentional storytelling that distinguishes Queen Sugar from other TV dramas is what DuVernay terms “luxurious pacing.” The show adheres to a three-act structure more typical of films instead of TV’s usual five-act format—the latter’s design is well suited to ending each act with a cliff-hanger before the commercial break. Consequently, Queen Sugar episodes might have fewer moments of heightened action, but they still effectively build and sustain emotional tension across the breaks. This technique creates what feels like loping narrative strides that unfold into bursts of Black joy, even as the show takes on the most wrenching subject matter. Visually, the show heavily utilizes what the crew calls the “Queen Sugar frame,” or shots where an actor is isolated at the edge of the frame. The abundant negative space around the actor captures the Louisiana environment: the chartreuse and forest-green hues of the sprawling Bordelon farm, the muddy browns of the waterways, and the multicolored shotgun- and bungalow-style homes characteristic of Louisiana architecture. An editorial pattern that resists quick cuts allows scenes to linger, to capture what DuVernay calls the “gentle moments,” the subtle glances between characters, as the lighting perfectly hits their melanated skin. “Black people in their everyday lives should be shot with cinematic grandeur,” said DuVernay, who collaborated with the cinematographer Antonio Calvache to develop the show’s lighting direction.[Read: Bel-Air and the flawed logic of Black excellence]In the United States, family dramas on television offer fictional representations of shared American values. They typically center on one family to explore how its members collectively handle real-life issues such as divorce, sibling rivalry, and unemployment. Programs from The Waltons and Little House on the Prairie to 7th Heaven and Parenthood have become blueprints for the genre. Each show has its own bent, but themes of hard work, economic stability, and heteronormative relationships are universal. Reflecting notions of the American Dream makes these shows relatable and trustworthy for mainstream viewers while reifying the notion that the ideal American family is white. Many recent dramas, such as the Freeform (formerly known as ABC Family) show The Fosters and NBC’s This Is Us, offer a progressive take on the formula but still work within the established parameters of the genre. Since the 1970s, there have been dozens of dramas that center on white families. Conversely, before Queen Sugar, there had been only a handful of Black family dramas on network and cable television, including CBS’s Under One Roof (1995), Showtime’s Soul Food (2000–2004), and the ABC Family vehicle Lincoln Heights (2007–2009).\r\nOWN Communications; Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Hart / The Atlantic\r\nHistorically, Black family shows have either been sitcoms, such as The Cosby Show (1984–1992) and Black-ish (2014–2022), primetime soap operas such as Empire (2015–2020) and OWN’s Greenleaf (2016–2020), or crime dramas such as Power (2014–2020). One interpretation is that many studio and network executives don’t believe there’s an audience for a Black show that revolves around something other than humor and violence. Others might not believe Black stories are suited to the sensitive, character-driven work of the family drama. Such beliefs may stem from the myth of the pathologically dysfunctional Black family that has persisted since the era of U.S. slavery. Politicians and lawmakers codified racist and sexist tropes about African American family life in welfare and education policies, aided by sociological reports such as Daniel Patrick Moynihan’s The Negro Family: The Case for National Action (1965). African American families, particularly single-mother-headed households, have been criminalized by the media and depicted as less redeemable than even dysfunctional white families (think the Gallaghers on Showtime’s Shameless).[Read: Not enough has changed since Sanford and Son]Queen Sugar’s method of luxurious Black storytelling eschews the conventions of the mainstream family drama and the racial hierarchy that defines the genre. DuVernay told me she didn’t consult or study any white family series while developing the treatment and pilot for Queen Sugar. She instead took inspiration from films that emerged from the so-called L.A. Rebellion movement, which was known for works such as Haile Gerima’s Bush Mama (circa 1975) and Sankofa (1993), Charles Burnett’s Killer of Sheep (1978), and Julie Dash’s Daughters of the Dust (1991). Many indie filmmakers of this era resisted the conventions of Hollywood films to tell distinctive, honest stories that focused on working-class Black people. The directors blended elements of documentary, neorealism, and nonlinear storytelling with West African knowledge systems and cultural practices to explore the possibilities of Black world-making in the Americas. DuVernay hired Dash to direct the two-part midseason premiere for Season 2, which delved into the emotional burden of secrets and shame. Borrowing from Black experimental film enables Queen Sugar to depict the African American family authentically, with all its strengths and imperfections and without catering to a white audience.\r\nOWN Communications; Photo Illustration by Elizabeth Hart / The Atlantic\r\nViewers can especially see the influence of L.A. Rebellion–era cinema in Queen Sugar’s Season 4 finale, which was directed by the Black indie filmmaker Ayoka Chenzira. In Season 1, viewers had learned that Nova is a rootworker, a traditional healer. She inherited her spiritual gifts from her deceased mother, Trudy Lavoisier Bordelon, whom Nova describes as a “a voodoo priestess from the bayous of Louisiana.” This rootwork arc spans several seasons. Viewers regularly see Nova engaging in what scholars such as Kinitra Brooks term “conjure feminism,” or the practice of using ancestral knowledge of West African and Caribbean herbal medicine and spirit work, to treat members of her community. Near the end of Season 4, Nova acquires from a family elder her mother’s journal, which contains Trudy’s formulas for medicinal elixirs and salves and cleansing smudges. Nova learns that her father, Ernest Bordelon, secretly buried Trudy in an unmarked grave on the Bordelon land. In the finale, Nova and her brother, Ralph Angel (Kofi Siriboe), find their mother’s burial location by deciphering her journal. The closing scene shows Nova leading her family—dressed in all white, common ritual attire in African diasporic religions—in a burial service for Trudy. In a voice-over, Nova says: “Our land … upholds our family, our hopes, and our fears … our blood and our blessings.” The land symbolizes the ancestral covenant, which predates slavery and defies Western notions of kinship, consecrating the bonds of the Bordelon family.[Read: What the ‘Hollywood Jim Crow’ looks like today]Indeed, the Bordelons’ land is a character in the show. It is used to historicize the conflict between the family and their nemesis, the white Landry/Boudreaux family. The siblings learn late in Season 1 that their ancestors had been enslaved by the Landrys, and later were exploited as sharecroppers until they were able to buy the land during the Great Depression. Ever since, the clans have been warring over the property rights. Thus, viewers are forced to reflect on institutional racism and the vestiges of slavery. They also witness a multigenerational Black family using land to imagine a more democratic future, one where African American farmers can profit from their own labor. In the show’s vision, true inheritance isn’t just about accumulating wealth, it’s about love for community and mutual aid. Queen Sugar “is so born out of love, pure love, in my own heart for southern traditions, and southern ways, and southern value systems,” Oprah Winfrey, an executive producer on the show, told me. She explained that they were intentional about hiring New Orleans natives as supporting cast and crew members, whose own life experiences, growing up on Louisiana soil, could add texture to the storytelling.Season 6 ended with the Bordelons facing a major conflict: Should they accept the Landrys’ crooked deal to get the Bordelon family’s land back, or should they press forward with the other Black farmers on the co-op land deal that Ralph Angel and his wife, Darla, had proposed? Watching the Bordelon siblings confront this defining question will make for an intriguing final season. “There’s lots of little Easter eggs for the fans,” Season 7’s showrunner, Shaz Bennett, told me. As the Bordelon’s legacy unfolds on the screen, so does the show’s legacy. To see a Black, rural Louisiana family “given the care and treatment of a [Martin] Scorsese movie … just that alone, I think, is going to live a long time,” Bennett said. For now, as Season 7 takes off, longtime fans of the show can look forward to indulging in this last gift of Sugar.",

        "description": "Venice film festival: Florian Zeller’s follow-up to The Father features a tremendous performance from Hugh Jackman, as a divorced lawyer who agrees to look after his troubled offspringFlorian Zeller has already devastated audiences in 2020 with his movie The Father, based on his own stage play and adapted by Christopher Hampton, with Anthony Hopkins as the old man being cared for by his daughter played by Olivia Colman while he succumbs to the tragic endgame of dementia. Maybe the title of Zeller’s new film The Son – again from his own play with a Hampton screenplay – provides a kind of emotional rhyme or complement to that.The Son is a laceratingly painful drama, an incrementally increased agony without anaesthetic. At the centre of it, Hugh Jackman gives a performance of great dignity, presence and intelligence as Peter, a prosperous New York lawyer whose life is enviable: he is divorced (that situation being now amicable enough), remarried with a baby son, and on the verge of a political consultancy which might give him some sort of superstar future role in the White House.

During the leadership campaign she said she wanted to allow fracking, but only in areas where there was a clear public consensus in favour.On the Today programme this morning Lord Deben, the Tory peer who chairs the Committee for Climate Change, said fracking was not a solution to the UK’s energy problems. He explained:The price of gas is not affected by the relatively small amount that we can get, in addition to the North Sea or indeed from fracking.This is an international price and we would be paying the same price we got out of the fracked gas as we are for the gas we’re using now.

        "description": "Little Looie didn’t want to play a whole doubleheader on this day in 1970, but he ended up as part of a record, and losing, effort. | Louis Reqeuna/MLB via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Empty the bench, the South Siders are losing another doubleheader! 1954\nOne of the linchpins of the famed White Sox pitching staff of the late 1950’s, Dick Donovan, was purchased from Double-A Atlanta in the Milwaukee Braves organization. Dick would win 73 games over six seasons on the South Side, including a pair of one-hitters and an All-Star appearance in 1955.\n\n1960\nIn a game at Comiskey Park, infielder Sammy Esposito booted a cinch double-play ball hit by future Sox infielder Moose Skowron with the Sox leading in the eighth inning, 4-2. The lead quickly evaporated, as the Yankees rallied for four runs and a 6-4 win. \nFans Willie Harris and his friend, Jesse James (I swear, I’m not making the names up), had a wager on the game. When Esposito blew the ground ball, Harris took matters into his own hands. He jumped over the box seat railing, ran on to the field, and had words with Esposito. Then the two started throwing punches! It took several uniformed police officers and ushers to pull Harris off of Esposito. Harris left the field shouting that he was “A real Sox fan.”\n\n1970\nThe White Sox were swept by the A’s in a Monday doubleheader at Comiskey Park, in front of 6,115 fans. As the losses dropped Chicago to 49-92 on the season, the sweep was not remarkable. But what was? That with September’s expanded rosters, the Pale Hose used 13 players and five pitchers in the 7-4 opening loss, and 16 players and seven pitchers in the 7-5 nightcap loss. The 41 total players in a doubleheader set a major league record.\nCoincidentally, the White Sox played 20 doubleheaders in the 106-loss 1970 season, losing 13 of them and splitting seven — a 7-33 record in twin-bills alone! The team’s doubleheader winning percentage of .175 was roughly twice as bad as its overall .346 winning percentage. Or put another way, remove doubleheaders in 1970, and the White Sox played at a much-improved, 65-win pace.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3632542-how-to-dilute-political-polarization-at-the-sec/",
        "description": "A majority of commissioners on the Securities and Exchange Commission is rushing to regulate with a slate of intrusive and burdensome new rules. The minority commissioners have objected, but their pleas for restraint have not had a noticeable effect. A limited procedural reform is needed to restore balance.\n\n\n\nThe SEC and other major agencies have been reflecting the same partisanship and polarization that dominate national politics. Small majorities in Congress, when they have a president from the same party, too often favor partisan measures that barely pass, such as the recent $700 billion bill on health care, climate, and taxes, which needed a tiebreaking vote from the vice president in the Senate and passed on a party-line vote in the House.\n\n\n\nIn our sprawling country, rich with a broad spectrum of views, how can a massive bill pass without losing one vote of the proposing party or gaining one from the opposition party? Studies from political scientists do not adequately explain this or the inability of centrist politicians to compromise and build coalitions to serve a wider vision of the public interest.\n\n\n\nThis divisiveness rather than cooperation now exists at some federal agencies. The statute creating the SEC requires that the commissioners come from different political parties, with no more than three of the five from one party. The current majority commissioners have succumbed to the same winner-take-all approach seen in Congress.\n\n\n\nA recent example is the SEC’s broadside at the internal governance structure of&nbsp;clearing agencies. The SEC wants to obligate these back-office institutions that clear and settle securities trades to have a majority of independent directors, directors with a “diversity” of “perspectives,” and several board committees that comply with SEC standards. Both minority commissioners were unconvinced and dissented,&nbsp;one writing&nbsp;that the “proposal takes an overly prescriptive, regulator-knows-best approach to these matters.”\n\n\n\nThe SEC also acted on a partisan basis to propose extensive new disclosures about&nbsp;climate change&nbsp;and in July 2022 to rewrite the&nbsp;rules on proxy advisers&nbsp;that the SEC had just adopted in 2020.\n\n\n\nPartisan flip-flops and novel, sweeping regulatory regimes from a federal administrative agency are seldom good government and should be avoided. A procedural change at the SEC and possibly other agencies could help.\n\n\n\nFirst, require a supermajority vote for significant actions. The norm in multimember agencies is for approval by a simple majority. A supermajority requirement would be a simple majority plus one, or four votes in favor in the standard case at the SEC. “Significant” agency action would include major new regulations or repeals, decisions on enforcement cases, and final adjudications.\n\n\n\nThis would set up a formal incentive for consultation and compromise among the commissioners. The majority would need to incorporate features in a proposal to attract the vote of at least one other commissioner.\n\n\n\nSupermajority voting would honor the original theory for requiring an agency with several heads to come from different political parties. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, when he was a judge, explained that a&nbsp;multimember agency&nbsp;benefits from different points of view and fosters compromise and less extreme decisions.\n\n\n\nThe agency has worked this way in the past. Some SEC chairs have had an informal practice of bringing a matter to a vote only when it had the support of at least four commissioners. If this type of collegiality returns to Washington, a supermajority voting requirement could be lifted.\n\n\n\nAlthough supermajority voting is not unusual, it violates the democratic rule of simple majority and can lead to impasse in favor of the minority. Both parties have used the Senate cloture rule to block the majority’s priorities.\n\n\n\nSecond, to address those concerns, provide that falling short of a supermajority does not terminate a proposal and instead only delays final action. A major agency proposal not initially receiving a supermajority of votes could be reconsidered after a period of time — say one year — on only a simple majority vote. The calculation for the majority would be whether it can wait to pass the proposal or whether further consultations and amendments could produce a supermajority sooner.\n\n\n\nNo doubt, some would try to game a supermajority voting rule, but it should appeal to those tired of the adoption and repeal of regulations as partisan majorities shift. Good government from agencies should not be winner-take-all. It must promote the general welfare, not just the political majority.\n\n\n\nAndrew N.

        "description": "Former Attorney General William Barr said on Wednesday that he believes the Justice Department is “getting very close” to having enough evidence to indict former President Trump.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said on Fox News that government investigators need to consider if they will be able to make a “technical” case against Trump for his handling of sensitive documents the FBI found at his Mar-a-Lago home last month. \n\n\n\n“I think they’re getting very close to that point, frankly,” Barr said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said the other question to consider is whether to indict a former president, what it would do to the country and what precedent it would set.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Will the people really understand that this is not failing to return a library book, that this is serious? And so you have to worry about those things,” he said. \n\n\n\nBarr said he hopes those factors will lead the Justice Department (DOJ) to not indict Trump, but added the department will be under pressure to do so. \n\n\n\nA federal judge approved Trump’s request to appoint a special master to review the documents seized from his Florida estate last month. The special master will be tasked with determining if any documents taken are protected by attorney-client or executive privilege. \n\n\n\nBarr said documents protected by attorney-client privilege should be returned to Trump. He noted the FBI had a right to take those documents initially as they would not have looked through them page-by-page during the search. \n\n\n\nHe said “there is no scenario” under the law in which the government documents, some of which are classified, should be returned to Trump.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If it deals with government stuff, it goes back to the government,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBarr said investigators are also allowed to take and keep personal items of Trump’s if it is evidence of the way the government documents were stored.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If you find very sensitive documents in Trump's desk along with his passports, that ties Trump to those documents,” he said. \n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Barr said a federal judge’s order to appoint a special master to review the documents was “deeply flawed”.\n\n\n\n“The opinion was wrong, and I think the government should appeal it,” Barr said on Fox News. “It’s deeply flawed in a number of ways. I don’t think the appointment of a special master is going to hold up, but even if it does, I don’t see it fundamentally changing the trajectory” of the case.",

        "description": "NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg penned an op-ed that was published in the Financial Times on Wednesday insisting that although Europeans will face rising energy costs this winter after levying sanctions against Russia, the continent has a “moral responsibility” to support Ukraine.\n\n\n\n“There are tough times ahead, but we have faced tough times together before,” Stoltenberg wrote. “The cost of not standing up for our values is always greater. For Ukraine’s future and for ours, we must prepare for the winter war and stay the course.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the same time, Stoltenberg acknowledged a “difficult six months” ahead, noting threats of energy cuts, disruptions and potentially civil unrest as the sanctions’ impacts hit NATO and European Union (EU) countries at home.\n\n\n\n“We do pay a price for our support to Ukraine,” he wrote. “But the price we pay is counted in dollars, euros and pounds, while Ukrainians are paying with their lives.”\n\n\n\nEurope is attempting to wean itself off Russian energy supplies in the wake of the country’s invasion of Ukraine, which has already hiked energy prices for residents and businesses that could soar even higher as temperatures cool with winter approaching.\n\n\n\nIn 2019, Russia provided roughly 27 percent of crude oil, 47 percent of coal and 41 percent of natural gas imported by the EU.\n\n\n\nOn Friday, Russian state-owned energy company Gazprom announced it was delaying exporting natural gas to Germany through the Nord Stream 1 pipeline, blaming an oil leak that could not be fixed due to current sanctions against Russia.\n\n\n\nThe move came as the Group of Seven agreed to a price cap on Russian oil. Europe has already banned Russian coal and will halt most Russian oil imports at near the end of the year.\n\n\n\n“Above all, technology sanctions are severely limiting Russia’s access to the advanced semiconductors and chips it needs to power its automotive industry, aircraft and war effort,” Stoltenberg wrote on Wednesday. “Our nations are seizing this opportunity to diversify our economies and energy supplies, strengthen our resilience and break free of Russia’s energy blackmail for good.”\n\n\n\nBut those shifts have led to domestic problems for political leaders across Europe. High inflation across the continent, in part driven by the surge in energy prices, has become a hot-button political issue.\n\n\n\nIn the United Kingdom, annual energy bills for the average household have already risen by 54 percent this year, and consumers will see another hike in October that brings the increase to roughly 80 percent. On her first day as British prime minister on Tuesday, Liz Truss vowed to tackle the country’s energy crisis.\n\n\n\nStoltenberg on Wednesday noted those mounting problems but said Europeans have “a choice to make about the world we want to live in.”\n\n\n\n“All of us will pay a much higher price if Russia and other authoritarian regimes believe they can invade their neighbours and trample on international law with impunity,” he said.&nbsp;“If Russia stops fighting, there will be peace,” Stoltenbeg continued. “If Ukraine stops fighting, it will cease to exist as an independent nation. We have a moral responsibility to support this independent democracy at the heart of Europe.”",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;Much of California has been hit with triple-digit temperatures since the heat wave kicked off just before Labor Day weekend.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe severe September heat wave prompted state energy officials to call on residents to limit their electricity use to avoid rotating power outages.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTemperatures are forecast to remain well above average for many regions through Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA brutal September heat wave continues to bake large parts of California, bringing&nbsp; record-breaking temperatures, threats of blackouts and increased risk of fire danger to the state plagued by drought.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMuch of California has been hit with triple-digit temperatures since the heat wave kicked off just before Labor Day weekend, with a series of high-temperature records being broken in cities from California’s Bay Area to those south of Los Angeles.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe severe September heat wave prompted state energy officials to call on residents to limit their electricity use to avoid rotating power outages. California’s power grid operator issued an emergency alert Tuesday as the grid struggled to keep up with surging power demand, but said later in the evening that widespread blackouts were avoided across the state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe heat wave was anticipated to peak Tuesday, but temperatures are now forecast to remain well above average for many regions through Friday.\n\n\n\nRecord-breaking heat\n\n\n\nLong-standing daily and all-time records were shattered in cities across California over the past several days. Sacramento hit 116 degrees Fahrenheit for the first time ever, surpassing a 97-year-old record of 114 degrees previously set on July 17, 1925, according to the National Weather Service. Stockton reached 115 degrees, tying the city’s previous all-time record set in 2006. San Francisco was just a few degrees shy of breaking 100 degrees.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the Bay Area, San Jose, Santa Rosa, Livermore, Redwood City, King City and Napa also experienced all-time record high temperatures. San Jose had a high of 109 degrees Tuesday, beating the old record of 108 degrees set in 2017. Santa Rosa hit 115 degrees, breaking a record set in 1913, and Napa had a high of 114 degrees. Both Livermore and King City reached 116 degrees.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the Los Angeles area, both Burbank and Long Beach set daily records Sunday. Burbank hit 110 degrees while Long Beach Airport marked a high of 109 degrees. Newport Beach broke its all-time high temperature record of 96 degrees Sunday at 97 degrees.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRisk of power outages\n\n\n\nCalifornia narrowly managed to avert rolling blackouts Tuesday as electricity use climbed and excessive heat taxed the state’s power supply.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe California Independent System Operator (ISO), the entity that oversees California’s electrical grid, warned there could be “rotating power outages” Tuesday evening as energy supplies appeared to be insufficient to “cover demand and reserves.” ISO reported statewide power demand hit 52,061 megawatts, a record for the state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ISO upgraded its Energy Emergency Alert level from 2 to 3, enabling the grid operator to order rotating power outages to lower demand and stabilize the grid if necessary. By 8 p.m. local time, ISO reported the alert level 3 had been lifted without any rotating power outages, due to Californians heeding the warning and conserving power. Residents were asked by utilities to keep thermostats at 78 degrees or higher, to avoid using major appliances or charging electric vehicles. Pacific Gas and Electric Company, a utility that provides power to large parts of Northern and Central California, warned some 525,000 customers of possible blackouts lasting 1 to 2 hours.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile no rotating blackouts were needed, tens of thousands of people found themselves without power in Northern California, including in Silicon Valley and southern and inland areas of the San Francisco Bay area. Most of the outages were heat-related. By Wednesday morning, about 20,000 people were without power, according to Power Outage.US.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs high temperatures are expected to continue through the next few days, the state is urging residents to continue conserving electricity. California has been under a statewide alert for energy conservation for more than a week.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Thank you to everyone who saved power - coming together to keep the lights on for each other is the California way,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office tweeted Tuesday night.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“But, we aren't out of the woods yet. We will see continued extreme temps this week and if we rallied today, we can do it again.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWildfire threat\n\n\n\nAs California’s power grid faces a major stress test, low humidity and high temperatures are increasing the risk for wildfires across the Golden State.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than 4,000 firefighters are battling 14 large fires around the state, Anale Burlew, a deputy chief with the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection said, according to The Associated Press. At least 45 new fires were started on Sunday alone.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Fairview Fire in Riverside County in Southern California killed two people and left one injured. The blaze was sparked Monday and has burned 4,500 acres, prompting evacuations. As of Wednesday the fire is just 5 percent contained, according to Cal Fire.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHurricane Kay\n\n\n\nA hurricane currently moving northward toward the Baja California Peninsula is expected to make the horrendous heat wave in Southern California worse.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHurricane Kay is currently tracking along Mexico’s Pacific Coast and could bring heavy rain and flash flooding across the Baja California peninsula and parts of mainland northwestern Mexico through Saturday.\n\n\n\nHurricane conditions are expected along parts of the west-central Baja California coast on Thursday and a hurricane warning is in place for that area.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe hurricane is forecast to come within 220 miles south of San Diego Friday and could bring easterly winds to the area, which is likely to prolong extreme heat the region has been dealing with for more than a week.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s a complicated high temperature forecast for Friday for the coast and valleys,” the National Weather Service in San Diego said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Strengthening east winds between high pressure to the north and tropical system to the south bring downslope warming while moisture and clouds increasing from the south could offset the warming.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe weather service in San Diego has extended its excessive heat warning for the region through Friday. The Los Angeles National Weather Service also expects dangerous heat to continue into Friday, with highs up to 95 along the coast and triple digits further inland.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore heat waves in the future\n\n\n\nAs it’s been a summer of record-setting heat across the U.S., severe heat waves like the one in California aren’t expected to slow down anytime soon.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHeat waves are occurring more often and with more intensity than they used to in major U.S. cities. The frequency of heat waves has increased steadily, from an average of two per year during the 1960s to six per year during the 2010s and 2020s, according to data from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe average duration of heat waves is currently about four days, about a day longer than the average heat wave in the sixties. California’s current heat wave will drag on for more than a week.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJust last month, a new heat model from the climate-focused nonprofit group First Street Foundation showed heat waves in California and most of the U.S. over the next three decades could be longer, hotter and more frequent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe report found all areas of California will continue to see increases in the number of “Local Hot Days,” defined as days at or above the 98th percentile heat index temperature, over the next 30 years. Orange County will face the largest increase in hot days, with an estimated 22 days at or above 90.5 degrees Fahrenheit each year by 2053. Los Angeles County is expected to have 21 days per year exceeding 93 degrees by that time, while Imperial, Riverside and Fresno counties will also see significant increases in hot days.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCounties in Southern California are also expected to see a significant increase in the number of days with a heat index exceeding 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Imperial County, which currently has 102 days out of the year exceeding 100, is forecast to have 116 days with a heat index above 100 degrees by the 2050s.&nbsp;",

There’s no Mini option this year, so your options are big or bigger. The US models of the iPhone 14 also do away with the physical SIM tray, going all-in on eSIM. The standard iPhone 14 model starts at $799, and the 14 Plus starts at $899. Preorders will start September 9th; the standard 14 ships on September 16th, and the 14 Plus arrives later on October 7th.\nBoth models support Emergency SOS, the much-rumored emergency messaging via communication satellites when you’re out of range of a cell signal.

Off the canvas, they and their peers might be disproportionately policed, detained and vilified – but in Presley’s work they stand triumphant, heads wreathed in golden flames like avenging saints, standing tall over the instruments of state and colony.In One Day This Will All Be Yours (2022), a young mother holding a baby points a stun gun at three white policemen, composed in a way that recalls the symmetry of Renaissance depictions of the Transfiguration of Jesus. In Crown Land (Till the Ends of the Earth) (2020) another woman channels Saint George and the Dragon as she sits astride a magnificent horse, wielding a machete against a chimera with the heads of a snake, paws of a lion, and a judge’s wig.

On the eve of a new exhibition, the artist talks colour visions and anime obsessionsA corrugated metal door rattles open and Jadé Fadojutimi appears. She welcomes me inside, as the sun beats down on the south London industrial estate where she keeps a studio. An extremely stylish dresser, who often poses on Instagram in an outfit coordinated with her paintings, the artist is today wearing a neon yellow top and multicoloured shorts, with her nails painted green, red and teal – all part of her oeuvre, she explains, since “anything that creates a composition is a painting”. Spirit, an ambient album by Atom Music Audio, booms from the speakers. Two rococo settees sit either side of a table bearing a bottle of sake, surrounded by an extravagant display of pot plants. And propped against the walls are her enormous, immersive, gloriously colourful new paintings, destined for Hepworth Wakefield in Yorkshire this month.The show, she explains, is called Can We See the Colour Green Because We Have a Name For It? The title was inspired by a book by Peter Wohlleben called The Heartbeat of Trees, “about our senses and relationships to colour and how where you grow up kind of determines the colours you can see and your colour sensitivity”. Fadojutimi believes she has synaesthesia (although “there’s no test for it”), where other forms of stimulation bring on visions of colour. “I’m not one of those people who reads and then the words change colour, but when I feel emotion, I see a colour and that’s how my paintings come to life.” Continue reading...",

Watts notes not only where the words come from but some of the fascinating idiosyncrasies behind the naming of the hues.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFind out the etymologies of black, white, gray, blue, brown, green, orange, purples, pink, red and yellow &#8211; from their origins thousands of years ago, through Old English and into the present day.\n\n\n\nWatts previously addressed the two different spellings of the specific word for these different shades.\n\n\n\n&#8230;. In the United States of America, fellow stern-faced dictionary peddler Noah Webster was coming up with a shiny new version of English to go with his shiny new nation that had just become independent from Britain. When he wrote his Compendious Dictionary of the English Language he made lots of little tweaks to make American English different to British English. One of the changes he made was to get rid of any letters that he saw as unnecessary.",

        "description": "On the not-so-infrequent nights when I’m plagued by insomnia, no combination of melatonin, weighted blankets, and white noise will do. Just one cure for my affliction exists: my cat Calvin, lying atop my shoulder, lulling me to sleep with his purrs.For veteran members of Club Purr, the reasons are clear. A purr is warm tea, a roaring fire, and fresh-out-of-the-oven cookies, all rolled into a fleece-lined hug; it is the auditory salve of a babbling brook; it is coffee brewing at dawn. It is emotional gratification incarnate—a sign that “we’ve made our pets happy,” which just feels darn good, says Wailani Sung, a veterinary behaviorist at the San Francisco SPCA.But purrs—one of the most recognizable sounds in the animal kingdom—are also one of the most mysterious. “No one, still, knows how purring is actually done,” says Robert Eklund, a phonetician and linguist at Linköping University, in Sweden. Nor can experts say, exactly, what purring means. Cats purr when they’re happy—but also sometimes when they’re anxious or afraid, when they’re in labor, even when they’re about to die. Cats are perhaps the most inscrutable creatures humans welcome into our homes, and purring might be the most inscrutable sound they make.There is, at least, some consensus on what purring is. In the strictest sense, the sound is a rhythmic, rumbly percolation that’s produced during both exhales—as is the case with most typical animal vocalizations—and inhales, with no interruptions between. Purrers also run their motor with their mouths entirely closed, like little feline ventriloquists; the sound simply springs out of the body at a frequency that roughly spans the range between 20 and 150 Hertz. Back in the 1960s, one scientist posited that purring was the product of blood percolating through the vena cava, a vessel that returns the body’s blood to the heart; that notion was later disproved. Now it’s generally understood that the source is the voice box: The brain pings electric signals to the vocal folds, prompting them to flutter open and shut like little muscular doors.[Read: Pay no attention to that cat inside a box]Lots of animals can imitate the sound of purring, among them bears and guinea pigs. But only a small number of creatures can cook up a bona fide version of the burbly noise: In addition to house cats, genets—little cat look-alikes native to Africa—can do it; so can lynx, ocelots, and dozens of other smaller members of the felid family. Eklund recounted for me how one captive cheetah, named Caine, emitted booming purrs from “the second he woke up to the second he fell asleep,” he told me. But lions, tigers, and jaguars can’t rouse the same rasps; scientists have not documented any cats that can both purr and roar. Scientists can’t say for certain what separates the purrs from the purr-nots. It may have something to do with the length, shape, or thickness of certain species’ voice box, or the tissue architecture that surrounds it; or perhaps it’s the squishiness of their hyoid, a U-shaped bone suspended in the throat. Or maybe not. Purring isn’t easy to study: Felines aren’t usually keen on producing the sound around researchers in labs.Whatever its mechanical basis, purring seems hardwired into certain cats from birth. They start revving their little locomotor engines within days of exiting the womb, while still blind and deaf. Kittens and mothers seem to exchange the sounds as a form of early communication, swapping essential messages such as I’m hungry and Hey, here comes Mom, says Hazel Carney, a cat veterinarian and purr expert based in Idaho, where she also cares for her own three cats—Wyatt Earp, Calamity Jane, and Hi Ho Silver. Those early, positive associations might be part of why purring sticks around through adulthood, reappearing whenever cats get content—curling up with their favorite humans, say, or chowing down on an especially tasty snack. Zazie Todd, an animal-behavior expert and the author of the book Purr: The Science of Making Your Cat Happy, told me that one of her cats, Harley, will sometimes rumble the moment Todd walks into a room, which is “really lovely.” For other felines, Sung told me, mere eye contact with a beloved human may be all it takes to get that engine going.TheAtlantic · Purring genet (Courtesy of Robert Eklund, Gustav Peters, Chris Wemmer)But the gears of purring can also turn under some far less cheery circumstances. Mikel Delgado, a feline-behavior expert in California, told me she once had a cat that would purr at the vet. Sung has even heard the noise while inserting a catheter into a patient. Scientists can only speculate about what’s going on. Carney told me that in some animals, purring could be a sort of vocal tic, like nervous laughter; cats might also be trying to send out pleas for help or warning messages to anyone who might dare approach. Or maybe bad-times purrs are self-soothing, says Jill Caviness, a veterinarian and cat expert at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and parent to a feline named Electron. They could even be a cat’s attempt to dupe its pain-racked body into a less stressed state.[Read: Cat owners can (almost) all agree on one thing]In the early aughts, a researcher proposed that purring might even have palliative properties for cats—pinging out vibratory frequencies that could, for instance, speed the healing of wounds or broken bones. The thought isn’t totally bonkers, Eklund told me. Vibratory therapy has shown some promise in animals such as rabbits; even NASA once pursued it, hoping to stave off or even reverse bone loss in astronauts headed for long stints in space. Carney has had plenty of clients who “swear that the cats lying in bed, purring beside them while they were ill, kept them from passing away,” she told me. But alas: Although cats can purr at frequencies that overlap with those used in vibration therapy, none of the research on these treatments has actually involved felines. “I don’t think we have any studies that are like, I sat with a purring cat on my broken leg for 15 minutes a day; I healed more rapidly than someone else,” Caviness told me; the same goes for the effects of purrs on the purrer. Carney’s more open to the healing idea, though she, too, admits: If people feel better around their cats, that might be less about purring’s direct mechanical effects on human tissues, and more about the entire companion animal being a psychological balm.TheAtlantic · Purring serval (Courtesy of Robert Eklund)With cat communication now undergoing a bit of a research boom, Eklund told me—new papers on the subject appear “basically every week”—purring is perhaps less perplexing than it’s ever been. But among its cat-vocalization cousins, its rumbles can still be unusually difficult to parse, not least because, across contexts, purrs just sound so similar. Meows can also be a bit cryptic, but they have more discernible logic: It’s not so difficult to parse Calvin’s Feed me; I am legitimately starving mewl from his Why am I in this cat carrier? yowl. Carney, who’s spent years listening to purrs of all sorts, told me that such differences may exist with purrs too: Contented rumbles tend to be more melodious and lower, while anxious revs trend higher and harsher. And one study, from a few years ago, suggested that humans could pick out their pet’s “solicitation” purrs—an urgent, pitchy sound that cats emit when seeking a meal—from other purrs that they made on the regular. But differences like those are very hard to pick out, especially in unfamiliar cats; even Caviness’s veterinary students can’t tell them apart in the clinic, she said.[Read: Why we think cats are psychopaths]And unlike many other cat noises, purrs stubbornly elude human imitation (though some people on YouTube might beg to differ). Humans can easily meow back at their cats; “it’s like a very rudimentary pidgin language,” Eklund said. But purring? Our brains and throats just aren’t set up for the stuff. Which, to me, is a soft tragedy: The rumbles of my two cats, Calvin and Hobbes, are missives of love, of joy, of bliss; they are tactile and auditory feedback to my touch. They are a token of affection I can receive, but cannot send back.Certain devices and soundtracks can offer substitutes. Some vet clinics play cat music in exam rooms, with a calming purr bass track; Delgado mentioned that a shelter she used to work at purchased surrogate nursing machines for orphaned kittens, which could be outfitted with a synthetic purr. Purr enthusiasts can even put on a podcast of an orange cat from Ireland named Bilbo purring for 30 minutes straight.Purring is a language barrier we have yet to surmount. Which, in some ways, is so, so cat. Humans have spent generations breeding dogs to emote in very people-esque ways, using their soulful eyes and slobbery, smiley mouths. Cats, though, continue to thrive on subtlety; their mugs aren’t evolutionarily set up for obvious expressions, defaulting instead to “resting cat face.” Even compared with other cat vocalizations, purring is subtle and intimate, a form of communication that hinges on proximity, on closeness, on understanding a cat’s wants and needs—and maybe, sometimes, on them understanding ours.​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

        "description": "On the not-so-infrequent nights when I’m plagued by insomnia, no combination of melatonin, weighted blankets, and white noise will do. Just one cure for my affliction exists: my cat Calvin, lying atop my shoulder, lulling me to sleep with his purrs.For veteran members of Club Purr, the reasons are clear. A purr is warm tea, a roaring fire, and fresh-out-of-the-oven cookies, all rolled into a fleece-lined hug; it is the auditory salve of a babbling brook; it is coffee brewing at dawn. It is emotional gratification incarnate—a sign that “we’ve made our pets happy,” which just feels darn good, says Wailani Sung, a veterinary behaviorist at the San Francisco SPCA.But purrs—one of the most recognizable sounds in the animal kingdom—are also one of the most mysterious. “No one, still, knows how purring is actually done,” says Robert Eklund, a phonetician and linguist at Linköping University, in Sweden. Nor can experts say, exactly, what purring means. Cats purr when they’re happy—but also sometimes when they’re anxious or afraid, when they’re in labor, even when they’re about to die. Cats are perhaps the most inscrutable creatures humans welcome into our homes, and purring might be the most inscrutable sound they make.There is, at least, some consensus on what purring is. In the strictest sense, the sound is a rhythmic, rumbly percolation that’s produced during both exhales—as is the case with most typical animal vocalizations—and inhales, with no interruptions between. Purrers also run their motor with their mouths entirely closed, like little feline ventriloquists; the sound simply springs out of the body at a frequency that roughly spans the range between 20 and 150 Hertz. Back in the 1960s, one scientist posited that purring was the product of blood percolating through the vena cava, a vessel that returns the body’s blood to the heart; that notion was later disproved. Now it’s generally understood that the source is the voice box: The brain pings electric signals to the vocal folds, prompting them to flutter open and shut like little muscular doors.[Read: Pay no attention to that cat inside a box]Lots of animals can imitate the sound of purring, among them bears and guinea pigs. But only a small number of creatures can cook up a bona fide version of the burbly noise: In addition to house cats, genets—little cat look-alikes native to Africa—can do it; so can lynx, ocelots, and dozens of other smaller members of the felid family. Eklund recounted for me how one captive cheetah, named Caine, emitted booming purrs from “the second he woke up to the second he fell asleep,” he told me. But lions, tigers, and jaguars can’t rouse the same rasps; scientists have not documented any cats that can both purr and roar. Scientists can’t say for certain what separates the purrs from the purr-nots. It may have something to do with the length, shape, or thickness of certain species’ voice box, or the tissue architecture that surrounds it; or perhaps it’s the squishiness of their hyoid, a U-shaped bone suspended in the throat. Or maybe not. Purring isn’t easy to study: Felines aren’t usually keen on producing the sound around researchers in labs.Whatever its mechanical basis, purring seems hardwired into certain cats from birth. They start revving their little locomotor engines within days of exiting the womb, while still blind and deaf. Kittens and mothers seem to exchange the sounds as a form of early communication, swapping essential messages such as I’m hungry and Hey, here comes Mom, says Hazel Carney, a cat veterinarian and purr expert based in Idaho, where she also cares for her own three cats—Wyatt Earp, Calamity Jane, and Hi Ho Silver. Those early, positive associations might be part of why purring sticks around through adulthood, reappearing whenever cats get content—curling up with their favorite humans, say, or chowing down on an especially tasty snack. Zazie Todd, an animal-behavior expert and the author of the book Purr: The Science of Making Your Cat Happy, told me that one of her cats, Harley, will sometimes rumble the moment Todd walks into a room, which is “really lovely.” For other felines, Sung told me, mere eye contact with a beloved human may be all it takes to get that engine going.TheAtlantic · Purring genet (Courtesy of Robert Eklund, Gustav Peters, Chris Wemmer)But the gears of purring can also turn under some far less cheery circumstances. Mikel Delgado, a feline-behavior expert in California, told me she once had a cat that would purr at the vet. Sung has even heard the noise while inserting a catheter into a patient. Scientists can only speculate about what’s going on. Carney told me that in some animals, purring could be a sort of vocal tic, like nervous laughter; cats might also be trying to send out pleas for help or warning messages to anyone who might dare approach. Or maybe bad-times purrs are self-soothing, says Jill Caviness, a veterinarian and cat expert at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and parent to a feline named Electron. They could even be a cat’s attempt to dupe its pain-racked body into a less stressed state.[Read: Cat owners can (almost) all agree on one thing]In the early aughts, a researcher proposed that purring might even have palliative properties for cats—pinging out vibratory frequencies that could, for instance, speed the healing of wounds or broken bones. The thought isn’t totally bonkers, Eklund told me. Vibratory therapy has shown some promise in animals such as rabbits; even NASA once pursued it, hoping to stave off or even reverse bone loss in astronauts headed for long stints in space. Carney has had plenty of clients who “swear that the cats lying in bed, purring beside them while they were ill, kept them from passing away,” she told me. But alas: Although cats can purr at frequencies that overlap with those used in vibration therapy, none of the research on these treatments has actually involved felines. “I don’t think we have any studies that are like, I sat with a purring cat on my broken leg for 15 minutes a day; I healed more rapidly than someone else,” Caviness told me; the same goes for the effects of purrs on the purrer. Carney’s more open to the healing idea, though she, too, admits: If people feel better around their cats, that might be less about purring’s direct mechanical effects on human tissues, and more about the entire companion animal being a psychological balm.TheAtlantic · Purring serval (Courtesy of Robert Eklund)With cat communication now undergoing a bit of a research boom, Eklund told me—new papers on the subject appear “basically every week”—purring is perhaps less perplexing than it’s ever been. But among its cat-vocalization cousins, its rumbles can still be unusually difficult to parse, not least because, across contexts, purrs just sound so similar. Meows can also be a bit cryptic, but they have more discernible logic: It’s not so difficult to parse Calvin’s Feed me; I am legitimately starving mewl from his Why am I in this cat carrier? yowl. Carney, who’s spent years listening to purrs of all sorts, told me that such differences may exist with purrs too: Contented rumbles tend to be more melodious and lower, while anxious revs trend higher and harsher. And one study, from a few years ago, suggested that humans could pick out their pet’s “solicitation” purrs—an urgent, pitchy sound that cats emit when seeking a meal—from other purrs that they made on the regular. But differences like those are very hard to pick out, especially in unfamiliar cats; even Caviness’s veterinary students can’t tell them apart in the clinic, she said.[Read: Why we think cats are psychopaths]And unlike many other cat noises, purrs stubbornly elude human imitation (though some people on YouTube might beg to differ). Humans can easily meow back at their cats; “it’s like a very rudimentary pidgin language,” Eklund said. But purring? Our brains and throats just aren’t set up for the stuff. Which, to me, is a soft tragedy: The rumbles of my two cats, Calvin and Hobbes, are missives of love, of joy, of bliss; they are tactile and auditory feedback to my touch. They are a token of affection I can receive, but cannot send back.Certain devices and soundtracks can offer substitutes. Some vet clinics play cat music in exam rooms, with a calming purr bass track; Delgado mentioned that a shelter she used to work at purchased surrogate nursing machines for orphaned kittens, which could be outfitted with a synthetic purr. Purr enthusiasts can even put on a podcast of an orange cat from Ireland named Bilbo purring for 30 minutes straight.Purring is a language barrier we have yet to surmount. Which, in some ways, is so, so cat. Humans have spent generations breeding dogs to emote in very people-esque ways, using their soulful eyes and slobbery, smiley mouths. Cats, though, continue to thrive on subtlety; their mugs aren’t evolutionarily set up for obvious expressions, defaulting instead to “resting cat face.” Even compared with other cat vocalizations, purring is subtle and intimate, a form of communication that hinges on proximity, on closeness, on understanding a cat’s wants and needs—and maybe, sometimes, on them understanding ours.​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

        "description": "Logan Glass shatters his line after a good week. | Kannapolis Cannon Ballers\n    \n\n  Some unlikely names stood out among our best of the week \n\nLogan Glass hits his 6th HR of the year.  #Ballers tied at 1. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/2wddlzc5QV— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nSometimes, one of the non-top prospects has a really good week that is impossible to ignore. Logan Glass had that type of week. He only played in three games for Kannapolis, but he was hitting everything, and most of the time hitting pitches very far. He went 7-for-12 over his three games, with three homers, and he even stole a base for show. Glass was a high school pick from the 2019 draft, and it seems like with White Sox prospects, younger guys really struggled in 2021 after losing the 2020 season. Glass was no exception, with a 58 wRC+ in the ACL. He has been better this year (90 wRC+) based more off of power (.194 ISO) than total hitting skills (.188 batting average). He got a cup of coffee in Triple-A because of injury, and of course he did not do well (50% strikeout rate). He is still young with pop that is enticing, but a 40% strikeout rate in Low-A is not going to cut it. It really is swing or miss for Glass, and this is the type of week shows you his potential when he actually hits the ball.\nKannapolis Cannon Ballers\nJordan Sprinkle: .238/.304/.286 — 2 BB, 5 K, 3 R, 4 SB (4th round pick, $452,900 bonus)Jacob Burke: .421/.522/.632 — 1 BB, 5 K, 4 R, 3 RBI, 1 SB (11th round pick, $225,000 bonus)Brooks Baldwin: .192/.250/.269 — 2 BB, 4 K, 3 R, 2 RBI (12th round pick, $125,000 bonus)Logan Glass: .700/.750/1.700 — 3 HR, 2 BB, 3 K, 6 R, 6 RBI, 1 SB **Weekly MVP**Shane Murphy: 2 IP, 0.00 ERA, 0 BB, 1 K (14th round pick, $125,000 bonus)Jonathan Cannon: 2 IP, 0.00 ERA, 1 BB, 0 K (3rd round pick, $925,000 bonus)Billy Seidl: 2 IP, 0.00 ERA, 1 BB, 4 K (15th round pick, $100,000 bonus)Eric Adler: 1⁄3 IP, 54.00 ERA, 3 BB, 0 K (6th round pick, $200,000 bonus)\n\nCharlotte Knights\nLenyn Sosa: .391/.440/.565 — 1 HR, 2 BB, 4 K, 3 R, 5 RBITyler Neslony: .467/.500/.933 — 2 HR, 1 BB, 4 K, 3 R, 3 RBI, 1 SB **Weekly MVP**Yolbert Sánchez: .235/.235/.353 — 0 BB, 2 K, 3 RBI Jason Bilous: 2 2⁄3 IP, 16.87 ERA, 3 BB, 3 KKade McClure: 3 IP, 0.00 ERA, 1 BB, 5 K\n\n\nTyler Neslony goes YARD!!!   pic.twitter.com/mA6OcAMUa8— Charlotte Knights (@KnightsBaseball) September 1, 2022\n\n\n\nIf you take out Tyler Neslony’s awful first week, he has been an above-average hitter and he keeps getting better as his season goes on in Triple-A. After not playing since mid-August, Neslony came back last week and provided immediate help to a lackluster team. He finished the week with a 272 wRC+, because every number was fantastic. He reached base 50% of the time and provided outrageous power, with a .467 ISO. After being in Double-A for almost five seasons, Nelsony finally got his shot in Triple-A with Charlotte, and it was concerning to start. He had a -15 wRC+ that first week but a 111 since then. He is still not walking as much as he had with Birmingham the past couple of years and the strikeouts are up overall, but at least the strikeout rate is falling as Nelsony gets more Triple-A at-bats under his belt. It is a good story and if that bat keeps going, maybe he gets in an MLB game at some point.\n\nBirmingham Barons\nYoelqui Céspedes: .280/.333/.480 — 1 HR, 1 BB, 10 K, 2 R, 4 RBI, 2 SB Oscar Colás: .214/.214/.464 — 2 HR, 0 BB, 8 K, 4 R, 4 RBI Sean Burke: 3 2⁄3 IP, 4.91 ERA, 1 BB, 9 KMatthew Thompson: (Did not play last week)Caleb Freeman: 1 IP, 0.00 ERA, 0 BB, 2 K\nProject Birmingham\nBryan Ramos: .300/.364/.600 — 1 HR, 2 BB, 3 K, 3 R, 3 RBIColson Montgomery: .167/.167/.167 — 0 BB, 3 KLuis Míeses: .192/.250/.346 — 1 HR, 1 BB, 6 K, 3 R, 3 RBIDuke Ellis: .333/.500/.833 — 1 HR, 1 BB, 2 K, 3 R, 2 SBWes Kath: .000/.188/.000 — 2 BB, 8 K Wilfred Veras: .333/.385/.750 — 1 HR, 1 BB, 3 K, 2 R, 2 RBI **Weekly MVP**Jared Kelley: 4 IP, 6.75 ERA, 0 BB, 6 KKohl Simas: 2 1⁄3 IP, 11.57 ERA, 1 BB, 1 KNorge Vera: 2 2⁄3 IP, 10.12 ERA, 4 BB, 4 KDrew Dalquist: 4 IP, 0.00 ERA, 3 BB, 2 KCristian Mena: 4 IP, 6.75 ERA, 0 BB, 4 K\n\n\nWilfred Veras drives one up and out for his first #Barons HR.

In the 9th Colas scores on a balk to push to extras. #WhiteSox pic.twitter.com/8CebTzjncu— White Sox Daily (@dailywhitesox) September 5, 2022\n\n\n\nBecause Logan Glass won player of the week with three games played, we cannot ignore what Wilfred Veras did in his three. If Glass was not as good, maybe Bryan Ramos wins with his six games played. Alas, they did have the same number of homers and Veras did get on base more and showed more power. Ramos had three extra-base hits compared to the one single — kind of an odd stat line. The best part of Veras’ six games in Birmingham is the K-rate is lower than his Low-A rate. It is very early, he only has six games played there, but he is doing much better than fellow Low-A call-up, Wes Kath. \n\nWinston-Salem Dash\nCaberea Weaver: .375/.500/.750 — 1 HR, 4 BB, 5 K, 5 R, 6 RBI **Weekly MVP**\nAgain, all of the top prospects in Winston-Salem are gone but there are always going to be guys that have great weeks. This past week, it was down to Hunter Dollander, who threw six shutout innings, and the winner, Caberea Weaver. Like Glass, Weaver was a high school draft pick that had some potential but has lost that shine over his career. His first stint in rookie ball was good, with a 112 wRC+, but there were warning signs of a high K-rate and low power numbers. Those have both plagued him since 2018 and into this year. So far, even with a week of 1.250 OPS under his belt, he has a 39 wRC+ in High-A. That is off of an ISO just under .100 and a near 40% K-rate. To make it worse, he is 40 points under the Mendoza Line.",

Just minutes before first pitch, the Pirates made a move many thought would potentially come days or weeks ago.\nPittsburgh designated utility man Josh VanMeter for assignment Wednesday afternoon before the first of two games against the New York Mets.\nFellow utility player Hoy Park was recalled in a corresponding move. Park has seen action in 22 MLB games with the Pirates this year, hitting .220 with two home runs, six RBI, and a stolen base. \nPark slashed .236/.342/.386, mashing 10 home runs while bringing in 34 runs in 78 games with Triple-A Indianapolis. \nLeft-handed reliever Eric Stout was also recalled to serve as the 29th man for the doubleheader. \nVanMeter took on a variety of roles for the Bucs in 2022.

VanMeter recorded three homers, 14 RBI, and a .558 OPS for Derek Shelton’s club.\nHe found playing time at all three bases, the outfield, as well as emergency catcher and pitcher. It’s safe to say VanMeter wore multiple different hats in his time as a Pirate but could not rely on consistent at-bats and solid defense to stick around.\nVanMeter’s -1.1 WAR is a tall tale sign of his overall struggles, committing four errors at both first and second base. \nHis departure further opens the door for younger players to earn playing time after previously being blocked.\nThe Pirates have 26 games remaining on their 2022 schedule following Wednesday’s doubleheader at PNC Park.",

        "description": "Photo by Dustin Bradford/Icon Sportswire via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Can the Rockies carry over the momentum from Tuesday’s walk-off win? The Rockies earned their fourth walk-off win of the season on Tuesday night thanks to four homers, most notably, two from Randal Grichuk. The win gave the Rockies something to celebrate and fans something to cheer for, which have been in short supply this season. \nToday when the Rockies finish their three-game series with Milwaukee, they will not only be looking to earn the series win, but do something they haven’t yet done this season: win the next game following a walk-off win. \nThe Rockies first walk-off came on June 1 against the Marlins (thanks to a Brendan Rodgers home in the 10th), but Colorado lost the next day to Atlanta. The second came on July 27 against the White Sox (when Elias Díaz hit an RBI single in the bottom of the ninth), but the Rockies dropped the next game to the Dodgers. The third walk-off came on Aug. 20 vs. the Giants (Rodgers hit an RBI single in the 10th), but the Rockies went on to lose the next day against San Francisco. \nColorado’s Kyle Freeland (7-9, 4.75 ERA) will be on the mound for Colorado, while Eric Lauer (10-6, 3.54 ERA) will pitch for the Brewers. \nFirst Pitch: 1:10 p.m. MDT\nTV: AT&amp;T Sports Net Rocky Mountain; MLB.tv\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM; KNRV 1150 (Spanish)\nLineups:\n\n\nWrapping up the road trip. : @BallySportWI  : @620wtmj #ThisIsMyCrew pic.twitter.com/eyH14pHzy0— Milwaukee Brewers (@Brewers) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nDay game! ⚾️  AT&amp;T SportsNet  12:30 PM MT ️Coors Field⚾️ Kyle Freeland (COL) vs Eric Lauer (MIL)@Rockies | #Rockies | @SouthwestAir pic.twitter.com/b2GYyCzNEZ— AT&amp;T SportsNet™ | RM (@ATTSportsNetRM) September 7, 2022",

        "description": "Alfonso Rivas is caught stealing second base in Toronto | Photo by Jon Blacker/MLB Photos via Getty Images\n    \n\n  Let’s take a closer look at the Cubs’ baserunning woes this season If you’ve been watching the 2022 Cubs there are a lot of things to be hopeful about. Nico Hoerner has really taken a step forward at shortstop and is currently one of the top five shortstops in the National League in FanGraphs WAR. Despite both currently being on the IL, Justin Steele and Keegan Thompson have emerged as viable back of the rotation options while pitching a career high in innings. Hayden Wesneski had a debut for the ages yesterday, allowing just two hits across five scoreless innings with eight strikeouts. Christopher Morel has exceeded expectations against big league hitting, while playing multiple defensive positions and just generally providing joy as he literally introduces himself to the league:\n\n\nPeople you want to see succeed (just not this week @Cubs) pic.twitter.com/Zg6DPEcZDI— Tim and Friends (@timandfriends) August 29, 2022\n\n\n\nBut one of the things that needs to change right now is the Cubs absolutely embarrassing tendency to make outs on the basepaths. \nIt was apparent in April that this team had an aggressive, and sometimes questionable, baserunning philosophy. There have been a handful of us resigned to making running jokes about TOOTBLANs over the course of the 2022 season because sometimes all you can do is lolsob emoji your way through the worst of it. For the uninitiated, TOOTBLAN stands for “Thrown Out On the Basepaths Like A Nincompoop.” It has a long and storied history with the Chicago Cubs as an unofficial stat necessitated by the existence of Ryan Theriot — if you watched the Cubs in 2008 you already know, if you didn’t you can read more about it here.\nEven Theriot would be stunned by the TOOTBLAN propensity of the 2022 Cubs.\nThe best running list of this season’s TOOTBLANs is being compiled by Cubs Twitter user Uncle Jeff, who has tracked a stunning 90 TOOTBLANs as of his last update Friday, September 2 for the Chicago Cubs over the course of the 2022 season:\n\n\n2022: 90Ortega 16Contreras 11Wisdom 8Happ 8Morel 7Hoerner 7 Suzuki 6Rivas 6Madrigal 5Heyward 2Villar 2 Higgins 2 Velázquez 2 Reyes 2 McKinstry 2Hermosillo 1Schwindel 1Frazier 1Bote 1 pic.twitter.com/9K3txiMCHX— Uncle Jeff (@ebsoftball) September 3, 2022\n\n\n\nIt’s tough to say if there have only been 90 TOOTBLANs this season, because it’s not an easy stat to cross-check. You know it when you see it and if one happens and Uncle Jeff doesn’t happen to be watching, a single TOOTBLAN or two could be easily missed. That’s because the TOOTBLAN is a compilation of a bunch of different statistical events, plus some things that aren’t really captured in any stat. Yes, it includes runners caught stealing and back picks, but it also includes moments where Franmil Reyes thought he could leg out a double despite being in the 20th percentile of MLB for sprint speed. It includes overrunning a bag and being thrown out like a nincompoop and Willie Harris waving everyone around third base for #reasons. \nIn order to truly capture the fullness of the Cubs TOOTBLANery one would need to go back to the start of the season and re-watch every game, documenting all of the inconceivably bad baserunning decisions this team has made over the course of 135 games. I wouldn’t wish that punishment on anyone, so we’ll just go with Jeff’s unofficial count of 90.\nNinety TOOTBLANs over the course of 135 games is .67 TOOBLANs per game. That means this team averages more than a TOOTBLAN every other game. \nUnfortunately, we cannot compare the above TOOTBLAN/Game metric by teams because as far as I can tell no other team does it enough to inspire unofficial team TOOTBLAN tracking, but there are baserunning stats. So today, I wanted to take a look at some of those leaderboards. In case you were wondering, yes, this lack of baserunning prowess shows up in more traditional metrics too and it’s past time that we take a look at them. Below you’ll see the teams leading the way in terms of the raw number of stolen bases, plus some other stats to put those totals in perspective, per FanGraphs. Let’s just start with the steals. All numbers below are through games of Monday, September 5:\n\nThe Cubs rank fourth in steals, which sounds great, but it’s all downhill from there. Successful baserunning is more than just a raw number of steals. It’s also how often you get caught stealing relative to attempts. Re-sorting that table by CS reveals a team that is tied with the Rays for the most times being caught stealing in baseball. However, raw numbers for either of these stats don’t really provide enough context either. What I really wanted to know was how the Cubs stack up in terms of successful steals vs. unsuccessful attempts. That would give us some handle on how efficient the Cubs are at stealing bases.\nThe easiest way to get to that data is the SB/CS ratio I created at the end, which quite literally takes the number of successful steals divided by the times a team is caught — The Cubs are the 19th worst team in baseball by this metric, well behind baserunning juggernauts like the Dodgers who have 86 SB to only 15 CS, as compared to the Cubs’ 88 SB to 32 CS.\nBaserunning also shows up in terms of double plays, so I added a raw count of GDP to this table — you guessed it, the Cubs hit into a lot of them, the third most in baseball, as it turns out. Only the hapless Nationals and Rockies have hit into more GDPs than the Chicago Cubs.\nIf there is a silver lining to this TOOTBLAN cloud it is that not all Cubs are nincompoops on the basepaths, but for those who are, there needs to be an intervention. Below are all of the Cubs hitters with at least 50 plate appearances this season sorted by BsR, which is the base running component of FanGraphs WAR. It incorporates weighted stolen bases, weighted GDP and Ultimate Base Running for each player. If you want to read more about BsR here, you can, but if you’re not up for math, just think of this like WAR for baserunning. I would like to suggest that everyone in the negative here should be put on a “do not steal second or attempt to take an extra base without explicit instructions otherwise” status until further notice (again, stats are through games of Monday, September 5):\n\nWe all know what the 2022 season is — preparation for the future and tryouts for the next great Cubs team, plus a chance for the Cubs to see what they have in the farm system. None of us have any illusions about the competitive realities for this team. But there is very little to be gained by teaching a bunch of 22- to 25-year-old rookies that it’s okay to be reckless on the basepaths because you don’t have enough power bats. The Cubs should tack to a more thoughtful baserunning strategy immediately, not next season, not next series, today. The current state of Cubs outs on the basepaths is embarrassing.",

The groundwork for this technological behemoth is already well underway, with computers already communicating with one another to allow users to send electronic mail (President Bill Clinton is already connected) and access news, weather and even some shopping services.\n\n\n\nBellingham also discussed how the UK needs to invest in more robust phone lines and infrastructure to keep up with the rest of the world.\n\n\n\nFor the information superhighway to really take off though, it needs more capacity than the UK&#8217;s ageing network of copper telephone wires can provide. Is Britain prepared to invest in the sort of high-capacity fibre-optic cable network that can make the technological utopia a reality?",

        "description": "The framers of our Constitution recognized that concentrated power is a threat to personal liberty, famously resulting in the separation of powers in the federal government. But they also knew that that threat was not limited to kings and queens.\n\n\n\nIndeed, the American tradition has long been skeptical of private concentrations of power, whether the&nbsp;“hated trade monopolies”&nbsp;of the American Revolution or the industry-dominating trusts before Teddy Roosevelt came to office.\n\n\n\nToday, our tech markets are controlled almost exclusively by a few companies. They influence almost every aspect of our lives. They tell us what’s true and what’s false. They decide what we see online, what we say, what we’re allowed to find and what apps we can download. Like the Eye of Sauron, they watch so much of what we do and curate our online experiences that increasingly determine what we do and think offline.\n\n\n\nWorse yet, these companies have grown so powerful through a host of unique government privileges. From legal immunity to vast tax breaks, they can and do control markets (and too often narratives) with impunity and no accountability to the American public.\n\n\n\nYou don’t like it? Too bad. They run the show.\n\n\n\nIf we’re going to rein in Big Tech, make the market work for the people and not the powerful, we need a holistic strategy to combat their ever-enveloping influence.\n\n\n\nExecutive action is one possible solution — but it has limits.&nbsp;Despite Lina Khan’s trust-busting chops, the Federal Trade Commission has had little success stopping mergers or breaking up Big Tech in court.&nbsp;And now the courts are considering whether the Federal Trade Commission even has the constitutional authority&nbsp;to file suit.\n\n\n\nThat leaves Congress to rein in Big Tech. And fortunately, a bipartisan group of lawmakers has been looking at establishing guardrails.\n\n\n\nMost prominently, Sens. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) and Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) introduced the Open App Markets Act to even the odds for consumers by promoting competition in app stores. Google and Apple (most famously) have leveraged their dominant position to stifle consumer choice of apps on their respective stores. Narrowly targeted and broadly bipartisan, the bill sailed through the Senate Judiciary Committee in February.\n\n\n\nSo why hasn’t Congress brought the Open App Markets Act to a vote? Political gamesmanship.\n\n\n\nRather than move forward on the Open App Markets Act, Senate leaders have tied its fate to the much broader American Innovation and Choice Online Act, which aims to address self-preferencing by internet giants. Although commendable for its intent, the devil is always in the details; and there are many, many details to be worked through in such a wide-ranging bill.\n\n\n\nSo, it’s no surprise that many senators who nominally support the bill have called for reworking it, leaving it – and consequently the Open App Markets Act – on indefinite hold.\n\n\n\nWe cannot let the great be the enemy of good.&nbsp;Congress is unlikely to pass the self-preferencing bill in its current form, and congressional leaders will need time, months perhaps, to fine-tune its terms to limit unintended consequences. At this point, Congress should green-light what’s ready to go – the Open Apps Market Act – and take the time that is needs to iron the wrinkles out of its self-preferencing bill.\n\n\n\nIncremental progress is just sound policy.\n\n\n\nOf course, even if Congress were to adopt both bills, we would still have a long way to go to unravel the Big Tech Gordian Knot. In particular, Big Tech would still exert significant control over our digital public squares.\n\n\n\nFor example, a&nbsp;study&nbsp;from North Carolina State University showed that Gmail often treats Republican emails as spam and Yahoo treats Democratic emails as spam, even for users who sign up to receive political emails.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg recently&nbsp;admitted&nbsp;that Facebook has censored posts at the government’s behest, including those by media outlets like the New York Post. And researchers have long been concerned about algorithmic bias against Black Americans and other people of color on social media.\n\n\n\nWhat connects all these stories?&nbsp;A lack of transparency (or much belated transparency on Facebook’s part) about how Big Tech decides what we see and when we see it.\n\n\n\nThe good news is that Democrats and Republicans alike support increasing transparency for the tech sector. It’s time for Congress to flex that bipartisan muscle and bring these massive platforms out of the darkness and into the light.\n\n\n\nDespite what you see on the news every day, bipartisanship survives in Washington, D.C., and a host of public servants are working to reduce the power of Big Tech, to protect our privacy and to safeguard our children online.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut for this work to have an impact on the American public, the Senate needs to start by bringing these good, bipartisan bills to the floor for a vote.\n\n\n\nJoel Thayer is president of the Digital Progress Institute and a Washington-based telecom and tech attorney.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia has spearheaded state efforts to combat climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, a record heat wave underscores the importance of the state’s past and future initiatives. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBelow are five ways California is adapting to rising temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia is currently experiencing one of the state’s worst heat waves in history, with record high temperatures expected to last for up to nine days.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe crisis is so bad, operators feared the state’s power grid would fail as demand for electricity skyrockets. On Tuesday, temperatures reached 116 degrees in Sacramento and 109 degrees in San Jose.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This will be essentially the worst September heat wave on record, certainly in Northern California, and arguably for the state overall,” Daniel Swain, a University of California Los Angeles climatologist told the Los Angeles Times. “It might be one of the worst heat waves on record, period, in any month, given its duration and its extreme magnitude.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCalifornia remains at the forefront of state efforts to combat climate change and has adopted and introduced several measures to better adapt to rising temperatures over the years. \n\n\n\nHere are five ways California is changing to handle rising temperatures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Phasing out of gas-powered vehicles\n\n\n\nIn August, the state announced it would ban sales of all gas-powered cars starting in 2035. Traffic-related greenhouse gas emissions are a significant contributor to climate change and pose hazards to humans in the form of air pollution. One visible form of air pollution is ground-level ozone, or smog. Heat waves, which have become more intense thanks to climate change, accelerate the formation of smog, exacerbating health risks in humans. \n\n\n\nBy phasing out gas-powered vehicles and reducing heat-trapping greenhouse gasses, the state aims to lower its overall contribution to climate change and improve air quality both during heat waves and at normal temperatures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. Reduced dependence on the Colorado River&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDroughts are common when heat waves strike and often strain individuals’ water usage. In light of the extreme heat and diminishing water levels hitting the region, California is looking to cut the amount of water it takes from the Colorado River. The decision is in response to an emergency demand made by the federal government regarding dangerously low levels in Lake Powell and Lake Mead.\n\n\n\nApproximately 10 percent, or at least 100 trillion gallons, of the state’s water allocation from the Colorado River will be left in reservoirs next year. California has never made any cuts to its share of the river, while other states who depend on the water supply are expected to follow suit. \n\n\n\n3. Reflective coatings in low-income areas\n\n\n\nLow-income urban areas are subject to the urban heat-island effect whereby limited shade and dense concentrations of concrete and buildings work to trap heat, increase air pollution and exacerbate heat-related health problems. Many low-income individuals cannot afford air conditioning, prompting the need for creative solutions to soaring outdoor temperatures.\n\n\n\nSome city regions throughout California are installing coatings in parks and on pavement that reflect the solar infrared radiation typically absorbed by asphalt. The process works to lower the ambient air temperature in heat-prone regions, and has been shown to lower pavement temperatures by up to 10 degrees. Because pavement releases heat trapped during the day at nighttime, the solution can also help reduce night temperatures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n4. Solar panels on canals&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn an effort to reduce its dependence on nonrenewable energy sources, California is planning to begin a new project that would install solar panels over canals. Along with generating renewable power, the project will determine whether installations can reduce water evaporation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrevious research on the proposed project estimated that by covering 4,000 miles of canals the state could save more than 63 billion gallons of water each year. This total amounts to that needed to irrigate about 50,000 acres of farmland or supply the water needs of 2 million residents. From an electricity perspective, researchers predict the project could generate around one-sixth of the state’s total power.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. State assistance programs for water bills&nbsp;\n\n\n\nProposed legislation would provide financial assistance for low-income California residents to help pay for water bills. Water rates rose by 45 percent between 2007 and 2015 and currently outpace inflation. In September of 2021 residents and businesses owed over $315 million in total unpaid water bills.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bill, which awaits Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) signature, will create a state program to help low-income Californians pay their water and sewage bills, marking the first of its kind in the country. How many residents would be eligible for the program or how much assistance they would receive remains unknown. To combat dehydration, residents experiencing heat waves are encouraged to drink water and other fluids regularly. ",

        "description": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) is maintaining a 7-point lead over his Democratic opponent Beto O’Rourke, according to a new poll released on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe University of Houston-Texas Southern University survey found that 49 percent of likely voters supported Abbott, while 42 percent supported O’Rourke.\n\n\n\nThe results of Wednesday’s survey track with other recent polls. An August poll from the Dallas Morning News and the University of Texas at Tyler also showed Abbott holding a 7-point lead over O’Rourke.\n\n\n\nSupport for the two candidates breaks down sharply along partisan lines, with “virtually every Texas Democrat” intending to vote for O’Rourke and “virtually every Texas Republican” planning to vote for Abbott, according to the latest poll.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbbott’s and O’Rourke’s likely voter bases also represent vastly different demographics. While the current governor was more popular among older white voters, O’Rourke was more popular among younger voters of color.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the latest poll, Abbott led the Democratic candidate by 29 points among white voters, but O’Rourke led Abbott by 57 points among Black voters and 15 points among Latino voters.\n\n\n\nThe silent generation/baby boomer cohort and Generation X favored Abbott by 28 points and 11 points, respectively, while millennials and Generation Z favored O’Rourke by 21 points and 23 points, according to the poll.\n\n\n\nHowever, the gender breakdown is less distinct. While Abbott leads O’Rourke by 18 points among men, the two candidates are tied at 45 percent support among women.\n\n\n\nAfter the deadly shooting at an Uvalde, Texas, elementary school brought the gun control debate back to the forefront, O’Rourke appeared to close the gap between himself and Abbott, leading to a sense of cautious optimism among the state’s Democrats. However, O’Rourke has been unable to gain further ground on Abbott in polls.\n\n\n\nThe University of Houston-Texas Southern University survey was conducted from Aug. 11-27, with 2,140 respondents and had a confidence interval of plus or minus 2.1 points. ",

Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) in new comments said he will not support the Senate’s marriage equality bill in its current form —&nbsp;a reversal from July, when he said he had “no reason to oppose” the measure.\n\n\n\n\"I always support civil unions never felt this bill is necessary,\" Johnson told reporters Wednesday in Washington. \"This is just Democrats opening up a wound that doesn't need to be opened up. And now that I've talked to people there are some very serious concerns on religious liberty.\"\n\n\n\nThe remarks at the Capitol followed up on comments Johnson made at a meeting last week that first surfaced publicly on Wednesday. \n\n\n\n“I would not support it in its current state,” Johnson said at a Common Sense Citizens of Washington County meeting last week, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, which obtained a recording of the remarks.\n\n\n\nThe Wisconsin Republican aired concerns about religious liberties before calling the issue of same-sex marriage “a wound that was healed.”\n\n\n\n“But at the same time I don’t want to see millions of lives disrupted either. To me, that was a wound that was healed. Let it go, okay. Move on, okay,” he said, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\n\n\nThe newspaper first reported Johnson’s remarks on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe comments from Johnson represent a change from his stance in July, when the senator, who is embroiled in a tough reelection race, signaled that he would support the marriage-equality bill.\n\n\n\n“The Respect for Marriage Act is another example of Democrats creating a state of fear over an issue in order to further divide Americans for their political benefit. Even though I feel the Respect for Marriage Act is unnecessary, should it come before the Senate, I see no reason to oppose it,” Johnson said in a statement to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel.\n\n\n\nNews of Johnson’s new stance comes as the Senate is looking to take up the marriage-equality bill, titled the Respect for Marriage Act, which would protect same-sex marriage on the federal level by requiring that individuals are considered married if they were wed in a state where it is legal.\n\n\n\nThe legislation would also prohibit state officials from denying full faith and credit to an out-of-state marriage based on sex, race, or ethnicity, and it would allow individuals to pursue legal action if they are hurt by a violation of the proposed law.\n\n\n\nThe House approved the legislation in July in a 267-157 vote, with 47 Republicans joining all Democrats in support. Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) last month vowed that the Senate would vote on the measure in September.\n\n\n\nThe bipartisan nature of the House vote fueled Democratic hopes that 10 Republicans could cross the aisle and support the measure, which would bypass a filibuster and send the bill to President Biden’s desk for signature.\n\n\n\nBut Johnson's announcement that he will not back it deprives supporters of what had seemed like a potential \"yes\" vote. \n\n\n\nWith Johnson against the bill, there are three Republican who are seen as “yes” votes: Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Rob Portman (R-Ohio), both sponsors of the measure, and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who previously told reporters that he “probably will” back the measure.\n\n\n\nAround nine other Republicans are potential backers.\n\n\n\nAxios reported last month that Sen. Tammy Baldwin (D-Wisc.), a sponsor of the measure, was working with Collins to grow GOP support for the bill. One area under consideration was providing “more clarity that the legislation would not take away any religious liberty or conscience protections,” Baldwin’s office told the outlet.\n\n\n\nAris Folley contributed.\n\n\n\nThis story was updated at 2:20 p.m.",

        "description": "Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley will campaign with Gov. Brian Kemp (R) in Georgia on Friday, Kemp’s reelection campaign announced.\n\n\n\nA media advisory from Kemp’s campaign on Wednesday said that Haley, the former governor of South Carolina, would be joining Kemp and his wife for a campaign event in the Atlanta metro area. Haley formally endorsed Kemp’s reelection bid last month. \n\n\n\nHaley has been floated as a possible 2024 GOP presidential candidate, and her decision to campaign in Georgia is likely to continue raising speculation. \n\n\n\nEarlier this summer, Haley attended several events in Iowa, including a family picnic hosted by Rep. Randy Feenstra (R-Iowa), the Iowa Republican Party’s Dubuque Regional Reception and an event that included Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks (R-Iowa).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring a Christians United for Israel lunch, she appeared to hint at presidential aspirations, saying at one point, “Just saying, sometimes it takes a woman.” \n\n\n\nFormer President Trump has teased the possibility of launching a third presidential bid, though he has not made a formal announcement. \n\n\n\nOther Republicans who have also been floated as possible 2024 presidential candidates include Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, Sen. Ted Cruz (Texas), former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and former Vice President Mike Pence.",

        "description": "Kim Kardashian is the latest celebrity to announce the launch of her own private equity firm, SKKY Partners.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a news release on Wednesday, Kardashian partnered up with long-time private equity veteran Jay Sammons to create a firm focusing on investments within the portfolio of high-growth consumer and media businesses. \n\n\n\nSKKY’s target sectors include consumer products, digital products and e-commerce, consumer media and entertainment, hospitality, and luxury with both Kardashian and Sammons serving as the firm's co-managing partners and co-founders. \n\n\n\nKardashian's mother, Kris Jenner, will also serve as co-partner for the new equity firm, according to the news release.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I’m excited to launch SKKY Partners to invest in the next generation of consumer brands, leveraging my experience founding and building global businesses and partnering with innovative companies to help them grow,” the 41-year-old celebrity mogul said in a statement. “I look forward to working closely with Jay and our team to identify distinctive investment opportunities and build the firm’s portfolio of world class companies for our investors.”\n\n\n\nSammons, the former Global Head of Consumer, Media, and Retail at private equity firm the Carlyle Group expressed his excitement about teaming up with Kardashian to co-lead the new company.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I have been privileged to spend my career partnering with the founders and leaders of some of the most influential and culturally groundbreaking consumer brands of our time,” Sammons, who will lead the day-to-day operations of SKKY Partners said in a statement. “Now, in partnership with Kim and Kris, I look forward to building SKKY into the leading private equity firm that backs the next generation of innovative, disruptive consumer businesses and brands.”\n\n\n\nIn a recent interview with Interview Magazine, Kardashian, who has used her platform to push for criminal justice reform, said that the U.S. has regressed following the Supreme Court overturn of Roe v. Wade in June, adding that it is also scary to think that gay marriage can also be in jeopardy as well.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I’m studying civil procedure and criminal procedure right now, so just understanding the process of how Roe v. Wade got overturned — it’s fascinating and scary,” Kardashian told the magazine. “Just seeing how far our country has progressed, to then see it regress — it’s really scary to think that gay marriage is in jeopardy.”",

federal judge in Texas struck down a key provision of the Affordable Care Act that requires insurers and employers to cover HIV prevention drugs, ruling that the requirement violates the religious freedom of a Christian-owned company.\n\n\n\nThe ruling by Judge Reed O'Connor — who previously struck down the entire ObamaCare law before it was upheld by the Supreme Court — was a partial victory for the challengers.\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear what kind of impact the ruling would have beyond the employers challenging the provision, but it could determine whether the rest of the law's preventive care coverage requirements will remain.\n\n\n\nThe Texas employers who challenged the provision argued it violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act by forcing people to pay for coverage that conflicts with their faith and personal values.\n\n\n\nSpecifically, they said paying for health plans that cover HIV prevention drugs, known as PrEP, makes them \"complicit in facilitating homosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage between one man and one woman.\"\n\n\n\nPrEP reduces the risk of getting HIV by 99 percent when taken as recommended, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are two pills approved for use as PrEP: Truvada and Descovy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nO'Connor also ruled against the broader preventive services covered under the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, including colorectal and other cancer screenings, depression screenings and hypertension screenings, among many others. O'Connor said the task force's system for deciding which services should be fully covered was unconstitutional.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nO'Connor upheld some requirements for immunizations as well as for certain services for women and children.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nO'Connor did not rule on the scope of relief or remedy, and asked the parties for additional briefs by Friday, including how to proceed on the law's contraceptive mandate.\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit was led by Jonathan Mitchell, the architect of Texas's six-week abortion law that offers a $10,000 bounty to private citizens who successfully sue abortion providers.\n\n\n\nAn analysis by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation in July found that overturning the preventive services requirement could threaten access to life-saving care for nearly 168 million Americans covered under private employer health plans as well as the ACA's individual market plans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",

The town of about 121,000 residents boasts 162 parks, an average one-bedroom rent of approximately $2,050, and around $5 for a&nbsp;pint of beer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSt. Charles, Mo., where the average one-bedroom rent is $950, came in second. The small town near St. Louis hosts three colleges and universities, including Lindenwood University. In addition to a low crime rate, and rental costs, a student of legal drinking age may purchase a beer for an average of $4. \n\n\n\nNewark, Del., home to the University of Delaware, took the third spot. Newark earned the spot given its low crime rate, rental costs as well as economic opportunity. The average net monthly salary for a Newark resident is $5,438, according to the report.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLa Crosse, Wisc., and Grand Forks, N.D. round out Preply’s top five small college towns. \n\n\n\nPreply grouped 13 metrics into three categories — wallet friendliness, social environment, and economic opportunities — before applying them to 200 college towns. \n\n\n\nData shows the average cost for college in 2022, including books, supplies and daily living expenses, is more than $35,500, while the cost for tuition alone is nearly $9,400. \n\n\n\nHere are Preply’s&nbsp;top small college towns.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1.

This is the first time that Apple’s not updating to a new processor for one of its flagship iPhones since the 2008 iPhone 3G, which featured virtually the same internals as the original iPhone.\nThe iPhone 14 Pro, meanwhile, has an A16 processor, which the company says is more power efficient, even when doing intensive tasks.

        "description": "I love this: Terence takes eleven years to reflect on a comment I made on stage at an event here in Brighton. It&#8217;s all about the longevity of the web compared to native apps:\n\n\n  If you wrote an app for an early version of iOS or Android, it simply won&#8217;t run on modern hardware or software. APIs have changed, SDKs weren&#8217;t designed with forward compatibility, and app store requirements have evolved.\n  \n  The web has none of that. The earliest websites are viewable on modern browsers.\n\n\nAs wrote at the time, I may have been juicing things up for entertainment:\n\n\n  Now here’s the thing when it comes to any discussion about mobile or the web or anything else of any complexity: an honest discussion would result in every single question being answered with “it depends”. A more entertaining discussion, on the other hand, would consist of deliberately polarised opinions. We went for the more entertaining discussion.\n\n\nBut I think this still holds true for me today:\n\n\n  The truth is that the whole “web vs. native” thing doesn’t interest me that much. I’m as interested in native iOS development as I am in native Windows development or native CD-ROM development. On a timescale measured in years, they are all fleeting, transient things. The web abides.\n\n\nadactio.com/links/19422",

        "link": "https://buckscountybeacon.com/2022/09/people-power-may-flush-bucks-county-sewer-sale/",
        "description": "The Bucks County Water and Sewer Authority announced in July they were in discussions with Aqua America to sell off the sewer portion of the municipal service for $1.1 billion. Sales of water and sewer systems have been on the rise in Pennsylvania, but residents who have contested the sales, or experienced huge billing increases following a sale, sounded the alarm.\n\n\n\nNeighbors Opposing Privatization Efforts, or NOPE, a grassroots group originally organized by David McMahon, assisted Bucks County residents with organizing and providing strategies to better communicate with their county commissioners and other elected officials. NOPE had already successfully fended off Aqua in Norristown. Dozens of Bucks County residents immediately turned out for advocacy planning sessions and at BCSWA meetings in opposition to the sale.\n\n\n\nTuesday&#8217;s announcements from each of the Bucks County Commissioners to scrap negotiations with Aqua America came as a surprise, but illustrate the impact of advocacy and activism.\n\n\n\n\n📣 Calling all #BucksCounty Residents! 📣 Stand with CVPA and NOPE in the fight against privatizing the Bucks County Sewer System: https://t.co/PP85EQCrmG&mdash; Conservation Voters of PA (@ConservationPA) August 29, 2022\n\n\n\n\nKofi Osei, of Towamencin NOPE, believes the unpopularity of the sale of water and sewer systems transcends political partisanship and contributed to the group’s success in Bucks County.\n\n\n\n“Decisions about how we build infrastructure and how we fund it is a fundamental political discussion and I think that is the core of why this issue resonates so well,” Osei said. “People want to know they can reliably drink from their tap and flush the toilet at the cheapest possible cost. The only types of people who think adding investors into the middle of that equation makes sense are investors themselves or are public officials swayed by lobbyists.”\n\n\n\nAnthony Bellitto, executive director of the North Penn Water Authority (NPWA), participated in NOPE’s Tuesday night Zoom call and revealed a major disparity between water utilities managed by local municipalities versus those that are privately operated by corporations. According to online data, the chief executive officer for Aqua receives annual compensation in excess of $4.2 million; the NPWA&#8217;s entire annual payroll, for 52 employees, is $4.1 million.\n\n\n\n“People can easily see privatization for the scam that it is – a loan disguised as a gift, wrapped up with empty promises that must be paid back with interest through exorbitant rate increases, resulting in no better service to the customers, while the private company’s upper management and investors fill their own pockets with obscene amounts of profits,” said Bellitto.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile the commissioners’ recommendation carries weight, the Bucks County Water and Sewer Authority must vote on discontinuing the sale at their next meeting. \n\n\n\nNOPE members said their work will not be complete until they see the BCWSA board members take a vote to officially end the Aqua deal at their upcoming September meeting.\n\n\n\nMcMahon credits some of the group’s success to building new relationships and by drawing from ongoing experiences in various municipalities.\n\n\n\n“We now have resources from Pennsylvania Municipal Authorities Association (PMAA) with their key studies and statistics. They were tracking the sales and the rate increases between municipal and private systems over time,” he said. “We had people who were township officials, or former township officials, so they were peers and colleagues and not just voters and residents, and that was a factor.”\n\n\n\nOne such local official is Elen Snyder, a Supervisor for Newtown Township.“Due to the public outcry against probable soaring costs associated with the sale of BCSWA to a private company, the Newtown Supervisors wholeheartedly agreed with our community when drafting our resolution opposing the sale,” said Snyder.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNOPE knows that curtailing future sales of municipal water and sewer authorities in Pennsylvania will require addressing existing and proposed legislation in Harrisburg.\n\n\n\nState Representative Melissa Shusterman (D-157) hopes to have&nbsp; a moratorium placed on all water and sewer sales until there are assurances that sales do not have a negative impact on consumers.\n\n\n\n“As it is currently written, ACT 12, Section 1329 allows the PUC to approve sales of public sewer systems, even against the recommendation of the Public Utility Commission Administrative Law Judge. This process is severely impacting our residents,” Shusterman said.Senate Bill 597,&nbsp; a moving piece of legislation that NOPE is watching and hopes to derail, was drafted by water lobbyists. The proposed law would favor privatization because (a) it imposes new regulatory burdens on municipalities while exempting investor-owned PUC regulated companies; (b) forces ratepayers to fund market research for industry acquisitions; and, (c) serves to benefits corporate takeovers while camouflaged as consumer and environmental protections.\n\n\n\nThanks to NOPE, those served by the Bucks County Water and Sewer Authority may not be facing dramatic rate increases.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/giants-select-luis-ortiz.html",
        "description": "The Giants have selected the contract of right-hander Luis Ortiz today. The club already had a vacancy on their 40-man roster after catcher Andrew Knapp was designated for assignment yesterday. Susan Slusser of The San Francisco Chronicle mentioned that Ortiz appeared to be about to join the club with Alex Pavlovic of NBC Sports Bay Area relaying that Ortiz had a locker for today&#8217;s game. Slusser also relays that outfielder Bryce Johnson has been optioned in a corresponding move to get Ortiz onto the active roster. Evan Webeck of the San Jose Mercury News relays that the moves are official.\nOrtiz, 26, has some MLB experience, although a very small amount. In 2018, he made two appearances for the Orioles, followed by one more in 2019. He has a 12.71 ERA in a tiny sample of 5 2/3 innings over those three games. Prior to that, Ortiz was a highly-touted prospect with the Rangers, cracking Baseball America&#8217;s top 100 list in 2016 and 2017. He got traded to the Brewers and then to the Orioles, though his prospect stock faded as injuries limited his output. Despite being a starting pitcher in his early career, he only cracked the 100-inning plateau once, which was the 102 frames he logged over three levels in 2018.\nHe&#8217;s moved into more relief work over the past couple of seasons and seems to have taken a step forward here in 2022. Signed by the Giants to a minor league deal in the offseason, he&#8217;s spent this entire season with the Triple-A Sacramento River Cats. His 4.66 ERA might not jump out and grab you, but it&#8217;s not as bad as it seems since the River Cats play in the notoriously hitter-friendly Pacific Coast League. Ortiz has a strong 25.7% strikeout rate for the season, along with a miniscule 4.5% walk rate and average-ish 42% groundball rate. It&#8217;s also worth noting that he&#8217;s gotten into an excellent groove after a rough start. Through June 28, his ERA was way up at 7.30, but he&#8217;s thrown 23 scoreless innings since then to cut almost three full runs off that number.\nOrtiz will provide a fresh arm to a Giants bullpen that&#8217;s in the midst of a stretch where they play 20 games in 19 days thanks to tomorrow&#8217;s doubleheader in Milwaukee. He still has two options and just 29 days of service time, meaning the Giants could potentially keep him around for a while if he continues throwing well.",

        "description": "As announced last month on the Play Console Help website, changes to Google&#8217;s Developer Program Policy are now in effect. While there were several updates that drastically affect how developers can interact with and market to users, The Register reports one of the most notable differences that have been implemented &#8211; VPNs.\n\n\n\nWhat&#8217;s different about Virtual Private Network apps now, you may ask? Well, instead of being able to block advertisements entirely as they&#8217;ve always been capable of doing (though this has never been a primary function), Google is now explicitly preventing them from doing so.\n\n\n\nThe issue isn&#8217;t in the blocking of ads themselves, though there are many who are concerned with the language across the Chrome Web Store and Google Play Store that may indicate Google&#8217;s future plans to wipe out ad blockers.\n\n\n\nInstead, the issue is that when VPNs that double as ad blockers intercept ads from displaying to a user, they could be in a position to collect personal information that they really shouldn&#8217;t have. As The Register put it, &#8220;Permissible VPN apps should not, according to Google, collect personal or sensitive data without prominent disclosure and, more importantly, user consent. Furthermore, they should not redirect or manipulate traffic, nor manipulate ads, that can have an impact on other services&#x2019; monetization.&#8221;\n\n\n\n&#x2460; Unexpected static ad appears during gameplay at the beginning of a level.\n\n\nComing at the end of the month are changes that will prevent apps from displaying ads in full screen unexpectedly, prior to an app&#8217;s loading screen, or during the beginning of the gameplay experience. Additionally, ads that are not able to be closed after 15 seconds will also be banned starting September 30, 2022, which is in just a few weeks. With this, you should be able to expect a much better and less invasive experience in your favorite apps and games &#8211; specifically, those that are free to use.\n\n\n\nWith all of that being said, I&#8217;d love to hear your thoughts in the comments. Do you believe that Google&#8217;s changes are setting the stage for it to have full control over ads in Chrome, or do you think that it&#8217;s genuinely trying to protect users from VPNs that may intercept your data?\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  It’s time for the opener of a doubleheader against the Twins. After a day off for rain yesterday, the Yankees are back in action today for a doubleheader against the Twins. The series opener on Monday went mostly well with the Yankees winning, 5-2, and Aaron Judge hitting home run No. 54. Can they follow that up with more wins today in the ongoing quest to add more games back to the AL East lead?\nIn the opener, Domingo Germán is set to get the start. In his most recent outing, Germán was solid, allowing three runs (two earned) in 6.2 innings in an eventual loss to the Rays. In general, he’s been good of late, putting up a 1.31 ERA in 20.2 innings over his last three starts in particular.\nThe lineup behind him is quite an adventure. With Anthony Rizzo on the IL and Giancarlo Stanton and DJ LeMahieu (who both could be available for game two) both dealing with stuff, the batting order is a weird one. Ronald Guzmán, called up after Rizzo hit the IL, is in the lineup for his Yankees’ debut and went straight to the cleanup spot. Right behind him is Miguel Andújar, who got the call as the extra man for the doubleheader. Besides them, Oswaldo Cabrera leads off, Estevan Florial starts for the first time since being recalled last week, Oswald Peraza gets a game at shortstop, and Isiah Kiner-Falefa moves over to third with Josh Donaldson on the paternity list.\nFor the Twins, starting pitcher Louie Varland will be making his MLB debut. In 126.1 innings across Double and Triple-A this season, Varland has a 3.06 ERA. That includes a 1.69 mark in 21.1 innings with the Triple-A St. Paul Saints.\nCome join us in the game thread as the Yankees go for some much-needed wins! Note that the second game will begin at either 7:05pm ET or 30 minutes after this one ends.\nHow to watch\nLocation: Yankee Stadium — Bronx, NY\nFirst pitch: 3:05 pm EDT\nTV Broadcast: Amazon Prime Video, Bally Sports North\nRadio Broadcast: WFAN 660/101.9 FM, WADO 1280 (NYY), TIBN (MIN)\nOnline stream: MLB.tv\nFor updates, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, and like us on Facebook.\n\n\nDoubleheader on deck. #RepBX Presented by @Hilton pic.twitter.com/Id48eErGB7— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a doubleheader day. #MNTwins pic.twitter.com/DYxju7qsq8— Minnesota Twins (@Twins) September 7, 2022",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;Mental health services are typically accessed through clinics and hospitals.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople who have unstable housing conditions may not have adequate access to psychiatric treatments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreet psychiatrists are a growing group of mental health professionals who are working with community groups to reach people in need in cities around the U.S.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA growing area of psychiatry, called street psychiatry or street medicine, has developed in the U.S. in several metro areas like Boston, Oakland and Los Angeles. Adjacent programs like one in Portland sends responders who are trained to help in non-life-threatening mental health and behavioral health issues to relevant 911 calls.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne of the few ways people can get psychiatric treatment is to go to the emergency room or department at a hospital. A patient might get prescribed medications during an emergency room visit, but once they leave there aren’t follow ups for when the medication runs out.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSeeing a patient in a clinical setting is also different from seeing them in their daily environment. “You are seeing two different versions of the patient,” psychiatrist Shayan Rab, who leads the team of psychiatrists and psychiatric nurse practitioners, told the L.A. Times. “When we work with an individual on the street we see how an individual is living in the community, what the realities of their environment are like.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe goal is to get people into residential programs, but the first critical step is knowing where they are through the outreach and social worker teams. Rab’s psychiatry team in L.A. collaborates with teams of outreach workers, social workers, nurses and substance abuse counselors from L.A. county’s Homeless Outreach and Mobile Engagement (HOME) program.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeople who are unhoused and are experiencing homelessness are particularly vulnerable to mental health illness, as well as food insecurity and other needs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These vulnerable and disengaged individuals struggle with securing appropriate food, clothing, and shelter due to their mental illness,” the HOME website states.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In addition, they may have critical deficits in hygiene and communication, and are generally highly avoidant of services.&nbsp; They are unable to live safely in the community and require specialized mental health services to secure and sustain housing,” the website says.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStreet psychiatrists fill a gap for this group of people, who are less likely to access services especially if they are far from where the services are located.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I would argue that few populations bear greater psychological burden than homeless people yet given the magnitude, there are very few resources for treating them,” street psychiatrist Katherine Koh with the Boston Healthcare for the Homeless Program and Massachusetts General Hospital told the L.A. Times.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome individuals may really need help and want to find shelter but may still take some convincing to enter a care facility. “I was at my wit's end. I was tired of getting high. I was tired of not being on my medication, not being normal,” a person named Alvin told the University of California San Francisco. Another person told the university that getting dental care gave him the “super self-esteem\" he needed to finally go to a clinic to get treated for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and he later found housing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRab notes that street psychiatrists can follow up and give medication support to their patients, sometimes also helping them get housing. By engaging with people in need where they are and bringing psychiatric services to them, it increases the chances that these patients can get the care they need.&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3632735-a-monetarist-recession-vs-a-targeted-approach-to-inflation/",
        "description": "Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues are continuing to raise interest rates even though they know this is likely to cause a recession. At the annual bankers’ gathering in Jackson Hole this August, Powell promised “pain” as a result of the interest rate increases he is engineering. Everyone knows this will be hard on working people, but the Fed policy makers seem to have made up their minds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy are they risking a recession and a serious increase in unemployment? Because the “idea” driving Monetarist economics these days is “credibility.” Deep down, it’s that sick machismo business again. The central bankers are persuaded that they have to have the “cohones” to cause a recession, or they will be seen as wimps and inflation will become “untethered,” that is soar out of control. Squeezing down on credit by raising interest rates is the price working people will pay to show that the Board is manly and unflinching.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis credibility fixation makes no sense. Prices in competitive markets are set by supply and demand not credibility or expectations. If a roofer demands $100 an hour because he expects that is where wages are going and there is another roofer competing with him for the business at $85 an hour, it doesn’t matter what the first person’s “inflationary expectations” are.&nbsp; If one car dealer asks $30,000 for a car and the dealer down the street will take $29,000, the first dealer’s “expectations” of future prices don’t matter. It was not the Fed’s credibility and willingness to cause pain that brought down inflation in the 1980s and 90s. It was the weakening of the OPEC oil cartel and a series of targeted pro-competitive reforms in key economic areas promoted by Presidents Ford, Carter, Reagan and congressional leaders that did the job.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis history is worth reviewing. The post-World War II U.S. economy was dominated by large corporations in key industries. Government regulatory agencies — the Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC), the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC), and antitrust laws were meant to limit the pricing power of these companies, but they weren’t fully successful during the ’50s, ’60s, and ’70s. President Carter recognized this as did Presidents Ford and Reagan so between 1976 and 1980 Carter appointed leaders at the regulatory agencies who wanted to promote competition to break the hold of the powerful incumbents.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and the courts over a period of years ended Ma Bell’s (AT&amp;T) communications monopoly, and communications costs dropped like a rock.&nbsp; The Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) broke the power of regional rate-bureaus that set prices in trucking and ended “back hauling” limitations and other restrictions on trucking competition. The ICC and Congress then moved on to force the railroads to follow suit.&nbsp; Shipping costs dropped sharply just like the costs of communications services.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) allowed new freight and passenger airlines to enter and open up additional routes for the first time since the 1930s. FedEx in the freight area is a product of these CAB reforms which brought competition to air transportation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe point here is that high interest rates engineered by the Fed in the late 1970s and early 80s had little to do with these anti-inflationary structural changes in communications, trucking, railroads, airlines and&nbsp;retailing although the Monetarists have never recognized this.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt was not just the “regulated industries” that were restructured to be less inflation prone in the 1970 and 80s. Pro-competitive actions by the government during this period also reduced prices in the huge manufacturing sector, which was not formally “regulated.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe whole mid-section of the U.S. after World War II was dependent on the Big 3 car companies. Industries like steel, metalworking, and machine tools were tied to the three automotive giants. Inflation was tamed in this key manufacturing sector in the 1980s because the government did not yield to pressure to close the market to auto imports and new domestic automakers. Instead, GM, Ford and Chrysler were forced to compete with Volkswagen, Toyota, Honda, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Audi, BMW and a raft of others.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDealers wanted to sell these makes of cars too, so they fought to free themselves from exclusive arrangements with the Big 3, increasing competition at this level too. Monetary policy again was hardly a factor.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe huge retail sector also was opened to more intense competition. Traditional mark ups between wholesale and retail were sharply reduced by competition from Walmart and other big box stores. Not surprisingly this held down prices no matter what the Fed did.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMonetarist policies — raising rates and squeezing down on credit for middle-class borrowers in the 1970s and 80s as the Fed is doing now — get far too much credit for taming inflation in that period. Higher interest rates and a deep Fed-inspired recession in the 1980s were not what opened up communications, transportation, manufacturing or retailing. It was the targeted actions cited above. In 2022, by the same token, higher rates will not lower prices of gasoline, natural gas, fertilizer and electricity or remove key bottlenecks which ought to be the targets of long-term government policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPain-causing interest rate increases by the Fed are applauded because they look tough but don’t target the well established insiders.&nbsp; In reality they are a way to avoid the hard political work of tackling specific issues in energy, transportation, supply chain and climate, the areas that are driving inflation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPaul A.

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new Florida rule that prohibits transgender people from using Medicaid to help pay for gender-affirming health care likely violates Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), agencies in the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) told Changing America.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnder Section 1557, health programs that receive federal funds are prohibited from discriminating based on six protected characteristics, including sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHHS is working to prevent similar rules and policies from cropping up elsewhere, the agencies said.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new Florida rule that bars transgender people in the state from using Medicaid to help pay for gender-affirming medical care likely violates federal law, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) has said.\n\n\n\nFlorida’s Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) in August published a rule eliminating coverage under Medicaid for puberty blockers, hormones, gender-affirming surgeries and “any other procedures that alter primary or secondary sexual characteristics” when those procedures are used to treat gender dysphoria.\n\n\n\nThe move, which stripped an estimated 9,000 transgender Floridians of coverage for gender-affirming health care, took effect Aug. 21.\n\n\n\nIn an emailed statement to Changing America, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) and the HHS Office of Civil Rights (OCR) said the measure likely violates Section 1557 of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), which prohibits health programs that receive federal funds from discriminating based on six protected characteristics, including sex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe agencies said restrictions imposed by federally funded entities that prevent an individual from receiving medically necessary care – including gender-affirming care – from their health care provider because of their sexual orientation or gender identity likely violates Section 1557.\n\n\n\nThe agencies added that HHS has concerns with the new Florida rule and plans to take action to protect state Medicaid beneficiaries’ access to gender-affirming health care but declined to provide additional information. The department is also working to prevent similar policies from cropping up elsewhere, the agencies said.\n\n\n\nThe AHCA did not respond to Changing America’s request for comment.\n\n\n\nIn July, HHS issued a proposed rule that would broaden the definition of sex discrimination in Section 1557 to include sexual orientation and gender identity, consistent with the Supreme Court’s ruling in Bostock v. Clayton County and earlier actions taken by the Biden administration to expand protections for LGBTQ+ Americans.\n\n\n\nPublic comment on the rule is open until October 3.\n\n\n\nAccording to Anne Alstott, a professor at Yale Law School, even if the Florida rule is found by the Health Department to violate Section 1557, the steps HHS can take to address it are fairly limited.\n\n\n\n“That will not prevent Florida from doing what it's doing, but it will set up a legal conflict with Florida and with other places that are trying to discriminate,” she said.\n\n\n\nIn June, Alstott and a team of seven scientists argued that Florida health officials’ position on gender-affirming health care is “thoroughly flawed and lacking scientific weight.” An AHCA report issued that same month claimed medical treatments for transgender youth including puberty blockers and hormones are “experimental and investigational” and inconsistent with “generally accepted professional medical standards.”\n\n\n\nMajor medical associations including the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Psychological Association have voiced opposition to measures that restrict access to transgender health care.\n\n\n\nThe only acceptable recommended form of gender-affirming care for children who have not started puberty is social transition, according to guidelines set by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) and the Endocrine Society. Gender-affirming surgeries are not recommended for minors.\n\n\n\nThe AHCA report, along with guidance from the Florida Department of Health that suggested even social transition – non-medical interventions including haircuts or changes to clothing, names or pronouns – be off-limits to minors, was used by state officials to support eliminating Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming care.\n\n\n\nMeredithe McNamara, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Yale and one of Alstott’s co-authors in the June report, said the move highlights a need for a federal watchdog or institution to conduct scientific checks on state policies that rely on evidence disputed by mainstream science.\n\n\n\nYale researchers, including McNamara and Alstott, in May accused officials in Alabama and Texas of enacting policies to curtail transgender health care that are based on studies that intentionally “warp” scientific evidence to “exaggerate potential harms” of gender-affirming medical care.\n\n\n\n“It’s never been so glaringly obvious that we needed something like this before,” McNamara told Changing America in an interview. “Discrimination and disinformation go hand in hand – anti-discrimination protections are helpful, but there needs to be some sort of consequence for using scientific misinformation to accomplish discrimination.”\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, LGBTQ+ and health advocacy groups including Lambda Legal, the Southern Legal Counsel, the Florida Health Justice Project and the National Health Law Program filed a federal lawsuit challenging Florida’s Medicaid rule.\n\n\n\nThe complaint in part claims the rule violates Section 1557 of the ACA by discriminating on the basis of sex.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3632729-manchin-says-leadership-pledged-permitting-reform-in-stopgap-funding-bill/",
        "description": "Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) said Wednesday that Democratic leadership told him the permitting reform he has pushed for will be included in a government funding measure known as a continuing resolution. \n\n\n\n“Permitting is in,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAsked Wednesday whether he was told by leadership that the reforms would be included in the funding measure, he answered affirmatively. \n\n\n\nThe Senate swing vote has pushed for legislation that would speed up the process for approving energy and infrastructure projects. When Manchin announced his support for the Democrats’ climate, tax and health care bill, he and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a joint statement that they would separately pass a deal to reform the permitting process for these projects as part of the deal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the push has come under fire from progressives, led by Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who have raised concerns about the potential for undermining environmental reviews and helping the fossil fuel industry. \n\n\n\nGrijalva, who chairs the House’s Natural Resources Committee, has circulated a letter asking leadership to separate the Manchin deal out of the continuing resolution.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHis office told The Hill last week that they had more than 40 signatories so far and were still circulating at that time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe has argued that these measures are largely ones that are supported by Republicans, and shared concerns with environmentalists that expedited reviews could harm vulnerable groups. \n\n\n\nHowever, it’s not clear whether or how many progressives would vote against a measure to fund the government, as Democrats would be unlikely to want a government shutdown ahead of the midterms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAsked about the progressive resistance, Manchin said: “I think people need to see what’s inside and how much good it does for the country.”\n\n\n\nA summary released by Manchin’s office said that the reforms will set maximum timelines for environmental reviews and complete a pipeline that runs through West Virginia.",

        "description": "All across Minnesota, businesses are desperate for workers. “We’re hiring” signs seem to be posted in every storefront. Companies are flying in workers from places like Puerto Rico, paying big signing bonuses, and getting into wage wars in a desperate attempt to fill open positions.According to the Washington Post, a job scooping ice cream in Mankato is paying well above minimum wage. Meanwhile, in a report for the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, David Montgomery, a data journalist who now works for the bank, digs behind the unemployment numbers to take a look at Americans who aren&#x27;t working.The following is a transcript of the conversation, edited for clarity. Listen to the full conversation using the audio player above.We should probably begin by asking this question: Who is working right now?Well in Minnesota, the answer is a lot of people. Minnesota has some of the highest employment rates in the country, in the vicinity of 80 percent of all prime-age adults working. And that&#x27;s a technical term, basically that means people who are 25 to 54 [years old]. Economists like to use that number, because it sort of controls for population dynamics, it rules out younger people who may be more likely to be in school, and older people who may be more likely to be retired early. So this report you wrote says about 25 percent of Americans aged 25 to 54 don&#x27;t have jobs. So what are they doing instead?For a certain share of them, what they&#x27;re doing is looking for a job or looking for the right job. About 1 in 5 people who aren&#x27;t currently working are actively looking for a new job. But the rest are doing other things. In general, they&#x27;re pretty happy doing other things. So these other things include going to school and retiring early. That can also include people who have health issues that prevent them from working, or who are caring for family.Let&#x27;s look at that caregiving number. What percentage of individuals who don&#x27;t have a full-time job — although caregiving is, you know, a full-time job — do you have a percentage as to how many people are said to be caregivers?Within that prime age workforce, 25 to 54, about 1 in 5 of people who aren&#x27;t working say that the reason they&#x27;re not working is that they&#x27;re caring for family.And it looks like around 22 percent say that illness or disability prevents them from working. I wonder if that number will increase with people dealing with long COVID?It&#x27;s hard to say so far with these numbers. This is an annual dataset … from 2021. So it&#x27;s hard to get a precise read on that. Certainly employment rates did go down from 2021 with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic disruptions. But it&#x27;s too early to say what are going to be the long-term impacts on employment rates based on the COVID pandemic and long COVID. You also looked at who is out of the workforce because of illness or disability and their education level. And the findings may surprise folks.If you look at this whole prime age population overall, just over 1 percent of people with college degrees in this prime age group are currently not working due to health reasons. But that&#x27;s over 8 percent for people who don&#x27;t have a college degree. And this doesn&#x27;t mean that there&#x27;s something about having that diploma that makes you less likely to get hurt. More likely it has something to do with the correlation about the type of jobs that people with and without college degrees are doing and the perhaps more physically stressful blue collar jobs out there that might be more likely to lead to health issues or to be unable to be performed by people with health issues.When we look at this report in total, I&#x27;m wondering what should policymakers take away from it? What should business owners take away from it?The most striking thing to me when I sat down and looked at this, just trying to get a handle on what was this big picture: Who is not working? Most people, especially in Minnesota, are working and most of the people who aren&#x27;t working say they&#x27;re happy not working. But there is that key group of about one in five non-workers who are actually looking for a job or the right job. And there&#x27;s also another group of people who aren&#x27;t looking for a job, but who say they&#x27;d like a job if the circumstances were right. This totals about one in three people who don&#x27;t have a job who say they&#x27;d like one, whether or not they&#x27;re actively trying. So there are people out there who would like to get into the workforce and the right situation. It&#x27;s up to employers and job seekers to try to find the right match to get these people who say they want to work, into the workforce.",

        "description": "The Pirates have made a couple of waiver claims today, per Justice delos Santos of MLB.com. They&#8217;ve grabbed catcher Zack Collins from the Blue Jays and reliever Junior Fernández from the Cardinals. Both players have been optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis. The Bucs already opened up one 40-man roster spot earlier today by designating infielder Josh VanMeter for assignment, but have opened another by designating left-hander Cam Vieaux.\nCollins, 27, was traded to the Blue Jays in early April, with fellow catcher Reese McGuire going to the White Sox. Part of the appeal of that trade for the Jays was the fact that Collins was still optionable, whereas McGuire wasn&#8217;t. As such, Collins has been bounced between the majors and the minors a few times, with Danny Jansen and Alejandro Kirk getting the bulk of the playing time in the bigs. While in the majors, Collins has added a bit of pop but also his share of strikeouts. He&#8217;s hit four home runs in 26 games, slashing .194/.266/.417 for a wRC+ of 93 while going down on strikes in 39.2% of his plate appearances. In 36 Triple-A games, he&#8217;s struck out 25.8% of the time but walked at an incredible 20.6% rate, producing a batting line of .195/.361/.398, wRC+ of 107.\nFor the Pirates, he can be optioned for the remainder of this year but will be out of options next season. The catching job in Pittsburgh is fairly wide open, as Roberto Perez was supposed to be the everyday guy this year until he required season-ending hamstring surgery. There&#8217;s apparently mutual interest in a reunion, though he will be a free agent at season&#8217;s end. For the time being, rookie Jason Delay and journeyman Tyler Heineman are on the active roster. Collins won&#8217;t reach arbitration this winter and can be kept around cheaply as long as he continues to hold his roster spot.\nFernández, 25, joins a new organization for the first time, as he has spent his entire career in the Cardinals&#8217; system until now. He&#8217;s logged 50 2/3 innings of MLB action over the past four seasons, producing a 5.51 ERA in that time. Perhaps his best attribute is his ability to get batters to hit the ball into the ground. He has a 49.4% ground ball rate in his time in the majors, including a 60.4% rate this season. For context, the MLB league average is 42.8% this year. Like Collins, he can be optioned for the rest of this season but will be out of options next year. He will also come up short of arbitration this winter and can be kept around for years if the Pirates deem him worthy of a roster spot.\nAs for Vieaux, 28, this is the second time he has been designated for assignment by the Pirates this season. The first time, he cleared waivers and was outrighted. Since the trade deadline has passed, the Pirates will put him on waivers again in the coming days. If he clears again, he will be eligible to reject an outright assignment and elect free agency, as is the right of any player who has previously been outrighted in their career. He&#8217;s only been able to throw 8 2/3 innings in the majors this year, with one especially ugly outing bumping his ERA up to 10.38. In 45 Triple-A innings for the season, he has a 2.80 ERA, 23.7% strikeout rate, 8.3% walk rate and 43.1% ground ball rate.",

        "description": "Benny Sieu-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  It’s been a rough season for Counsell and Stearns. How would you grade their season, and should they remain? After last night’s collapse by the Brewers, discussion on the tenure of manager Craig Counsell reached a critical point. Some fans were angry about Counsell’s decisions in the game, though some fans also still defended Counsell. This hasn’t been limited to just last night’s game, though. Since the trade deadline, and the Brewers decline in August and the start of September, the discussion has been building. It’s also been building for president David Stearns, whose trade deadline moves did not generate much confidence. While the Brewers have made four straight postseason appearances, they have also had three straight exits after one series. \nWith less than a month to go in the season, the Brewers are 8.5 games behind the Cardinals in the NL Central race and 3 games back of both the Phillies and Padres for two of the three Wild Card spots. There are 27 games remaining in the 2022 season. There’s plenty of time for the standings to change, but let’s take a look at where confidence is in the Brewers management right now. How would you grade their performance at this moment in the season? Also, do you think they should remain after this season is done? Vote in the polls below, then join us in the comments to discuss why you voted the way you did.",

Freeland enters the contest with a 7-9 record and a 4.75 ERA.\nThe loss last night in addition to both the Phillies and Padres getting walk-off wins means the Brewers are three games out of the final Wild Card entering Wednesday.

        "description": "Enlarge / The iPhone 14 Pro includes a pill-shaped cutout that resizes dynamically as you use the phone. (credit: Apple)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUPERTINO, Calif.—Apple's new flagship phones have been revealed, and critics of the iPhone's design since 2017 will be happy to see that the company has taken a new approach to the camera and sensor notch at the top of the screen.\n\nInstead of a notch descending from the top of the display, the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max use a pill-shaped cutout several pixels below the bottom to house the selfie camera, 3D sensor, and more. Called the \"dynamic island,\" it takes up less of the screen than the notch by default, but it can resize itself to show different status indicators and other UI elements, blurring the line between the cutout and the rest of the screen. Tapping the dynamic island can also expand it to show more controls or take you to music or calling apps.\n\n    \n            \n    \nThe new iPhone's screen sizes are staying the same, at 6.1 and 6.7-inches, but they have a few all-new features (in addition to returning ones, like the 120 Hz Pro Motion feature). The screens have a maximum brightness of 2000 nits, twice the peak brightness of the iPhone 13 Pro display. And Apple has also added an Apple Watch-esque \"always-on\" display feature that can display the clock, iOS 16's new widgets, and a few other things when your phone isn't being actively used. The display's refresh rate can drop as low as 1 Hz when you're not interacting with it, to save battery life.Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: Apple)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUPERTINO, Calif.—Today at its first indoor, in-person product launch event since the pandemic began, Apple announced the new iPhone 14 lineup.\nLike its predecessor, the basic iPhone 14 has a 6.1-inch OLED screen. But missing is the iPhone mini, the smaller one-handed model that was present in Apple's lineup for the previous two years. That phone didn't sell all that well, so the majority of consumers have spoken: Big phones are the way to go.\nThus, Apple has replaced the mini with the iPhone 14 Plus, with a 6.7-inch screen—the same size as the recent iPhone 12 Max and iPhone 13 Max. Apart from that, though, the specs and features are the same across the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus.Read 18 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

The new H2 chip facilitates enhanced noise cancellation that Apple says is twice as powerful as the previous AirPods Pro. A new adaptive transparency mode can also offer more dynamic tuning to drown out louder things like vehicles or concerts. Personalized spatial audio will also help listeners tune the sound to their ears. Using the iPhone's front-facing TrueDepth camera, listeners can create spatial sound profiles based on the shape of their ears and head.\nThings should also sound cleaner across the range of pitches with a new \"low-distortion\" driver and \"custom\" amplifier that Apple says will improve bass response and clarity at higher pitches. Lastly, on the audio front, voices should be clearer in calls and through transparency modes thanks to Conversation Boost. There will also be smaller silicone tips to fit a wider range of people.Read 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

The Apple Watch Ultra includes deep water resistance (it's EN13319 certified), a siren that can be heard up to 600 feet away, and high-end physical materials. The 49 mm case is composed of \"aerospace titanium,\" while the new \"alpine loop\" wristband combines titanium with woven fabric.\n      \n          \n          \n        \n        \n          The new action button.                  \n        \n      \n      \n  \nApple says that in regular use, the Watch Ultra will last for \"up to 36 hours\" on a single charge, thanks to the \"biggest battery yet\" on an Apple Watch. That battery life could grow to as much as 60 hours via a \"battery optimization setting coming later this fall.\" The lower-power mode will be achieved via \"reduced frequency of GPS and heart rate readings.\" The Ultra's display is also the brightest yet for an Apple Watch, reaching up to 2,000 nits of brightness—though we're still waiting to hear how battery life will be affected by constant use of max brightness.Read 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Sensors on both the underside of the watch and just underneath the display can track changes as small as 0.1° Celsius, Apple claims. Users can be notified of cycle deviations and other aberrations tracked by temperature, heart rate, and cycle logging.\nApple, likely sensing the current US climate, noted that all of that data is end-to-end encrypted.Read 8 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "link": "https://arstechnica.com/?p=1878761",
        "description": "Enlarge / AMD's new naming scheme for Ryzen 7000 laptop CPUs, broken down. (credit: AMD)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEven for someone who pays a lot of attention to them, processor model numbers can be hard to parse. Ideally, each model number would communicate information about the chip's underlying technology and capabilities, making it easy to quickly tell the difference between a new chip and an old chip or a fast chip and a slow chip. But these model numbers also serve a marketing purpose, both for AMD and for PC makers who want to advertise that their systems are using the latest and greatest chips.\nAMD is making an effort to resolve this tension with a revamp of its laptop CPU model numbers, which will go into effect in 2023, when Ryzen 7000-branded laptop processors begin shipping. Here's how AMD breaks it down:\n\n The first digit now indicates the year in which the CPU was launched, with Ryzen 7000 CPUs coming in 2023, Ryzen 8000 in 2024, and Ryzen 9000 in 2025.\nA higher second digit indicates better performance. It will no longer have anything to do with the underlying CPU architecture, as it sometimes does for older chips (Ryzen 5 5500U is Zen 2-based, for example, while Ryzen 5 5600U is Zen 3-based).\nThe third digit will now indicate the CPU architecture being used. A \"1\" means either the original Zen or Zen+, a \"2\" denotes Zen 2, a \"3\" denotes either Zen 3 or Zen 3+, a \"4\" denotes Zen 4, and a \"5\" will refer to the as-yet-unannounced Zen 5.\nThe fourth digit is another loose performance indicator. CPUs ending in \"0\" will be slower, and CPUs ending in \"5\" will be faster (as of this writing, those are the only two numbers in use).\nThe suffix will denote the TDP of the chip, as it currently does. HX-series chips start at 55 W TDPs, Hs-series chips start at 35 W, U-series chips range from 15 to 28 W, e-series chips are 9 W parts targeted at fanless systems, and C-series chips are just U-series chips in Chromebooks instead of Windows PCs.\n\nAMD also provided this slide, showing how the new model numbers will work in practice for the Ryzen 7000 series (which will encompass at least four distinct CPU architectures, from Zen 2 to Zen 4).Read 5 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Google&#8217;s Messages web application is pretty rudimentary and compared to its Android app counterpart, it&#8217;s more utilitarian in nature, but it gets the job done in a pinch. Once the company added a dark mode for it, I was ecstatic! It could be activated by choosing the setting from the vertical three dots &#8220;more&#8221; menu.\n\n\n\nHowever, changing the system theme on your Chromebook or Windows machine as a whole would never automatically tell your messages PWA to follow suit. That&#8217;s all changed now though, and after visiting the Settings section, I discovered that Google has quietly implemented not only a new UI for light and dark mode but also a &#8220;System default&#8221; option which will allow the website to automate the process based on your OS settings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, a new &#8220;High contrast&#8221; mode has been added for accessibility. Although I won&#8217;t be using this one, I can see it being useful for those who have a hard time seeing and differentiating elements on the screen due to their color or saturation.\n\n\n\nThe closer we get to having &#8220;System default&#8221; options available across all of Google&#8217;s web applications, the closer we get to having a unified visual experience. I&#8217;m so sick of Gmail and Calendar being the only bright burning white lights in the room at night when the rest of my apps and websites and pretty much all other elements on the screen respect my preference to have less unnecessary searing eye pain! I hope that these core sites receive this update soon, and it&#8217;s great to see Messages receive it in the meantime.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Photo by Justin Berl/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The offense woke up and ended the Mets losing streak at three. The Mets came into today in a tie for first place in the East with the Braves, the first time since April where they haven’t been alone in first place. They had also dropped three straight to two of the worst teams in the league, so they had a lot to prove coming into today’s doubleheader. Luckily, they had Chris Bassitt taking the mound for the first game, who has been one of their most consistent starters of late. \nThe Mets hit the ground running in the first. A Brandon Nimmo single and Pete Alonso double got them going early, and a Jeff McNeil sacrifice fly got Nimmo in for the Mets first run. They were unable to bring Alonso around to score, but it was a promising start for the Mets who had had issues scoring in the previous three games. In the bottom of the inning Bassitt made quick work of the Pirates lineup, sending the Pirates top of the order down in order, with two strikeouts to start.\nThe Mets started the second quietly, hitting into two quick outs. But then an Eduardo Escobar single and Tomas Nido double had the Mets threatening to score again. But Nimmo flew out to end the inning and leave the Mets still leading by only one run. The Pirates again had a quiet inning in the bottom of the second, with an one-out single giving them their first hit but it being erased with a double play.\nThe Mets went down in order in the top of the third, the first inning of the day where the Mets couldn’t scratch out a hit, but they still held the (skinny) lead. Bassitt had another easy inning, setting down the Pirates in order once again, and getting another strikeout along the way.\nThe Mets offense really came alive in the fourth, starting with a Daniel Vogelbach leadoff single. Then Mark Canha was hit by a pitch, putting two runners on with no outs for Tyler Naquin. Naquin delivered, clubbing a three-run home run to the bullpens in center field, giving the Mets a four-run lead. That wasn’t all though, as Escobar demolished a ball into the stands in right-center, to put the Mets up a towering five runs. The Mets didn’t score anymore that inning, but the lead they garnered was very promising. And with Bassitt dealing as he was, the bottom of the inning continued their dominance. With the exception of a lead-off infield single by Oneil Cruz, Bassitt kept the Pirates at bay.\nThe Mets hit into three straight groundouts in the fifth, but it didn’t feel as bad given their big lead in the game. Bassitt had a great bottom of the sixth, with three strikeouts to send the Pirates down in order once again.\nThe bottom of the Mets lineup went down in order in the top of the sixth, with two strikeouts to boot from Naquin and Nido. In the bottom of the inning, some cracks started to show in Bassitt’s performance. He gave up a leadoff double to Greg Allen, then gave up another single to Tyler Heineman which drove Allen in for the Pirates first run. Bassitt was eventually able to extricate himself from trouble, with a lot of effort and a lot of pitches, leaving the Pirates having only scored one run.\nOther than a leadoff single from Brandon Nimmo, the seventh inning was quiet for the Mets, who didn’t score another run or even get runners in scoring position. Bassitt was still in the game in the bottom of the seventh, and with the exception of a MIchael Chavis one-out double, the Pirates went down without a fight, with two strikeouts bringing Bassitt to ten total on the day.\nIn the eighth, the Mets didn’t do much of anything at the plate. With the exception of a two-out Naquin single, the Mets were unable to hit off Miguel Yajure, brought in to replace Bryse Wilson. In the bottom of the inning, Seth Lugo came in to pitch, ending Bassitt’s outing. And he got through it without much stress, giving up just a single to Oneil Cruz and retiring everyone else, putting the Mets just three outs from a much needed victory.\nIn the ninth, the Mets went down in order in not very inspiring fashion, with every batter striking out against Yajure. But still, they needed just three outs from Seth Lugo to put them back in the win column. And Seth Lugo was able to get it done, with a Michael Chavis two-out single being the only blemish on his otherwise good ninth inning. \nThe Mets snapped their three game losing streak, keeping the Mets from having their first four game losing streak of the year. They also got back to being a half-game over the Braves in first place, at least for a few hours. There’s still a whole other game to play today, but for now, the Mets are feeling good and back to their winning ways.\nSB Nation GameThreads\nAmazin’ AvenueBucs Dugout\nBox scores\nMLB.comESPN\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      FanGraphs\n  \nWhat’s WPA?\nBig Mets winner: Chris Bassitt, +25.0% WPABig Mets loser: Francisco Lindor, -8.0% WPAMets pitchers: +29.6% WPAMets hitters: +20.4% WPATeh aw3s0mest play: Tyler Naquin’s three run home run in the fourth, +16.6% WPATeh sux0rest play: Brandon Nimmo’s two-out fly out in the second, -5.4% WPA",

first lady Michelle Obama on Wednesday took an apparent dig at former President Trump, highlighting the significance of a peaceful transition of power once a presidency comes to an end.\n\n\n\n“You see, the people that make their voices heard with their vote. We hold an inauguration to ensure a peaceful transition of power,” she said at the official portrait unveiling ceremony at the White House for her and former President Obama.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Those of us lucky enough to serve work, as Barack said, as hard as we can for as long as we can, as long as the people choose to keep us here. And, once our time is up, we move on. And all that remains in this hallowed place are our good efforts and these portraits,” the former first lady said.\n\n\n\nPresident Biden hosted the ceremony on Wednesday. Trump had declined to host the Obamas for the unveiling, which is traditionally hosted by first-term presidents for their immediate predecessors. The ceremony, which was then expected last fall, was further pushed back due to COVID-19.\n\n\n\nThe first lady spoke about her humble background and growing up in Chicago, telling the audience that “a girl like me, she was never supposed to be up there next to Jacqueline Kennedy and Dolly Madison.”\n\n\n\n“Even if it’s all still a bit awkward for me, I do recognize why moments like these are important. Why all of this is absolutely necessary. Traditions like this matter. Not just for those of us who hold these positions but for everyone participating in and watching our democracy,” Obama said.\n\n\n\nShe also said that the portraits symbolize telling a “fuller story” that includes “every single American.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd, she stressed the significance of democracy amid a time of divisiveness in the U.S.\n\n\n\n“As much as some folks might want us to believe that that story has lost some of its shine, that division and discrimination and everything else might have dimmed its light, I still know deep in my heart that what we share, as my husband continues to say, is so much bigger than what we don’t. Our democracy is so much stronger than our differences,” Obama said.\n\n\n\nThe former first lady’s name is often floated as a popular potential presidential candidate, especially if Biden chose to not run again in 2024 amid speculation due to his age.\n\n\n\nSome Democrats, polls have suggested, want to see her run. A poll from November showed she was the second lead for a 2024 Democratic candidate if Biden decided not to run, ranking just 3 points behind Vice President Harris.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3632301-dismantling-cryptocurrency-regulations-is-a-step-backward-not-forward/",
        "description": "Until a few years ago, crypto was mostly unknown among the Washington crowd. Those policymakers and lawmakers who knew about this emerging technology were few, and because of its lack of tangibility, many thought of it as a plaything for nerds or a tool for bad actors. In short, crypto was taken seriously by only a select few in Washington.\n\n\n\nToday, crypto has not only shed this misguided perception but has also begun to gain broad acceptance by members of Congress and the general public alike. Crypto is&nbsp;reaching a level of mass adoption&nbsp;among the American people, and there is increased recognition of the benefits that crypto has to offer on both sides of the political aisle.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, both Democrats and Republicans recognize that regulatory clarity is needed. The past year has seen the introduction of&nbsp;three&nbsp;bipartisan&nbsp;bills&nbsp;seeking to bring clear regulation to the crypto industry. Although these efforts to bring regulatory clarity to the crypto industry are encouraging, Congress is not the only governmental body that has “woken up” to crypto and the need for tailored and appropriate regulation in the space.\n\n\n\nRegulatory agencies like the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) have made great efforts to understand the technology and incorporate it into the U.S. regulatory landscape. FinCEN, in&nbsp;guidance&nbsp;published in 2019, established which crypto entities qualify as money services businesses (MSBs) and thus have to comply with the requirements of the Bank Secrecy Act. Similarly, the OCC established prudential regulatory standards for banks doing business with crypto firms through a series of&nbsp;interpretive letters&nbsp;in 2020 and 2021. Interestingly and encouragingly, both the current and previous comptrollers of the currency, one a Republican appointee and the other a Democratic appointee, have worked on and approved of these interpretive letters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlthough crypto is increasingly being brought into the regulatory and legislative fold by bipartisan regulators and members of Congress, there is still lingering suspicion and hesitation, which has led some to push back against all aspects of crypto, including regulatory and legislative efforts like the ones described above. A group of policymakers, for example, recently sent&nbsp;a letter&nbsp;to the OCC requesting that the acting comptroller rescind the aforementioned interpretive letters.\n\n\n\nThe best way forward for crypto and&nbsp;its millions of U.S. users&nbsp;is to embrace appropriate and tailored regulation and the consumer protection and transparency it brings. Regulatory efforts like the OCC’s interpretive letters have paved the way for increased consumer protection and insulation from further negative events associated with the industry and broader economic downturn. Indeed, Acting Comptroller Michael Hsu&nbsp;recently explained: “a whole bunch of stuff just happened, and the banking system is in pretty good shape, knock on wood. I think part of that is the actions we’ve taken.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIncreased regulatory clarity also encourages crypto businesses to do business in the United States, bolstering the economy, growing American jobs and increasing the effectiveness of U.S. national security by augmenting the scope of U.S. sanctions and anti-money laundering laws.\n\n\n\nAs policy and lawmakers continue to grapple with applying U.S. regulatory standards to the crypto ecosystem, efforts should focus not on dismantling current crypto regulations but on filling the regulatory and legal gaps that underscore market turmoil and failures and thus exacerbate consumer losses. Regulatory clarity for the crypto industry is desperately needed. Rather than rescind existing guidance, Washington should issue further regulatory guardrails to allow the crypto industry to do what it does best: innovate.\n\n\n\nLindsey Kelleher is a senior policy manager for Blockchain Association (BA), a Washington, D.C.-based trade association. ",

Her grace, her intelligence, and the fact that she is fine,” Obama said during the unveiling of the portraits in the East Room, prompting loud applause and claps from the audience.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“She is. Her portrait is stunning,” Obama said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe former first lady thanked Obama for his “spicy remarks” shortly thereafter when she stepped up to the podium to deliver her own comments.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMichelle Obama’s portrait was painted by Sprung and captures her wearing a blue gown while sitting on a sofa.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer President Obama also joked that his portrait by Robert McCurdy took on a “much more difficult subject.” He complimented McCurdy for his precision and attention to detail and joked that the painter “talked me out of wearing a tan suit.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nObama's portrait shows the former president wearing a black suit against a white backdrop.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Biden and first lady Jill Biden attended the ceremony to unveil the portraits of the Obamas that will hang in the White House. It marked the Obamas first return to the White House together since they left in early 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer President Obama also visited the White House solo back in April to mark the anniversary of the Affordable Care Act signing.",

Biden praised Barack Obama as one of “the most consequential presidents in our history” as he unveiled the ex-commander in chief and Michelle Obama’s official portraits in a long-delayed ceremony at the White House.\n\n\n\n\"There are a few people I've ever known with more integrity, decency and moral courage than Barack Obama,” Biden said on Wednesday in the East Room — packed with alumni of the Obama administration — as the former first family looked on.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"These portraits have a special significance because, as Joe mentioned, they will hang in the White House alongside portraits of other presidents and first ladies dating back to George and Martha,\" Obama, flanked by his wife, remarked.\n\n\n\nObama’s portrait, by artist Robert McCurdy, shows the former president sporting a black suit and grey tie. The painting was created from photographs taken of Obama by McCurdy, which the White House said the artist preferred over working from sketches based on sittings.\n\n\n\nThe white backgrounds of McCurdy’s portraits “allow the viewer to establish a relationship with the subject,” the White House said, “the focus shifts from the celebrity-status of the individual to the viewer’s direct response to that individual as a human being.”\n\n\n\nSharon Sprung painted the image of Michelle Obama that will hang in the White House. “By methodically manipulating the layers of paint, she works to mimic the complexity of real life in her portrait compositions,” the White House said in a statement about the portraits.\n\n\n\nWhile typically not an eyebrow-raising custom, the tradition of a first-term president unveiling the official portrait of their immediate predecessor was a precedent-shattering casualty of former President Trump's time in office. Trump reportedly declined to host Obama — his longtime political nemesis — for such a ceremony during his term. Obama was also opposed to participating in the tradition with Trump, according to news reports.\n\n\n\nThe first public view of the Obamas' official portraits also faced further delays due to COVID-19. The pair of paintings was originally expected to be revealed last year, but the ceremony was reportedly postponed because of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nThe event marked the first trip back to the White House for Michelle Obama since she was first lady. The former president had returned to the White House in April — his first visit since Biden took office — to promote the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\nThe Obamas' portraits will have a permanent home at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said this week ahead of the ceremony. The artwork, she said, \"will hang on the walls of the White House forever as reminders of the power of hope and change.\"",

Gov. Charlie Baker (R) does not plan to endorse the state’s GOP gubernatorial nominee, who is backed by former President Trump, according to a spokesperson.\n\n\n\n“The Governor and Lt. Governor [Karyn Polito (R)] said months ago they don’t plan to get involved in the gubernatorial election so they can focus solely on finishing strong,” Baker spokesman Jim Conroy confirmed to The Hill. “That’s still the case.”\n\n\n\nFormer state Rep. Geoff Diehl, who had the endorsement of former President Trump, was projected on Tuesday night to win the Republican primary in the Massachusetts governor’s race, beating out moderate businessman Chris Doughty.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDiehl will face Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey (D) in November’s general election race. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the general election race as “solid Democratic.”\n\n\n\nBaker, who announced last year he would not seek a third term, did not endorse in the primary to replace him.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe blue-state Republican governor has critiqued Trump at times, saying he didn’t vote for the former president in 2016 and calling Trump “outrageous” and “disgraceful” in a 2018 debate during Baker’s second gubernatorial campaign.\n\n\n\nBaker was asked about his gubernatorial endorsement during an interview with GBH News’s Boston Public Radio in late July, MassLive reported.\n\n\n\n“I don’t know,” said Baker. “I have a lot of work to do, and I have a day job.”\n\n\n\nBaker isn’t the first outgoing Republican governor to decline to endorse a successor after a Trump-backed candidate won the party's primary. \n\n\n\nMaryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R), who similarly serves in a traditionally blue state and is a frequent critic of Trump, said he will not support state Del. Dan Cox after he won the state’s GOP gubernatorial primary in July.\n\n\n\nHogan has been more forceful in his criticism of his party’s nominee, calling Cox a “QAnon conspiracy theorist.”",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;Over 50 percent of U.S. workers admit to being “quit quitters,” according to a new Gallup Poll.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poll shows that the number of employees who are disengaged with their work has jumped significantly since the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe most disengaged workers are Gen Z employees or younger millennials.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe trend of “quiet quitting” isn’t dying down.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt least 50 percent of U.S. workers are “quiet quitters,” or employees who have chosen to stop going above and beyond in the workplace, according to a new Gallup poll.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWorker engagement began to drop in the latter half of 2021 at the same time thousands of U.S. workers were opting to leave their current jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast year, over 47 million people in the United States voluntarily quit their jobs, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, an unprecedented exit en masse that has become known as The Great Resignation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEngagement among workers dropped again in March with the number of actively disengaged workers jumping to 18 percent while the amount of engaged workers hovered at 32 percent, according to the poll.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ratio of engaged to actively disengaged employees is now at 1.8 to 1, the lowest in almost 10 years.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWorkplace engagement was the lowest among remote Gen Z and younger millennial workers, the poll found.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOverall, the decline in engagement is linked to employees not feeling cared for in the workplace, or issues with clarity of expectations or opportunities to learn and grow.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince the pandemic, the number of younger workers who strongly feel that someone at work cares for them or encourages their development has dropped by 10 percentage points.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd shockingly, only four in 10 remote or hybrid workers under the age of 35 clearly know what is expected of them at work, the poll found.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother reason for a dip in engagement is related to workers connecting to their organization’s mission or purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",

Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) promised on Wednesday to pass a side deal on permitting reform with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to the massive tax, climate and health care bill despite growing opposition from progressive House Democrats.\n\n\n\nSchumer said he will put permitting reform legislation that would speed the development of fossil fuel and other energy projects in the stopgap spending measure Congress needs to pass to keep the federal government funded beyond Sept. 30.\n\n\n\n“Our intention is to add it to the CR,” Schumer told reporters Wednesday, referring to the short-term continuing resolution to fund the government, which he said must get passed this month.\n\n\n\nThe decision will make it tougher for House progressives, who feel little obligation to help Manchin pass one of his top energy development priorities, to block it.\n\n\n\nRep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, has circulated a letter calling for a stand-alone vote on permitting reform measures.\n\n\n\nHe told The Hill last week that 40 House lawmakers have already signed on to the letter.\n\n\n\nBut Schumer told reporters that passing permitting reform was part of the deal he struck with Manchin in July to pass the tax, climate and health care bill known as the Inflation Reduction Act, which included hundreds of billions of dollars in federal investments to combat climate change and increase domestic energy production.\n\n\n\nRachel Frazin contributed.",

Sony isn’t impressed, though, just as Microsoft is in the middle of trying to get its $68.7 billion Activision Blizzard deal approved by regulators.\n“Microsoft has only offered for Call of Duty to remain on PlayStation for three years after the current agreement between Activision and Sony ends,” explains PlayStation chief Jim Ryan in a statement to Games Industry.biz. “After almost 20 years of Call of Duty on PlayStation,...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

Not a SIM tray in sight. | Photo by Allison Johnson / The Verge\n    \n\n  The new iPhone 14 lineup will ship without physical SIM trays — but only in the US. They’ll be able to use two eSIMs at once (and store more than that), but is the lack of a physical tray a big deal? And is it user-hostile and stupid? \nFirst, a refresher on eSIMs: they’re SIM cards, but electronic, not physical. That means your phone can be provisioned remotely — no more going to a store to get a physical SIM. This makes it easier (in some ways) to switch networks or try one out — T-Mobile now uses eSIMs to let people test-drive its network for up to three months. As of iOS 16, you can even transfer your eSIM between iPhones via Bluetooth, which should make it almost as easy as a physical SIM — as long as you’re staying in the Apple...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "The Cardinals announced a series of roster moves today, placing outfielder Dylan Carlson on the 10-day injured with a left thumb sprain. His spot on the roster has gone to fellow outfielder Alec Burleson. Since Burleson wasn&#8217;t previously on the 40-man roster, outfielder Conner Capel has been designated for assignment to open a spot.\nBurleson, 23, was selected by the Cardinals 70th overall in the 2020 draft. There were no minor leagues for him to play in that year due to the pandemic, but he took off in 2021. He started in High-A and mashed his way up to Double-A after just 11 games. In 63 games with the Springfield Cardinals, he hit .288/.333/.488, producing a wRC+ of 116. That was enough to get him up to Triple-A for the end of the season, his third level of the year.\nWhile Burleson struggled in his first taste of Triple-A, he&#8217;s dominated here in 2022. In 109 games with the Memphis Redbirds, he&#8217;s hit 20 home runs while striking out in only 14.3% of his plate appearances. His slash line on the year is .331/.372/.532, leading to a wRC+ of 138.\nThanks to his strong performance in the minors, Burleson has been creeping up prospect lists since his draft. Last year, Baseball America ranked him the #26 prospect in the Cards&#8217; system, before bumping him up to #10 at the start of this year and #4 at the midseason update. BA also considers him the #66 prospect in the entire league.\nAs for Carlson, it&#8217;s unclear when or how he sustained his injury, as he entered last night&#8217;s game in the eighth inning as a pinch hitter. The club has not yet provided any information on how long they expect him to be out. He&#8217;s hitting .240/.316/.386 for the year, producing a wRC+ of 102. He&#8217;s played mostly center field this season but has seen Tyler O&#8217;Neill take over the bulk of the playing time up the middle lately. Burleson has mostly played left field in the minors, with a bit of time in right as well. He&#8217;ll try to replace Carlson&#8217;s bat and take some corner outfield time but likely won&#8217;t be an option in center, leaving that spot for O&#8217;Neill and Ben DeLuzio.\nAs for Capel, 25, he was drafted by Cleveland but came to the Cardinals in the 2018 trade that sent Oscar Mercado the other way. He was selected to the big league roster for the first time this June, producing a tepid batting line in a tiny sample of just 19 plate appearances. In 87 Triple-A games, he&#8217;s hit .258/.361/.425 for a 112 wRC+. He&#8217;s shown strong work at the plate in that stretch, striking out in just 16.4% of his plate appearances while walking in 13.3% of them. He&#8217;s also popped 1o homers and stolen 19 bases.\nDespite some signs of optimism there, it seems Capel has been nudged out of the plans in St. Louis. Since the trade deadline has passed, the Cards will place him on outright waivers or release waivers in the coming days. Given his full slate of options and limited service time, he could prove to be an intriguing option for the 29 other clubs.",

        "description": "5:30pm: The Sox have now made it official, per Chris Cotillo of MassLive. Almonte has been selected with Cordero going on the 60-day IL. He won&#8217;t be eligible to return this season.\n3:50pm: The Red Sox are going to select outfielder Abraham Almonte to their roster for tonight&#8217;s game, according to Pete Abraham of the Boston Globe. Almonte isn&#8217;t yet on the 40-man roster, meaning corresponding moves will be required. It&#8217;s possible that outfielder Franchy Cordero will head to the 10-day or maybe even the 60-day injured list. Abraham reported yesterday that Cordero has a sprain on both sides of his ankle and could be done for the season.\nOnce Almonte gets into a game, it will be the 10th straight season of MLB action for the 33-year-old. He&#8217;s spent time with Seattle, San Diego, Cleveland, Kansas City, Arizona and Atlanta. In 440 career games, he&#8217;s hit .223/.302/.374 for a wRC+ of 83. This year, he signed a minor league deal with the Brewers and went to the Red Sox in a July trade. He&#8217;s been having a great year down on the farm, hitting .293/.417/.534 across 80 Triple-A games. That amounts to a 154 wRC+.\nDespite his years of experience, he&#8217;s only accrued four years and 155 days of MLB service time. Should he carry any of that tremendous minor league production up to the big leagues with him, the Red Sox could keep him around for another season via arbitration. He&#8217;ll step into an outfield mix that includes Alex Verdugo, Tommy Pham, Enrique Hernández and Rob Refsnyder.\nThat mix won&#8217;t include Cordero for now, as he injured himself crashing into the wall at Tropicana Field on Monday, having to be carted off the field. The 28-year-old has gotten into 84 games on the season, hitting .219/.300/.397 for a wRC+ of 93. Like Almonte, he can be retained for 2023 via arbitration, should the Sox decide to tender him a contract.",

        "description": "Sadler’s Wells, LondonThe Belgian choreographer’s interpretation of the great keyboard work is a rich, carefully crafted essayAnne Teresa de Keersmaeker is not someone you expect to see dancing in silver sequined hotpants: a high queen of choreographic seriousness and an austere presence on stage. This solo is both a departure from and a distillation of what we know of the Belgian choreographer. Her 42 years of work has spanned starkly formal early pieces, shimmering group dances and sober solos, all wedded to the details of musical structures.In this case the music is Bach’s late masterpiece The Goldberg Variations, and it’s not really a solo, because her stage is shared with pianist Pavel Kolesnikov. In white vest, black shorts and bare feet, he sits with his back to the audience – he’s playing for her, not us – introducing the music’s theme with divine delicacy. Kolesnikov’s playing dances and sings as De Keersmaeker provides some profound listening experiences, standing still to let Bach breathe, even cutting the lights in mournful variation 25 to cocoon us in sound.

        "description": "As we all prepare for the fall back to school/back to work season, I thought I&#8217;d touch on a topic that has been top of mind for me for the last six months.\n\n\n\nThe covid pandemic taught many of us that we can be productive and our companies can succeed in a fully remote work environment. But just because you can does not mean you should.\n\n\n\nIn the venture capital business, this has meant making investments in teams we don&#8217;t meet face to face. For founders, this has meant raising rounds from their offices instead of getting on planes.\n\n\n\nAs the pandemic has eased and offices have gradually reopened over the last year, we are meeting more founders face to face. But we have not gone back to a world where we meet every team we back in person. I don&#8217;t think we will ever go fully back to that world.\n\n\n\nBut even if the way we work has changed permanently, it does not mean that it has changed for the better. I believe that all change has positive and negative impacts. We can meet more founders than we used to. And founders can meet more investors. That is good. But matches are now being made over video and that is not always great. \n\n\n\nWe know that humans are better to each other in person. We know that in-person interaction is more meaningful, we are more present, and we connect in more fundamental ways.\n\n\n\nSo I believe that we must work in the coming years to get out of our offices (or homes) and see each other in person more often. \n\n\n\nThat means we should run fundraising processes that include meeting in person. We can do the initial screens (on both sides) over zoom, but the final selection process should include face-to-face meetings whenever possible. And board meetings should be done in person at least a few times a year. And those in-person meetings should include some social time in addition to business.\n\n\n\nFor companies, this means hiring should include a face-to-face meeting. Teams should meet in person regularly. Going to the office should be a regular occurrence for those that live near one.\n\n\n\nIt is time to get back to the office, at least some of the time. It will make for better business. And I also think it will make us happier at work.\nUSV TEAM POSTS:",

We pick areas that we think will present interesting investment opportunities over the next five to ten years and then spend time researching them. We like to talk to lots of experts, academics, investors, entrepreneurs, and industry.  We generally spend a few months on these deep dives and then present them to the rest of the team so that everyone at USV will be somewhat fluent in the topic area and can flag interesting things that fit what is interesting to us.\n\n\n\nDeep dives are not so much about areas we&#8217;ve been investing in, although we sometimes do that to refresh a thesis. Deep dives are generally about new areas that are just starting to percolate and appear interesting to us.\n\n\n\nThis summer all of the USV partners picked one or two (in one case three) areas to do deep dives on. As the market has cooled down, we&#8217;ve found the time to take on some primary research.\n\n\n\nI&#8217;ve been looking into nuclear reactors and batteries with the lens of how small is possible. Could we make a nuclear reactor or battery that fits in our home? Could we make a nuclear reactor or battery that we carry with us like a phone?\n\n\n\nI know these ideas seem preposterous but that&#8217;s exactly the kind of questions we like to ask ourselves. Often we find out that the idea is as nutty as it seems but we bump into something else along the way that is even more interesting.\n\n\n\nSo if you know something about my research topic or know someone who does send me an email.

Post Twitter, I moved to posting daily for a decade, and then I have gradually slowed the pace to a post a week in the last few years.\n\n\n\nJoe also shows how the topics have changed over the years:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile that is directionally correct, I am not sure the TD-IF methodology he uses is that insightful.

        "title": "The Merge",
        "link": "https://avc.com/2022/08/the-merge/",
        "description": "In about a month, an important moment will happen in the world of crypto/web3. The Ethereum blockchain will move from a proof of work consensus mechanism to a proof of stake consensus mechanism. This event is known as &#8220;The Merge&#8221; in Ethereum land.\n\n\n\nThere are many reasons why this is an important moment for the world of crypto/web3, but to my mind the most important reasons are:\n\n\n\n1/ The Merge reduces the carbon footprint of the Ethereum blockchain very significantly. No longer will miners be required to run large energy-intensive compute facilities to secure the Ethereum blockchain. There are many people out there who have serious concerns about web3 over environmental reasons. We can argue about that and have, but The Merge takes the concern off the table for the largest and most used smart contract blockchain. This is a big deal.\n\n\n\n2/ The supply/demand balance of the Ethereum token will change dramatically. In a proof of work system, miners spend significant sums of money to run large energy-intensive compute facilities to secure the chain. They are rewarded with tokens (in Ethereum&#8217;s case, these are Ethereum tokens) and they must sell most of these tokens to pay their electric bills and hardware costs. In a proof of stake system, validators stake significant amounts of the base token (in Ethereum&#8217;s case, these are Ethereum tokens) and risk losing them if a bad transaction is validated. There is very little cost associated with staking so the tokens that are earned from staking are mostly held/re-staked instead of sold. I have seen a lot of estimates of how this shift will play out and my take is that Ethereum will move from a system that has roughly $20mm a day of structural outflows to a system that has roughly a half a million dollars a day of structural inflows. This shift in supply/demand will likely result in a very different dynamic for ETH/USDC, ETH/USD, and ETC/BTC (and other ETH pairs too) going forward.\n\n\n\n3/ Proof of Stake systems (of which they are many in the market already like Solana, Avalanche, etc) are considered more secure because the likelihood of a 51% attack is much lower. I don&#8217;t plan to lay out the argument here, but suffice it to say that Ethereum is moving to a consensus mechanism that many consider to be more resistant to attack, making it even more secure than it has been.\n\n\n\nThere are some interesting side effects of this event. The current Ethereum proof of work blockchain will not go away. This chain, which many are calling ETH POW, could develop a community around it and live on and provide value to developers and others. This has already happened in the Bitcoin community a few times and once before in the Ethereum community. Holders of ETH at the time of The Merge will receive ETH POW tokens as a result of this fork. These ETH POW tokens could be worthless in time or worth a lot in time. There is really no way to know how ETH POW will develop.\n\n\n\nThe Merge is probably the most important change that a large scaled blockchain has ever undergone. It is not without risk and there is a chance that things will not go smoothly. The Ethereum core developers have been working on this effort for many years and have deployed many testnets and they are confident they can pull this off next month. The crypto/web3 world will be watching closely and I am rooting for them. I think this is a very important moment for the sector and that it will be very positive if things work as planned.\n\n\n\nDisclosure: My family and USV have large holdings in ETH and other crypto assets and may continue to add to them in the coming weeks, months, and years.\nUSV TEAM POSTS:",

        "description": "When fundraising gets tougher for startups, the existing investors (insiders) will often provide a bridge loan to the company to extend the runway for getting another round done. There is more of this sort of thing happening in today&#8217;s fundraising market and I thought I&#8217;d share some of the things I have learned about setting up bridge loans.\n\n\n\nFirst, bridge loans are a bridge to something else. Most commonly they are a bridge to a round of financing with new investors (outsiders). They can also be a bridge to the sale of the company. Occasionally, but not often, they can be a bridge to getting cash flow positive. If none of those things is going to happen in a relatively short period of time, then it is a bridge to nowhere and you really want to avoid that. A bridge to another bridge is never a good thing and should be avoided at all costs.\n\n\n\nAn alternative to a bridge is an &#8220;insider round&#8221; where the existing investors provide sufficient capital to fund the business for eighteen to twenty-four months. That is a real round of financing and it is not a bridge. While that can sometimes be the right answer for a startup, I strongly prefer bringing new investors/new capital into a company in every financing round. New investors strengthen the investor syndicate which makes the company more resilient. New investors bring new ideas, new experiences, and new sources of funding to the business. New investors in every round are a very good thing and I like to try for that whenever possible.\n\n\n\nSo let&#8217;s say your company really wants to bring new investors into the business with another round, but it is taking longer. But you and your investors are confident that the new round will happen. Then a bridge is a good idea.\n\n\n\nHere is how I like to structure a bridge:\n\n\n\nAll material existing investors should participate, ideally &#8220;pro-rata&#8221;, meaning the investors participate based on their respective ownership interests. When you have an existing investor that owns a large percentage of the business and they won&#8217;t or can&#8217;t participate, you have a problem. You can get a bridge done in these circumstances but it will be painful because nobody likes to &#8220;carry&#8221; a large existing investor who can&#8217;t support the business.The ideal structure is a convertible note, with nominal interest, and a discount upon conversion into the next round of financing.I like the discounts to be based on the amount of time the bridge note is outstanding. This creates an incentive to get the round done quickly, which is what everyone wants in this situation. It is also easier to explain the discount to the new investors in the next round when the discount is small if the bridge has not been outstanding for long. And it is understandable if the discount is larger when the bridge has been outstanding for a longer time period.I like to start with a 5% discount and cap the discount at 25%. The ideal discount is between 10% and 20% and so the time frame for the various discounts should be set with that in mind.A very important consideration in structuring a bridge loan is what happens if the company is sold when the note is outstanding. If the bridge documents do not specify anything in this situation, the noteholders will only get their money back, plus interest, in a sale. That is not really appropriate given that they are providing the capital to get the company to a sale, and so I like a premium to be paid in the event of a sale. I like somewhere between 2x and 3x depending on the circumstances.\n\n\n\nWhen it is time for a bridge, the lead investor, which is typically the investor with the largest capital invested and largest ownership, should &#8220;step up&#8221;, suggest terms, and work with the investor syndicate to come together and provide a bridge loan. That kind of leadership is very important when fundraising gets harder. The startups that have strong leads will do a lot better in tough times and this is a really good example of why that is.\nUSV TEAM POSTS:",

        "link": "https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2022/08/10/recommendations-for-updating-the-ftcs-disclosure-guidelines-to-combat-dark-patterns/",
        "description": "Last week, CITP’s Tech Policy Clinic, along with Dr. Jennifer King, brought leading interdisciplinary academic researchers together to provide recommendations to the Federal Trade Commission on how it should update the 2013 version of its online digital advertising guidelines (the “Disclosure Guidelines”). This post summarizes the comment’s main takeaways.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe focus on how the FTC should address the growing problem of “dark patterns,” also known as “manipulative designs.” Dark patterns are user interface techniques that benefit an online service by leading consumers into making decisions they might not otherwise make. Some dark patterns deceive consumers, while others exploit cognitive biases or shortcuts to manipulate or coerce them into choices that are not in their best interests. Dark patterns have been an important focus of research at CITP, as noted in two widely cited papers, “Measurement Methods and Dark Patterns at Scale: Findings from a Crawl of 11K Shopping Websites,” and “What Makes a Dark Pattern&#8230; Dark?: Design Attributes, Normative Considerations.”\n\n\n\nAs documented in several research studies, consumers may encounter dark patterns in many online contexts, such as when making choices to consent to the disclosure of personal information or to cookies, when interacting with services and applications like games or content feeds that seek to capture and extend consumer attention and time spent, and in e-commerce, including&nbsp;at multiple points along a purchasing journey. Dark patterns may start with the advertising of a product or service, and can be present across&nbsp;the whole customer path, including sign-up, purchase, and cancellation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGiven this landscape, we argue that FTC should provide guidance that covers the business’s entire interaction with the consumer to ensure that they are allowed to engage in free and informed transactions. Importantly, we highlight why the guidance needs to squarely address the challenge that providing additional disclosures, standing alone, will not cure the harms caused by a number of dark patterns.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOur key recommendations include the following:\n\n\n\nOffer consumers symmetric choices at crucial decision-making points. And offer that parity for crucial decision-making points across different modes of accessing the service so that consumers can exercise the same choices whether they are using web applications, mobile applications, or new forms of augmented reality applications.&nbsp;Do not preselect choices that favor the interest of the service provider at the expense of the consumer.&nbsp;Disclose material information in a manner that allows consumers to make informed decisions. Consider a heightened requirement to present information in a manner that serves the best interest of the consumer at critical decision points.Follow ethical design principles when designing their interfaces. Such principles include taking account how different demographics, especially vulnerable populations, may interact with an interface by testing the usability and comprehensibility of interfaces across the different demographics.&nbsp;Disclose if and when businesses use personal data to shape the online choice architecture for users.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOur comments also draw attention to how consumer protection authorities across different countries are addressing dark patterns. While each jurisdiction operates in its unique context, there is a growing set of strategies to counteract the negative effects of dark patterns that are worth drawing lessons from as the FTC develops its own guidance.\n\n\n\nWe also caution that legalistic, long form disclosures are not read or understood by the average consumer. In other words, relying on boilerplate disclosures alone will not cure most dark patterns. Instead, we point to&nbsp; studies that demonstrate how disclosures shown close to the time of the decision and relevant to that decision are a lot more effective in educating consumers about their choices. As a way forward, we recommend that consumer-centered disclosures should be (1) relevant to the context of transaction, (2) understandable by the respective consumer audience/segment, and (3) actionable, in that the disclosure needs to be associated with the ability to express an informed decision.\n\n\n\nTo read our comment in its entirety, as well as those of other commentators such as a broad coalition of state attorneys general, please visit the FTC’s docket.",

        "description": "We have been watching our portfolio of ~130 technology companies wrestle with this decision for the last two and a half years. Brought on by the covid pandemic and the work from home moment that it created, there has been a sea change in the way that technology companies organize themselves to get work done.\n\n\n\nBen Horowitz observed this in a piece last week where he described A16Z&#8217;s decision to embrace a hybrid model that he called &#8220;HQ in the Cloud.&#8221;\n\n\n\nIt turns out that running a technology company remotely works pretty darned well. It’s not perfect, but mitigating the cultural issues associated with remote work turns out to be easier than mitigating the employee satisfaction issues associated with forcing everyone into the office 5 days/week. https://a16z.com/2022/07/21/a16z-is-moving-to-the-cloud/\n\n\n\nMost people are happier having a lot of flexibility around where they work. We have seen that people who are raising families have benefitted from the flexibility of working closer to where their families are and the ability to be somewhere quickly. But that is only one example of why flexibility around where you work is so powerful. Many job functions require, or at least benefit from, the ability to concentrate without interruption or distraction. A quiet home office is vastly better than a busy open workspace for that kind of work.\n\n\n\nAnd then there is the commute. I am writing this on a commuter train heading into NYC. For a time in my life, I took a train like this into the city every morning at 6am and got back on it to go home at 6pm. It was almost an hour each way, so I spent almost two hours a day, five days a week, commuting. This can be a productive time, particularly if you are commuting on mass transit like I am right now, but many people don&#8217;t have convenient mass transit options in their lives and must drive to and from work, often in traffic. Eliminating the need to commute to the office might be the single best reason that people are happier having a lot of flexibility around where they work.\n\n\n\nThe numbers are telling. As of this spring, only 38% of NYC office workers were in their office on a given day based on this survey by the Partnership For NYC (a leading business group in NYC). The numbers are similar in the Bay Area and Los Angeles. Some cities around the US have much higher numbers but I have not seen any city higher than 70% on this score.\n\n\n\nThe Partnership concluded that remote work is here to stay:\n\n\n\nRemote work is here to stay, with 78% of employers indicating a hybrid office model will be their predominant post-pandemic policy, up from just 6% pre-pandemic.https://pfnyc.org/research/return-to-office-survey-results-may-2022/\n\n\n\nBut I want to return to Ben&#8217;s quote and talk about the cultural issues. I don&#8217;t believe we (the tech sector broadly) have done a good job of &#8220;mitigating the cultural issues with remote work.&#8221;  I think a lot of the challenging morale and retention situations in our portfolio and across the tech sector suggest the opposite is true. \n\n\n\nHere is the quandry we face: \n\n\n\nPeople are happier with flexibility around where they work. Companies, teams, and organizations are happier when people are working together. \n\n\n\nAren&#8217;t companies just collections of people? Yes. But groups of happier people are less happy together when they don&#8217;t get the face time that makes group dynamics easier.\n\n\n\nWe all know that people are nicer to each other in person. Email and slack and zoom don&#8217;t bring out the best in people. Having a meal together does.\n\n\n\nSo what should we do about this quandry? \n\n\n\nI don&#8217;t think the answer is restricting flexibility around where people work. That feels like table stakes now for knowledge workers. I think the answer is figuring out how to get people back together more frequently in ways they want to convene in person.\n\n\n\nThere are many ways to do this and we have seen some good ones.\n\n\n\nAt USV, we have two days a week where we meet together and as a group with founders (Mondays and Thursdays) and those days tend to be much more popular to be in the office. We don&#8217;t require people to come to the office on those days, but we do see that most people opt into coming in those days. We also make sure to order a great lunch on Mondays and Thursdays. We could and probably should add an after-work happy hour and/or sports teams/leagues to make those days even more attractive to the team. The basic idea is to make coming to the office an attractive option a few days a week.\n\n\n\nOne USV portfolio CEO suggested a great idea in a CEO zoom we organized on this topic a year or so ago. He said that he wanted his teams to come together for a week at the start of a project and again for a week at the end of a project. He wanted them to be together to kick it off and again to ship it. I think that&#8217;s a great idea and have been encouraging the teams that I work with to do that.\n\n\n\nOur portfolio companies used to do exec team offsites a few times a year. A few of them are now doing them monthly. That makes sense to me. I can&#8217;t imagine an effective exec team that isn&#8217;t in person together at least once a month. And yet so many of the exec teams I have exposure to are not spending nearly enough time together right now and have not for the last few years. This same thought can be extrapolated to any team in any company.\n\n\n\nThose are just some examples of things that can be done and should be done to get people working together again in an age of remote work that is not going to end. I am sure there are many other great techniques and if you lead a company and/or an HR team, you should be collecting and using as many of them as you can right now.\n\n\n\nAt USV, we feel pretty strongly that getting people back to working together in person is important to the success of our portfolio companies and the broader tech sector. So we recently opened our new office in NYC that is designed to host individuals and teams from our portfolio and the broader tech ecosystem that need somewhere nice to work together. Think WeWork meets SohoHouse meets VC firm. We are still working out the kinks this summer and plan to open it up more broadly in the fall. Stay tuned for more on that here and elsewhere.\n\n\n\nAll change has good and bad downstream effects. The broad-based adoption of remote work in the tech sector (and beyond) is allowing people to balance work and home life in ways that are extremely beneficial to them. But team morale and the broader cultural needs of companies have suffered and we need to recognize that and address it. We can&#8217;t accept that as the new norm. It is unacceptable the way it is right now. A hybrid model that provides continued flexibility while creating a lot more face time is the long-term answer and we must keep innovating until we find the right balance. \n\n\n\n\nUSV TEAM POSTS:",

        "description": "Why are our computer systems so complex and so insecure?&nbsp; For years I’ve been trying to explain my understanding of this question. Here’s one explanation–which happens to be in the context of voting computers, but it’s a general phenomenon about all our computers:\n\n\n\nThere are many layers between the application software that implements an electoral function and the transistors inside the computers that ultimately carry out computations. These layers include the election application itself (e.g., for voter registration or vote tabulation); the user interface; the application runtime system; the operating system (e.g., Linux or Windows); the system bootloader (e.g., BIOS or UEFI); the microprocessor firmware (e.g., Intel Management Engine); disk drive firmware; system-on-chip firmware; and the microprocessor’s microcode. For this reason, it is difficult to know for certain whether a system has been compromised by malware. One might inspect the application-layer software and confirm that it is present on the system’s hard drive, but any one of the layers listed above, if hacked, may substitute a fraudulent application layer (e.g., vote-counting software) at the time that the application is supposed to run. As a result, there is no technical mechanism that can ensure that every layer in the system is unaltered and thus no technical mechanism that can ensure that a computer application will produce accurate results. [Securing the Vote, page 89-90]\n\n\n\nSo, computers are insecure because they have so many complex layers.\n\n\n\nBut that doesn’t explain why there are so many layers, and why those layers are so complex–even for what “should be a simple thing” like counting up votes.\n\n\n\nRecently I came across a really good explanation: a keynote talk by Thomas Dullien entitled “Security, Moore’s law, and the anomaly of cheap complexity” at CyCon 2018, the 10th International Conference on Cyber Conflict, organized by NATO.\n\n\n\nThomas Dullien&#8217;s talk video is here, but if you want to just read the slides, they are here.\n\n\n\nAs Dullien explains,\n\n\n\nA modern 2018-vintage CPU contains a thousand times more transistors than a 1989-vintage microprocessor.&nbsp; Peripherals (GPUs, NICs, etc.) are objectively getting more complicated at a superlinear rate. In his experience as a cybersecurity expert, the only thing that ever yielded real security gains was controlling complexity.&nbsp; His talk examines the relationship between complexity and failure of security, and discusses the underlying forces that drive both.\n\n\n\nTransistors-per-chip is still increasing every year; there are 3 new CPUs per human per year.&nbsp; Device manufacturers are now developing their software even before the new hardware is released.&nbsp; Insecurity in computing is growing faster than security is improving.\n\n\n\nThe anomaly of cheap complexity.&nbsp; For most of human history, a more complex device was more expensive to build than a simpler device.&nbsp; This is not the case in modern computing. It is often more cost-effective to take a very complicated device, and make it simulate simplicity, than to make a simpler device.&nbsp; This is because of economies of scale: complex general-purpose CPUs are cheap.&nbsp; On the other hand, custom-designed, simpler, application-specific devices, which could in principle be much more secure, are very expensive.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is driven by two fundamental principles in computing: Universal computation, meaning that any computer can simulate any other; and Moore’s law, predicting that each year the number of transistors on a chip will grow exponentially.&nbsp; ARM Cortex-M0 CPUs cost pennies, though they are more powerful than some supercomputers of the 20th century.\n\n\n\nThe same is true in the software layers.&nbsp; A (huge and complex) general-purpose operating system is free, but a simpler, custom-designed, perhaps more secure OS would be very expensive to build.&nbsp; Or as Dullien asks, “How did this research code someone wrote in two weeks 20 years ago end up in a billion devices?”\n\n\n\nThen he discusses hardware supply-chain issues: “Do I have to trust my CPU vendor?”&nbsp; He discusses remote-management infrastructures (such as the “Intel Management Engine” referred to above):&nbsp; “In the real world, ‘possession’ usually implies ‘control’. In IT, ‘possession’ and ‘control’ are decoupled. Can I establish with certainty who is in control of a given device?”\n\n\n\nHe says, “Single bitflips can make a machine spin out of control, and the attacker can carefully control the escalating error to his advantage.”&nbsp; (Indeed, I’ve studied that issue myself!)\n\n\n\nDullien quotes the science-fiction author Robert A. Heinlein:\n\n\n\n“How does one design an electric motor? Would you attach a bathtub to it, simply because one was available? Would a bouquet of flowers help? A heap of rocks? No, you would use just those elements necessary to its purpose and make it no larger than needed &#8212; and you would incorporate safety factors. Function controls design.”  Heinlein, The Moon Is A Harsh Mistress\n\n\n\nand adds, “Software makes adding bathtubs, bouquets of flowers, and rocks, almost free. So that’s what we get.”\n\n\n\nDullien concludes his talk by saying, “When I showed the first [draft of this talk] to some coworkers they said, ‘you really need to end on a more optimistic note.”  So Dullien gives optimism a try, discussing possible advances in cybersecurity research; but still he gives us only a 10% chance that society can get this right.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPostscript:  Voting machines are computers of this kind.  Does their inherent insecurity mean that we cannot use them for counting votes?  No. The consensus of election-security experts, as presented in the National Academies study, is: we should use optical-scan voting machines to count paper ballots, because those computers, when they are not hacked, are much more accurate than humans.  But we must protect against bugs, against misconfigurations, against hacking, by always performing risk-limiting audits, by hand, of an appropriate sample of the paper ballots that the voters marked themselves.",

        "link": "https://avc.com/2022/07/valuing-a-venture-capital-portfolio/",
        "description": "Every quarter our firm goes through a process to value our entire portfolio. Those values, on a schedule of investments we publish to our investors every quarter, flow through to our financial statements and capital accounts and establish how much an interest in our partnerships are worth at that time.\n\n\n\nWe have always taken this process very seriously and approach it with a lot of rigor. Every partner is highly engaged with this process. Although we have a fantastic financial team at USV, we do not simply outsource valuing the portfolio to them because we understand that those who are closest to the portfolio companies will have the best view of what they are worth.\n\n\n\nWe have a few rules and I would like to share them:\n\n\n\n&#8211; Be conservative. The auditors try to get us to mark our portfolio up to reflect &#8220;market prices&#8221; but we prefer to keep our portfolio marked below market prices, particularly in times of market froth. This leads to a fair bit of haggling with our auditors that is mostly a waste of everyone&#8217;s time but we feel that it is important to maintain our conservative posture.\n\n\n\n&#8211; Get Ahead of Market Pullbacks. We like to move quickly to take our marks down when we see the market environment changing. Public stocks often lead private valuations by several quarters so we like to look to public market comparables and mark down quickly.\n\n\n\n&#8211; Never Mark Higher Than Potential Sale Value. Every time we have a significant M&amp;A exit in our portfolio, I like to check that the proceeds to USV exceed our current mark. I believe we have always met that test. I hope we always do.\n\n\n\n&#8211; Take Total or Partial Write-Downs In Advance of Problems. When a company is having real issues, we like to take total or partial write downs. We sometimes reverse them if the company recovers. If you might lose money on an investment, it is always best to signal that ahead of time.\n\n\n\n&#8211; Have Multiple Sets Of Eyes On The Marks. We debate and discuss the marks with each other. This is all about getting multiple sets of eyes on the marks. While the partner closest to the company will always have the best sense of value, debating and discussing often leads to a better answer. We do this in everything we do at USV. It&#8217;s a huge part of our culture.\n\n\n\nValuing a private investment or a portfolio of private investments is an inexact exercise. Because there is no liquid market for most of our positions, we don&#8217;t really know what someone would pay for them right now. So we do the best we can, take a very conservative posture, and revisit them quarterly. That has worked well for us over the years.\n\n\n\nQ1 of this year was a down quarter for USV and we expect we will see additional markdowns in Q2. But our markdowns have not been as steep as the decline in the Nasdaq over the last six months. That is because we maintained a conservative bias throughout the last few years and resisted the efforts of some to get us to behave differently. And that feels good and right to me.\nUSV TEAM POSTS:",

        "link": "http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8764",
        "description": "The two most intriguing developments in the recent evolution of the Microsoft Windows operating system are Windows System for Linux (WSL) and the porting of their Microsoft Edge browser to Ubuntu.\n\n\n\nFor those of you not keeping up, WSL allows unmodified Linux binaries to run under Windows 10.  No emulation, no shim layer, they just load and go.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft developers are now landing features in the Linux kernel to improve WSL. And that points in a fascinating technical direction. To understand why, we need to notice how Microsoft&#8217;s revenue stream has changed since the launch of its cloud service in 2010.\n\n\n\nTen years later, Azure makes Microsoft most of its money. The Windows monopoly has become a sideshow, with sales of conventional desktop PCs (the only market it dominates) declining.   Accordingly, the return on investment of spending on Windows development is falling. As PC volume sales continue to fall off , it&#8217;s inevitably going to stop being a profit center and turn into a drag on the business.\n\n\n\nLooked at from the point of view of cold-blooded profit maximization, this means continuing Windows development is a thing Microsoft would prefer  not to be doing. Instead, they&#8217;d do better putting more capital investment into Azure &#8211; which is widely rumored to be running more Linux instances than Windows these days.\n\n\n\nOur third ingredient is Proton.  Proton is the emulation layer that allows Windows games distributed on Steam to run over Linux.  It&#8217;s not perfect yet, but it&#8217;s getting close.  I myself use it to play World of Warships on the Great Beast.\n\n\n\nThe thing about games is that they are the most demanding possible stress test for a Windows emulation layer, much more so than business software. We may already be at the point where Proton-like technology is entirely good enough to run Windows business software over Linux. If not, we will be soon.\n\n\n\nSo, you&#8217;re a Microsoft corporate strategist.   What&#8217;s the profit-maximizing path forward given all these factors?\n\n\n\nIt&#8217;s this: Microsoft Windows becomes  a Proton-like emulation layer over a Linux kernel, with the layer getting thinner over time as more of the support lands in the mainline kernel sources.  The economic motive is that Microsoft sheds an ever-larger fraction of its development costs as less and less has to be done in-house.\n\n\n\nIf you think this is fantasy, think again.  The best evidence that it&#8217;s already the plan is that Microsoft has already ported Edge to run under Linux.  There is only one way that makes any sense, and that is as a trial run for freeing the rest of the Windows utility suite from depending on any emulation layer.\n\n\n\n So, the end state this all points at is: New Windows is mostly a Linux kernel, there&#8217;s an old-Windows emulation over it, but Edge and the rest of the Windows user-land utilities don&#8217;t use the emulation.  The emulation layer is  there for games and other legacy third-party software.\n\n\n\nEconomic pressure will be on Microsoft to deprecate the emulation layer. Partly because it&#8217;s entirely a cost center.  Partly because they want to reduce the complexity cost of running Azure.   Every increment of Windows/Linux convergence helps with that &#8211; reduces administration and the expected volume of support traffic.\n\n\n\nEventually, Microsoft announces upcoming end-of-life on the Windows emulation.  The OS itself , and its userland tools, has for some time already been Linux underneath a carefully preserved old-Windows UI. Third-party software providers stop shipping Windows binaries in favor of ELF binaries with a pure Linux API&#8230;\n\n\n\n&#8230;and Linux finally wins the desktop wars, not by displacing Windows but by co-opting it. Perhaps this is always how it had to be.",

        "link": "https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2022/07/21/magical-thinking-about-ballot-marking-device-contingency-plans/",
        "description": "The Center for Democracy and Technology recently published a report, “No Simple Answers: A Primer on Ballot Marking Device Security”, by William T. Adler.   Overall, it’s well-informed, clearly presents the problems as of 2022, and it’s definitely worth reading.  After explaining the issues and controversies, the report presents recommendations, most of which make a lot of sense, and indeed the states should act upon them.  But there’s one key recommendation in which Dr. Adler tries to provide a simple answer, and unfortunately his answer invokes a bit of magical thinking.  This seriously compromises the conclusions of his report.  By asking but not answering the question of “what should an election official do if there are reports of BMDs printing wrong votes?”, Dr. Adler avoids having to make the inevitable conclusion that BMDs-for-all-voters is a hopelessly flawed, insecurable method of voting.  Because the answer to that question is, unfortunately, there’s nothing that election officials could usefully do in that case.\n\n\n\nBMDs (ballot marking devices) are used now in several states and there is a serious problem with them (as the report explains): “a hacked BMD could corrupt voter selections systematically, such that a candidate favored by the hacker is more likely to win.”&nbsp; That is, if a state’s BMDs are hacked by someone who wants to change the result of an election, the BMDs can print ballots with votes on them different from what the voters indicated on the touchscreen.&nbsp; Because most voters won’t inspect the ballot paper carefully enough before casting their ballot, most voters won’t notice that their vote has been changed.&nbsp; The voters who do notice are (generally) allowed to “spoil” their ballot and cast a new one; but the substantial majority of voters, those who don’t check their ballot paper carefully, are vulnerable to having their votes stolen.\n\n\n\nOne simple answer is not to use BMDs at all: let voters mark their optical-scan paper ballots with a pen (that is, HMPB: hand-marked paper ballots).&nbsp; A problem with this simple answer (as the report explains) is that some voters with disabilities cannot mark a paper ballot with a pen.&nbsp; And (as the report explains) if BMDs are reserved just for the use of voters with disabilities, then those BMDs become “second class”: pollworkers are unfamiliar with how to set them up, rarely used machines may not work in the polling place when turned on, paper ballots cast by the disabled are distinguishable from those filled in with a pen, and so on.\n\n\n\nSo Dr. Adler seems to accept that BMDs, with their serious vulnerabilities, are inevitably going to be adopted—and so he makes recommendations to mitigate their insecurities.&nbsp; And most of his recommendations are spot-on:&nbsp; incorporate the cybersecurity measures required by the VVSG 2.0, avoid the use of bar codes and QR codes, adopt risk-limiting audits (RLAs).&nbsp; Definitely worth doing those things, if election officials insist on adopting this seriously flawed technology in the first place.\n\n\n\nBut then he makes a recommendation intended to address the problem that if the BMD is cheating then it can print fraudulent votes that will survive any recount or audit.  The report recommends,\n\n\n\nAnother way is to depend on voter reports. In an election with compromised BMDs modifying votes in a way visible to voters who actively verify and observe those modifications, it is likely that election officials would receive an elevated number of reported errors. In order to notice a widespread issue, election officials must be monitoring election errors in real-time across a county or state. If serious problems are revealed with the BMDs that cast doubt on whether votes were recorded properly, either via parallel testing or from voter reports, election officials must respond. Accordingly, election officials should have a contingency plan in the event that BMDs appear to be having widespread issues. Such a plan would include, for instance, having the ability to substitute paper ballots for BMDs, decommissioning suspicious BMDs, and investigating whether other machines are also misbehaving. Stark (2019) has warned, however, that because it is likely not possible to know how many or which ballots were affected, the only remedy to this situation may be to hold a new election.\n\n\n\nThis the magical thinking:  “election officials should have a contingency plan.”  The problem is, when you try to write down such a plan, there’s nothing that actually works!  Suppose the election officials rely on voter reports (or on the rate of spoiled ballots); suppose the “contingency plan” says (for example) says “if x percent of the voters report malfunctioning BMDs, or y percent of voters spoil their ballots, then we will . . .”   Then we will what?  Remove those BMDs from service in the middle of the day?  But then all the votes already cast on those BMDs will have been affected by the hack; that could be thousands of votes.  Or what else?  Discard all the paper ballots that were cast on those BMDs?  Clearly you can’t do that without holding an entirely new election.  And what if those x% or y% of voters were fraudulently reporting BMD malfunction or fraudulently spoiling their ballots to trigger the contingency plan?  There’s no plan that actually works.\n\n\n\nEverything I’ve explained here was already written down in “Ballot-marking devices cannot ensure the will of the voters” (2020 [non-paywall version]) and in “There is no reliable way to detect hacked ballot-marking devices” (2019), both of which Dr. Adler cites.  But an important purpose of magical thinking is to avoid facing difficult facts.\n\n\n\nIt’s like saying, “to prevent climate change we should just use machines to pull 40 billion tons of CO2 out of the atmosphere each year.”&nbsp; But there is no known technology that can do this.&nbsp; All the direct-air-capture facilities deployed to date can capture just 0.00001 billion tons.&nbsp; Just because we really, really want something to work is not enough.\n\n\n\nThere is an inherent problem with BMDs: they can change votes in a way that will survive any audit or recount.&nbsp; Not only is there “no simple solution” to this problem, there’s no solution period.&nbsp; Perhaps someday a solution will be identified.&nbsp; Until then, BMDs-for-all-voters is dangerous, even with all known mitigations.",

While I&#8217;ve had some research grants in the past, right now nobody is subsidizing the infrastructure work I do and I&#8217;m burning my savings.\n\n\n\nThere&#8217;s NTPsec, of course &#8211; secure time synchronization is critical to the Internet. There are the 40 or so other projects I maintain.  Recently I&#8217;m working on improving the tools ecosystem for the Go language, because to reduce defect rates we have got to lift infrastructure like NTPsec out of C and Go looks like the most plausible path.  Right now I&#8217;m modifying Flex so it can be be retargetable to emit Go (and other languages); I expect to do Go support for Bison next.\n\n\n\nI&#8217;m not the only person deserving of your support &#8211; I&#8217;ve founded the Loadsharers network for people who want to help with the more general infrastructure-support problem &#8211; but if you&#8217;re a regular on this blog I hope I&#8217;m personally relatively high on your priority list.  I&#8217;m not utterly broke yet, but the prospect is looming over me and my house needs a new roof.\n\n\n\nEven $10 a month is helpful if enough of you match it.  For $20 a month you get to be credited as a supporter when I ship a release of one of my personal projects. From $50 a month I can buy my long-suffering wife a nice dinner and afford an occasional trip to the shooting range.\n\n\n\nI live a simple life, trying to be of service to my civilization.

        "description": "I wrote the post at the bottom and linked here when Elon Musk announced his intention to buy Twitter in late April. I am relieved that Musk has decided he does not want to own Twitter. I never thought he would be a good shepherd of the Twitter network and maybe now we have the opportunity to find a better ownership/governance model for it.\n\n\n\nI understand why the Twitter Board and management team feel they must force Musk to perform on the agreed-upon deal. They have shareholders to protect and an obligation to do what is best for them. If Musk really does not want to own Twitter and is not just trying to renegotiate the deal, then eventually both sides will come to some settlement that enriches Twitter and lets Musk out of the deal. That will likely be a lot more than the $1bn breakup fee. I hope that we don&#8217;t end up with Musk owning Twitter at a lower price. That would be a bad outcome for the shareholders and for the Twitter network.\n\n\n\nI would like to see the Twitter Board and management team continue to press Musk to perform on the deal, and at the same time start working on a plan to decentralize Twitter and move it to the thing it has always wanted to be which is a core communications protocol for the Internet. A first step in that direction would to broadly re-open the API and allow third-party clients to be built on Twitter with a business model that covers the costs of operating the Twitter network. Longer-term, Twitter should move to a fully decentralized protocol, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, but that will take some time to do.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen I read the news a few weeks ago that Elon Musk had offered to buy Twitter, I wrote this:\n\n\n\n\nTwitter is too important to be owned and controlled by a single person. The opposite should be happening. Twitter should be decentralized as a protocol that powers an ecosystem of communication products and services.&mdash; Fred Wilson (@fredwilson) April 14, 2022\n\n\n\n\nI continue to believe that decentralization is the right long-term answer for a core communications protocol of the Internet and hope that Elon will think about doing just that once he owns it and is not concerned with the stock price and meeting quarterly revenue targets.\n\n\n\nMy partner Albert wrote this yesterday:\n\n\n\n\nhttps://twitter.com/albertwenger/status/1518684477052096515?s=20&#038;t=m8f3FHeCqU72HUGvzqOhPw\n\n\n\n\nAlbert’s suggestion would return Twitter to where it was a decade and a half ago when it first launched and that would be a fantastic first step towards full decentralization.\n\n\n\nI continue to believe that a single person owning one of the most important communications protocols of the internet is a bad idea, but maybe it can be a bridge to something better.\n\n\n\nCertainly being a public company has not been the right ownership model to make the big fundamental changes which are badly needed.\nUSV TEAM POSTS:",

        "description": "(13/13) “In prison there was a pill cart. They’d wheel it out at 5 PM, and they’d shout: ‘pill line!’ And everyone would get in line for pills. I wouldn’t do it. I told the warden: ‘I’d rather die. Either I keep my pills in my locker, or I’m not taking them.’ It’s been an obsession my whole life, keeping that secret. I gave a draft of this story to my bosses; just to let them know what was coming. Since then it’s been nothing but texts: ‘We love you, John. We’re proud of you.’ I guess it was a much bigger deal to me than everyone else. Last Friday was my birthday. Before the shift I could see everyone sneaking around. I thought: ‘They made me a cake, whatever.’ But it wasn’t just a cake. It was racks and racks of Philly Cheesesteaks. And an entire ice cream bar: hot fudge, sour patch kids, gummy bears. All my favorite stuff. The whole staff sang Happy Birthday, which I fucking hated. I’ve hated that song since the age of two. But then one of my bosses Maya gave a speech. She said: ‘John drives us fucking crazy, but we love him. And when his story comes out, you’ll realize he’s an even better human being than we realized.’ For her to say that: after knowing everything. I never knew. I just never knew people could feel that way about me. I grew up not knowing how to express. Then the HIV put me in a downward spiral of paranoia. Meth made it four levels deeper. And prison, prison threw dirt on the casket to make sure I’d never feel again. They almost got me. When they were singing that fucking song, they almost had me crying. But I said: ‘Listen guys, 5 more minutes to celebrate my birthday. Then it’s time for the show.’ The next day I drove out to New Jersey, to see my 86-year old mother. She can’t hear too well, so I read the story to her slow. She’s always been the one pushing me to get therapy. My whole life, I’ve been begging her: Stop worrying about me, Mom. Stop worrying if I’m ever going to be happy.’ But she’s relentless. It’s an obsession. But as I read the story to her, I could see it all drain out of her. Years and years of obsessive worry: gone. When I finished the last page, she said: ‘Johnny, maybe this can be the end. Maybe now you can let it go.’”",

        "description": "Hello, everyone. I&#8217;m going to be taking an extended break from kottke.org, starting today.  I&#8217;ve been writing here for more than 24 years, nearly half my life &#8212; I need a breather. This is something I have been thinking about and planning for years1 and I&#8217;d like to share why I&#8217;m doing it, how it&#8217;s going to work, what I hope to accomplish, and how you can help.\n\nThis is a long post and was a hard one to write &#8212; I hope you&#8217;ll give it your thoughtful attention. But first, let me introduce you to my plant.\n\n(This is going somewhere. Trust me.)\n\nEight years ago when I still lived in NYC, I bought a fiddle leaf fig tree from a store in the Flower District. Here it is a couple of years ago, thriving next to my desk here in Vermont:\n\n\n\nI&#8217;d recently moved into my own apartment after separating from my wife and figured a large plant in my new place would add some liveliness to a new beginning that was feeling overwhelming, lonely, and sad. For the first couple of months, I didn&#8217;t know if my tree and I were going to make it. I&#8217;d never really had a plant before and struggled getting a handle on the watering schedule and other plant care routines. It started losing leaves. Like, an alarming number of leaves.\n\nI&#8217;d brought this glorious living thing into my house only to kill it! Not cool. With the stress of the separation, my new living situation, and not seeing my kids every day, I felt a little like I was dying too.\n\nOne day, I decided I was not going to let my fiddle leaf fig tree die&#8230;and if I could do that, I wasn&#8217;t going to fall apart either. It&#8217;s a little corny, but my mantra became &#8220;if my tree is ok, I am ok&#8221;. I learned how to water & feed it and figured out the best place to put it for the right amount of light. It stopped shedding leaves.\n\nThe fig tree was a happy plant for several years after that. And I was ok because my plant was ok &#8212; I found new routines and rhythms in my altered life, made new traditions with my kids, got divorced, met new people, moved to a new state (w/ my family and tree), rediscovered who I was as a person, and, wonderfully and unexpectedly, forged a supportive and rewarding parenting partnership and friendship with my ex. We made it through that tough time together, that plant and me.\n\nRecently however, my fiddle leaf fig has been struggling again. It&#8217;s been losing leaves and has become lopsided &#8212; some branches are going gangbusters while others are almost bare and the plant is listing so badly to one side that the whole thing tips over without the weight of water in the pot. This is what it&#8217;s looking like these days:\n\n\n\nMy plant is not ok. And neither am I &#8212; I feel as off-balance as my tree looks. I&#8217;m burrrrned out. I have been for a few years now. I&#8217;ve been trying to power through it, but if you&#8217;ve read anything about burnout, you know that approach doesn&#8217;t work.\n\nI appreciate so much what I&#8217;ve built here at kottke.org &#8212; I get to read and learn about all sorts of new things every day, create new ideas and connections for people, and think in public &#8212; and I feel incredibly lucky to be able to set my own schedule, be my own boss, and provide for my family. But if you were to go back into the archive for the past several months and read the site closely, you&#8217;d see that I&#8217;ve been struggling.\n\nDoes what I do here make a difference in other people&#8217;s lives? In my life? Is this still scratching the creative itch that it used to? And if not, what needs to change? Where does kottke.org end and Jason begin? Who am I without my work? Is the validation I get from the site healthy? Is having to be active on social media healthy? Is having to read the horrible news every day healthy? What else could I be doing here? What could I be doing somewhere else? What good is a blog without a thriving community of other blogs? I&#8217;ve tried thinking about these and many other questions while continuing my work here, but I haven&#8217;t made much progress; I need time away to gain perspective.\n\n&middot; &middot; &middot;\n\nSo. The plan, as it currently stands, is to take 5-6 months away from the site. I will not be posting anything new here.  I won&#8217;t be publishing the newsletter. There won&#8217;t be a guest editor either &#8212; if someone else was publishing here, it would still be on my mind and I&#8217;m looking for total awayness here. I&#8217;m planning on setting up a system to republish some timeless posts from the archive while I&#8217;m away, but that&#8217;s not fully in place yet. If you send me email (please do!), it might take me awhile to read it and even longer to reply &#8212; I plan to ignore my inbox as much as I can get away with. I probably won&#8217;t be on Twitter but will be more active on Instagram if you want to follow me there.\n\nThe goal of my time away from the site is resting, resetting, recharging, and figuring out what to do going forward. In this NY Times feature, Alexandra Bell said this about how art is made: &#8220;I need some space to think and live and have generative conversations and do things, and then I&#8217;ll make something, but I can&#8217;t tell you what it is just yet.&#8221; That&#8217;s the sort of energy I need to tap into for a few months.\n\nHere&#8217;s the way I&#8217;ve been thinking about it: there&#8217;s a passenger ferry that goes from Cape Cod to Nantucket and there&#8217;s a stretch of time in the middle of the journey where you can&#8217;t see the mainland behind you and can&#8217;t yet see the island ahead &#8212; you&#8217;re just out in the open water. That&#8217;s what I need, to be in that middle part &#8212; to forget about what I&#8217;ve been doing here for so many years without having to think about where I&#8217;m going in the future. I need open water and 5-6 months feels like the right amount of time to find it.\n\n&middot; &middot; &middot;\n\nThis is probably a good time to admit that I&#8217;m a little terrified about taking this time off. There&#8217;s no real roadmap for this, no blueprint for independent creators taking sabbaticals to recharge. The US doesn&#8217;t have the social safety net necessary to enable extended breaks from work (or much of anything else, including health care) for people with Weird Internet Careers. I support a lot of individual writers, artists, YouTubers, and bloggers through Substack, Patreon, and other channels, and over the years I&#8217;ve seen some of them produce content at a furious pace to keep up their momentum, only to burn out and quit doing the projects that I, and loads of other people, loved. With so many more people pursuing independent work funded directly by readers & viewers these days, this is something all of us, creators and supporters alike, are going to have to think about.\n\nI&#8217;ve said this many times over the past 5 years: kottke.org would not be possible today without the incredible membership support I have gotten from the people who read this site. Members have enabled this site to be free for everyone to read, enriching the open web and bucking the trend towards paywalling information online. I hope you will continue to support me in taking this necessary time off.\n\nIf, for whatever reason, you would like to pause/suspend your membership until I return, email me and I would be happy to do that for you. You&#8217;re also free of course to raise or lower your membership support here if you&#8217;d like. Regardless of what you choose to do, I hope I will see you back here in the fall.\n\n&middot; &middot; &middot;\n\nIf you&#8217;re curious about what&#8217;s on my agenda for the next few months, so am I! I&#8217;m leaving on a long-planned family trip soon, but other than that, I do not have any set plans. Suggestions and advice are welcome! I&#8217;d like to spend some unrushed time with my kids, who too often see me when I&#8217;m stressed out about work. I want to read more books. Watch more good movies. Take more photos. Go on pointless adventures. I want to exercise a little more regularly and figure out how to eat a bit better. Maybe travel some, visit friends or the ocean or both. Bike more. Stare at the walls. I hope to get a little bored. I need to tend to my fiddle leaf fig tree &#8212; if my tree is ok, I will be too.\n\nI&#8217;m going to miss this &#8212; and all of you &#8212; more than I probably realize right now, but I&#8217;m ready for a break. I&#8217;ll see you in a few months.\n\n*deep breath*\n\nHere I go!\n\n*jumps*\n\n&middot; &middot; &middot;\n\nP.S. The best way to keep tabs on when the site starts up again is to subscribe to the newsletter. You can also follow @kottke on Twitter, subscribe to the RSS feed, or follow me on Instagram so you don&#8217;t miss anything.\n\nP.P.S. Big big thanks to the many people I&#8217;ve talked to about this over the past few months and years, especially Anil, Alaina, David, Adriana, Tim, Caroline, Matt, Joanna, Meg, Aaron, Edith, Kara, Megan, Anna, Jackson, and Michelle. (Forgive me if I&#8217;ve forgotten anyone.) I value your wise counsel and your pointing me, hopefully, in the right direction.\n\nP.P.P.S.

Happy hunting!\n\nUpdate: Hello, everyone. I want to thank you all so much for your emails, tweets, and DMs&#8230;yesterday was just a little overwhelming. I was apprehensive yesterday morning about publishing this post &#8212; I had no idea what the reaction was going to be &#8212; and, well, you folks turned it into a party. I&#8217;m so grateful for your support, advice, well-wishes, and understanding. I should not have doubted you &#8212; if this site is anything, it&#8217;s that way because of all of you. Thank you again for the support and I will see you in a few months. &#x2764;\n\nThe original plan was to do this in late spring 2020 but&#8230;.you know.&#x21A9;\n\n Tags: Jason Kottke&nbsp;&nbsp; kottke.org&nbsp;&nbsp; working",

        "link": "https://torrentfreak.com/verizon-must-disconnect-pirates-block-pirate-sites-new-lawsuit-demands-220907/",
        "description": "Efforts to hold internet service providers in the United States accountable for the piracy activities of their subscribers are gaining momentum.\nIn 2019, Cox Communications was ordered to pay a billion dollars in damages to record labels. The decision is being appealed by Cox, but it set the stage for similar lawsuits, including a new complaint reported just yesterday targeting AT&#038;T.\nFiled in Texas by filmmaker Voltage Pictures and several affiliates, together behind movies such as “After We Collided,” “Dallas Buyers Club,” “Room 203,” and “The Bird Catcher”, the lawsuit lambasts AT&#038;T for not doing enough to prevent subscribers from engaging in movie piracy. \nA new and broadly similar complaint filed against Verizon Communications and Cellco Partnership follows a similar template.\nVerizon Hit With Copyright Complaint\nThe premise of the lawsuit is that Verizon &#8220;can easily take action against online piracy&#8221; by disconnecting customers who repeatedly use its services to download and share movies. The company doesn&#8217;t even have to find these pirates itself because the plaintiffs have provided infringement notices carrying all of the information it needs.\nThe reason that Verizon hasn&#8217;t taken action, the complaint notes, is because Verizon makes between $400 and $1,000 in additional profits per &#8216;pirate&#8217; account. But this isn&#8217;t permissible under law, the plaintiffs claim, because when Verizon receives knowledge of repeat infringement yet fails to disconnect the associated accounts, it can be held liable for customers&#8217; piracy.\nHundreds of Thousands of Infringements\nAccording to the plaintiffs, IP addresses allocated to Verizon/Cellco Partnership were monitored by anti-piracy tracking outfit Maverickeye downloading and sharing pirate copies of their movies. Over the past three years, &#8220;hundreds of thousands&#8221; of these infringements were logged and over 90,000 corresponding infringement notices were sent to the ISP.\nOn this basis, the plaintiffs believe that Verizon/Cellco were willfully blind to these infringements because neither took meaningful action to prevent ongoing infringement by their customers. In some cases, infringement notices weren&#8217;t even forwarded to the allegedly-infringing subscribers, the plaintiffs add.\nThe complaint highlights several specific IP addresses allocated to Verizon customers, for which the plaintiffs sent large volumes of copyright infringement complaints. One IP address was listed in infringement notices 800 times, another appeared 700 times, with three others being identified on 600, 500 and 400 occasions. \nIn these cases and others like them, it&#8217;s alleged that Verizon had the opportunity to suspend customer accounts but failed to do so.\nRepeat Infringers and the DMCA\nWhen Congress passed the DMCA in 1998 (not 1988, as this lawsuit alleges), service providers were given &#8216;safe harbor&#8217; protections if they adopted and reasonably implemented policies for terminating repeat infringers &#8220;in appropriate circumstances.&#8221; \nVerizon publishes its policy here but according to the complaint, the implementation of the Verizon policy places an unfair burden on rightsholders. \nThe plaintiffs say that BitTorrent-style infringements must be reported via &#8216;Conduit Notice Forms&#8217; but Verizon prohibits these from being filled out using automated processes. Verizon does operate the &#8220;Verizon Anti-Piracy Cooperation&#8221; program but the plaintiffs say the contract contains &#8220;onerous&#8221; terms. \nThese include an agreement not to sue Verizon for copyright infringement alongside processing fees of $75 per hour for IP address lookups.\nIn any event, the lawsuit claims that Verizon failed to terminate customer accounts, even when it received multiple complaints against specific accounts. As a result, it has lost its safe harbor protections under the DMCA.\nSeveral Types of Copyright Infringement\nDue to the alleged inaction of Verizon/Cellco Partnership, the plaintiffs claim that the defendants are liable for contributory and vicarious copyright infringement. These claims alone could run to many millions of dollars in damages.\nDue to the plaintiffs&#8217; Copyright Management Information (CMI) being removed or altered in movie files distributed via BitTorrent by Verizon customers, the ISP is also liable for contributory and vicarious violations under 17 U.S.C.S. §1202(a)(b), the complaint adds.\nThe plaintiffs demand actual or statutory damages and an order that compels Verizon to implement a repeat infringer policy that terminates the accounts of repeat infringers. \nIn common with the lawsuit the plaintiffs just filed against AT&#038;T, the complaint demands an order that compels Verizon to block access to pirate sites listed in the USTR&#8217;s Notorious Foreign Markets report. These include YTS, The Pirate Bay, RARBG, and 1337x.\nA copy of the complaint, filed by Voltage Holdings et al. at the District Court of the Southern District of New York, can be found here (pdf)\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "Discovered Jul 26, 2022 18:32 Revisiting ‘The Power of Context’ | Synesthesia &lt;— The power is that these tools for thought are more readily available, easier to share and easier to host.

        "description": "By Chong Xiang and Prateek Mittal\n\n\n\nIn our previous post, we discussed adversarial patch attacks and presented our first defense algorithm PatchGuard. The PatchGuard framework (small receptive field + secure aggregation) has become the most popular defense strategy over the past year, subsuming a long list of defense instances (Clipped BagNet, De-randomized Smoothing, BagCert, Randomized Cropping, PatchGuard++, ScaleCert, Smoothed ViT, ECViT). In this post, we will present a different way of building robust image classification models: PatchCleanser. Instead of using small receptive fields to suppress the adversarial effect, PatchCleanser directly masks out adversarial pixels in the input image. This design makes PatchCleanser compatible with any high-performance image classifiers and achieve state-of-the-art defense performance.\n\n\n\nPatchCleanser: Removing the Dependency on Small Receptive Fields\n\n\n\nThe limitation of small receptive fields. We have seen the small receptive field plays an important role in PatchGuard: it limits the number of corrupted features and lays a foundation for robustness. However, the small receptive field also limits the information received by each feature; as a result, it hurts the clean model performance (when there is no attack). For example, the PatchGuard models (BagNet+robust masking) can only have a 55%-60% clean accuracy on the ImageNet dataset while state-of-the-art undefended models, which all have large receptive fields, can achieve an accuracy of 80%-90%.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nThis huge drop in clean accuracy discourages the real-world deployment of PatchGuard-style defenses. A natural question to ask is:\n\n\n\nCan we achieve strong robustness without the use of small receptive fields?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYES, we can. We propose PatchCleanser with an image-space pixel masking strategy to make the defense compatible with any state-of-the-art image classification model (with larger receptive fields).\n\n\n\nA pixel-masking defense strategy. The high-level idea of PatchCleanser is to apply pixel masks to the input image and evaluate model predictions on masked images. If a mask removes the entire patch, the attacker has no influence over the classification, and thus any image classifier can make an accurate prediction on the masked image. However, the challenge is: how can we mask out the patch, especially when the patch location is unknown?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPixel masking: the first attempt. A naive approach is to choose a mask and apply it to all possible image locations. If the mask is large enough to cover the entire patch, then at least one mask location can remove all adversarial pixels.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe provide a simplified visualization below. When we apply masks to an adversarial image (top of the figure), the model prediction is correct as “dog” when the mask removes the patch at the upper left corner. Meanwhile, the predictions on other masked images are incorrect since they are influenced by the adversarial patch &#8212; we see a prediction disagreement among different masked images. On the other hand, when we consider a clean image (bottom of the figure), the model predictions usually agree on the correct label since both we and the classifier can easily recognize the partially occluded dog.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nvisual examples of one-mask predictions\n\n\nBased on these observations, we can use the disagreement in one-mask predictions to detect a patch attack; a similar strategy is used by the Minority Reports defense, which takes inconsistency in the prediction voting grid as an attack indicator. However, can we recover the correct prediction label instead of merely detecting an attack? Or equivalently, how can we know which mask removes the entire patch? Which class label should an image classifier trust &#8212; dog, cat, or fox?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPixel masking: the second attempt. The solution turns out to be super simple: we can perform a second round of masking on the one-masked images (see visual examples below). If the first-round mask already removes the patch (top of the figure), then our second-round masking is applied to a “clean” image, and thus all two-mask predictions will have a unanimous agreement. On the other hand, if the patch is not removed by the first-round mask (bottom of the figure), the image is still “adversarial”. We will then see a disagreement in two-mask predictions; we shall not trust the prediction labels.\n\n\n\nvisual examples of two-mask predictions\n\n\nIn our PatchCleanser paper, we further discuss how to generate a mask set such that at least one mask can remove the entire patch regardless of the patch location. We further prove that if the model predictions on all possible two-masked images are correct, PatchCleanser can always make correct predictions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPatchCleanser performance. In the figure below, we plot the defense performance on the 1000-class ImageNet dataset (against a 2%-pixel square patch anywhere on the image). We can see that PatchCleanser significantly outperforms prior works (which are all PatchGuard-style defenses with small receptive fields). Notably, (1) the certified robust accuracy of PatchCleanser (62.1%) is even higher than the clean accuracy of all prior defenses, and (2) the clean accuracy of PatchCleanser (83.9%) is similar to vanilla undefended models! These results further demonstrate the strength of defenses that are compatible with any state-of-the-art classification models (with large receptive fields).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClean accuracy and certified robust accuracy on the ImageNet dataset; certified robust accuracy evaluated against a 2%-pixel square patch anywhere on the image\n\n\n(certified robust accuracy is a provable lower bound on model robust accuracy; see the PatchCleanser paper&nbsp;for more details)\n\n\n\nTakeaways. In PatchCleanser, we demonstrate that small receptive fields are not necessary for strong robustness. We design an image-space pixel masking strategy that is compatible with any image classifier. The compatibility allows us to use state-of-the-art image classifiers and achieves significant improvements over prior works.\n\n\n\nConclusion: Using Logical Reasoning for Building Trustworthy ML systems\n\n\n\nIn the era of big data, we have been amazed at the power of statistical reasoning/learning: an AI model can automatically extract useful information from a large amount of data and significantly outperforms manually designed models (e.g., hand-crafted features). However, these learned models can have unexpected behaviors when encountered with “adversarial examples” and thus lacks reliability for security-critical applications. In our posts, we demonstrate that we can additionally apply logical reasoning to statistically learned models to achieve strong robustness. We believe the combination of logical and statistical reasoning is a promising and important direction for building trustworthy ML systems.\n\n\n\nAdditional Reading\n\n\n\nPaper list for localized adversarial patch research [link]Leaderboard for certifiable robustness against adversarial patch attacks [link]PatchGuard [paper and presentation] [code on GitHub]PatchCleanser [paper and presentation] [code on GitHub]",

Axios can leave out the republican damaging portion because democrats answer questions and republicans use the opportunity to frame news as bad for dems. Democrats are still waiting for that moderator in the sky to say that they are right and then feel ok. Life doesn’t work that way on the playground or battlefield or boardroom or bar. If you stand for something, you don’t wait for other people to validate you, you don’t look back for approval, you say out loud and proud that you are right.

        "description": "There&#8217;s an angle on the case of Kyle Rittenhouse that I haven&#8217;t seen even hinted at in the media.\n\n\n\nSection 246 of US Code Title 10, entitled, “Militia: composition and classes” reads:\n\n\n\n“(a) The militia of the United States consists of all able-bodied males at least 17 years of age and, except as provided in section 313 of title 32, under 45 years of age who are, or who have made a declaration of intention to become, citizens of the United States and of female citizens of the United States who are members of the National Guard.\n\n\n\n(b) The classes of the militia are:\n\n\n\n(1) the organized militia, which consists of the National Guard and the Naval Militia; and\n\n\n\n(2) the unorganized militia, which consists of the members of the militia who are not members of the National Guard or the Naval Militia.”\n\n\n\nThat is, all males of military age who are or intend to become citizens of the United States are under federal statute the “unorganized militia”, and have the duty of the militia to defend the Constitution of the United States against enemies foreign and domestic (as both naturalizing citizens and members of the armed forces swear to do).\n\n\n\nKyle Rittenhouse is a 17-year-old male and thus a member of the unorganized militia under black-letter Federal law.  When he armed up to defend a friend&#8217;s business during a breakdown in civil order, he was acting precisely as all members of the unorganized militia have a legal and Constitutional duty to act in like circumstances. \n\n\n\nAnd yes, shooting violent criminal insurrectionists is included in that duty. Rittenhouse would have been justified in doing so even if he had not been acting in self-defense against lethal threats to his person.\n\n\n\nSo let&#8217;s not hear any more nonsense about a teenager having no business being in that situation. Kyle Rittenhouse recognized one of his core duties as an American citizen and performed it with exceptional skill and courage.",

        "description": "AVC has been around for nineteen years and it has evolved over the years from a place I&#8217;d post multiple times a day to once a day to now once a week. There was a time when there was a vibrant comment community at AVC with many posts getting over a hundred comments and replies. That&#8217;s long gone and now it is just me posting here with some chatter occasionally on Twitter.\n\n\n\nAs anyone who has tried knows, posting every day is a mighty big commitment. I am relieved to have given that up, gradually, a few years ago. \n\n\n\nWhat is left at AVC is a place where I can write when I have something to say that I want to say out loud. That last bit is important because there are many things I will say privately these days but not publicly. At this stage of my life, AVC is for conversations that are helpful, productive, and constructive. Everything else can happen elsewhere.\n\n\n\nThe entire catalog of AVC posts remains online and can be accessed in the archives. If anyone wants to see the progression, it is right there out in the open for anyone to see. The comments are there too for the posts that have them.\n\n\n\nThe AVC archives are a journey through the evolution of social media. From an experiment in the early 2000s, to a happening in the late 2000s, to mainstream in the early 2010s, to a mess in the late 2010s, to something to be incredibly careful with now.\n\n\n\nAt least that is my journey with social media. I continue to believe that technology that gives everyone a voice, that gave me a voice, is an incredible thing. But like many incredibly powerful technologies, it has to be used carefully or it can create more bad than good.\n\n\n\nAnd that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m seeking to do here at AVC. Create more good than bad. Use the technology carefully and constructively. It has taken me a few years to land here but I&#8217;ve been here for a while now and I thought I&#8217;d explain it that I understand it myself.\nUSV TEAM POSTS:",

        "description": "(12/13) “I spent the 4th of July alone in my new place. It’s a nice one-bedroom, overlooking the river. I cooked my favorite meal. Hard shell crabs, spread over pasta. I sat on the balcony and watched the fireworks. And suddenly I start crying like a baby, thinking about what they symbolize. The next morning I put on my suit, looked in the mirror, and called myself a pussy. My boss tells me I’m too intense. I get it. I’m too intense for myself; but there’s only one right way. One right way to be the best. And until it’s right, it’s not enough. It will never be enough; never, ever. I was supposed to die of AIDS in prison. That was supposed to be my legacy. They counted me out. A lot of people counted this restaurant out too. When we opened 20 years ago: Madonna was here, this star, that star, James Beard Award. But the New York dining culture moves on fast. Maybe some people thought we weren’t relevant anymore. Then the pandemic came. We were supposed to die. But look at us now: setting records, month-over-month. I wasn’t the only one to make it happen. It’s our whole team. It’s the way we make people feel. But it was my responsibility. I found every vendor that was overcharging us. I put an extra banquette on the wall, for thirteen more seats. I’ve got a list of 7,000 birthdays. And every person is getting an email, one week before, inviting them to celebrate at Craft. I’ll do whatever it takes. It will never be enough. Don’t tell me to let it go. Fuck you. That’s what everyone does; they let go of the anger. Don’t you understand? That’s what they want you to do. If they thought everyone was going to come home and be a motivated motherfucker asshole like me, maybe they’d fix the system. So your little brother, or your father, or your son, won’t have to deal with the same shit. How about you, Mr. Politician? When your son develops a drug problem because of your drive for power; maybe then you’ll care about the 2.2 million sons rotting away in prison, too ashamed to speak to their own fathers. You’ll be glad then that 56134066 didn’t let go. Not me, I’m never letting go. Never. Not until every single one of them says: ‘Wow, that motherfucker really did it.’",

        "description": "As the battle against pirate IPTV services continues, beIN Media Group today announced early success in new legal action.\nThe sports broadcaster says that after filing an application for an emergency injunction in Tunisia, local electronics retailer MyTek is no longer allowed to sell IPTV products carrying pirated beIN channels. The injunction is temporary, pending a full hearing on the merits of the case.\nAccording to beIN, more than 80% of consumers in Tunisia use pirate IPTV services to watch live sports and other TV channels. Given the extraordinary deals available, it&#8217;s not difficult to see why.\nIPTV Subscriptions on Open Sale\nAt the time of writing, subscription listings on MyTek&#8217;s website are yet to be suspended. The website team probably needs a little more time to make the changes so, in the meantime, we did a little virtual shopping to see why beIN sees this retailer as a threat.\n\nAs far as 12-month packages go, MyTek offers at least two, branded as Global IPTV and TIVOSAT. The price listed for the former is 25,000 TND, which initially sounds like a lot. \nHowever, the Tunisian dinar is subdivided into a thousand milim so, for the sake of simplicity, the last three digits can be discarded. In short, a full subscription package costs 25 dinars and that converts to less than $8.00 &#8211; for a 12-month subscription.\nPeople without a compatible device can buy an Android set-top box for 89 dinars and MyTek will throw in a 12-month IPTV package free of charge. Grand total: $27.80.\n\nPeople who pay $5 or $10 per month in the United States usually recognize a good deal when they see one, but this is on a whole new level of cheap that seems barely believable. When compared to an official beIN subscription, it&#8217;s easy to see why beIN wants this stopped and why users on this local Arabic forum think it should continue.\nMyTek Also Offers beIN Packages &#8211; But Does Anybody Buy Them?\nFor those who prefer not to go down the illegal route, official beIN subscription packages are also available via the MyTek website. For 189 dinars &#8211; just short of $59.00 &#8211; Tunisians can watch beIN for three uninterrupted months. \nIf that&#8217;s not long enough, 359 dinars ($112) buys six months of beIN service and 699 dinars ($217) buys a whole year. To counter this deal, MyTek offers a Max IPTV subscription that costs less than 30 dinars (just over $9.00) but lasts 18 months.\nThese listings will probably disappear in the coming hours or days but MyTek has work to do. When the company sells a Samsung Galaxy M52, it also throws in a free IPTV subscription. The same holds true for this 50&#8243; Smart TV and many other similar products.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

What&#8217;s the hard part? What&#8217;s the part that has to be right for the rest to matter? \r\nThen we get to focus on the rest.\r\n\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&#160;",

        "description": "By Orestis Papakyriakopoulos, Christelle Tessono, Arvind Narayanan, Mihir Kshirsagar\n\n\n\nWith the 2022 midterm elections in the United States fast approaching, political campaigns are poised to spend heavily to influence prospective voters through digital advertising. Online platforms such as Facebook, Google, and TikTok will play an important role in distributing that content. But our new study – How Algorithms Shape the Distribution of Political Advertising: Case Studies of Facebook, Google, and TikTok — that will appear in the Artificial Intelligence, Ethics, and Society conference in August, shows that the platforms’ tools for voluntary disclosures about political ads do not provide the necessary transparency the public needs. More details can also be found on our website: campaigndisclosures.princeton.edu.\n\n\n\nOur paper conducts the first large-scale analysis of public data from the 2020 presidential election cycle to critically evaluate how online platforms affect the distribution of political advertisements. We analyzed a dataset containing over 800,000 ads about the 2020 U.S. presidential election that ran in the 2 months prior to the election, which we obtained from the ad libraries of Facebook and Google that were created by the companies to offer more transparency about political ads. We also collected and analyzed 2.5&nbsp;million TikTok videos from the same time period. These ad libraries were created by the platforms in an attempt to stave off potential regulation such as the Honest Ads Act, which sought to impose greater transparency requirements for platforms carrying political ads. But our study shows that these ad libraries fall woefully short of their own objectives to be more transparent about who pays for the ads and who sees the ads, as well the objectives of bringing greater transparency about the role of online platforms in shaping the distribution of political advertising.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe developed a three-part evaluative framework to assess the platform disclosures:&nbsp;\n\n\n\n1. Do the disclosures meet the platforms’ self-described objective of making political advertisers accountable?\n\n\n\n2. How do the platforms’ disclosures compare against what the law requires for radio and television broadcasters?\n\n\n\n3. Do the platforms disclose all that they know about the ad targeting criteria, the audience for the ads, and how their algorithms distribute or moderate content?\n\n\n\nOur analysis shows that the ad libraries do not meet any of the objectives. First, the ad libraries only have partial disclosures of audience characteristics and targeting parameters of placed political ads. But these disclosures do not allow us to understand how political advertisers reached prospective voters. For example, we compared ads in the ad libraries that were shown to different audiences with dummy ads that we created on the platforms (Figure 1). In many cases, we measured a significant difference between the calculated cost-per-impression between the two types of ads, which we could not explain with the available data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1. We plot the generated cost per impression of ads in the ad-libraries that were (1) targeted to all genders &amp; ages on Google, (2) to Females, between 25-34 on YouTube, (3) were seen by all genders &amp; ages in the US on Facebook, and (4) only by females of all ages located in California on Facebook.&nbsp; For Facebook, lower &amp; upper bounds are provided for the impressions. For Google, lower &amp; upper bounds are provided for cost &amp; impressions, given the extensive “bucketing” of the parameters performed by the ad libraries when reporting them, which are denoted in the figures with boxes. Points represent the median value of the boxes. We compare the generated cost-per impression of ads with the cost-per impression of a set of dummy ads we placed on the platforms with the exact same targeting parameters &amp; audience characteristics. Black lines represent the upper and lower boundaries of an ad’s cost-per-impression as we extracted them from the dummy ads. We label an ad placement as “plausible targeting”, when the ad cost-per-impression overlaps with the one we calculated, denoting that we can assume that the ad library provides all relevant targeting parameters/audience characteristics about an ad.&nbsp; Similarly, an placement labeled as `”unexplainable targeting&#8217;”&nbsp; represents an ad whose cost-per-impression is outside the upper and lower reach values that we calculated, meaning that potentially platforms do not disclose full information about the distribution of the ad.\n\n\n\nSecond, broadcasters are required to offer advertising space at the same price to political advertisers as they do to commercial advertisers. But we find that the platforms charged campaigns different prices for distributing ads. For example, on average, the Trump campaign on Facebook paid more per impression (~18 impressions/dollar) compared to the Biden campaign (~27 impressions/dollar). On Google, the Biden campaign paid more per impression compared to the Trump campaign. Unfortunately, while we attempted to control for factors that might account for different prices for different audiences, the data does not allow us to probe the precise reason for the differential pricing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThird, the platforms do not disclose the detailed information about the audience characteristics that they make available to advertisers. They also do not explain how the algorithms distribute or moderate the ads. For example, we see that campaigns placed ads on Facebook that were not ostensibly targeted by age, but the ad was not distributed uniformly.&nbsp; We also find that platforms applied their ad moderation policies inconsistently, with some instances of moderated ads being removed and some others not, and without any explanation for the decision to remove an ad. (Figure 2)&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2. Comparison of different instances of moderated ads across platforms. The light blue bars show how many instances of a single ad were moderated, and maroon bars show how many instances of the same ad were not. Results suggests an inconsistent moderation of content across platforms, with some instances of the same ad being removed and some others not.\n\n\n\nFinally, we observed new forms of political advertising that are not captured in the ad libraries. Specifically, campaigns appear to have used influencers to promote their messages without adequate disclosure. For example, on TikTok, we document how political influencers, who were often linked with PACs, generated billions of impressions from their political content. This new type of campaigning still remains unregulated and little is known about the practices and relations between influencers and political campaigns.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn short, the online platform self-regulatory disclosures are inadequate and we need more comprehensive disclosures from platforms to understand their role in the political process. Our key recommendations include:\n\n\n\n&#8211;  Requiring that each political entity registered with the FEC use a single, universal identifier for campaign spending across platforms to allow the public to track their activity.\n\n\n\n&#8211; Developing a cross-platform data repository, hosted and maintained by a government or independent entity, that collects political ads, their targeting criteria, and the audience characteristics that received them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&#8211; Requiring platforms to disclose information that will allow the public to understand how the algorithms distribute content and how platforms price the distribution of political ads.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&#8211; Developing a comprehensive definition of political advertising that includes influencers and other forms of paid promotional activity.",

        "title": "Documentation as knowledge capture",
        "link": "http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8741",
        "description": "Maybe you&#8217;re one of the tiny minority of programmers that, like me, already enjoys writing documentation and works hard at doing it right. If so,the rest of this essay is not for you and you can skip it.\n\n\n\nOtherwise, you might want to re-read (or at least re-skim) Ground-Truth Documents before continuing. Because ground-truth documents are a special case of a more general reason why you might want to try to change your mindset about documentation.\n\n\n\nIn that earlier essay I used the term &#8220;knowledge capture&#8221; in passing. This is a term of art from AI; it refers to the process of extracting domain knowledge from the heads of human experts into a form that can  be expressed as an algorithm executable by the literalistic logic of a computer.\n\n\n\nWhat I invite you to think about now is how writing documentation for software you are working on can save you pain and effort by (a) capturing knowledge you have but don&#8217;t know you have, and (b) eliciting knowledge that you have not yet developed. \n\n\n\nHumans, including me and you, are sloppy and analogical thinkers who tend to solve problems by pattern-matching against noisy data first and checking our intuitions with logic after the fact (if we actually get that far). There&#8217;s no point in protesting that it shouldn&#8217;t be that way, that we should use rigorous logic all the way down, because our brains simply aren&#8217;t wired for that.  Evolved cognition is a kludge &#8211; more properly, multiple stacks of kludges &#8211; developed under selection to be just barely adequate at coping. \n\n\n\nThis kludginess is revealed by, for example, optical illusions. And by the famous 7±2 result about the very limited sized of the human working set. And the various well-documented ways that human beings are extremely bad at statistical reasoning. And in many other ways&#8230;\n\n\n\nWhen you do work that is as demanding of rigor as software engineering, one of your central challenges is hacking around the limitations of your own brain.  Sometimes this develops in very obvious ways; the increasing systematization of testing during development during the last couple of decades, for example.\n\n\n\nOther brain hacks are more subtle. Which is why I am here to suggest that you try to stop thinking of documentation as a chore you do for others, and instead think of it as a way to explore your problem space. and the space in your head around your intuitions about the problem, so you can shine light into the murkier corners of both.  Writing documentation can function as valuable knowledge capture about your problem domain even when you are the only expert about what you are trying to do.\n\n\n\nThis is why my projects often have a file called &#8220;designer&#8217;s notes&#8221; or &#8220;hacking guide&#8221;.  Early in a project these may just be random jottings that are an aid to my own memory about why things are the way they are. They tend to develop into a technical briefing about the code internals for future contributors.  This is a good habit to form if you want to have future contributors!\n\n\n\nBut even though the developed version of a &#8220;designer&#8217;s notes&#8221; looks other-directed, it&#8217;s really a thing I do to reduce my own friction costs.  And not just in the communication-to-my-future-self way either.  Yes, it&#8217;s tremendously valuable to have a document that, months or years after I wrote it, reminds me of my assumptions when I have half-forgotten them. And yes, a &#8220;designer&#8217;s notes&#8221; file is good practice for that reason alone. But its utility does not even start there, let alone end there.\n\n\n\nEarlier, I wrote of (a) capturing knowledge you have but don&#8217;t know you have, and (b) eliciting knowledge that you have not yet developed. The process of writing your designer&#8217;s notes can be powerful and catalytic that way even if they&#8217;re never communicated.  The thing you have to do in your brain to narratize your thoughts so they can be written down is itself an exploratory tool.\n\n\n\nAs with &#8220;designer&#8217;s notes&#8221; so with every other form of documentation from the one-line code comment to a user-oriented HOWTO.  When you achieve right mindset about these they are no longer burdens; instead they become an integral part of your creative process, enabling you to design better and write better code with less total effort.\n\n\n\nI understand that to a lot of programmers who now experience writing prose as difficult work this might seem like impossible advice.  But I think there  is a way from where you are to right mindset. That way is to let go of the desire for perfection in your prose, at least early on.  Sentence fragments are OK.  Misspellings are OK.  Anything you write that explores the space is OK, no matter how barbarous it would look to your third-grade grammar teacher or the language pedants out there (including me).\n\n\n\nIt is more important to do the discovery process implied by writing down your ideas than it is for the result to look polished. If you hold on to that thought, get in the habit of this kind of knowledge capture, and start benefiting from it, then you might find that over time your standards rise and it gets easier to put more effort into polishing.\n\n\n\nIf that happens, sure; let it happen &#8211; but it&#8217;s not strictly necessary.  The only thing that is necessary is that you occasionally police what you&#8217;ve recorded  so it doesn&#8217;t drift into reporting something the software no longer does.  That sort of thing is a land-mine for anyone else who might read your notes and very bad form.\n\n\n\nOther than that, though, the way to get to where you do the documentation-as-knowledge-capture thing well is by starting small; allow a low bar for polish and completeness and grow the capability organically. You will know you have won when it starts being fun.",

During the pandemic: alone in my room all day, no job, collecting food stamps, another year of my life down the drain. I slipped. But each time I’d think of Obama: how they ridiculed this man, and crucified him, for giving opportunities to people like me. What kind of payback would that be to him? I thought of every brother and sister in prison, waiting for their own Obama moment. What would that do to their chances? I knew it couldn’t just be about me. I’ve been there; I know where that leads. When it’s about me, I lose. After six months the halfway house wanted to discharge me into the NYC shelter system; I didn’t know what to do. It would have broken me. It was another inmate that suggested I meet with Iris. She was a case manager at Mt. Sinai hospital, working out of a 6x6 office. Nothing on the walls. I went there wanting to hate her, but I couldn’t. She was like Oprah: her voice was calm and comforting. We started going over my health questionnaire, and my entire history was in there. She wanted to know everything. No judgement. She just seemed interested; that’s all. Afterward she told me her own story. She’d gone to prison for her boyfriend’s drugs. Sixteen years; almost the exact same time as me. Now she was raising five kids. Youngest daughter died of cancer. Yet here she was: working 80 hours a week, in a 6x6 box, helping other people. She was one of the givers. Iris got me an apartment. She arranged my hip surgeries. She got me into a job training program. In the program they teach you to be up front about your history: tell them before they ask. I had a whole speech memorized. I scheduled six different in-person interviews, and six different times I couldn’t go inside. But the seventh time I made myself do it. I walked in those doors. The manager that day was Raven Peters, that big ole peckerwood. I said: ‘My name is John Gargano. Before we begin, I want you to know there’s a 15-year gap on my resume, and this is why.’ He wouldn’t let me finish. He said: “John, I don’t care about any of that. We care about two things here: how you treat our guests, and how you make them feel.”",

        "description": "By Chong Xiang and Prateek Mittal\n\n\n\nThanks to the stunning advancement of Machine Learning (ML) technologies, ML models are increasingly being used in critical societal contexts &#8212; such as in the courtroom, where judges look to ML models to determine whether a defendant is a flight risk, and in autonomous driving,&nbsp; where driverless vehicles are operating in city downtowns. However, despite the advantages, ML models are also vulnerable to adversarial attacks, which can be harmful to society. For example, an adversary against image classifiers can augment an image with an adversarial pixel patch to induce model misclassification. Such attacks raise questions about the reliability of critical ML systems and have motivated the design of trustworthy ML models.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn this 2-part post on trustworthy machine learning design, we will focus on ML models for image classification and discuss how to protect them against adversarial patch attacks. We will first introduce the concept of adversarial patches and then present two of our defense algorithms: PatchGuard in Part 1 and PatchCleanser in Part 2.\n\n\n\nAdversarial Patch Attacks: A Threat in the Physical World\n\n\n\nThe adversarial patch attack, first proposed by Brown et al., targets image recognition models (e.g., image classifiers). The attacker aims to overlay an image with a carefully generated adversarial pixel patch to induce models’ incorrect predictions (e.g., misclassification). Below is a visual example of the adversarial patch attack against traffic sign recognition models: after attaching an adversarial patch, the model prediction changes from “stop sign” to “speed limit 80 sign” incorrectly.\n\n\n\na visual example of adversarial patch attacks taken from Yakura et al.\n\n\nNotably, this attack can be realized in the physical world. An attacker can print and attach an adversarial patch to a physical object or scene. Any image taken from this scene then becomes an adversarial image. Just imagine that a malicious sticker attached to a stop sign confuses the perception system of an autonomous vehicle and eventually leads to a serious accident! This threat to the physical world motivates us to study mitigation techniques against adversarial patch attacks.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, security is never easy. An attacker only needs to find one strategy to break the entire system while a defender has to defeat as many attack strategies as possible.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the remainder of this post, we discuss how to make an image classification model as secure as possible: able to make correct and robust predictions against attackers who know everything about the defense and who might attempt to use an adversarial patch at any image location and with any malicious content.\n\n\n\nThis as-robust-as-possible notion is referred to as provable, or certifiable, robustness in the literature. We refer interested readers to the PatchGuard and PatchCleanser papers for its formal definitions and security guarantees\n\n\n\nPatchGuard: A Defense Framework Using Small Receptive Field + Secure Aggregation\n\n\n\nPatchGuard is a defense framework for certifiably robust image classification against adversarial patch attacks. Its design is motivated by the following question:\n\n\n\nHow can we ensure that the model prediction is not hijacked by a small localized patch?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe propose a two-step defense strategy: (1) small receptive fields and (2) secure aggregation. The use of small receptive fields limits the number of corrupted features, and secure aggregation on a partially corrupted feature map allows us to make robust final predictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStep 1: Small Receptive Fields. The receptive field of an image classifier (e.g., CNN) is the region of the input image that a particular feature looks at (or is influenced by). The model prediction is based on the aggregation of features extracted from different regions of an image. By using a small receptive field, we can ensure that only a limited number of features “see” the adversarial patch.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe example below illustrates that the adversarial patch can only corrupt one feature — the red vector on the right – when we use a model with small receptive fields, marked with red and green boxes over the images.\n\n\n\n.\n\n\n\nWe provide another example below for large receptive fields. The adversarial pixels appear in the receptive fields – the area inside the red boxes – of all four features and lead to a completely corrupted feature map, making it nearly impossible to recover the correct prediction.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStep 2: Secure Aggregation. The use of small receptive fields limits the number of corrupted features and translates the defense into a secure aggregation problem: how can we make a robust prediction based on a partially corrupted feature map? Here, we can use any off-the-shelf robust statistics techniques (e.g., clipping and median) for feature aggregation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn our paper, we further propose a more powerful secure aggregation technique named robust masking. Its design intuition is to identify and remove abnormally large features. This mechanism introduces a dilemma for the attacker. If the attacker wants to launch a successful attack, it needs to either introduce large malicious feature values that will be removed by our defense, or use small feature values that can evade the masking operation, but are not malicious enough to cause misclassification.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis dilemma further allows us to analyze the defense robustness. For example, if we consider a square patch that occupies 1% of image pixels, we can calculate the largest number of corrupted features and quantitatively reason about the worst-case feature corruption (details in the paper). Our evaluation shows that, for 89.0% of images in the test set of the ImageNette dataset (a 10-class subset of the ImageNet dataset), our defense can always make correct predictions, even when the attacker has full access to our defense setup and can place a 1%-pixel square patch at any image location and with any malicious content. We note that the result of 89.0% is rigorously proved and certified in our paper, giving the defense theoretical and formal security guarantees.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFurthermore, PatchGuard is also scalable to more challenging datasets like ImageNet. We can achieve certified robustness for 32.2% of ImageNet test images, against a 1%-pixel square patch. Note that the ImageNet dataset contains images from 1000 different categories, which means that an image classifier that makes random predictions can only correctly classify roughly 1/1000=0.1% of images.\n\n\n\nTakeaways\n\n\n\nThe high-level contribution of PatchGuard is a two-step defense framework: small receptive field and secure aggregation. This simple approach turns out to be a very powerful strategy: the PatchGuard framework subsumes most of the concurrent (Clipped BagNet, De-randomized Smoothing) and follow-up works (BagCert, Randomized Cropping, PatchGuard++, ScaleCert, Smoothed ViT, ECViT). We refer interested readers to our robustness leaderboard to learn more about state-of-the-art defense performance.\n\n\n\nConclusion\n\n\n\nIn this post, we discussed the threat of adversarial patch attacks and presented our PatchGuard defense algorithm (small receptive field and secure aggregation). This defense example demonstrates one of our efforts toward building trustworthy ML models for critical societal applications such as autonomous driving.\n\n\n\nIn the second part of this two-part post, we will present PatchCleanser &#8212; our second example for designing robust ML algorithms.",

        "description": "For the 3 other people interested in this (doesn’t apply if you can manage to file your lost luggage report with Lufthansa’s web app; instead I had to physically go to C3049 and then up the stairs to the right to the Lufthansa office at C4100 to file my report in person):\n  The C3049 doorway to the Lufthansa office (who handle lost luggage) is NOT in a secure area even though the sign says it is in a secure area! It is to the right of the oversized baggage counter in international at YVR aka Vancouver airport\n  For the record: I flew Ancona (AOI) to Munich (MUC) on June 24th, missed my flight to YVR on the 24th and then flew to YVR on June 25th and my luggage didn’t show up. I tried to file a lost luggage report  via the web app on June 25th, 26th and 27th and failed so I went to the airport and filed a lost luggage report at C4100 on Tuesday June 28\n\n\nC3049 and C4100 Lufthansa Admin and Lost Luggage Office Photos\n\n\n  C3049Door is on the right of the following photo:\n\n  Actual C3049 door:\n\n  Actual Lufthansa office at C4100\n*",

        "description": "Over the past several years there has been a drive to hold US-based ISPs liable for copyright infringements carried out by their customers.\nThese Internet providers are accused of not doing enough to stop copyright infringers on their networks, even after receiving multiple ‘copyright infringement’ notifications.\nThe copyright infringement allegations can have real consequences. In 2019, a Virginia jury ordered Internet provider Cox to pay a billion dollars in damages to a group of major record labels. The decision is being appealed but at the same time, other ISPs have been dragged to court over similar issues.\nFilmmakers Sue AT&#038;T\nThis week, AT&#038;T, the largest terrestrial Internet provider in the US, joins the list of accused ISPs. In a complaint filed at a federal court in Texas, Voltage Pictures and its affiliates, known for films such as “After We Collided,” “Dallas Buyers Club,” “Room 203,” and “The Bird Catcher”, accuse the ISP of contributory and vicarious copyright infringement. \n&#8220;For years, AT&#038;T has knowingly allowed AT&#038;T users to engage in online piracy, the illegal distribution and downloading of copyrighted materials, including films. AT&#038;T provides the IP addresses used for piracy, makes the connections needed to share and download pirated films, and transmits the pirated films,&#8221; they write.\n\nThe ISP allegedly turned a blind eye to pirating subscribers, facilitating mass online piracy. The filmmakers say they sent tens of thousands of notices to the company, reporting alleged copyright infringements. \n1,000+ Notices for One IP-address\nIn some cases, hundreds of notices were sent for a single IP address without any visible response from the Internet provider. \n&#8220;For example, AT&#038;T failed to terminate the account of its subscriber at IP address 104.5.19.25 even after AT&#038;T received multiple notices of copyright infringement at this address. AT&#038;T received at least 1000 notices of copyright infringement for this IP address,&#8221; the complaint reads.\nIn the United States, the law requires Internet providers to adopt a policy that provides for the termination of accounts of repeat infringers, under appropriate circumstances. AT&#038;T references this in its terms but according to the filmmakers&#8217; complaint, this policy is not sufficient.\nProfit Motive?\nThe lawsuit specifically claims that AT&#038;T willingly keeps repeat infringers on board because that adds tens of millions of dollars to AT&#038;T’s bottom line.\n&#8220;[O]nline piracy is lucrative for AT&#038;T. AT&#038;T profits from subscriptions to its internet services. Instead of taking simple steps against illegal pirating, AT&#038;T turns a blind eye and continues to collect its customers’ subscription payments every month.&#8221; \nThese and other allegations will need to be backed up with further evidence, but the filmmakers are convinced that AT&#038;T is liable for both contributory and vicarious copyright infringement. \nDamages, Disconnections, and Site Blocking\nTo compensate for all piracy-related losses, the plaintiffs request actual or statutory damages, which can run into millions of dollars. In addition, they also want AT&#038;T to terminate repeat infringers under appropriate circumstances. \nAs mentioned earlier, AT&#038;T already has such as policy and the company has terminated repeat infringers in the past. According to the complaint, that is insufficient.\nFinally, and of particular interest, the movie companies also want the Internet provider to block foreign pirate sites. They include YTS, The Pirate Bay, RARBG, 1337x, and others that have been called out in the US Trade Representative&#8217;s annual overview of notorious markets.\nAT&#038;T is expected to contest these allegations but has not yet responded to the complaint. When it does, we will report accordingly.\n\n&#8212;\nA copy of the complaint, filed by Voltage Pictures et al. at the District Court of the Northern District of Texas, is available here (pdf).\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "Well hey there, it&#8217;s been a few months, so it&#8217;s time for another roundup of what I&#8217;ve been reading, watching, listening to, and experiencing recently. In addition to the stuff below, I have a few things in progress: the second season of Russian Doll, Oliver Burkeman&#8217;s Four Thousand Weeks, and I just started dipping into Rebecca Woolf&#8217;s forthcoming memoir, All of This. Oh, and I&#8217;m listening to Russell Shorto&#8217;s The Island at the Center of the World on audiobook and the third season of Michael Lewis&#8217; Against the Rules podcast. All always, don&#8217;t sweat the letter grades too much.\n\n\n\nEverything Everywhere All at Once. This movie is a little bit of a miracle: action, comedy, heartfelt, and a little bit of a mess, all together in a perfect balance. This is the best movie I&#8217;ve seen in ages. (A+)\n\nEncanto. The kids and I liked it fine. (B+)\n\nThe Expanse (season six). I&#8217;m going to miss spending time in this world with these people. (A-)\n\nMatrix by Lauren Groff. Was delighted and moved by this work of historical fiction about Marie de France. (A)\n\n\n\nStation Eleven. I loved the slow burn and resolution of this show. I didn&#8217;t think I wanted to watch a TV show about a flu pandemic causing the end of civilization, but it was actually perfect. Both actresses who played Kirsten were fantastic. (A/A+)\n\nThe Last Duel. Every director is entitled to their Rashomon I guess? And I&#8217;m not sure Matt Damon was the right choice here&#8230; (B)\n\nPig. Had no idea what to expect from this one. Even so, Taken + Truffle Hunters + Fight Club + Ratatouille was a surprise. (B+)\n\nStrafford ice cream. This Black-owned dairy farm makes the richest, creamiest ice cream I&#8217;ve ever had. So glad I randomly bought a pint of it a few months ago&#8230;I&#8217;m never going back to anything else. (A)\n\nSeverance. Fantastic opening credits sequence and while I wasn&#8217;t as enamored as many were after the first few episodes, the show definitely grew on me. (A-)\n\nMy Brilliant Friend (season three). I don&#8217;t know why there&#8217;s no more buzz about this show. The acting, world-building, story, and Max Richter&#8217;s soundtrack are all fantastic. And the fight against fascism! (A)\n\nThe Gilded Age. Exactly what I wanted out of a period drama from the maker of Downton Abbey and Gosford Park. (B+)\n\nExhalation. Second time through, this time on audiobook. I love these stories - Chiang is a genius. (A)\n\nThe Book of Boba Fett. This turned into season 2.5 of The Mandalorian and I am totally ok with that. (B+)\n\nOther People&#8217;s Money podcast. As a snack-sized in-between season for his excellent Against the Rules podcast, Michael Lewis revisits his first book, Liar&#8217;s Poker, written about his experience working for Salomon Brothers in the 80s. (A-)\n\nThe King&#8217;s Man. Not as fun as the first movie but more fun than the second one? But they all could be better. (B)\n\nTurning Red. I loved Domee Shi&#8217;s short film, Bao, and this film is similarly clever and heartfelt. (A-)\n\n\n\nDrive My Car. Really appreciated the cinematography of this one; wish I could have seen it in the theater. (A-)\n\nJennifer Packer at The Whitney. I was unfamiliar with Packer&#8217;s work before seeing this exhibition, but I&#8217;m a fan now. (A-)\n\nLicorice Pizza. I&#8217;m really flabbergasted at the two pointless racist scenes in this film. PT Anderson is a better filmmaker than this. It&#8217;s a shame because I enjoyed the rest of the film &#8212; the two leads are great. Can&#8217;t recommend it though. (D) \n\nDeath on the Nile. These movies are fun. Sometimes all you want to do is watch Kenneth Branagh chew scenery as Hercule Poirot. (B+)\n\nMoonfall. Not as fun or coherent (I know, lol) as some of Emmerich&#8217;s other movies. The acting in this is&#8230;not great. (C+)\n\nHawkeye. Fun but I don&#8217;t know how many more Marvel things I want to keep up with. (B)\n\nSpider-Man: No Way Home. Tom Holland&#8217;s Spider-Man is always fun. (B+)\n\nFantastic Beasts: The Secrets of Dumbledore. Better than the overcomplicated sequel and Mikkelsen was a better Grindelwald than Depp. The story wrapped up so nicely that who knows if there will be a fourth movie. (B)\n\n\n\nThe Tragedy of Macbeth. Brilliant cinematography and set design. (B+)\n\nThe Batman. Oh I don&#8217;t know. I guess this was a pretty decent detective story, but I&#8217;m not sure why Batman needed to be involved. (B)\n\nThe Northman. This would have been much better had it ended 20 minutes sooner. Not sure we needed another movie that concludes with ultimately pointless violent masculine revenge. (B-)\n\nKimi. Soderbergh does Rear Window + The Conversation. The direction is always tight and Zo&euml; Kravitz is great in this. (A-)\n\nThe Mysterious Benedict Society. The kids and I enjoyed this solid adaptation of the first book of a popular series. (B+)\n\nArmageddon. The pace of this movie is incredible &#8212; it just drops you right into the action and never stops for more than 2 hours. Also, the top question when searching this movie title on Google is &#8220;Is Armageddon movie a true story?&#8221; *sigh* (B-)\n\nPast installments of my media diet are available here.\n\n Tags: art&nbsp;&nbsp; books&nbsp;&nbsp; food&nbsp;&nbsp; media diet&nbsp;&nbsp; movies&nbsp;&nbsp; podcasts&nbsp;&nbsp; TV&nbsp;&nbsp; video",

        "description": "First, my complaint to Simply NUC about the recent comedy of errors around my attempt to  order a replacement fan for Cathy&#8217;s NUC.   Sorry, I was not able to beat WordPress&#8217;s new editor into displaying URLs literally, and I have no idea why the last one turns into a Kindle link.\n\n\n\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-\n\n\n\nSubject: An unfortunate series of events\n\n\n\nSimply NUC claims to be a one-stop shop for NUC needs and a customer-centric company. I would very much like to do business with an outfit that lives up to Simply NUC&#8217;s claims for itself. This email is how about I observed it to fail on both levels.\n\n\n\nA little over a week ago my wife&#8217;s NUC &#8211; which is her desktop\nmachine, having replaced a conventional tower system in 2018 &#8211;\ndeveloped a serious case of bearing whine. Since 1981 I have\nbuilt, tinkered with, and deployed more PCs than I can remember,\nso I knew this probably meant the NUC&#8217;s fan bearings were becoming\nworn and could pack up at any moment.\n\n\n\nShipping the machine out for service was unappealing, partly for cost\nreasons but mostly because my wife does paying work on it and can&#8217;t\nafford to have it out of service for an unpredictable amount of time.\nSo I went shopping for a replacement fan.\n\n\n\nThe search &#8220;NUC fan replacement&#8221;  took me here:\n\n\n\nhttps://techsterweb.com/2019/05/01/nuc-replacement-fans/\n\n\n\nThere was a sentence that said &#8220;As of right now SimplyNUC offersreplacement fans for all NUC models.&#8221; Chasing the embedded linklanded me on the Simply NUC site here:\n\n\n\nhttps://simplynuc.com/nuc-accessories/?category=Fans\n\n\n\nNow bear in mind that I had not disassembled my wife&#8217;s NUC yet,\nthat I had landed from a link that said &#8220;replacement fans for all\nNUC models&#8221;, and that I didn&#8217;t know different NUCs used different\nfan sizes.\n\n\n\nThe first problem I had was that this page did nothing to even hint\nthat the one fan pictured might not be a universal fit.  Dominic has\ntold me over the phone that &#8220;Dawson&#8221; is a NUC type, and if I had known\nthat I might have interpreted the caption as &#8220;fit only for Dawsons&#8221;.\nBut I didn&#8217;t, and the caption &#8220;Dawson BAPA0508R5U fan&#8221; looks exactly\nas though &#8220;Dawson&#8221; is the *fan vendor*.\n\n\n\nSo I placed the order, muttering to myself because there aren&#8217;t any\nshipping options less expensive than FedEx.\n\n\n\nA properly informative page would have labeled the fan with its product code and had text below that said &#8220;Compatible with Dawson Canyon NUCs.&#8221; That way, customers landing there could get a clue that the BAPA0508R5U is not a universal replacement for all NUC fans.\n\n\n\nA page in conformance with Simply NUC&#8217;s stated mission to be a\none-stop NUC shop would also carry purchase links to other fans fitted\nfor different model ranges, like the Delta BSC0805HA I found out later\nis required for my wife&#8217;s NUC8i3BEH1.\n\n\n\nThe uninformative website page was strike one.\n\n\n\nIn the event, when the fan arrived, I disassembled my wife&#8217;s\nNUC and instantly discovered that (a) it wasn&#8217;t even remotely the right\nsize, and (b) it didn&#8217;t even match the fan in the website picture!  What I\nwas\nshipped was not a BAPA0508R5U, it&#8217;s a BAAA0508RSH.\n\n\n\nNot getting the product I ordered was strike two.\n\n\n\nI got on the Simply NUC website&#8217;s Zendesk chat and talked with a\nperson named Bobbie who seemed to want to be helpful (I point this out\nbecause, until I spoke with Dominic, this was the one single occasion\non which Simply NUC behaved like it might be run by competent\npeople). I ended up emailing her a side-by-side photo of the two fans.\nIt&#8217;s attached.\n\n\n\nBobbie handed me off to one Sean McClure, and that is when my\nexperience turned from bad to terrible.  If I were a small-minded\nperson I would be suggesting that you fire Mr. McClure. But I&#8217;m\nnot; I think the actual fault here is that nobody has ever explained\nto this man what his actual job is, nor trained him properly in\nhow to do it.\n\n\n\nAnd that is his *management&#8217;s* fault. Somebody &#8211; possibly one\nof the addressees of this note &#8211; failed him.\n\n\n\nBack during the dot-com boom I was on the board of directors of\na Silly Valley startup that sold PCs to run Linux, competing\ndirectly with Sun Microsystems. So I *do* in fact know what Sean\nMcClure&#8217;s job is.  It&#8217;s to *retain customers*. It&#8217;s to not alienate\npossible future revenue streams.\n\n\n\nWhen a properly trained support representative reads a story like\nmine, the first words he types ought to be something equivalent to\n&#8220;I&#8217;m terribly sorry, we clearly screwed up, let me set up an RMA for\nthat.&#8221;  Then we could discuss how Simply NUC can serve my actual\nrequirements.\n\n\n\nThat is how you recruit a loyal customer who will do repeat business\nand recommend you to his peers. That is how you live up to the\nlanguage on the &#8220;About&#8221; page of your website.\n\n\n\nHere&#8217;s what happened instead:\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately we don&#8217;t keep those fans in stock. You can try reaching\nout to\nIntel directly to see if they have a replacement or if they will need to\nRMA\nyour device. You can submit warranty requests to:\nsupporttickets.intel.com, a\nlogin will need to be created in order to submit the warranty request.\nFans can\nalso be sourced online but will require personal research.\n\n\n\n\nThis is not an answer, it&#8217;s a defensive crouch that says &#8220;We don&#8217;t\ncare, and we don&#8217;t want your future business&#8221;. Let me enumerate the\nways it is wrong, in case you two are so close to the problem that you\ndon&#8217;t see it.\n\n\n\n\n\n1. 99% odds that a customer with a specific requirement for a\nreplacement part is calling you because he does *not* want to RMA the\nentire device and have it out of service for an unpredictable amount\nof time.  A support tech that doesn&#8217;t understand this has not been\ntaught to identify with a customer in distress.\n\n\n\n 2. A support tech that understands his real job &#8211; customer retention &#8211; will move heaven and earth rather than refer the customer to a competing vendor.  Even if the order was only for a $15 fan, because the customer might be experimenting to see if the company is a competent outfit to handle bigger orders.  As I was; you were never going to get 1,000 orders for whole NUCs from me but more than one was certainly possible.  And I have a lot of friends. \n\n\n\n3. &#8220;Personal research&#8221;?  That&#8217;s the phrase that really made me\nangry. If it&#8217;s not Simply NUC&#8217;s job to know how to source parts for\nNUCs, so that I the customer don&#8217;t have to know that, what *is* the\ncompany&#8217;s value proposition?\n\n\n\nMatters were not improved when I discovered that typing BAPA0508R5U\ninto a search engine instanntly turned up several sources for the fan\nI need, including this Amazon page:\n\n\n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07XR1QHXL\n\n\n\nA support tech who understood his actual job would have done that\nsearch the instant he had IDed the fan from the image I sent him, and\nreplied approximately like this: &#8220;We don&#8217;t currently stock that fan;\nI&#8217;ll ask our product guys to fix this and it should show on our Fans\npage in &lt;a reasonable period&gt;.  In the meantime, I found it on Amazon;\nhere&#8217;s the link.&#8221;\n&gt;\n\n\n\nAs it is, &#8220;personal research&#8221; was strike three.\n\n\n\nOh, and my return query about whether I could get a refund wasn&#8217;t even\nrefused.\nIt wasn&#8217;t even answered.\n\n\n\nMy first reaction to this sequence of blunders was to leave a scathingly bad review of Simply NUC on TrustPilot.  My second reaction was to think that, in fairness, the company deserves a full account of the blunders directed at somebody with the authority to fix what is broken.\n\n\n\nYour move.\n\n\n\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-\n\n\n\nHere&#8217;s the reply I got:\n\n\n\n&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-\n\n\n\nMr. Raymond, while I always welcome customer feedback and analyze it foropportunities to improve our operations, I will not entertain customers whoverbally berate, belittle, or otherwise use profanity directed at myemployees or our company.

        "description": "(10/13) “I was 48 years old when they let me out. Twelve years of incarceration. The HIV medication had decayed my bones so badly, I could barely walk. I needed two full hip replacements. When they were checking me out at Discharge, the guards made a joke. They said: ‘See you when you get back.’ Same joke they make with everyone. It’s what they want. They want you back. Because without inmates, there’s no funding. No free labor, no correction officer picnics, no paid overtime. They need you coming back; 78 percent of inmates are reincarcerated within 3 years. ‘See you when you get back.’ Not me, motherfucker. Not 56134066. You’re never seeing me again. I’ve lost too much time. I decided right then, limping across that parking lot, that I was going to beat these people. And there’s only one way to beat a system incentivized by your failure, and that’s by succeeding. They don’t lift a finger to help you. They let you out with no money, no clothes. No health coverage. Not even a fucking driver’s license. At least someone from the clemency initiative escorted me to a halfway house in the Bronx; most guys just get dumped at the bus stop. The halfway house is just another arm of the criminal justice system. So many rules that it’s nearly impossible to get a full-time job. Most guys just give up, but I tried. I sent out applications to restaurant after restaurant. I’d see the same ‘Help Wanted’ ads in the newspaper for weeks. But the moment they found out about my record, they didn’t want help from me. Not 56134066. I developed a phobia of telling people about my past. I couldn’t hear it one more time. It’s the same message, coming from everywhere: ‘You made your choice. You’ve chosen to belong to this class of people. Now stay there.’ The whole world is saying it: scumbag, scumbag, scumbag. Then somehow, all on your own, living off food stamps, despite all your regret, all your self-loathing, you’ve got to summon the fortitude to not believe them. While the whole time it’s right there. One sniff. One sniff to erase everything: the HIV, every year I spent in prison, every cop, every CO, every judge that made me feel like nothing. One sniff to feel invincible again.”",

        "description": "To the public at large, blockchains and NFTs are often associated with volatile coins and expensive JPG files.\nHowever, beyond the major headlines, many projects in development put this technology to use in novel ways. \nThe European Union recognized this potential several years ago. In 2017, the European Commission started exploring options to use blockchain technology to combat online piracy and counterfeiting. Today, more than half a decade later, this vision is about to become reality. \nIn 2018  the European Commission and the European Union Intellectual Property Office (EUIPO) launched their first 48-hour &#8220;blockathon,&#8221; which aimed to develop concrete projects. With the help of talented developers, this resulted in a project that will help to fight counterfeit products. \nFast forward four years and the EU&#8217;s blockchain-based anti-counterfeiting solution is about to see the light of day. In a recent update, EUIPO&#8217;s Claire Castel informed the World Intellectual Property Organization that a live version of the project should be up and running soon. \nEU Anti-Counterfeit NFTs\nIn basic terms, the anti-counterfeiting blockchain allows manufacturers to create unique tokens for all their products as proof of authenticity. This record is kept on the blockchain and can be transferred to others if the underlying product is sold. \nThese tokens are &#8220;non-fungible,&#8221; better known as NFTs, and can be kept in a regular blockchain wallet. The EU sees them as unique &#8220;digital twins&#8221; of a physical product that signifies proof of legitimacy and ownership.\n&#8220;The record on the blockchain is a unique and immutable token. As goods pass from one party to another, the token is exchanged between digital wallets. The combination of a unique product identity and the continuous transfer of the digital identity between wallets creates proof that the goods are genuine.&#8221; \n&#8220;Along the journey of a product, customs and other enforcement authorities can access information, such as authentic shipping records, which can support risk assessment,&#8221; Castel adds.\n\nThe EU sees many benefits of a blockchain-based solution. The unique NFTs make it easier for consumers and enforcement agencies to authenticate products. However, the NFTs will also help with product recalls, and allow manufacturers to communicate directly with consumers over the blockchain.\n&#8220;Since the right holder defines what type of data is included in the digital twin, it could also lead to a targeted loyalty program based on product specifications,&#8221; Castel notes. \nOpen and Compatible\nThe EU initiative aims to be open and compatible with the broader NFT marketplace. Brand owners can choose their own NFT platform, for example. However, the EU blockchain services infrastructure, which is currently being developed, will have a central role.\n&#8220;The solution will introduce a common language in order for track-and-trace providers, NFT platforms and logistics enterprise resources planning (ERP) to collect and share proper data for anti-counterfeiting operations. \n&#8220;The EUIPO will additionally create an identity management system, which will also act as the knowledge repository system to store interested stakeholders’ identities and product location, thus positioning the EUIPO at the center of the ecosystem.&#8221; \nThis might sound quite futuristic to some, but the project is already in the final stages. The EUIPO is actively engaging with brand owners and will continue to test the system later this year. In addition, EU customs authorities, logistics operators and retailers are on board as well. \nBased on the current planning, a live version of the EU&#8217;s blockchain anti-counterfeiting technology will go live by the end of 2023.\n&#8212;-\nThe quotes above are from a document EUIPO&#8217;s Claire Castel prepared for WIPO, which was shared with the Advisory Committee on Enforcement last week.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "link": "https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2022/07/01/switzerlands-e-voting-the-threat-model/",
        "description": "Part 5 of a 5-part series starting here\n\n\n\nSwitzerland commissioned independent expert reviews of the E-voting system built by Swiss Post. &nbsp; One of those experts concluded, “as imperfect as the current system might be when judged against a nonexistent ideal, the current system generally appears to achieve its stated goals, under the corresponding assumptions and the specific threat model around which it was designed.”\n\n\n\nI have explained the ingenious idea (in the Swiss Post system) behind client-side security:&nbsp; because the voter’s computer may be quite insecure, because the client-side voting app may be under control of a hacker, keep certain secrets on paper that the computer can’t see.&nbsp; Professor Ford, the systems-security expert, points out that part of the threat model is:&nbsp; if the printing contractor is corrupt, that prints the paper and mails it, then the system is insecure.\n\n\n\nThe new threat model in 2022. But I’ll now add something to the threat model that I would not have thought about last year:&nbsp; Step one of the voter’s workflow is, “type in a 20-character password from the paper into the voting app.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the old days (2020 and before) the voter would do this using a physical or on-screen keyboard.&nbsp; In the modern era (2022) you might do this using Apple’s “live text”, in which you aim your phone camera at anything with text in it, and then you can copy-paste from the picture.&nbsp; And, of course, if you do that, then the phone sees all the secrets on the paper.\n\n\n\nSo the security of the Swiss Post E-voting system relies entirely on a trick–that the voter’s computer can’t know the secret numbers on a piece of paper–that has been made obsolete by advances in consumer technology.\n\n\n\nVoter behavior as a component of the threat model.&nbsp; Experts in voting protocols came to realize, over the past two decades, the importance of dispute resolution in a voting protocol.&nbsp; That is, suppose a voter comes to realize, while participating in an e-voting system (or at a physical polling-place) that the election system is not properly tallying their vote.&nbsp; Can the voter prove this to the election officials in a way that appropriate action will be taken, and their vote will be tallied correctly? &nbsp; If not, then we say the dispute resolution system has failed.\n\n\n\nAlso, experts have come to understand that voters are only human: they overlook things and they don’t check their work.&nbsp; So the voting system must have a human-centered design that works for real people.\n\n\n\nIn my previous post I described the Swiss Post E-voting protocol:\n\n\n\nThe voter receives a printed sheet in the mail;The voter copies the start-voting-key into the browser (or voting app);The voter selects candidates in the app;The app encodes the ballot using the serial number, and transmits to the servers;The servers send back “return codes” to the app, which then displays them to the voter;The voter looks up the return codes on the printed sheet to make sure they match the candidate selections.\n\n\n\nBut what if most voters omit step 6, checking the return codes?&nbsp; Then the voting app could get away with cheating: encode the wrong candidates, the server will send return codes for those wrong candidates, and the voter won’t notice.\n\n\n\nTo address that problem, Swiss Post added more steps to the protocol:\n\n\n\nVoter enters “ballot casting key” into the app to confirm that they’ve checked the return codes; app transmits that to serversServers transmit another return-code to confirm.Voter checks that the “vote cast return code” displayed by the app matches the one on the paper.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis protocol is becoming ridiculously complex – not exactly human-centered.&nbsp; Even so, here’s how the app could cheat:&nbsp; fail to transmit the “ballot casting key” to the servers, and make up a fake “Vote cast return code”.&nbsp; If the voter omits step 9, then the app has gotten away with cheating: it didn’t manage to cast a vote for the wrong candidate, but it did manage to cancel the voter’s ballot.\n\n\n\nAnd what’s the voter supposed to do if the return codes don’t match?&nbsp; Recall what’s printed in red on the paper:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd what should the authorities do if voters call that phone number and claim that the return codes don’t match?&nbsp; This video (found on this page) suggests the answer: the voter is told, “we didn’t count your e-vote, you should vote on paper by physical mail instead.”\n\n\n\nA big danger is that voters skip step 6 (diligently check every return code against the paper printout) and proceed directly to step 7 (enter the “casting key” to submit their ballot).&nbsp; Would voters really do that?&nbsp; Of course they would: research has shown over and over that voters don’t carefully reconfirm on paper the choices they made on-screen.\n\n\n\nYou might think, “I’ll check my own result, so it’s OK.”&nbsp; But if thousands of your fellow voters are careless with step 6, that allows the voting app (if hacked) to change thousands of their votes, which can change the outcome of your election.&nbsp; For a full analysis, see Ballot-Marking Devices (BMDs) Cannot Assure the Will of the Voters (here’s the non-paywall version).\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, the protocol has many, many steps for the voter to follow, and even then it’s not robust against typical voter behavior. &nbsp; These issues were left out of the threat model that the experts examined.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOther threats: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For brevity, I didn’t even describe some other threats that the experts should probably consider in their next-round evaluation.&nbsp; For example:\n\n\n\nWhen the (hacked) app transmits a fake vote and displays a fake return-code, it could also display a (fake) “return code doesn’t match, try again” button.&nbsp; If the user clicks there, then the app transmits the real vote (the one the voter selected) and gets back the real return code.&nbsp; In that case, the app hasn’t succeeded in stealing this voter’s vote, but the voter is reassured and doesn’t alert the hotline.That last point is an indication of a more general threat:&nbsp; the hacked app can change the protocol, at least the part of the protocol that involves interaction with the voter, by giving the voter fraudulent instructions.&nbsp; There could be a whole class of threats there; I invite the reader to invent some.Back to step 9:&nbsp; Suppose an attacker hacks thousands of voter computers/phones, so thousands of voters get bad return codes (because their vote has been stolen), and some percentage of them will notice (in step 9) and call the phone number to report.&nbsp; That is, a couple hundred calls come in to the hotline.&nbsp; Hundreds of calls to the hotline is evidence either that thousands of votes are being stolen, or that hundreds of voters are falsely reporting.&nbsp; Should the election be re-run?&nbsp; The point is, the election protocol is not complete without a written protocol for what the authorities should do in this case.&nbsp; And unfortunately, there’s nothing good they can do; which is already a serious flaw in the whole system.I discussed, “the (hacked) computer might be able to see what’s on the paper.”&nbsp; But consider this:&nbsp; within a few years after deployment of such a system, it’s easy to imagine that voters will pressure election administrators, “can’t you just e-mail my voter-sheet to me (as a PDF) instead of sending paper in physical mail?”&nbsp; Then it’s trivial for a (hacked) computer or phone to see all the return codes on the voter sheet.&nbsp; It will be natural for an election administrator to forget that the security of this whole system relies on the fact that the computer can’t see the paper; sending the “paper” as a PDF defeats that crucial security mechanism.The same is true if the voter-sheet is faxed to the voter; fax is internet, these days.",

        "description": "For decades, marketers (and politicians) have been working to amplify cultural distress, a hack on our emotions.\r\nNot the tragic emotional distress of being unable to care for your kids, find a place to live or deal with trauma, but the invented cultural distress of modern industrialized societies.\r\nThis is the easily created shame of not having a new suit to wear to the garden party, or having to use an old model smartphone instead of the new one. It&#8217;s the dissatisfaction of knowing that something &#8216;better&#8217; is available, and the invented discontent that comes from the peer pressure of being left out or left behind.\r\nOr it might be the social shame that comes from not having a big enough presence on social media, or the fomo that watching other people presenting nothing but happiness online can create.\r\nIt can be amplified with a sort of nostalgia for times when everything was perfect, or anxiety about a future when we imagine we won&#8217;t have enough.\r\nFear of this sort of cultural distress pushes us to simply spend money to avoid it. It&#8217;s easier to lose your life&#8217;s savings and peace of mind to end-of-life care than it is to simply draft a living will. It&#8217;s easier to give in to the high-pressure tactics of a real estate broker than it is to look squarely at the feelings that you might not actually get this particular house. Making a budget is hard, paying for not making one is easy.\r\nIt turns out that selling an easy and convenient way to avoid social pain is a nearly boundless formula for corporate growth. And so people with a lot of resources are still unhappy, because they succumb to invented narratives about cultural distress&#8211;and then, once they buy something to avoid it, discover that it&#8217;s still there.\r\nMarathon runners don&#8217;t complain about the tired, because getting tired is a necessary component of a well-run race. And human beings are always going to find moments of cultural distress, and it&#8217;s up to each of us to decide what to trade (in the short run and the long run) to deal with it. Perhaps it makes sense simply to acknowledge that it&#8217;s present.\r\n\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&#160;",

        "title": "Some PSAs for NUC owners",
        "link": "http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8725",
        "description": "I&#8217;ve written before, in Contemplating the Cute Brick, that I&#8217;m a big fan of Intel&#8217;s NUC line of small-form-factor computers.  Over the last week I&#8217;ve been having some unpleasant learning experiences around them.  I&#8217;m still a fan, but I&#8217;m shipping this post where the search engines can see it in support of future NUC owners in trouble.\n\n\n\nTwo years ago I bought an NUC for my wife Cathy to replace her last tower-case PC &#8211; the NUC8i3BEH1.  This model was semi-obsolete even then, but I didn&#8217;t want one of the newer i5 or i7 NUCs because I didn&#8217;t think it would fit my wife&#8217;s needs as well.\n\n\n\nWhat my wife does with her computer doesn&#8217;t tax it much.  Web browsing, office work, a bit of gaming that does not extend to recent AAA titles demanding the latest whizzy graphics card.  I thought her needs would be best served by a small, quiet, low-power-consumption machine that was cheap enough to be considered readily disposable at the end of its service life.  The exact opposite of my Great Beast&#8230;\n\n\n\nThe NUC was an experiment that made Cathy and me happy. She especially likes the fact that it&#8217;s  small and light enough to be mounted on the back of her monitor,  so it effectively takes up no desk space or floor area in her rather crowded office.  I like the NUC&#8217;s industrial design and engineering &#8211; lots of nice little details like the four case screws being captive to the baseplate so you cannot lose them during disassembly.\n\n\n\nAlso. Dammit, NUCs are pretty.  I say dammit because I feel like this shouldn&#8217;t matter to me and am a bit embarrassed to discover that it does. I like the color and shape and feel of these devices.  Someone did an amazing job of making them unobtrusively attractive.\n\n\n\nHowever&#8230;\n\n\n\nLast week, Cathy registered a complaint that her NUC was making a funny noise.  I went and listened and, alas, it was clearly the sound of the fan bearing in the NUC, screaming. That sound means you have worn or dirty bearing surfaces and the fan could fail at any time, forcing the device to shut down before it roasts its own components.\n\n\n\nPSA #1:   If you web-search for &#8220;NUC fan replacement&#8221;, you may well land at the website of a company specializing in NUC sales and support, named &#8220;Simply NUC&#8221;; I did.  Do not buy from these people; they are lazy jerks.\n\n\n\nFirst reason I know this: the &#8220;Fans&#8221; subpage in their Accessories section carries a link to exactly one model of fan. No indication of the range of NUC variants it matches, and not even a general warning that there are NUC models that require a different-sized fan.  I had to find this out the hard way by pulling out the innards of Cathy&#8217;s NUC  and sitting the fan I bought from Simply NUC next to it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSecond reason I know this: Simply NUC tech support was unhelpful, telling me they only carry that one fan and suggesting that I RMA Cathy&#8217;s machine back to Intel for repair, because obviously there could be no conceivable problem with it being out of service for an indefinite amount of time.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked if Simply NUC knew of a source for a fan that would fit  my 8i3BEH1 &#8211; a reasonable question, I think, to ask a company that loudly claims to be a one-stop shop for all NUC needs &#8211; the reply email told me I&#8217;d have to do &#8220;personal research&#8221; on that. \n\n\n\nIt turns out that if the useless drone who was Simply NUC &#8220;service&#8221; had cared about doing his actual job, he could have the read the fan&#8217;s model number off the image I had sent him into a search box and found multiple sources within seconds, because that&#8217;s what I then did.  Of course this would have required caring that a customer was unhappy, which apparently they don&#8217;t do at Simply NUC.\n\n\n\nThird reason I know this: My request for a refund didn&#8217;t even get refused; it wasn&#8217;t even answered.\n\n\n\nIt actually took some work to get the NUC board and fan out if its case.  I watched some YouTube videos purporting to illuminate the process; none of them quite matched the hardware I was looking at and none told me the One Weird Trick I actually needed to know.  Therefore:\n\n\n\nPSA #2:  If you&#8217;ve taken out both hold-down screws and the board still seems mechanically locked in place, it may well be because the NUC case is designed like that.  On some NUCs you need to flex the two case walls with connector ports outwards by about a millimeter on each side so the connectors will pop out of their exit holes.  The case is made of thin, springy metal; thumb pressure will do it.\n\n\n\nSo now I&#8217;m waiting on a second replacement fan to arrive. But there is good news; while I had the thing disassembled I blew out all the dust I could see with a can of air, playing it liberally over the fan.  And since I reassembled it,  it hasn&#8217;t screamed once.  So:\n\n\n\nPSA#3: Your NUC fan noise problem might be solvable just by blowing out the moondust under and around the fan bearings.\n\n\n\nWe&#8217;ll see. If I&#8217;m feeling lazy when the new fan arrives, I&#8217;ll leave it in the parts drawer until and unless the one now in the NUC fails. If I&#8217;m feeling energetic, I&#8217;ll swap in the new one, then disassemble and thoroughly clean and oil the old one before putting it in the drawer.",

        "description": "(9/13) “August 3rd, 2016. There was heat that took the breath out of you: Alabama, 150-degree, muggy, humid, nasty fucking heat. Thankfully I was the landscape clerk, so I had my own desk. I was sitting there when I heard this jive turkey redneck voice over the intercom, asking me to report to the warden’s office at 12:30. It sounded like I was in trouble. I went to lunch, asked a few people what was going on. But nobody knew. When I get to the office there’s like eight guys sitting on the bench outside. Nobody knows each other, nobody’s talking, nobody knows what’s going on. But at some point it hits me, and I ask: ‘Did everyone here apply for clemency?’ And they said yes. And I said: ‘Well guys, this is it.’ They got called in one-by-one. And one-by-one they came out, each one of them cursing and slamming the door. I’m thinking: ‘Fuck, this ain’t good.’ I was the last name called. The phone on the desk started ringing the second I walked in. The associate warden tells me to pick it up. Touching the warden’s phone means six months in the shoe, so I hesitated. He says: ‘That’s a direct order.’ So I pick up the phone, and a female voice says: ‘Is this Mr. Gargano?’ And I’m like, ‘yah.’ And the voice says: ‘We’re calling to let you know that President Obama signed your petition this morning. You’re going home in four days.’ I went completely numb. I don’t think I even gave her a proper thank you. The landscape clerk has a golf cart. So I sleepwalked to my golf cart, and I drove it to a courtyard. I’d planted some flowers there: it was part of my responsibility. I sat down on a bench, and I cried. I wanted to celebrate. I wanted to scream. There was a fucking 4th of July firework finale going on in my heart, but I kept it under a blanket. There were other guys around, who might be more deserving than me, and I wanted to be respectful. So I just cried. I cried for an hour. I stayed there until it was getting close to count time, then I walked back to my unit. I called my mom. She said: ‘Johnny, what’s wrong?’ I said: ‘Nothing’s wrong, Mom.’ She said: ‘Johnny, what is it? What’s wrong?’ I said: ‘Nothing’s wrong, Mom. I’m coming home. I’m coming home in four days.’”",

        "link": "https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2022/06/30/what-the-assessments-say-about-the-swiss-e-voting-system/",
        "description": "(Part 4 of a 5-part series starting here)\n\n\n\nIn 2021 the Swiss government commissioned several in-depth technical studies of the Swiss Post E-voting system, by independent experts from academia and private consulting firms.&nbsp; They sought to assess, does the protocol as documented guarantee the security called for by Swiss law (the “ordinance on electronic voting”, OEV)?&nbsp; Does the system as implemented in software correctly correspond to the protocol as documented?&nbsp; Are the networks and systems, on which the system is deployed, adequately secure?\n\n\n\nBefore the reports even answer those questions, they point out: “the engineers who build the system need to do a better job of documenting how the software, line by line, corresponds to the protocol it’s supposed to be implementing.”&nbsp; That is, this kind of assessment can’t work on an impenetrable black-box system; the Swiss Post developers have made good progress in “showing their work” so that it can be assessed, but they need to keep improving.\n\n\n\nAnd this is a very complex protocol, and system, because it’s attempting to solve a very difficult problem:&nbsp; conduct an election securely even though some of the servers and most of the client computers may be under the control of an adversary. &nbsp; The server-side solution is to split the trust among several servers using a cryptographic consensus protocol.&nbsp; The client-side solution is what I described in the previous post: even if the client computer is hacked, it’s not supposed to be able to succeed in cheating because there are certain secrets that it can’t see, printed on the paper and only visible to the voter.\n\n\n\nNow, does the voting protocol work in principle?&nbsp; The experts on cryptographic voting protocols say, “The Swiss Post e-voting system protocol documentation, code and security proofs show continuing improvement. The clarity of the protocol and documentation is much improved on earlier versions [which] has exposed many issues that were already present but not visible in the earlier versions of the system; this is progress. … There are, at present, significant gaps in the protocol specification, verification specification, and proofs. … [S]everal of the issues that we found require structural changes …. ”\n\n\n\nAnd, is the system architecture secure?&nbsp; The expert on system security says, “the SwissPost E-voting system [has] been evolving … for well over a decade. … The current generation of the system under audit takes many important and valuable measures for security and transparency that are to this author’s knowledge unprecedented or nearly-unprecedented among governmental E-voting programs worldwide. At a technical level, these measures include individual and universal verifiability mechanisms, trust-splitting of critical functions across four control components, the incorporation of an independent auditor role in the E-voting process, and the adoption of a reproducible build process for the E-voting software.&nbsp; [I see] ample evidence overall of both a system and a development process represent[ing] an exemplar that other governments worldwide should examine closely, learn from, and adopt similar state-of-the-art practices where appropriate.”\n\n\n\nBut on the other hand, he says, “the current system under audit is still far from the ideal system that … perhaps any expert well-versed in this technology domain – would in principle like to see. Some issues [include] the current system’s reliance on a trusted and fully-centralized printing authority, and its exclusion of coercion or vote-buying as a risk to be taken seriously and potentially mitigated.&nbsp; [And] Explicit documentation of the architecture’s security principles and assumptions, and how the concrete system embodies them, is still incomplete or unclear in many respects … The architecture’s trust-splitting across four control components strengthens vote privacy, but does not currently strengthen either end-to-end election integrity or availability … The architecture critically relies on an independent auditor for universal verifiability, but the measures taken to ensure the auditor’s independence appear incomplete … While the system’s abstract cryptographic protocol is well-specified and rigorously formalized, the security of the lower-level message-based interactions between the critical devices – especially the interactions involving offline devices – do not yet appear to be fully specified or analyzed.”\n\n\n\nIn conclusion,&nbsp; the cryptographic-protocol experts recommend, “We encourage the stakeholders in Swiss e-voting to allow adequate time for the system to thoroughly reviewed before restarting the use of e-voting,”&nbsp; while the system-security expert concludes, “as imperfect as the current system might be when judged against a nonexistent ideal, the current system generally appears to achieve its stated goals, under the corresponding assumptions and the specific threat model around which it was designed.”\n\n\n\nIn the next part of this series:  Threats that the experts didn’t think of.",

        "description": "Website blocking and cour-ordered domain suspensions are common anti-piracy measures in several parts of the world. \nIndia has been at the forefront of this movement, with rightsholders requesting blockades of thousands of websites over the years. \nLast week, the New Delhi High Court issued another other, targeting 18 pirate sites including torrentcue.co, uwatchfree.be, extramovies.pics and movierulzhd.lol. While many of these are relatively small players in the global piracy ecosystem, the injunction stands out for other reasons. \nPreemptive Blocking Order\nThe original complaint was filed by Star India. It aims to protect the release of the film &#8220;Brahmastra Part One: Shiva,&#8221; which will premiere later this week. Star believes that the pirate sites will make available unauthorized copies of the movie, so it asked the court to take action in advance. \nIn other words, the Indian media company requested a preemptive blocking order to prevent piracy that may take place sometime in the future. \nAfter reviewing all the evidence and weighing in previous decisions of the courts, the High Court granted the request. According to Judge Jyoti Singh, piracy should be met with a heavy hand.\n&#8220;There is no gain saying that piracy has to be curbed and needs to be dealt with a heavy hand and injunction against screening of copyrighted content by rogue websites ought to be granted,&#8221; Judge Singh writes. &#8220;This position is acknowledged and re-affirmed in several decisions..&#8221;\nPreventing Irreperable Harm\nThere is jurisprudence in India for these types of preemptive blockades and the Court believes that these are warranted here as well. Without any blocking measures, the film&#8217;s profits could be severely harmed. \nThe injunction prohibits the operators of the site from making pirated copies of the film available, either before or after its release. However, since these unknown site owners are unlikely to comply, ISPs and domain registrars must take action as well. \n\nThese types of domain blocking orders are not new in India, where the Government&#8217;s Department of Telecommunications helps to make sure that the ISPs are notified about new blockades. \nOrder Includes US-Based Registrars\nThe listed domain name registrars are a different story, however, as many are not Indian. They include many US-based companies such as GoDaddy, Namecheap, Tucows, Dynadot, and Namesilo. \nDespite being operated in a foreign jurisdiction, Judge Singh&#8217;s order compels the companies to take action. In addition to suspending the domain names, they must share the personal details of the domain name owners with Star India. \n&#8220;Defendants No. 22 to 28 shall provide complete details such as name, address, email address, IP address and phone numbers of Defendants No. 1 to 18,&#8221; the order reads. \n\nWhether the American domain registrars will comply with the Indian order remains to be seen. At the time of writing the domain names we checked remain active, but some are already redirecting to new domains. \n&#8212;\nA copy of the New Delhi High Court injunction, issued by Judge Jyoti Singh, is available here (via Bar &#038; Bench). A list of all domain names and their respective registrars can be found below.\n1. 7starhd.agency (GoDaddy)\n2. vegamovies.wtf (NameCheap)\n3. extramovies.pics (NameCheap)\n4. 9xmovies.yoga (NameCheap)\n5. 1tamilmv.pics (NameCheap)\n6.

        "link": "http://esr.ibiblio.org/?p=8720",
        "description": "The way I learned to use the term “user story”, back in the late 1990s at the beginnings of what is now called &#8220;agile programming&#8221;, was to describe a kind of roleplaying exercise in which you imagine a person and the person’s use case as a way of getting an outside perspective on the design, the documentation, and especially the UI of something you&#8217;re writing.\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\n\nMeet Joe. He works for Randomcorp, who has a nasty huge old Subversion repository they want him to convert to Git. Joe is a recent grad who got thrown at the problem because he’s new on the job and his manager figures this is a good performance test in a place where the damage will be easily contained if he screws up. Joe himself doesn’t know this, but his teammates have figured it out.\n\n\n\nJoe is smart and ambitious but has little experience with large projects yet. He knows there’s an open-source culture out there, but isn’t part of it – he’s thought about running Linux at home because the more senior geeks around him all seem to do that, but hasn’t found a good specific reason to jump yet. In truth most of what he does with his home machine is play games. He likes “Elite: Dangerous” and the Bioshock series.\n\n\n\nJoe knows Git pretty well, mainly through the Tortoise GUI under Windows; he learned it in school. He has only used Subversion just enough to know basic commands. He found reposurgeon by doing web searches. Joe is fairly sure reposurgeon can do the job he needs and has told his boss this, but he has no idea where to start.\n\n\n\nWhat does Joe’s discovery process looks like? Read the first two chapters of “Repository Editing with Reposurgeon” using Joe’s eyes. Is he going to hit this wall of text and bounce? If so, what could be done to make it more accessible? Is there some way to write a FAQ that would help him? If so, can we start listing the questions in the FAQ?\n\n\n\nJoe has used gdb a little as part of a class assignment but has not otherwise seen programs with a CLI resembling reposurgeon’s. When he runs it, what is he likely to try to do first to get oriented? Is that going to help him feel like he knows what’s going on, or confuse him?\n\n\n\n“Repository Editing&#8230;” says he ought to use repotool to set up a Makefile and stub scripts for the standard conversion workflow. What will Joe’s eyes tell him when he looks at the generated Makefile? What parts are likeliest to confuse him? What could be done to fix that?\n\n\n\nJoe, my fictional character, is about as little like me as as is plausible at a programming shop in 2020, and that’s the point. If I ask abstractly “What can I do to improve reposurgeon’s UI?”, it is likely I will just end up spinning my wheels; if, instead, I ask “What does Joe see when he looks at this?” I am more likely to get a useful answer.\n\n\n\nIt works even better if, even having learned what you can from your imaginary Joe, you make up other characters that are different from you and as different from each other as possible.  For example, meet Jane the system administrator, who got stuck with the conversion job because her boss thinks of version-control systems as an administrative detail and doesn&#8217;t want to spend programmer time on it.  What do her eyes see?\n\n\n\nIn fact, the technique is so powerful that I got an idea while writing this example. Maybe in reposurgeon’s interactive mode it should issue a first like that says “Interactive help is available; type ‘help’ for a topic menu.”\n\n\n\nHowever. If you search the web for &#8220;design by user story&#8221;, what you are likely to find doesn&#8217;t resemble my previous description at all.  Mostly, now twenty years after the beginnings of &#8220;agile programming&#8221;, you&#8217;ll see formulaic stuff equating &#8220;user story&#8221; with a one-sentence soundbite of the form &#8220;As an X, I want to do Y&#8221;.  This will be surrounded by a lot of talk about processes and scrum masters and scribbling things on index cards.\n\n\n\nThere is so much gone wrong with this it is hard to even know where to begin.   Let&#8217;s start with the fact that one of the original agile slogans was &#8220;Individuals and Interactions Over Processes and Tools&#8221;.  That slogan could be read in a number of different ways, but under none of them at all does it make sense to abandon a method for extended insight into the reactions of your likely users for a one-sentence parody of the method that is surrounded and hemmed in by bureaucratic process-gabble.\n\n\n\nThis is embedded in a larger story about how &#8220;agile&#8221; went wrong.  The composers of the Agile Manifesto intended it to be a liberating force, a more humane and effective way to organize software development work that would connect developers to their users to the benefit of both.  A few of the ideas that came out of it were positive and important &#8211; besides design by user story, test-centric development and refactoring leap to mind,\n\n\n\nSad to say, though, the way &#8220;user stories&#8221; became trivialized in most versions of agile is all too representative of what it has often become under the influence of two corrupting forces. One is fad-chasers looking to make a buck on it, selling it like snake oil to managers forever perplexed by low productivity, high defect rates, and inability to make deadlines. Another is the managers&#8217; own willingness to sacrifice productivity gains for the illusion of process control.\n\n\n\nIt may be too late to save &#8220;agile&#8221; in general from becoming a deadening parody of what it was originally intended to be, but it&#8217;s not too late to save design by user story. To do this, we need to bear down on some points that its inventors and popularizers were never publicly clear about, possibly because they themselves didn&#8217;t entirely understand what they had found.\n\n\n\nPoint one is how and why it works. Design by user story is a trick you play on your social-monkey brain that uses its fondness for narrative and characters to get you to step out of your own shoes.\n\n\n\nYes, sure, there&#8217;s a philosophical argument that stepping out of your shoes in this sense is impossible; Joe, being your fiction, is limited by what you can imagine. Nevertheless, this brain hack  actually works. Eppure, si muove; you can generate insights with it  that you wouldn&#8217;t have had otherwise.\n\n\n\nPoint two is that design by user story works regardless of the rest of your methodology. You don&#8217;t have to buy any of the assumptions or jargon or processes that usually fly in formation with it to get use out of it.\n\n\n\nPoint three is that design by user story is not a technique for generating code, it&#8217; s a technique for changing your mind.  If you approach it in an overly narrow and instrumental way, you won&#8217;t imagine apparently irrelevant details like what kinds of video games Joe likes. But you should do that sort of thing; the brain hack works in exact proportion to how much imaginative life you give your characters. \n\n\n\n(Which in particular, is why stopping at a one-sentence &#8220;As an X, I want to do Y&#8221; is such a sadly reductive parody. This formula is designed to stereotype the process, but stereotyping is the enemy of novelty, and novelty is exactly what you want to generate.)\n\n\n\nA few of my readers might have the right kind of experience for this to sound familiar. The mental process is similar to what in theater and cinema is called &#8220;method acting.&#8221;  The goal is also similar &#8211; to generate situational responses that are outside your normal habits.\n\n\n\nOnce again: you have to get past tools and practices to discover that the important part of software design &#8211; the most difficult and worthwhile part &#8211; is mindset.  In this case, and temporarily, someone else&#8217;s.",

There&#8217;s still conflicting reports about the fate of the ship. Ukraine says it was struck and sank. Russia says it was badly damaged, evacuated and is now under tow. Russia also seems to dispute that there was a successful missile attack, seemingly claiming a munitions explosion on board. Regardless of exactly what happened it seems Ukraine scored a rather stunning success either destroying or taking out of commission a major Russian warship.",

        "description": "Twelve years ago, I posted The Data Bubble. It began,\nThe tide turned today. Mark it: 31 July 2010.\nThat’s when The Wall Street Journal published The Web’s Gold Mine: Your Secrets, subtitled A Journal investigation finds that one of the fastest-growing businesses on the Internet is the business of spying on consumers. First in a series. It has ten links to other sections of today’s report. It’s pretty freaking amazing — and amazingly freaky when you dig down to the business assumptions behind it. Here is the rest of the list (sans one that goes to a link-proof Flash thing):\n\nPersonal Details Exposed Via Biggest U.S. Websites The largest U.S. websites are installing new and intrusive consumer-tracking technologies on the computers of people visiting their sites—in some cases, more than 100 tracking tools at a time.\nSee the Database at WSJ.com\nFollow @whattheyknow on Twitter\nWhat They Know About You\nYour Questions on Digital Privacy\nAnalyzing What You Have Typed\nVideo: A Guide to Cookies\nWhat They Know: A Glossary\nThe Journal’s Methodology\n\nHere’s the gist:\nThe Journal conducted a comprehensive study that assesses and analyzes the broad array of cookies and other surveillance technology that companies are deploying on Internet users. It reveals that the tracking of consumers has grown both far more pervasive and far more intrusive than is realized by all but a handful of people in the vanguard of the industry.\nIt gets worse:\nIn between the Internet user and the advertiser, the Journal identified more than 100 middlemen—tracking companies, data brokers and advertising networks—competing to meet the growing demand for data on individual behavior and interests.The data on Ms. Hayes-Beaty’s film-watching habits, for instance, is being offered to advertisers on BlueKai Inc., one of the new data exchanges. “It is a sea change in the way the industry works,” says Omar Tawakol, CEO of BlueKai. “Advertisers want to buy access to people, not Web pages.” The Journal examined the 50 most popular U.S. websites, which account for about 40% of the Web pages viewed by Americans. (The Journal also tested its own site, WSJ.com.) It then analyzed the tracking files and programs these sites downloaded onto a test computer. As a group, the top 50 sites placed 3,180 tracking files in total on the Journal’s test computer. Nearly a third of these were innocuous, deployed to remember the password to a favorite site or tally most-popular articles. But over two-thirds—2,224—were installed by 131 companies, many of which are in the business of tracking Web users to create rich databases of consumer profiles that can be sold.\nHere’s what’s delusional about all this: There is no demand for tracking by individual customers. All the demand comes from advertisers — or from companies selling to advertisers. For now.\nHere is the difference between an advertiser and an ordinary company just trying to sell stuff to customers: nothing. If a better way to sell stuff comes along — especially if customers like it better than this crap the Journal is reporting on — advertising is in trouble.\nIn fact, I had been calling the tracking-based advertising business (now branded adtech or ad-tech) a bubble for some time. For example, in Why online advertising sucks, and is a bubble (31 October 2008) and After the advertising bubble bursts (23 March 2009). But I didn&#8217;t expect my own small voice to have much effect. But this was different. What They Know was written by a crack team of writers, researchers, and data visualizers. It was led by Julia Angwin and truly Pulitzer-grade stuff. It  was so well done, so deep, and so sharp, that I posted a follow-up report three months later, called The Data Bubble II. In that one, I wrote,\nThat same series is now nine stories long, not counting the introduction and a long list of related pieces. Here’s the current list:\n\nThe Web’s Gold Mine: What They Know About You\nMicrosoft Quashed Bid to Boost Web Privacy\nOn the Web’s Cutting Edge: Anonymity in Name Only\nStalking by Cell Phone\nGoogle Agonizes Over Privacy\nKids Face Intensive Tracking on Web\n‘Scrapers’ Dig Deep for Data on the Web\nFacebook in Privacy Breach\nA Web Pioneer Profiles Users By Name\n\nRelated pieces—\n\nPersonal Details Exposed Via Biggest U.S. Websites The largest U.S. websites are installing new and intrusive consumer-tracking technologies on the computers of people visiting their sites—in some cases, more than 100 tracking tools at a time.\nSee the Database at WSJ.com\nWhat They Know: A Glossary\nThe Journal’s Methodology\nThe Tracking Ecosystem\nYour Questions on Digital Privacy\nAnalyzing What You Have Typed\nVideo: A Guide to Cookies\nApp Developers Weigh Business Models\nHow the Leaks Happen\nSome Apps Return After Breach\nFacebook Faces Lawsuit\nSocial Networks Weigh Privacy vs. Profits\nFour Aspects of Online Data Privacy\nHow to Protect Your Child’s Privacy\nHow to Avoid Prying Eyes\nGraphic: Google’s Widening Reach\nDigits Live Show: How RapLeaf Mines Data Online\nDigits: Escaping the Scrapers\nPrivacy Advocate Withdraws From RapLeaf Advisory Board\nCandidate Apologizes for Using RapLeaf to Target Ads\nPreview: Facebook Leads Ad Recovery\nHow to Get Out of RapLeaf’s System\nThe Dangers of Web Tracking (buy Nicholas Carr)\nWhy Tracking Isn’t Bad (by Jim Harper)\nFollow @whattheyknow on Twitter\n\nTwo things I especially like about all this. First, Julia Angwin and her team are doing a terrific job of old-fashioned investigative journalism here. Kudos for that. Second, the whole series stands on the side of readers. The second person voice (you, your) is directed to individual persons—the same persons who do not sit at the tables of decision-makers in this crazy new hyper-personalized advertising business.\nTo measure the delta of change in that business, start with John Battelle‘s Conversational Marketing series (post 1, post 2, post 3) from early 2007, and then his post Identity and the Independent Web, from last week. In the former he writes about how the need for companies to converse directly with customers and prospects is both inevitable and transformative. He even kindly links to The Cluetrain Manifesto (behind the phrase “brands are conversations”).\nIt was obvious to me that this fine work would blow the adtech bubble to a fine mist. It was just a matter of when.\nOver the years since, I&#8217;ve retained hope, if not faith. Examples: The Data Bubble Redux (9 April 2016), and Is the advertising bubble finally starting to pop? (9 May 2016, and in Medium).\nAlas, the answer to that last one was no. By 2016, Julia and her team had long since disbanded, and the original links to the What They Know series began to fail. I don&#8217;t have exact dates for which failed when, but I do know that the trusty master link, wjs.com/wtk, began to 404 at some point. Fortunately, Julia has kept much of it alive at https://juliaangwin.com/category/portfolio/wall-street-journal/what-they-know/. Still, by the late Teens it was clear that even the best journalism wasn&#8217;t going to be enough—especially since the major publications had become adtech junkies. Worse, covering their own publications&#8217; involvement in surveillance capitalism had become an untouchable topic for journalists. (One notable exception is Farhad Manjoo of The New York Times, whose coverage of the paper&#8217;s own tracking was followed by a cutback in the practice.)\nWhile I believe that most new laws for tech mostly protect yesterday from last Thursday, I share with many a hope for regulatory relief. I was especially jazzed about Europe&#8217;s GDPR, as you can read in GDPR will pop the adtech bubble (12 May 2018) and Our time has come (16 May 2018 in ProjectVRM).\nBut I was wrong then too. Because adtech isn&#8217;t a bubble. It&#8217;s a death star in service of an evil empire that destroys privacy through every function it funds in the digital world.\nThat&#8217;s why I expect the American Data Privacy and Protection Act (H.R. 8152), even if it passes through both houses of Congress at full strength, to do jack shit. Or worse, to make our experience of life in the digital world even more complicated, by requiring us to opt-out, rather than opt-in (yep, it&#8217;s in the law—as a right, no less), to tracking-based advertising everywhere. And we know how well that&#8217;s been going. (Read this whole post by Tom Fishburne, the Marketoonist, for a picture of how less than zero progress has been made, and how venial and absurd &#8220;consent&#8221; gauntlets on websites have become.) Do a search for https://www.google.com/search?q=gdpr+compliance to see how large the GDPR &#8220;compliance&#8221; business has become. Nearly all your 200+ million results will be for services selling obedience to the letter of the GDPR while death-star laser beams blow its spirit into spinning shards. Then expect that business to grow once the ADPPA is in place.\nThere is only thing that will save us from adtech&#8217;s death star.\nThat&#8217;s tech of our own. Our tech. Personal tech.\nWe did it in the physical world with the personal privacy tech we call clothing, shelter, locks, doors, shades, and shutters. We&#8217;ve barely started to make the equivalents for the digital world. But the digital world is only a few decades old. It will be around for dozens, hundreds, or thousands of decades to come. And adtech is still just a teenager. We can, must, and will do better.\nAll we need is the tech. Big Tech won&#8217;t do it for us. Nor will Big Gov.\nThe economics will actually help, because there are many business problems in the digital world that can only be solved from the customers&#8217; side, with better signaling from demand to supply than adtech-based guesswork can ever provide. Customer Commons lists fourteen of those solutions, here. Privacy is just one of them.\nUse the Force, folks.\nThat Force is us.",

        "description": "For more than 15 years, most piracy headlines in Sweden had some connection to The Pirate Bay. \nPerhaps anti-piracy groups grew tired of chasing and then the media moved on, but today it&#8217;s barely mentioned, despite providing the same functionality as it ever has. Web-based streaming sites have been relegated too, largely thanks to a newer scourge &#8211; pirate IPTV services.\nResponsibility for tackling pirate IPTV in Sweden falls to anti-piracy group Rights Alliance. Their recent successes include a four-month suspended sentence and $164K in damages against a subscription reseller, and 140 hours of community service and $231,000 in damages against another reseller.\nA new prosecution in Sweden looks set to continue the trend.\nCouple Faced Trial For IPTV-Related Offenses\nRights Alliance says that a trial recently took place at the specialist Patent and Market Court in Stockholm. A man and woman, a couple from Eskilstuna in eastern Sweden, faced accusations of running an illegal IPTV business and laundering the proceeds.\nAccording to Rights Alliance, the man is suspected of &#8220;running two different IPTV services&#8221; which together generated around SEK 2.3 million (around US$213.2k) in revenues over an unspecified period.\nThe woman claimed to have no idea that her partner was in the piracy business &#8211; according to her, he was a set-top box repairman. Misunderstandings aside, Rights Alliance says that SEK 1.3 million (around US$120.5k) was funneled to the woman from IPTV-related sales. As a result, she now faces money laundering charges.\nLong Running Investigation\nRights Alliance says that after discovering &#8220;two IPTV services&#8221; and reporting them to the police, subsequent investigations linked them to the same illegal activities. According to a report from Ekuriren (paywall), the investigation began in 2020 and was handled by Sweden&#8217;s National Operations Department (NOA).\nNOA identified an Eskilstuna man in his 40s as the suspect and inevitably paid him a surprise home visit. A police photograph shows a cardboard box containing several smaller boxes, that in turn may have contained Linux-based set-top boxes. A couple of remotes (soiled), and other sundry items complete the haul. \nThe same slide also reveals the name of an IPTV service &#8211; Nordens Bästa IPTV (The Nordics&#8217; Best IPTV).\n\nPolice found customer lists connecting the man to sales of IPTV subscriptions, most likely providing access to thousands of live TV channels and movies. The man also sent close to 1,400 packages through the mail, other documents reveal.\nResellers and IPTV Service Operators\nFor potential buyers lacking specific knowledge, it can be challenging to know the nature of the person selling them an IPTV subscription. Users can buy subscriptions directly from those operating IPTV services but in most cases, they will be dealing with a reseller operating their own branded website. \nResellers&#8217; connections to those actually operating IPTV services (servers and other infrastructure) are mostly limited to buying &#8216;credits&#8217; from a self-serve web service at one price, and then reselling them to customers under their own branding, hopefully at a higher price.\nThese differences don&#8217;t matter much to the customer, but they are important when reporting cases. They&#8217;re important to suspects in those cases too, and crucial to the wider fight against piracy.\nDifferences in Terminology\nIn the Swedish case targeting the man and his partner, Rights Alliance says he is charged with &#8220;running two different IPTV services&#8221;. According to the Ekuriren report, the investigation shows that he mainly sold set-top boxes. It&#8217;s acknowledged that the man ran two websites and received payments, but a cardboard box of set-top boxes isn&#8217;t an IPTV service.\nLanguage barriers and terminology preferences may be at play, but the difference between prosecuting someone behind an IPTV service and prosecuting a reseller of someone else&#8217;s service is significant. If prosecuting the operator of a service means that the service gets shut down, all resellers of that service have nothing further to sell. It tackles the problem at the source and causes much more disruption.\nProsecuting a single reseller not only means the underlying service continues, but all other resellers still have access to subscriptions that can be sold to the public. That doesn&#8217;t mean that prosecuting resellers is pointless but it does put a lot of faith in deterrent messages. These already face fierce competition from the small chance of being caught to the considerable profits available.\nOf course, IPTV sellers of all kinds prefer to hang on to those profits and that&#8217;s not going to happen in this case. \nIn addition to the seizure of around SEK 1.3 million (around US$92.7k), police also seized a Tesla. There&#8217;s also the potential for damages and prison sentences, with the length of the latter likely to be affected by the man&#8217;s status as a ringleader (the operator of a service) or just a cog in the machine (reseller).\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "(Part 3 of a 5-part series starting here)\n\n\n\nIn Part 1, I described how Switzerland decided to assess the security and accuracy of its e-voting system.&nbsp; Swiss Post is the “vendor” developing the system, the Swiss cantons are the “customer” deploying it in their elections, and the Swiss Parliament and Federal Chancellery are the “regulators,”&nbsp; deciding whether it’s secure enough for the cantons to use.\n\n\n\nInternet voting has inherent vulnerabilities that need to be addressed by any e-voting solution:\n\n\n\nThe server: &nbsp;bugs in the server that receives e-ballots and counts them; vulnerabilities in the server that allow hackers to penetrate and alter the vote-counting software; the possibility that insiders can use their access to subvert the vote counts.The client: &nbsp;bugs in the voter’s voting-app or browser app; vulnerabilities in the voter’s browser or operating system or hypervisor or BIOS that allow hackers to subvert the app so that it changes the ballot, after the voter sees it but before it is encrypted and transmitted.The communications network: possibility that attackers can change votes in transit, or cause ballots to be lost, or to commit denial-of-service attacks.Authentication of voters: &nbsp;association of a physical human being with a set of digital credentials.\n\n\n\nOf these, the communications network is probably the easiest to address with known technology (end-to-end encryption/authentication).&nbsp; Authentication of voters can be very difficult or less difficult depending on societal infrastructure.&nbsp; (Since Switzerland has no universal digital ID card, they address this issue by mailing a sheet of paper to each voter before each election, with an authorization key.)&nbsp; The server and insider threats can (perhaps) be addressed by splitting the server’s responsibilities among independent machines managed by independent trusted people, and using cryptographic protocols that prove consensus – and this is definitely an important part of the Swiss Post solution.\n\n\n\nBut it’s that other part, insecurities in the client, that the Swiss Post system tries to address in a more solid and responsible way than almost any other e-voting system deployed in other countries in public elections.&nbsp; A few other countries (and U.S. states, and Australian states) have deployed e-voting – typically in a limited way, only for citizens living abroad – and every one of them that I know of can be hacked on the client side.&nbsp; If the hacker installs a modified browser on your laptop computer, or hacks the operating system of your phone, then the voting app can be made to display to you the candidate choices that you indicated, but then encrypt, authenticate, and transmit a different set of votes. &nbsp; And if the e-voting system has some feature that lets you “check” whether your votes were recorded correctly at the server, then the hack can subvert that feature too, to reassure you.\n\n\n\nAnd the Swiss method of securing the client is: &nbsp;Send a sheet of paper through the mail. &nbsp; Before each election, the election administrator sends to each e-voter a personalized paper.&nbsp; At the top is a numeric key, randomly chosen for that voter alone.&nbsp; At the beginning of the voting session, the voter types the key into the voting app.\n\n\n\n(at the top of the paper sheet is this box)\n\n\n\nThe voter then selects candidates in the app, and the app uses the voter’s key to encrypt/authenticate the vote selections, and transmit them to a server.\n\n\n\nIf we stopped here, it would be insecure:&nbsp; the app could cheat, and encrypt a ballot with candidates that the voter didn’t choose.\n\n\n\nThe next step is that the servers return “result codes.”&nbsp; These are calculated based on the private key, known to the server but not to the voter or the client-side app, associated with the start-voting-key that the voter typed in.&nbsp; The voting app displays these result codes.\n\n\n\nThen the voter looks up the result codes on the sheet of paper, and checks that they correspond to the candidates that were chosen.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the system is working correctly, then the voting app (even if hacked) can’t know what the result codes are supposed to be.&nbsp; The (hacked) app can’t display the right result codes unless it gets them from the server, and it can’t get them from the server unless it has encrypted the right candidates in the first place.&nbsp; And it can’t see what result codes are written on the paper, unless the voter’s computer has some sort of camera attached to it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.&nbsp; Do computers have cameras? Really?&nbsp; And why would the camera ever be aimed at the paper sheet during the process of entering the start-voting-key?\n\n\n\nIf the Swiss Post e-voting system might possibly be secure, it’s only because of the out-of-band communication channel that is completely out of reach of the voter’s computer.&nbsp; That is: a sheet of paper sent through the mail, to the voter.\n\n\n\nSo the Swiss Post e-voting system isn’t exactly paperless.&nbsp; It is not a “pure” internet voting system.&nbsp; Scientists do not know how to make an adequately secure internet voting system without paper.&nbsp; (And by the way, the thoughtless use of paper doesn’t help:&nbsp; for example, when you upload or e-mail a PDF file to an election administrator who then prints it out onto paper before feeding it through the optical-scan voting machine.&nbsp; That’s not a “paper trail”, because the voter can’t see it, and it doesn’t make the system secure.)\n\n\n\nIn the next part of this series, I’ll analyze what problems remain in the Swiss Post system: some problems raised in the reports commissioned by the Chancellery, and some things that they haven’t thought of.\n\n\n\nNext part: What the Assessments Say About the Swiss E-voting System",

        "description": "(8/13) “I remember the night Obama got elected. Very few times in the history of my stay in prison, would something so earth-shattering happen, that it would lift the spirits of the whole compound. But it was one those nights. 11 o’clock is normally a dead time in prison. But everyone was gathered around the TV in the common area. And when he walked out on that stage in Chicago, and gave that speech, with Michelle and the kids at his side, every last inmate was silent. No dominos were being slammed. There was no hyperness, no activity. It was completely still. It was hope. That’s what his entire campaign had been about: ‘Hope, hope, hope.’ And we felt it. We felt, finally: a guy who understands what’s going on in here. The overcriminalization. The overincarceration. The racial disparities. Were we hoping he’d repeal the mandatory minimum? I’d be lying if I didn’t say that. But the clemency program was something. It was more than anyone else had done. Me and Dino finished that application in record time. I included all my petitions for appeal. I included letters from friends and family who knew me, before the meth. Then I included one final letter, to Obama. I appealed to the man himself, and my belief that he was a decent human being. I explained my diagnosis. I told my entire story, then I sent it off. I knew there wasn’t much of a chance. I was competing against every guy, in every facility, across the country. Every crack offender got sentenced to 100x the weight of cocaine. There were probably one hundred thousand more people deserving than me. And each petition was 100 pages long. They didn’t have time to study each one closely, I knew that. They’d be trying to find one reason to disqualify you. One single reason. A few months later I got a call from a lawyer at the clemency initiative. She said my file was about to be reviewed, but first they’d need an opinion from my sentencing judge: the scumbag with the golf club. They reached out to him, and a few days later they got his response. She read it to me over the phone: ‘Good conduct in prison is no reason for a sentence reduction. I recommend a firm denial.”",

        "description": "This is an answer I posted to Stack Overflow: Linguistics that was so much fun to write that I feel like sharing it with my blog audience. The question is: What is the past tense of &#8216;yeet&#8217;?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a field sighting of the form &#8220;yoten&#8221; to report.\n\n\n\nIn January I was involved with the organizing for the big pro-Second-Amendment demonstration in Richmond, VA. One of the central concerns of the organizers, in view of the extreme hostility of the media against firearms rights, was to keep the demonstration strictly nonviolent.\n\n\n\nAmong the many memes and images posted on social media to express concurrence with this goal was a sort of cartoon of plucky musket-bearing rebels in Revolutionary War costume. The caption read:\n\n\n\n&#8220;Yeet not unless ye be yoten upon!\n\n\n\nYou can&#8217;t tell gun-culture folks to be passively nonviolent; they&#8217;ll just laugh at you. You can preach an ethic of alert nonaggression, and that&#8217;s what this memester did. That fits their values, and works.\n\n\n\nSo we see &#8220;yeet&#8221; being used for the act of firing a weapon (no surprise; I already knew videogamers used it that way before this). We also have &#8220;yoten&#8221; as past tense in perfective aspect.\n\n\n\nSubsequently someone else else posted a chart of the full conjugation of &#8220;yeet&#8221;. It did include &#8220;yote&#8221; as the simple past, and in general was a meticulous and knowing parody of the Germanic strong verb.\n\n\n\nWatching culture being invented is a marvellous thing!\n\n\n\nI concur with previous answers that the strong-verb system is not as yet entirely nonproductive in English. We should not expect new production of ablaut to obey historical rules for OE verb classes, but rather to template itself on surviving strong verbs.\n\n\n\nI offer in this connection the following models: &#8220;speak/spoke/spoken&#8221;, &#8220;freeze/froze/frozen&#8221;, and &#8220;break/broke/broken&#8221;.\n\n\n\nI further note that I have previously observed a tendency for such irregular inflections to flourish where humor is intended, and if the message of &#8220;Yeet not unless ye be yoten upon!&#8221; was serious the form of it was intentionally funny.\n\n\n\nIn another subculture that I am involved with, the name of a now obsolete minicomputer called a &#8220;VAX&#8221; was pluralized to &#8220;vaxen&#8221;, not &#8220;vaxes&#8221;, allegedly because the machine was as slow as an ox. This joke became productive: today, people in that culture may pluralize &#8220;box&#8221; (used in the sense of a computer, e.g a Unix box) as &#8220;boxen&#8221;.\n\n\n\nThe meme was successful. Enough armed gunfolks showed up to overmatch an infantry division, and the day was entirely peaceful.",

        "title": "On windowseat photography",
        "link": "https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2022/07/30/windowseat/",
        "description": "A visitor to aerial photos on my Flickr site asked me where one should sit on a passenger plane to shoot pictures like mine. This post expands on what I wrote back to him.\nHere&#8217;s the main thing: you want a window seat on the side of the plane shaded from the Sun, and away from the wing. Sun on plane windows highlights all the flaws, scratches, and dirt that are typical features of airplane windows. It&#8217;s also best to have a clear view of the ground. In front of the wing is also better than behind, because jet engine exhaust at low altitudes distorts the air, causing blur in a photo. (At high altitudes this problem tends to go away.) So, if you are traveling north in the morning, you want a seat on the left side of the plane (where the seat is usually called A). And the reverse if you&#8217;re flying south.\nHere in North America, when flying west I like to be on the right side, and when flying east I like to be on the left, because the whole continent is far enough north of the Equator for the Sun, at least in the middle hours of the day, to be in the south. (There are exceptions, however, such as early and late in the day in times of year close to the Summer Solstice, when the Sun rises and sets far north of straight east and west.) This photo, of massive snows atop mountains in Canada&#8217;s arctic Baffin Island, was shot on a flight from London to Denver, with the sun on the left side of the plane. I was on the right:\n\nAs for choosing seats, the variety of variables is extreme. That&#8217;s because almost every airline flies different kinds of planes, and even those that fly only one kind of plane may fly many different seat layouts. For example, there are thirteen different variants of the 737 model, across four generations. And, even within one model of plane, there may be three or four different seat layouts, even within one airline. For example, United flies fifteen different widebody jets: four 767s, six 777s, and four 787s, each with a different seat layout. It also flies nineteen narrowbody jets, five regional jets, and seven turboprops, all with different seat layouts as well.\nSo I always go to SeatGuru.com for a better look at the seat layout for a plane than what United (or any airline) will tell me on their seat selection page when I book a flight online. On the website, you enter the flight number and the date, and SeatGuru will give you the seat layout, with a rating or review for every seat.\nThis is critical because some planes&#8217; window seats are missing a window, or have a window that is &#8220;misaligned,&#8221; meaning it faces the side of a seat back, a bulkhead, or some other obstruction. See here:\n\nSome planes have other challenges, such as the electrically dimmable windows on Boeing 787 &#8220;Dreamliners.&#8221; I wrote about the challenges of those here.\nNow, if you find yourself with a seat that&#8217;s over the wing and facing the Sun, good photography is still possible, as you see in this shot of this sunset at altitude:\n\nOne big advantage of life in our Digital Age is that none of the airlines, far as I know, will hassle you for shooting photos out windows with your phone. That&#8217;s because, while in the old days some airlines forbid photography on planes, shooting photos with phones, constantly, is now normative in the extreme, everywhere. (It&#8217;s still bad form to shoot airline personnel in planes, though, and you will get hassled for that.)\nSo, if you&#8217;re photographically inclined, have fun.",

        "link": "https://kottke.org/22/05/letter-of-recommendation-get-a-vasectomy",
        "description": "Men in the US typically do not talk about or worry about birth control that much, to the detriment of the health and safety of women. In the spirit of trying to change that a little, I&#8217;m going to talk to you about my experience. About a decade ago, knowing that I did not want to have any more children, I had a vasectomy. And let me tell you, it&#8217;s been great. Quickly, here&#8217;s what a vasectomy is, via the Mayo Clinic:\n\nVasectomy is a form of male birth control that cuts the supply of sperm to your semen. It&#8217;s done by cutting and sealing the tubes that carry sperm. Vasectomy has a low risk of problems and can usually be performed in an outpatient setting under local anesthesia.\n\nWhether you&#8217;re in a committed relationship or a more casual one, knowing that you&#8217;re rolling up to sexual encounters with the birth control handled is a really good feeling for everyone concerned.1 Women have typically (and unfairly) had to be the responsible ones about birth control, in large part because it&#8217;s ultimately their body, health, and well-being that&#8217;s on the line if a sexual act results in pregnancy, but there are benefits of birth control that accrue to both parties (and to society) and taking over that important responsibility from your sexual partner is way more than equitable.\n\n(Here&#8217;s the part where I need to come clean: getting a vasectomy was not my idea. I had to be talked into it. It seemed scary and birth control was not something I thought about as much as I should have. I&#8217;m ashamed of this; I wish I&#8217;d been more proactive and taken more responsibility about it. Guys, we should be talking about and thinking about this shit just as much as women do! I hope you&#8217;ve figured this out earlier than I did. Ok, back to the matter at hand.)\n\nVasectomies are often covered by health insurance and are (somewhat) reversible. These issues can be legitimate dealbreakers for some people. Some folks cannot afford the cost of the procedure or can&#8217;t take the necessary time off of work to recover (heavy lifting is verboten for a few days afterwards). And if you get a vasectomy in your 20s for the purpose of 10-15 years of birth control before deciding to start a family, the lack of guarantee around reversal might be unappealing. Talk to your doctor, insurance company, and place of employment about these concerns!\n\nDoes the procedure hurt? This is a concern that many men have and the answer is yes: it hurts a little bit during and for a few days afterwards. For most people, you&#8217;re in and out in an hour or two, you ice your crotch, pop some Advil, take it easy for a few days, and you&#8217;re good to go.1 It&#8217;s a small price to pay and honestly if you don&#8217;t want to get a vasectomy because you&#8217;re worried about your balls aching for 48 hours, I&#8217;m going to suggest that you are a whiny little baby &#8212; and I&#8217;m telling you this as someone who is quite uncomfortable and sometimes faints during even routine medical procedures.\n\nSo, if you&#8217;re a sperm-producing person who has sex with people who can get pregnant and do not wish for pregnancy to occur, you should consider getting a vasectomy. It&#8217;s a minor procedure with few side effects that results in an almost iron-clad guarantee against unwanted pregnancy. At the very least, know that this is an option you have and that you can talk to your partner and doctor about it. Good luck!\n\nJust to be clear, you still have to worry about sexually transmitted infections &#8212; a vasectomy obviously does not provide any protection against that.&#x21A9;\n\nThere also is a follow-up about 6-12 weeks later to make sure the procedure worked. You masturbate into a cup and they check to see that there&#8217;s no sperm in the sample. Part of this follow-up, if my experience is any guide, includes checking that the doctor&#8217;s office bathroom door is locked about 50 times while watching very outdated porn on a small TV mounted up in the corner of the tiny room. It&#8217;s fine though! And you have a fun story to tell later.&#x21A9;\n\n Tags: medicine",

        "link": "https://freedom-to-tinker.com/2022/06/28/how-not-to-assess-an-e-voting-system/",
        "description": "by Vanessa Teague, an Australian computer scientist, cryptographer, and security/privacy expert.\n\n\n\n(Part 2 of a 5-part series starting here)\n\n\n\nAustralian elections are known for the secret ballot and a long history of being peaceful, transparent and well run. So it may surprise you to learn that the Australian state of New South Wales (NSW) is home to one of the world’s largest Internet voting projects, second only to Moscow’s by absolute number. In the 2021 New South Wales local government elections, 652,983 votes were received from the Internet, including more than one third of votes for the Sydney city council.\n\n\n\nThe system suffered substantial downtime throughout polling day and the day before. There is no way to tell how many voters were disenfranchised. Electoral Commission estimates give a total of about 20,000 people who registered to use iVote but did not receive a voting credential in time to vote. About half of these probably voted on paper; the rest were disenfranchised. In many councils, the number of disenfranchised people was enough to change the election outcome. As a consequence, the Supreme Court of New South Wales voided the results in three local councils, though the results are highly uncertain in many other councils too.&nbsp;\n\n\n\niVote has had serious reliability issues and security concerns since its inception. The protocol does not provide any genuine verification, either for the voter to check that their vote reflects their intentions, or for election observers to verify that the complete set of votes has been properly included and decrypted. In 2015, Alex Halderman and I showed that it was vulnerable to an Internet-based attacker who could take over the voting session and substitute a different vote. In 2017, a different set of colleagues found that a version of the vote could be decrypted directly by the server. In 2019, when Thomas Haines, Sarah Jamie Lewis, Olivier Pereira and I found serious cryptographic errors in the Swiss Internet voting system, the NSW Electoral Commission announced that iVote had the same problems.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnlike Switzerland, NSW attempted no serious reassessment of either the regulations or the system design. Even when their appointed auditing team raised concerns about hardcoded passwords, a possible opportunity to delete votes without detection, and inadequate procedures for ensuring that the executed code matched the audited code, the NSW Electoral Commission simply ran iVote again in 2021. No regulations were altered, and they continued to threaten jail time for sharing the source code, though the sharing of source code in Switzerland had led to the identification and correction of serious problems in NSW.\n\n\n\nWe don’t have demographic or political data, either about who tried to use iVote or who was most impacted by its downtime. We do know, from NSW Electoral Commission reports, that about half of the voters affected by iVote’s downtime went to a polling place and voted on paper. This is extremely unlikely to be a random half&#8212;most probably, it was the well-off, healthy voters without caring responsibilities, long working hours on a Saturday, or physical or mobility challenges. The people actually excluded from the franchise by iVote’s downtime were people who were not easily able to suddenly make alternative arrangements, who probably included the more disadvantaged people often used as a justification for running Internet voting. There would have been some who were not able to vote on paper under any circumstances (such as those with physical disabilities) and those who suddenly found themselves under covid isolation orders despite intending to vote in a polling place. These people had no other voting option in NSW (the voters with disabilities should have been offered a verifiable voting option, but they weren’t). However, some of those disenfranchised by iVote’s downtime were people who would have had ample opportunity to apply for a mail-in vote, if they had known in advance that iVote would fail. Unreliable voting systems are most damaging to the voting rights of the people dependent upon them.\n\n\n\nThe main long-term consequence of iVote’s downtime is that NSW elections will become much more secure and trustworthy because they will stop using iVote.\n\n\n\nInternet voting is not part of Australia’s proud history of innovative electoral progress. It is more accurately seen as part of a pattern of public-sector disregard for electronic security and privacy, which includes driver’s licenses, health data, and covid-tracing records. Serious, evidence-based security concerns were repeatedly ignored.\n\n\n\nBy the time the reruns &amp; possible lawsuits are settled, it will be much more expensive than running the election properly the first time.\n\n\n\nUndetectable fraud remains the primary concern. The worst thing about this election was not that ten thousand or more people were disenfranchised, but that 652,983 votes were included in the tally without the slightest evidence that they accurately reflected the voting intentions of eligible voters.\n\n\n\n(Next part: How the Swiss Post E-voting system addresses client-side vulnerabilities)",

It&#8217;s hard to tell good advice from the not-so-good, so it may pay to simply ignore it.The advice might be good for &#8220;someone,&#8221; but it&#8217;s easy to imagine that it doesn&#8217;t apply to us. After all, the advice giver hardly knows us, we&#8217;re a special case and this is a special situation. Not to mention that good advice is often conservative and intended to maintain the status quo, which isn&#8217;t apparently helpful for someone who wants to make a ruckus.The person who needs advice might not actually want advice. They might simply want reassurance. Reassurance that their instincts are right, that they and they alone are the ones that can make a difference. Of course, reassurance is futile (because it needs constant replenishment) but that doesn&#8217;t keep this from being the biggest of the three categories.\r\nWe don&#8217;t have an advice shortage.

This comes just after a call today between Presidents Biden and Zelensky. This is part of a more general move toward providing Ukraine not just defensive weaponry — light/mobile anti-tank and anti-aircraft weaponry — but heavier weaponry required for offensive operations. It&#8217;s also best to see these moves in the context of actions taken by all NATO member states since they are all coordinated.",

        "title": "Remembering Craig Burton",
        "link": "https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2022/07/27/remembering-craig-burton/",
        "description": "I used to tell Craig Burton there was no proof that he could be killed, because he came so close, so many times. But now we have it. Cancer got him, a week ago today. He was sixty-seven.\nSo here&#8217;s a bit of back-story on how Craig and I became great friends.\nIn late 1987, my ad agency, Hodskins Simone &amp; Searls, pulled together a collection of client companies for the purpose of creating what we called a &#8220;connectivity consortium.&#8221; The idea was to evangelize universal networking—something the world did not yet have—and to do it together.\nThe time seemed right. Enterprises everywhere were filling up with personal computers, each doing far more than mainframe terminals ever did. This explosion of personal productivity created a massive demand for local area networks, aka LANs, on which workers could share files, print documents, and start to put their companies on a digital footing. IBM, Microsoft, and a raft of other companies were big in the LAN space, but one upstart company—Novell—was creaming all of them. It did that by embracing PCs, Macs, makers of hardware accessories such as Ethernet cards, plus many different kinds of network wiring and communications protocols.\nOur agency was still new in Silicon Valley, and our clients were relatively small. To give our consortium some heft, we needed a leader in the LAN space. So I did the audacious thing, and called on Novell at Comdex, which was then the biggest trade show in tech. My target was Judith Clarke, whose marketing smarts were already legendary. For example, while all the biggest companies competed to out-spend each other with giant booths on the show floor, Judith had Novell rent space on the ground floor of the Las Vegas Hilton, turning that space into a sales office for the company, a storefront on the thickest path for foot traffic at the show.\nSo I cold-called on Judith at that office. Though she was protected from all but potential Novell customers, I cajoled a meeting, and Judith said yes. Novell was in.\nThe first meeting of our connectivity consortium was in a classroom space at Novell&#8217;s Silicon Valley office. One by one, each of my agency&#8217;s client companies spoke about what they were bringing to our collective table, while a large unidentified dude sat in the back of the room, leaning forward, looking like a walrus watching fish. After listening patiently to what everyone said, the big dude walked up to the blackboard in front and chalked out diagrams and descriptions of how everything everyone was talking about could actually work together. He also added a piece nobody had brought up yet: TCP/IP, the base protocol for the Internet. That one wasn&#8217;t represented by a company, mostly because it wasn&#8217;t invented for commercial purposes. But, the big guy said, TCP/IP was the protocol that would, in the long run, make everything work together.\nI was of the same mind, so quickly the dude and I got into a deep conversation during which it was clear to me that I was being both well-schooled about networking, yet respected for what little new information I brought to the conversation. After a while, Judith leaned in to tell us that this dude was Craig Burton, and that it was Craig&#8217;s strategic vision that was busy guiding Novell to its roaring success.\nRight after that meeting, Craig called me just to talk, because he liked how the two of us could play &#8220;mind jazz&#8221; together, co-thinking about the future of a digital world that was still being born. Which we didn&#8217;t stop doing for the next thirty-four years.\nSo much happened in that time. Craig and Judith† had an affair, got exiled from Novell, married each other and built The Burton Group with another Novell alum, Jamie Lewis. It was through The Burton Group that I met and became good friends with Kim Cameron, who also passed too early, in November of last year. Both were also instrumental in helping start the Internet Identity Workshop, along with too many other things to mention. (Here are photos from the first meeting of what was then the &#8220;Identity Gang.&#8221;)\nIf you search for Craig&#8217;s name and mine together, you&#8217;ll find more than a thousand results. I&#8217;ll list a few of them later, and unpack their significance. But instead for now, I&#8217;ll share what I sent for somebody to use at the service for Craig today in Salt Lake City:\nIn a more just and sensible world, news of Craig Burton&#8217;s death would have made the front page of the Deseret News, plus the obituary pages of major papers elsewhere—and a trending topic for days in social media.*\nIf technology had a Hall of Fame, Craig would belong in it. And maybe some day, that will happen.\nBecause Craig was one of the most important figures in the history of the networked world where nearly all of us live today. Without Craig&#8217;s original ideas, and guiding strategic hand, Novell would not have grown from a small hardware company into the most significant networking company prior to the rise of the Internet itself. Nor would The Burton Group have helped shape the networking business as well, through the dawn of the Internet Age.\nIn those times and since, Craig&#8217;s thinking has often been so deep and far-reaching that I am sure it will be blowing minds for decades to come. Take, for example, what Craig said to me in  a 2000 interview for Linux Journal. (Remember that this was when the Internet was still new, and most homes were connected by dial-up modems.)\nI see the Net as a world we might see as a bubble. A sphere. It’s growing larger and larger, and yet inside, every point in that sphere is visible to every other one. That’s the architecture of a sphere. Nothing stands between any two points. That’s its virtue: it’s empty in the middle. The distance between any two points is functionally zero, and not just because they can see each other, but because nothing interferes with operation between any two points. There’s a word I like for what’s going on here: terraform. It’s the verb for creating a world. That’s what we’re making here: a new world.\nToday, every one of us with a phone in our pocket or purse lives on that giant virtual world, with zero functional distance between everyone and everything—a world we have barely started to terraform.\nI could say so much more about Craig&#8217;s original thinking and his substantial contributions to developments in our world. But I also need to give credit where due to the biggest reason Craig&#8217;s heroism remains mostly unsung, and that&#8217;s Craig himself. The man was his own worst enemy: a fact he admitted often, and with abiding regret for how his mistakes hurt others, and not just himself.\nBut I also consider it a matter of answered prayer that, after decades of struggling with alcohol addiction, Craig not only sobered up, but stayed that way, married his high school sweetheart and returned to the faith into which he was born.\nNow it is up to people like me—Craig&#8217;s good friends still in the business—to make sure Craig&#8217;s insights and ideas live on.\nHere is a photo album of Craig. I&#8217;ll be adding to it over the coming days.\n\n†Judith died a few years ago, at just 66. Her heroism as a marketing genius is also mostly unsung today.\n*Here&#8217;s a good one, in Silicon Slopes.",

        "link": "https://om.co/2022/09/05/is-the-2022-macbook-air-good-for-photography/",
        "description": "A day before the likely launch of Apple’s new line-up of products &#8212; iPhone 14 models and new Apple Watch models &#8212; is not the best time to share my thoughts about a product launched at the previous Apple event. But then, I am not doing a paint-by-numbers review. Nor am I a reviewer in the classic reviewer mold.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt has been a few months since Apple released the 2022 edition of the 13-inch MacBook Air &#8211;arguably the most popular laptop in the Mac line-up. Not surprisingly, there was a lot of interest in the thin-and-skinny laptop. And the reviews came in thick and fast. I am sure you have read or watched many of the reviews. If not, I can certainly recommend a handful &#8212; John Gruber, Joanna Stern, Dave Lee, and The Verge. So, if you are wondering what else I can add to what has already been said, then you are right to assume that: not much.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExcept, I wanted to see how good (or bad) the new M2-powered MacBook Air would be for me as an “on-the-go” photographer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, a little indulgence in nostalgia.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI have always had a sweet spot for the MacBook, from the day Steve Jobs showed it off for the first time on stage. It was back in 2008, and I was recovering from a tough medical condition. I remember telling one of my colleagues that I needed to get better because I wanted to buy and use that diminutive and thin device. She looked at me as if I was crazy. \n\n\n\nNevertheless, I did get better. I bought one. It was underpowered. It got hot as a barbeque grill. It had terrible battery life. The screen wasn’t anything to write home about. And even the way to connect the power bank and USB cable to it was less than ideal. It was classic Jony Ive, form over function design, made to please only one master &#8212; Steve. And boy, did I love it. Irrational? Absolutely.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn time, the Macbook Air evolved, and when the tapering trapezoid model came out &#8212; you could see that Apple’s design team had nailed it. It was a home run. It was thin, and it was light. And it had the right amount of ports, a good battery, and a decent screen. And the price was right. It has become one of Apple’s best-selling products. Like many other hit Apple products, it became a design icon, distinctive in its appearance. I liked the 13-inch version, but it was the 11-inch version that became my second computer &#8212; a perfect compliment to my iMac.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince then, the iPad has replaced it as my secondary computer, and at home, I have a MacBook Pro 16-inch, which is attached to an XDR Display. I need the laptop mostly because I use PhotoMechanic for my photo management and Adobe Photoshop for my photo editing. \n\n\n\nWhen Apple changed the design of the MacBook Air with the new launch, I was disappointed. It was losing its uniqueness. Instead of an icon, it looked like any other Apple (or Windows laptop.) Sure it was thin and light, but the design looked pretty ho-hum.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd now that I have had the opportunity to use the laptop for a few weeks, what do I think?&nbsp;\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf the MacBook Air lacks the wedge that made it the Air (remember that envelope schtick) then is it really a MacBook Air? Why is it not a MacBook? I am confused. Thoughts @stevesi @gruber @mjtsai&mdash; OM (@om) June 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\nMy opinion on the design of the laptop isn’t changed &#8212; it feels like a skinnier (and, in my opinion, better) version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro.\n\n\n\nHowever, by losing the iconic shape, Apple has shorn the “Air” line-up of its instant recognizability. For me, Macbook Air signified &#8212; practical, smart, and sensible. The new MacBook Air is just another faceless slab of aluminum in an ocean of laptops. Unlike John Gruber and others, I just can’t get over the loss of an iconic design.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd that’s where my criticism of the new laptop ends.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI think losing the old iconic shape has come at a cost &#8212; roughly $200. But it does buy you a much better screen, better audio, better webcam, better chip, and a more powerful chip. Dollar for dollar, not only is the Macbook Air 2022 better than its predecessor, it is better by a country mile than its “professional” cousin, the 2022 13-inch MacBook Pro. (Here is an in-depth comparison between the 13-inch Macbook Air and the 13-inch Macbook Pro.)&nbsp;\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy biggest problem when on photo trips is the amount of weight in my backpack &#8212; I am typically walking out of the apartment with around 35 lbs on my back, and that doesn’t include the other stuff, which I normally carry in a “weekender” bag. It is a bit too much. I love my 16-inch MacBook Pro 16 as my primary computer &#8212; god, it is good &#8212; I hate carrying a 4.7 lbs machine on my back.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Macbook Air shaves off just over a pound-and-a-half and takes up much less space in the camera bag. There is no denying that you give up a lot when you go with the Air. The screen size and quality aren’t the same, for starters. Speeds and performance aren’t the same either. Will these be deal breakers?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat is what I wanted to find out, and I asked Apple if they would loan me a laptop for a few weeks to try as an “on-the-go” photographer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSomeone at Apple knows me well and knows I am a “blues” man. Apple sent me a midnight blue version of the machine &#8212; it has 16 GB memory and 1 TB internal storage. The M2 chip inside has 8 CPU cores and 10&nbsp; GPU cores. This set-up costs $1899 &#8211; the same as the 2022 Macbook Pro 13. No serious photographer should consider the entry-level 8GB/256GB version of the 2022 MacBook Air. It is just not powerful enough and doesn’t have a large enough storage capacity to even be useful on a short trip.\n\n\n\nThe midnight color looks amazing in a way &#8212; but that fascination lasts only a little bit. The new surface is a fingerprint magnet. Every time I set it down, I see smudges and take out the polishing cloth to clean it up. What a waste of time &#8212; or, in my case, a compulsion you can’t avoid.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt didn’t take me long to set up the laptop &#8212; Apart from Firefox and Brave browsers, I installed half-a-dozen non-photography apps in total. I use the Mail.app as my email client, Apple’s Calendar &amp; Reminders. (I could download Outlook and do it all in a single app, but Outlook makes me feel like I am a corporate drone.)&nbsp; For everything else, I use cloud-based services.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI downloaded the Adobe Creative Cloud and proceeded to install three applications &#8212; Photoshop, Lightroom CC, and Lightroom CC. I also downloaded Capture One, SmugMug’s desktop uploader, and most importantly, Photo Mechanic, which is amazing photo management and organization tool.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI use PhotoMechanic to rename my photos, then cull them into a manageable lot. I don’t ever exceed more than 100 photos a day on my trips, so I end up with about 25 usable photos. I further narrow down my selections to about 10. Those selections go into an editing folder. Those photos are in my Lightroom Classic catalog. From PhotoMechanic selects, I open individual files in Photoshop.\n\n\n\nOver three weeks, I pretended I was on a landscape photography trip to San Francisco. I went around the city and took photos as a visiting landscape photographer. I walked around with my camera, lenses, filters, tripod, and Macbook Air packed in my backpack. I could feel the weight difference. It is weird, but the Macbook Air feels much lighter compared to the 16-inch machine, even though the weight difference is 1.7 pounds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnyway, after a “photo” session, I would come back home and attach an SD card reader (which is missing in MacBook Air compared to my MBP) in one of the only two Thunderbolt 4/ USB-C ports. I would plug a 2 TB SanDisk drive into the other Thunderbolt 4/USB-C port. Then I would import the photos from my SD card into the drive using PhotoMechanic. And go through my photography workflow.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPhotoMechanic, the most important part of my workflow, especially when traveling, performed like a champ. I could barely notice any difference between its performance on the 16-inch MacBook Pro. I know there is a difference, but in the”field,” it didn’t matter as much. I could get the culling and curation done very quickly.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat about Lightroom(s)? Again it is the same &#8212; the naked eye couldn’t perceive the speed difference between the 13-inch Air and 16-inch Pro. I supposed that an 18 percent bump in the M2 chip performance and updates from Adobe have made Lightroom perform like a champ on the MacBook Air.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith one caveat &#8212; I don’t have a massive Lightroom Catalog &#8212; I tend to have small catalogs based on the year. I also don’t have tens of thousands of photos in my Lightroom library. My entire year’s worth of Lightroom library is less than 1,000 photos. So my use case is not as intense as my friends who live in Lightroom. So, for this test. I created a new catalog &#8212; with photos from the past five years. It is still not big enough &#8211; less than 10,000 photos.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nImporting photos into the catalog for the first time was quite a drag &#8212; the whole process took about half an hour, and the previews took much longer. And boy, did it make the computer hot. But after that, everything became a breeze.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nImports after a “daily” session were a breeze. So fast that I barely noticed. I could do basic edits to photos as if I was sitting at home &#8212; though I did struggle with the smaller screen size. Still, when in the field, I normally look at my photos with my color or B&amp;W preset to decide what final direction the photo should take, and I could do that without a thought. This is the most I do when I am out in the field. I leave all my final editing for later &#8212; when I am home, in front of a big screen.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat I usually do in the field is try and do HDR merge and Panorama stitching. And this is where you can tell that MacBook Air is a bit of a lightweight. Since the MacBook Air is a fanless design, the computer does get visibly warm when you try and do more than two Panorama stitches or HDR merges.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn comparison, the Macbook Pro 16-inch does the job without as much as even a momentary pause. More memory in your MacBook Air should help, but this is a resource-hogging process. As a landscape photographer, this is a negative. However, I could live with it, as I am not constantly doing Panos and HDR merges all the time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow for Adobe Photoshop, my single most used photo editing tool. I typically open photos right from PhotoMechanic into Adobe Photoshop, starting my editing process with Adobe Camera Raw. Again, I apply my presets&nbsp; &#8212; color or black &amp; white. These two presets are the baseline from which I start to build my photos.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI have three cameras: the classic SL, SL2, and the Leica M11. Their resolutions are 24, 47, and 61 megapixels, respectively. The final file sizes are different as a result. SL files are 45 megabytes, while SL2 files are 85 megapixels, and the M11 files come in around 100 megabytes. I normally carry an SL2 body with an additional body. I give you this background to give you a better idea of how I use the software.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI make a lot of local contrast adjustments and use dodge and burn to give photos some dimensionality. A typical edit turns into about 10-12 layers. Add a few more layers for color (desaturation) and remove distractions such as dust spots &#8212; my basic edit turns into about 15 layers. And that means each file balloons in size.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn the new MacBook Air, the SL2 and SL were a breeze to manipulate, though I could tell they were slower than my Macbook Pro. The machine got a little hot and testy with the M11 files &#8212; over a gigabyte, I felt that the machine lost a step. Another thing I realized was that Photoshop sucks up a lot of battery &#8212; and you are better off plugging the computer into a power source.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile I missed the larger screen, the screen quality didn’t bother me as much. I knew I was going to finalize my photos when I got home. I appreciate the XDR display for how much it allows me to help tweak the grays and reduce the colors to the bare minimum.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat about some of the other apps I use? Capture One, for example. It is slower compared to how it runs on the MacBook Pro 16. It just might be that their software isn’t optimized for the upgraded M2 chips. I also use Darkroom &#8212; and it worked flawlessly. I use SmugMug uploader &#8212; it is not much of a resource hog, so it worked as expected.\n\n\n\nNow comes the bad news: I use additional applications such as Topaz GigaPixel, Topaz Sharpen, and Topaz DeNoise. They are resource-intensive applications. So much so that the fans on my MacBook Pro come on quite quickly. They were slow on the MacBook Air, and I had to wait to let them do their thing. And no, I wasn’t using them simultaneously &#8212; instead, they were being used as standalone applications. It was quite disappointing because I felt things would have improved since the launch of M1.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe last point is the battery life &#8212; if using the machine for photo-related tasks, emails, and some blogging and web surfing without plugging it into a power source, I was able to extract between 6 to 8 hours a day. Adobe apps &#8212; especially when using the GPU resourced &#8212; seem to use a lot of resources, and so does the email application. In comparison, the MacBook Pro 16 gives me about 4-to-5 hours a day, despite a big battery. I suppose that is because of the bigger, higher-resolution screen and more GPU consumption by various Adobe applications.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n***\n\n\n\nWhat’s my conclusion?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTL:DR: I don’t need to carry extra weight to do what I do when on location. In a perfect world, I would like to sell my Macbook Pro 16 and replace it with a “Studio” desktop and this MacBook Air.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 2022 MacBook Air is a very capable computer that does all the routine tasks a photographer is likely to undertake in the field. It doesn’t bat an eyelid regarding curation, editing in Lightroom, and using Photoshop. You can get six to eight hours a day from the battery. The lack of an SD card reader is a negative but not a deal breaker. If you use applications like the Topaz suite, you need to be prepared to get less than blazing fast performance.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSadly, yes, sadly…I will stay with the MacBook Pro 16 &#8212; because it would take about five weeks for Apple to ship me a beefed-up Studio and a Macbook Air. I got photos to edit!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdditional Notes:&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\nAt this point, all Apple Silicon is good enough to deliver excellent performance and perform better than similarly priced rivals. The real difference is how much software developers optimize their software to take advantage of Apple’s hardware. \n\n\nRead my late 2020 M1 MacBook Pro review.\n\n\nMy 2022 MacBook Air configuration would be 24 GB of memory and 2 TB of storage. That would allow for a much smoother experience.",

        "description": "(7/13) “When I got this job, I started at the bottom. Serving beers in a beer garden for $10 an hour. But I’m relentless. I did whatever I had to do: show up thirty minutes early, look your best, act your best. Do jobs that aren’t yours. If the table is 95 percent clean, make it 105 percent clean. If the guest wants one thing, bring them three. Say good morning before they do. Say good night before they do. Whatever it takes: to be the most seen, the most heard, to be the best. I’m relentless. Been that way my whole life. In prison I was a store man. It’s like a human bodega. There were seven of them on our compound, but I was the best. I had twenty lockers filled with cokes, candy bars, and potato chips. Each time a new prisoner came off the bus, I’d be there to greet him. I’d give him a care package: shampoo, deodorant, toothpaste. All of it for free. So the next time he needs a store man, he’s coming to me. It’s all about how you make people feel. It applies whether you’re in an upscale restaurant, or whether you’re in prison. I was a model inmate. Never had a single write-up. Not one altercation. And after six years they transferred me to a minimum-security facility in Montgomery, Alabama. It’s what’s known as a ‘camp.’ It had dorms, and a library. I had the best job on the whole compound: mowing the warden’s lawn. Tiny, Napoleon-ass motherfucker. But he had the best-looking lawn in the federal prison system. I made sure of that. I happened to be mowing his lawn on April 23rd, 2014, when I noticed everyone running to the prison yard. I knew there must be a rumor. Cause every time there’s a rumor, everyone runs straight to the yard. Usually the rumor turns out to be bullshit. But this time it was true: The Obama Administration had just announced a clemency program. Every federal inmate could apply for a presidential pardon. There were 200,000 federal inmates. Better odds than a mega millions lottery ticket, but not much better. I found a jailhouse lawyer named Dino, and we got started on my petition that same afternoon. I knew it was going to be the biggest fucking stack of applications in the world. And 56134066 was going to be sitting on the very top.”",

        "description": "For many people, Google is the go-to starting point when they need to find something on the web. With just a few keystrokes, the search engine can find virtually anything. \nThis makes life easier but for copyright holders, there&#8217;s a drawback too, as the web is littered with pirate sites. \nOver the past decade, Google has removed more than five billion &#8216;infringing&#8217; URLs from its search results. A few days ago the company hit a new milestone after receiving DMCA notices for more than four million unique domain names. \n\nTo mark this event we decided to take a closer look at the submitted URLs to see who the worst offenders are. This leads to some interesting conclusions and puts the four million number in perspective. \nTop Recipients\nThe domain most flagged for infringement is 4shared.com. This popular file-sharing service has had more than 68 million of its URLs removed from Google. The majority of these were removed several years ago. More recently, 4shared started to actively work with rightsholders to prevent piracy by deploying filtering technologies.\nThe runner-up on the list with 51 million removed URLs is the relatively unknown mp3toys.xyz. This domain has been inactive for roughly half a decade but previously hosted pirated MP3s. The top three is completed by rapidgator.net, which has had more than 42 million of its URLs removed from Google&#8217;s search results. \n\nWhat stands out is that the majority of the reported URLs are linked to a tiny fraction of the four million domain names. Just 400 domains (0.01%) are responsible for 41% of all links removed by Google over the years. \nHundreds of Pirate Bays\nThe Pirate Bay is ranked 66th based on the number of URLs Google had to remove. That&#8217;s only for the site&#8217;s main .org domain and there are hundreds of Pirate Bay proxy domains that are also frequently targeted. \nThere are currently close to 900 domain names that include the phrase &#8220;piratebay&#8221; in Google&#8217;s list of copyright infringing domain names. On top of that, there are more than 5,000 that use other variations of the word &#8220;bay,&#8221; many of which are inspired by the notorious pirate site.\n\nLegitimate Domains in the Long Tail\nIt&#8217;s clear that a relatively small number of domains generate the bulk of all takedown requests. This means that there&#8217;s a long tail of domains that are flagged just a few times.\nThis long tail includes many marginal pirate sites, but there are also thousands of domain names that are not typical copyright infringers. Some of these are simply flagged in error.\nThere are numerous examples of legitimate sites. These include the FBI (22x), the RIAA (2x), the Vatican (reported 3x), and the White House (17xx), but there are thousands more we could add to the list. The good news is that Google is usually quite good at spotting these errors. \nThere are also legitimate sites that are flagged relatively often. The movie and TV database IMDb, for example, was reported 5,564 times. Another popular target is Wikipedia, which was mentioned 3,492 times in takedown notices. Interestingly, Google.com was also targeted over 700,000 times.\nAll in all, it&#8217;s safe to conclude that the four million domain names are not all blatant infringers. Instead, the bulk of all pirated content is centered around just a few hundred sites. \nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "via Nick Youngson CC BY-SA 3.0 Pix4free.org\nLet&#8217;s start with what happened to TV.\nFor decades, all TV signals were &#8220;over the air,&#8221; and free to be watched by anyone with a TV and an antenna. Then these things happened:\n\n Community Antenna TeleVision, aka CATV, gave us most or all of our free over-the-air channels, plus many more—for a monthly subscription fee. They delivered this service, literally, through a cable connection—one that looked like the old one that went to an outside antenna, but instead went back to the cable company&#8217;s local headquarters.\nThen premium TV (aka &#8220;pay,&#8221; &#8220;prestige&#8221; and &#8220;subscription&#8221; TV), along with one&#8217;s cable channel selection. This started with HBO and Showtime. It cost additional subscription fees but was inside your cable channel selection and your monthly cable bill.\nThen came streaming services, (aka Video on Demand, or VoD) showed up over the Internet, and then through media players you could hook up to your tv through an input (usually HDMI) aside from the one from your cable box, and your cable service—even if your Internet service was provided by the cable company. This is why the cable industry called all of these services &#8220;over the top,&#8221; or OTT. The main brands here were Amazon Fire, Apple TV, Google Chromecast, and Roku. Being delivered over the Internet rather than lumped in with all those cable channels, higher resolutions were possible. At best most cable services are &#8220;HD,&#8221; which was fine a decade ago, but is now quite retro. Want to watch TV in 4K, HDR, and all that? Subscribe through your smart OTT media intermediary.\nAnd now media players are baked into TVs. Go to Best Buy, Costco, Sam&#8217;s Club, Amazon, or Walmart, and you&#8217;ll see promos for &#8220;smart&#8221; Google, Fire (Amazon), Roku, webOS, and Tizen TVs—rather than just Sony, LG, Samsung, and other brands. Relatively cheap brands, such as Vizio, TCL, and Hisense, are essentially branded media players with secondary brand names on the bezel.\n\nEconomically speaking, all that built-in smartness is about two things. One is facilitating subscriptions, and the other is spying on you for the advertising business. But let&#8217;s table the latter and focus just on subscriptions, because that&#8217;s the way the service world is going.\nMore and more formerly free stuff on the Net is available only behind paywalls. Newspapers and magazines have been playing this game for some time. But, now that Substack is the new blogging, many writers there are paywalling their stuff as well. Remember SlideShare? Now it&#8217;s &#8220;Read free for 60 days.&#8221;\nPodcasting is drifting in that direction too. SiriusXM and Spotify together paid over a half $billion to put a large mess of popular podcasts into subscription-based complete (SiriusXM) or partial (Spotify) paywall systems, pushing podcasting toward the place where premium TV has already sat for years—even though lots of popular podcasts are still paid for by advertising.\nI could add a lot of data here, but I&#8217;m about to leave on a road trip. So I&#8217;ll leave it up to you. Look at what you&#8217;re spending now on subscriptions, and how that collection of expenses is going up. Also, take a look at how much of what was free on the Net and the Web is moving to a paid subscription model. The trend is not small, and I don&#8217;t see it stopping soon.\n&nbsp;",

        "description": "I found out yesterday that the latest episode of The Josh Marshall Podcast with me and Kate Riga got pulled from YouTube apparently because we were **discussing** QAnon-adjacent pedophilia conspiracy theories peddled by Republicans. This got me in the mind of the frequently absurd ways that social media platforms try and fail to distinguish between bad or predatory speech and discussing bad or predatory speech. It also made me want to expand on some points that I made in that episode. (To be clear, you can still hear the episode. You just can&#8217;t watch the video version of it, at least for the moment.) \n\n\n\nAs I noted yesterday, mainstream political media is particularly ill-equipped to grapple with the ways in which the GOP pushes what is in essence eliminationist rhetoric and incitement. Many of us know about the QAnon conspiracy theory world which posits a vast liberal/Democrat conspiracy of sex trafficking and pedophilia which will finally be undone by a violent cleansing of America by Donald Trump. Conventional media seems entirely incapable of grappling with, explaining or describing the way that the &#8220;mainstream&#8221; GOP has increasingly promoted and mainstreamed these beliefs with a spectrum of indirect to increasingly explicit messaging. We see it in the otherwise quite difficult to explain focus on the sentencing specifics of a few cases overseen by future Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson. We see it in what I discussed yesterday as the right-wing appropriation of the pedophile/sexual predation language of &#8220;grooming&#8221; to indict and discredit any and all support of transgender minors. Conventional journalism simply has a willed incapability to make the connections.",

        "description": "(6/13) “The other night I was having dinner on the patio with someone who was in prison with me. We were sitting under these $20,000 custom Swiss-made umbrellas. We ordered something simple. But when you’re the boss, they bring you everything. All of it served in copper plates from France: Shishito Peppers, Potato Gnocchi, Summer Squash. Everything hyper-seasonal. Everything fresh from the green market. At one point my friend says: ‘Isn’t this surreal?’ And it really was. Considering five years earlier we were standing in the cafeteria line with 950 inmates, wearing boxers and jumpsuits that 9,000 other people had worn. Inmate 56134066. There’s a saying in prison: one man, one armband. Because the number on your armband is the only thing that belongs to you. There’s 2.2 million people in the American prison system, and half a million of those are locked up for drug offenses. A lot of them were in the same boat as me: victims of the mandatory minimum. Passed by Congress in 1986, it’s the reason hundreds of thousands of nonviolent people, mostly black and brown people, are rotting in prison. Rotting like the baloney and cheese sandwiches they serve for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. I did believe wholeheartedly in my petition for appeal; all of us did. But a prisoner filing an appeal is like a person buying a mega millions lottery ticket. Only 1 out of 100,000 get a post-conviction break. But it’s enough for the rest of us to torture ourselves with hope. You have no choice. You can’t survive without hope. I spent all my time in the legal library, crafting those appeals. None of it mattered. Denied by the District Court. Denied by the Third Circuit. The wheels of justice turn slow, that’s what my public defender used to say. I’d been in prison for ten years by the time my petition reached the Supreme Court. They were never going to accept my case; I knew that. They take like six cases a year, but it was the only hope I had left. I spent a thousand hours on that petition. It was 50 pages long. The rejection letter arrived three months later, in a tiny envelope. It said: ‘Shut the fuck up and do your time. And that was the end of hope. After that, there was nothing.”",

        "description": "From a single piece of handcrafted manga to an entire musical album, copyright law offers protection to all creators. \nAt least that&#8217;s the basic theory behind creators&#8217; rights. The reality can be a somewhat less comforting and at times entirely more confusing experience.\nSmaller Copyright Holders, Fewer Options\nThe truth is that the ability to act against infringers is often linked to a copyright holder&#8217;s resources. If hiring a lawyer isn&#8217;t a problem, most smaller disputes can be handled relatively quickly. Those with free time may be able to handle simple matters independently, but since copyright law is complex, even larger rightsholders will seek help at some point.\nThrough a new initiative launched this week, the Japanese government is offering free legal assistance to rightsholders who wish to protect their content from copyright infringement, especially when that infringement takes place overseas.\nPortal For Copyright Infringment Countermeasures\nThe service enhances a project operated by Japan&#8217;s Agency for Cultural Affairs. The agency launched a new portal in June, which explains the basics of copyright law and enables those without experience to send takedown notices.\n\nThis week the Agency for Cultural Affairs expanded its support for local rightsholders with the launch of a new service to help those who have visited the portal, absorbed all of the available knowledge, but still require further assistance.\nAnti-Piracy Consultation Desk\nIn recent years there has been a realization in Japan that overseas piracy represents a growing threat to local copyright holders. The Ministry for Cultural Affairs published a report in March detailing responses to cross-border piracy, including the establishment of a new consultation desk to assist rightsholders.\n&#8220;The Consultation Desk accepts consultations regarding infringement of copyrights, etc. from rightsholders. Consultation is accepted from the consultation reception form on the portal site,&#8221; the official announcement reads. \n&#8220;In principle, responses will be made by e-mail, and depending on the case, it is assumed that a free individual interview with an attorney will be held online or otherwise.&#8221;\nGiven that legal costs in copyright matters can be substantial, the provision of a free service will be appreciated by rightsholders, especially the smaller ones with fewer resources. Those who make use of the service will gain access to a network of 1,000 lawyers, including copyright specialists with experience of fighting piracy in Asia, North America and the EU.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "Two swimming pools hold an almost holy place in my heart:The indoor pool and gymnasium of the Chatham Center Hotel in Pittsburgh, where our family lived before our house was ready for occupancy. And where the gym manager Mr Kaufman, a mountain of lazily contented flesh who was never without his lighted cigar, unfailingly greeted my brother and me thusly: “Hello, boys. How’s your mother?” And where I taught my younger brother Peter to swim. We would hold our noses and hang upside down, our legs gripping the edge of the pool. When water went up our noses, we would shout “Angela!”, emulating some character on a TV show who had shouted that name, and cracking ourselves up over nothing, as only two close siblings can. After swimming, we would have spaghetti in the Howard Johnson’s that served as the hotel’s restaurant. That world is long gone.\n\n\n\nThe Big Pool at the Grand Floridian hotel in Disney World, several summers in a row, starting when my daughter Ava was six. The hotel is on the Magic Kingdom’s grounds. Entering the park an hour before general admission began, we’d hit our favorite attractions for an hour or two, while the temperature and humidity were still bearable. It’s a Small World and Pirates of the Caribbean were of course our favorites, but we also enjoyed the singing bears, and even the dreaded hall of presidents. Before lunchtime, our Magic Kingdom needs sated, we’d have returned to the hotel for a long day’s lounging in and around the pool. We made up imaginary and ridiculous Disney movies, describing the trailers to each other. (In “The Dog Who Shit Nickels,” when the suburban neighbor, pointing to a pile of coins, complains to dog owner Arnold Schwarzenegger, “Look what your dog did on my lawn!”, Arnold says, “Keep ze change.”) We splashed, we swam, we paddled. We floated on our backs, gazing at the palm trees and getting giddy over the ducks who roamed the grounds and used the pool as their toilet. My nostalgia for those moments is enormous. They will never come again. For we will never again travel to Florida.\nThe post A Tale of Two Pools appeared first on Zeldman on Web and Interaction Design.",

In branding circles, they call this line extension.\nAnother possibility is Spotted Hawk.

Meanwhile, Spotted Hawk reads well, even if the meaning is a bit obscure. Hell, the Redskins or the Indians could have renamed themselves the Spotted Hawks.\nYet barbaric yawping isn&#8217;t my style, even if I am untamed and sometimes untranslatable.\nAny other suggestions?\nAs a relevant but unrelated matter, I also have to decide how to produce it. The easy choice is to use Substack, which all but owns the newsletter platform space right now. But Substack newsletters default to tracking readers, and I don&#8217;t want that. I also hate paragraph-long substitutes for linked URLs, and tracking cruft appended to the ends of legible URLs. (When sharing links from newsletters, always strip that stuff off. Pro tip: the cruft usually starts with a question mark.) I&#8217;m tempted by Revue, entirely because Julia Angwin and her team at The Markup went through a similar exercise in 2019 and chose Revue for their newsletter. I&#8217;m already playing with that one. Other recommendations are welcome. Same goes for managing the mailing list if I don&#8217;t use a platform. Mailman perhaps?\n\n*One reason I keep this blog up is that Harvard hosts it, and Harvard has been around since 1636. I also appreciate deeply its steady support of what I do here and at ProjectVRM, which also manifests as a blog, at the Berkman Klein Center.",

        "link": "https://om.co/2022/08/30/apples-missing-augmented-intelligence/",
        "description": "As part of writing a review, I have been using Apple’s 2022 version of the 13-inch MacBook Air. I am not the first one to say it&nbsp; &#8212; many others have said before &#8212; it is a great device. It is a great testimonial of Apple’s hardware excellence and knowledge crammed into this thin sliver of engineering marvel. The new M2 chip, the longer battery life, improved webcam, keyboard, and speakers &#8212; everything is of exceptional quality. Apple does know how to build good premium hardware at scale.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSadly, you can’t say the same when it comes to its software &amp; services that rely on machine learning and augmented intelligence. The obvious deficiencies, whether on the Mac, the iPhone, or the iPad, are quite annoying. Take the Mac as an example. By now, it should be easier for the “notification” system to understand that showing notifications of events that have already happened is mere noise and a nuisance. And yet, you have to manually delete them. I mean, it should be obvious to any computer system and any application that date and time have passed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDon’t get me started about Siri, which feels like a kindergartner compared to highly effective Alexa, and Google’s Home. If you have an accent that is not “classic American” or “classic English,” Siri will never quite understand you. Much as I loved the HomePod, it could never play “Nitin Sawhney” when I asked Siri to play his new album.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThings on iOS are comically calamitous. We all know about “What the Duck,” and by now, we have decided to live with it. Whether it is the spontaneous capitalization of words without reason, amazingly incomprehensible autocorrect, or lack of competence to transcribe effectively makes you wonder what is the point of all those neural engines Apple’s hardware team keeps cramming into the newer generation of Apple’s chips.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany folks weighed in with their experiences and opinions when I tweeted out my observation. Ken Kocienda, who spent most of his working life at Apple and is the inventor of the iPhone auto-correct in a tweet-reply noted: “To make good computing experiences for people, you have to understand computers and people, what people want to do with computers, and what new technology can do to make things better. This sounds obvious in theory, but it isn’t so easy in practice.”\n\n\n\nIt is obvious that Apple competitors &#8212; Google, Amazon, and Microsoft &#8212; have become much better at helping people with their computing experiences. Microsoft’s Outlook, for example, has become very effective at helping with autocorrecting spellings and grammar and learning my idiosyncratic idioms. Apple showed many improvements in the Mailapp in its next Mac OS, Ventura, but they have been a bit of a letdown. For example, the &#8220;Follow Up&#8221; functionality in Mac OS Ventura Beta version of Mail is pretty hit or miss.\n\n\n\nTogether, this might seem like a bouquet of small annoyances, but it can have larger ramifications for the company. The future of hardware is not just hardware; it is constantly morphed and shaped with software and “augmented intelligence.” I pointed this out in my piece about Apple’s Studio Display. It is about adaptable and personalized hardware. AirPods, for example, could become more powerful and personal in the near future. \n\n\n\n\nApple – being an &quot;instrumentalist&quot; culture – gets atomized &quot;objects&quot; and &quot;functions&quot; as &quot;tools&quot; in preordained processes (think industrial era)&#8230; but not environments as multi-actor meaning generation contexts (think Internet and web1/2/3 with all their incredible graphs).&mdash; Squirrel (@sotirov) August 30, 2022\n\n\n\n\nBut all that needs intelligent systems to “augment” what we need as humans. And nothing needs it more than Apple’s next big bet. The much-rumored mixed reality platform depends on glasses, phones, and access to network information.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis platform eschews text entry for gestures and voice commands. For this new post-touch interface to work, the hardware has to be flawless, and its software experience has to be perfect. Imagine my “commands” getting a Siri-like response? I will return the glasses to the store and demand my money back. This is the real Achilles heel of Apple.\n\n\n\nIn a strange bit of irony, the piece started with Otter. I use that service to dictate notes, ideas, and random thoughts. It takes my voice and transcribes it. By now, it is good enough to deal with my accent and my pronunciation. I drafted this piece on Google Docs, enhanced by Google’s intelligence, and then used Grammarly’s AI tool to help make sure that I got my grammar right and didn’t skip the commas. For all this, I used the new 13-inch Apple Macbook Air, which I don’t mind saying, is one helluva computer.\n\n\n\n\nIndependent developers used to do something for Apple that they can&#39;t any longer. And you can&#39;t hire people to work inside large companies to do the kind of thing one developer with a big mind and strong will can do. Even if they had the ability it wouldn&#39;t be worth it.&mdash; Dave Winer (@davewiner) August 30, 2022\n\n\n\n\nAugust 30, 2022. San Francisco.\n\n\n\nRelated Reading: The Hype &#8212; and Hope &#8212; of Artificial Intelligence/The New Yorker.",

        "description": "(5/13) “I’ve tried therapy five times. And I’ve quit five times. They torture me with questions, just like you’re doing. How do you feel? How do you feel? There is no feel. My nerve tips have been incinerated. By HIV, by meth, by prison. The only thing I feel is the throttle in my hand when I’m cranking it. Maybe you have time to sit around, saying: ‘What if? What if?’ But I have a to-do list longer than Eighth Avenue. I can’t keep digging up the most shameful, the most aggravating part of my life. When I go back there, I start hating myself. And that leads to one place. That leads to meth. So after this, I’m done. No more interviews. No more therapy. In prison we had our own version of therapy. It was a track in the yard, if you could even call it that, 100 yards of pebbles and potholes. But whenever things got to be too much, instead of slapping your cellmate for farting all night, you put on your headphones and walk the track. Think about anything you want. Just don’t think about the future; it’s the only way to protect yourself. Because nothing is in your control. Three years into my sentence my father was diagnosed with cancer. My mom had to deal with the whole thing herself. With everything else she was going through, she took him to all his appointments. One time I called her and they’d just gotten back from chemotherapy. They were still in the car, because my father had shit himself, and she couldn’t get him out. They were waiting on my Uncle Tommy to come help. How humiliating is that? The man who provided you everything, sitting in his own shit, for forty-five minutes, and you can’t do a thing. How’s that for being a complete fucking failure? We had one final call, right before he passed. He said: ‘I’m not giving up on you,’ same as the other times. But this time was different. This time was goodbye. He said: ‘Johnny, my time is about up. Take care of your mother and sister.’ I told him I would. But I wasn’t coming home for 15 years. We both knew I wasn’t going to take care of anyone. It was nothing but a show. When I hung up the phone, I wanted to scream at someone. But there was nobody but me. So I put on my headphones, and went out to the track.”",

But it also creates tension.\r\nThe person you&#8217;re seeking to connect with might not want to believe that help is possible. There&#8217;s a solace that comes from being really and truly stuck, and hope might not be on their agenda.\r\nOr there might be resistance to thinking about what help would look like. Because visualizing it brings it one step closer to happening, and that can be scary.\r\nPerhaps the person has danced with hope before, and discovered that people who mean well don&#8217;t always follow through. It may be that an offer of help feels temporary and selfish, not generous.\r\nAnd it could be that the problem the person has built is so perfect and permanent that no help is possible.\r\nUltimately, the only way to know if help is possible is to try.\r\n\r\n&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&nbsp;&#160;",

        "description": "Last year, the UK music industry claimed a major victory in its fight against online piracy. \nFollowing a two-year process initiated by the British Recorded Music Industry Ltd (BPI) and Phonographic Performance Ltd (PPL), the High Court ordered major ISPs to block access to several YouTube rippers.\nThe order aims to make these sites, including Flvto and 2Conv, harder to reach. Many workarounds exist but rightsholders have been particularly frustrated by search engines such as Google including the domains in their results. \nFollowing the blocking order, the BPI asked Google to remove thousands of YouTube ripper links, but this is a game of whack-a-mole; targeted sites actively fight delistings by switching to new URLs. \nGoogle Removes YouTube Rippers\nA few days ago, BPI and PPL broke this impasse. The groups sent a copy of the UK High Court order to Google, requesting removal of the listed domains. While Google isn&#8217;t legally obliged to comply, it did so voluntarily, albeit only in the UK.\nBPI &#038; PPL&#8217;s request\nThis is not the first time that the search engine has taken action based on a court order targeting a third party. Google has done the same in several other countries, including Australia, Denmark, France and the Netherlands.\nThe BPI previously requested similar removals in the UK. These included a wide variety of sites including The Pirate Bay, but the YouTube rippers were not mentioned until last week. \n\nDeindexing from search results will make these YouTube rippers harder to find, but the game of whack-a-mole game is far from over as hundreds of other stream-rippers remain readily accessible. \nLegal Uses?\nFinally, its worth noting that while the music industry sees YouTube rippers as piracy tools, others see them as neutral services. \nThe Electonic Frontier Foundation (EFF), for example, wrote an amicus curiae brief in support of Flvto and 2Conv when they were sued for copyright infringement in the United States.\n“Like a web browser, photocopy machine, or video recorder, the converters at issue in this case are neutral technologies, equally capable of lawful and infringing uses. And lawful uses abound, from saving a copy of a family member’s home video to downloading clips from a TV show as raw material for a critical commentary,” EFF wrote.\nThese comments didn&#8217;t help the YouTube rippers in question, as they eventually lost their legal battle against the RIAA earlier this year. \nThe New Normal\nGoogle&#8217;s voluntary domain removals are noteworthy because the company openly warned against such measures in the past. In 2015, it told the U.S. Government that whole-site removals would chill free speech and be counterproductive. \n“Whole site removal would simply drive piracy to new domains, legitimate sites, and social networks,” the company said at the time. \nThe search engine&#8217;s position has clearly shifted since its earlier criticism, at least when there&#8217;s a third-party court order involved. In a recent presentation to Japanese rightsholders, Google confirmed that it will &#8216;generally&#8217; remove domains based on third-party injunctions. \nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "All my life I’ve known I was “creative” and “different.” Only recently have I realized that I’m both neurodivergent and bisexual.\n\n\n\nIn my youth, as I struggled with drugs, alcoholism, depression, and underemployment, it never crossed my mind that I was neurodivergent—not that the term existed then. \n\n\n\nEven after I was diagnosed with an Anxiety Disorder some ten-plus years ago, I didn’t make the neurodivergence connection. It was only as my ex and I began coming to grips with&nbsp;our kid’s autism that I began to recognize many of her autistic qualities in myself and other members of our family.\n\n\n\nAnd it’s only in the past year or two, and only with my daughter’s help, that I’ve come to realize I’m bisexual.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI’ve known I was attracted to&nbsp;women&nbsp;since age five, when my mom took me into the powder room at B. Altman, where I gazed with open mouth as ladies touched up their lipstick, fluffed their hair, and adjusted how their bodies fit into their dresses. I was dressed in a wee suit with short pants and a bow tie. Two of the ladies picked me up and called me handsome. A lady kissed me. I smelled flowers as she enveloped me in a hug. A deep hunger was born in that moment. (I know. That sentence is gross.) Years later, in college, as I watched the adoration sequence during my first viewing of Fellini’s&nbsp;8 1/2, I recognized my own experience of awakening.\n\n\n\nYet for all those years of knowing I loved women, I didn’t understand that the love I felt for male friends could also be a romantic attraction.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow could I not know that? I suppose it’s because the other drive was more dominant—and, let’s face it, was also far more socially acceptable in those benighted days. As a short, nonathletic, curly-haired, unaggressive Jewish male in a world that beat me down for every one of those adjectives, I suppose I wasn’t eager to throw an extra (and even heavier) albatross around my own neck. So much so that I could not accept or even recognize that aspect of myself—not even when my unconscious tried to tell me.\n\n\n\nI remember writing a short story about a failed connection between two male high school friends. Thinking I was another D.H. Lawrence, and that my hermetically sealed tale was secretly ripe with deep meaning and profound feelings, I shared the story with my peers in the graduate creative writing program where I was hiding to avoid growing up.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA colleague in the program, who was a far better writer than me, and an out gay man, disdainfully labeled my work “another failed male bonding story.” I thanked him for his honesty and because his ability to use words that way amazed me, but I didn’t understand why he didn’t&nbsp;understand—because it was I who didn’t understand. (Understand?)\n\n\n\nAnd so the decades have passed.\n\n\n\nAt this point in my life, being single works for me, and, after two marriages, I have enough to get on with, just working and being a dad. So why even share these fragments and evasions? Surely who I find attractive is of interest to absolutely no one.\n\n\n\nExcept that Fascists in my country are drawing lines, turning back the clock on human rights and human decency, and I’ll be damned if I’m going to sit silently warming my feet at the hearth of some late-recognized private truth. \n\n\n\nIf they want to outlaw queerness and Blackness and ovaries and pretty much any identity other than Ward or June Cleaver, then they’re not just a threat to humanity and a wrong turn in the arc of history, they’re my enemy to fight.&nbsp;I’m right here, motherfuckers.\nThe post I’m Here appeared first on Zeldman on Web and Interaction Design.",

        "description": "(4/13) “The first place they took me was MCC in New York. Same floor Epstein killed himself. When they closed the door of that cell, I remember looking at the graffiti all over the walls. Grime everywhere. Hair on the floor a quarter inch deep. And sitting in the middle of the floor was two sheets and a blanket. I didn’t have the meth anymore. It was just me, those sheets, and that mess. I spent all my time imagining what it would be like to die in prison. Every little cold, every little stomachache, I thought: This is it. And what kind of death would that be? Everyone wants to die with dignity. But there was no dignity here. I didn’t tell a soul about my diagnosis. Show vulnerability, in this place? I’m no dummy. But the guards knew, because they had a list with a code next to my name. They kept making little innuendos. Fucking infuriating. I didn’t even talk about my diagnosis with the phlebotomist who checked my blood. But one day we’re in there alone, and I finally got the courage to ask him: ‘What do you think? Will I make it out of here alive?’ I’ll never forget him; his name was Alex. He said: ‘With the new drugs now, you’ll live longer than the rest of these clowns.’ It was my first glimpse of hope in six years, but it came too late. When you’re in prison: you might as well be dead. You’re in a coma. You’re not making new memories. You wouldn’t even know time was passing if it wasn’t for the 13th of every month, when your phone minutes reset. My first call was always to my mother. It was an ebb and flow. Most days she was upbeat. Other days it was: ‘Why? Why? Why?’ But she never left my side. Sent me a letter every week. Visited whenever she could. My father never came to see me, but I didn’t take it personal. He didn’t come to my baseball games either. Sometimes my Mom would hand him the phone, and he’d say: ‘I’m not giving up on you.’ That was it; it’s just who he was. He was an old school onion farmer. If you wanted to get a beer after work, and stare at the Eagles game on TV, he’d be there. But ‘I love you?’ Nah, none of that. That was Mom. Supposedly he changed after I went to prison, and I’m happy for that. I really am. But I never got to see it.”",

        "description": "One of the first &amp; best lessons you get as a young business reporter: follow the money. I have never forgotten that. It is a handy lens &#8211; you can zoom in or out when trying to understand something. (1)\n\n\n\nUsing that approach, I looked at Apple&#8217;s recent moves. Especially around advertising. One can get lost in the outrage over Apple&#8217;s push to advertising &#8212; the Internet&#8217;s first original sin, but the question is why? (2)\n\n\n\nFrom privacy (theater) to tussle with Facebook nee Meta to risking antagonizing its current customer base, if you zoom out, you start to see a reason behind Apple&#8217;s moves. (3)\n\n\n\nThe same reason has pushed Apple&#8217;s foray into payments, credit cards, and buy no later pay offerings.

        "description": "Marcus Smart. Photo by Eric Drost, via Wikimedia Commons.\nBack in 2016, I correctly predicted that the Cleveland Cavaliers would win the NBA finals, beating the heavily favored Golden State Warriors, which had won a record 73 games in the regular season. In 2021, I incorrectly predicted that the Kansas City Chiefs would beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. I based both predictions on a theory: the best story would win. And maybe Tom Brady proved that anyway: a relative geezer who was by all measures the GOAT, proved that label.\nSo now I&#8217;m predicting that the Boston Celtics will win the championship because they will win because they have the better story.\nUnless Steph Curry proves that he&#8217;s the GSOAT: Greatest Shooter Of All Time. Which he might. He sure looked like it in Game Four. That&#8217;s a great story too.\nBut I like the Celtics&#8217; story better. Here we have a team of relative kids who were average at best by the middle of the season, but then, under their rookie coach, became a defensive juggernaut, racking up the best record through the remainder of the season, then blowing through three playoffs to get to the Finals. In Round One, they swept Kevin Durant, Kyrie Irving and the Brooklyn Nets, who were pre-season favorites to win the Eastern Conference. In Round Two, they beat Giannis Antentokuompo and the Milwaukee Bucks, who were defending champs, in six games. In Round Three, they won the conference championship by beating the Miami Heat, another great defensive team, and the one with the best record in the conference, in seven games. Now the Celtics are tied, 2-2, with the Western Conference champs, the Golden State Warriors, with Steph Curry playing his best, looking all but unbeatable, on a team playing defense that&#8217;s pretty much the equal of Boston&#8217;s.\nThree games left, two at Golden State.\nBut I like the Celtics in this. They seem to have no problem winning on the road, and I think they want it more. And maybe even better.\nMay the best story win.\n[Later&#8230;] Well, c&#8217;est le jeu. The Celtics lost the next two games, and the Warriors took the series.\nAfter it was over, lots of great stories were told about the Warriors: the team peaked at the right time, they were brilliantly coached (especially on how to solve the Celtics), Steph moved up in all-time player rankings (maybe even into the top ten), Wiggins finally looked like the #1 draft choice he was years ago, the Dynasty is back. Long list, and it goes on. But the Celtics still had some fine stories of their own, especially around how they transformed from a mediocre team at mid-season to a proven title contender that came just two games away from winning it all. Not bad.",

        "description": "The decision whether to pirate content or pay for it is ultimately a personal choice influenced by any number of factors. \nFrom content availability to the ability to pay, from wanting content now or being forced to wait, the scales can easily tip one way or the other. \nBy emphasizing the benefits of legal consumption and elevating public perception of risk, anti-piracy groups try to tip the scales in favor of rightsholders. Showing real-life consequences of piracy is one of the available options.\nDeterrence For All\nTorrent sites offering Danish content were popular in Denmark for obvious reasons, at least until anti-piracy group Rights Alliance teamed up with police to shut them down.\nWhen key DanishBits players were arrested, convicted and later sent to prison, anyone inclined to launch a new site had a crystal clear example of the potential risks. As a deterrent to regular BitTorrent users, it wasn&#8217;t the right message. \nThe pursuit of high-level players would&#8217;ve simply reinforced the belief that only those at the top face any risk. But Rights Alliance hadn&#8217;t forgotten regular torrent site users and was preparing to send them a hand-crafted message. \nRegular BitTorrent User Sentenced\nA former user of DanishBits appeared in court Thursday having pleaded guilty to sharing around 40 movies on DanishBits. As previously reported, he had no formal connections with the site other than membership, and wasn&#8217;t part of any specific uploader group. He was a normal user, much like any other.\nRights Alliance needed a conviction that would resonate with the general public so after hiring a specialist company to gather tracking evidence, a case was built against the DanishBits user. Instead of being handed to a lawfirm for civil action, the case was accepted by the police for criminal prosecution.\nYesterday the Court of Frederiksberg handed down a 30-day conditional prison sentence and ordered the man to pay DKK 2,840 (US$380) in damages, the exact amount requested by Rights Alliance on behalf of its rightsholder partners. The Court also ordered the confiscation of two computers and external hard drives.\nCompared to the wild damages awards available to U.S. courts in civil cases, $380 may seem insignificant. But what it represents is a real amount attached to a very real criminal conviction, one that Rights Alliance (RA) believes can offer significant support to credible anti-piracy messaging.\nRA: Conviction Marks a Turning Point\nConsidering the importance of the prosecution, TorrentFreak asked Rights Alliance CEO Maria Fredenslund if the conditional prison sentence would send the right kind of message. Was it too harsh, or perhaps not harsh enough?\n&#8220;That was what the prosecution was going for, and we certainly think that a prison sentence has a deterrent effect,&#8221; Fredenslund says.\n&#8220;Not least because the compensation claim is also taken into account, and our experience with the&#8217; environment&#8217; shows that it also means a lot for the preventive effect.&#8221;\nRights Alliance obviously wants knowledge of the conviction to be a dominant factor when choices are being made over whether to pirate content or pay for it. Maria Fredenslund believes that the combination of police intervention and adjudication of compensation claims in criminal cases could help tip the scales in favor of legal content. \nBut just as importantly, Rights Alliance CEO believes that the case represents a turning point in the fight against piracy &#8211; the involvement of the police.\n&#8220;Finally, we have come to the point where the theft of films, series and other content is also a task that the police take care of. It is a necessity and therefore also a milestone in the work to ensure good conditions in the digital area,&#8221; Fredenslund concludes.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

(As an example, traffic from his followers, or, as we called them back then, readers, brought NASA’s web server to its knees.)\n\n\n\nHe&nbsp;co-founded The Web Standards Project, which succeeded in bringing standards to our browsers at a time when browser makers saw the web as a software market to be dominated, and not a precious commons to be nurtured.\n\n\n\nHe&nbsp;anticipated responsive web design&nbsp;by more than 20 years with his formulation of Liquid, Ice, and Jello as the three possible ways a designer could negotiate the need for meaningful layout vis-a-vis the unknowns of the user’s browsing environment.\n\n\n\nHe taught the web DHTML through his educational Project Cool Site.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd then, like a handful of other vital contributors to the early web (e.g. Todd Fahrner and Dean Allen), he vanished from the scene he’d played so large a role in creating.\n\n\n\nHe’s ba-ack\n\n\n\nGlenn Davis wasn’t always missed. Like many other creators of culture, he is autistic and can be abrasive and socially unclueful without realizing it. Before he was diagnosed, some people said Glenn was an a**hole—and some no doubt still will say that. I think of him as too big for any room that would have him. And I’m talking about him here because he is talking about himself (and the history of the early web) on his new website,&nbsp;Verevolf.\n\n\n\nIf you go there,&nbsp;start with the introduction, and, if it speaks to you, read his stories and consider sharing your own. That’s how we did it in the early days, and it’s still a fine way to do it—maybe even the best way.\n\n\n\nI knew Glenn, I worked with him and a lot of other talented people on The Web Standards Project (you’re welcome!), and it’s my opinion that—if you’re interested in how the web got to be the web, or if you were around at the time and are curious about a fellow survivor—you might enjoy yourself.\nThe post He Built This City: The Return of Glenn Davis appeared first on Zeldman on Web and Interaction Design.",

        "description": "Chemistry is a good metaphor for how teams work—especially when times get tough, such as in the playoffs happening in the NBA right now.\nThink about it. Every element has a melting point: a temperature above which solid turns liquid. Basketball teams do too, only that temperature changes from game to game, opponent to opponent, and situation to situation. Every team is a collection of its own human compounds of many elements: physical skills and talents, conditioning, experience, communication skills, emotional and mental states, beliefs, and much else.\nSometimes one team comes in pre-melted, with no chance of winning. Bad teams start with a low melting point, arriving in liquid form and spilling all over the floor under heat and pressure from better teams.\nSometimes both teams might as well be throwing water balloons at the hoop.\nSometimes both teams are great, neither melts, and you get an overtime outcome that&#8217;s whatever the score said when the time finally ran out. Still, one loser and one winner. After all, every game has a loser, and half the league loses every round. Whole conferences and leagues average .500. That&#8217;s their melting point: half solid, half liquid.\nYesterday we saw two meltdowns, neither of which was expected and one of which was a complete surprise.\nFirst, the Milwaukee Bucks melted under the defensive and scoring pressures of the Boston Celtics. There was nothing shameful about it, though. The Celtics just ran away with the game. It happens. Still, you could see the moment the melting started. It was near the end of the first half. The Celtics&#8217; offense sucked, yet they were still close. Then they made a drive to lead going into halftime. After that, it became increasingly and obviously futile to expect the Bucks to rally, especially when it was clear that Giannis Antetokounmpo, the best player in the world, was clearly less solid than usual. The team melted around him while the Celtics rained down threes.\nTo be fair, the Celtics also melted three times in the series, most dramatically at the end of game five, on their home floor. But Marcus Smart, who was humiliated by a block and a steal in the closing seconds of a game the Celtics had led almost all the way, didn&#8217;t melt. In the next two games, he was more solid than ever. So was the team. And they won—this round, at least. Against the Miami Heat? We&#8217;ll see.\nRight after that game, the Phoenix Suns, by far the best team in the league through the regular season, didn&#8217;t so much play the Dallas Mavericks as submit to them. Utterly.\nIn chemical terms, the Suns showed up in liquid form and turned straight into gas. As Arizona Sports put it, &#8220;We just witnessed one of the greatest collapses in the history of the NBA.&#8221; No shit. Epic. Nobody on the team will ever live this one down. It&#8217;s on their permanent record. Straight A&#8217;s through the season, then a big red F.\nTalk about losses: a mountain of bets on the Suns also turned to vapor yesterday.\nSo, what happened? I say chemistry.\nMaybe it was nothing more than Luka Dončić catching fire and vaporizing the whole Suns team. Whatever, it was awful to watch, especially for Suns fans. Hell, they melted too. Booing your team when it needs your support couldn&#8217;t have helped, understandable though it was.\nApplying the basketball-as-chemistry theory, I expect the Celtics to go all the way. They may melt a bit in a game or few, but they&#8217;re more hardened than the Heat, which comes from having defeated two teams—the Atlanta Hawks and the Philadelphia 76ers—with relatively low melting points. And I think both the Mavs and the Warriors have lower melting points than either the Celtics or the Heat.\nBut we&#8217;ll see.\nThrough the final two rounds, look at each game as a chemistry experiment. See how well the theory works.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;",

        "description": "(3/13) “Three months later I’m out at a club with a friend. It’s 2 AM. I’m getting tired, so I say I’m going home. He pulls out a key and says: ‘sniff this.’ I’d never done a drug in my life, not even weed. Not even once. But I figured I’d be dead in two years anyway, so I said fuck it. One sniff. And that’s all it took. Meth makes you feel invincible. It erases all your insecurities. The perfect drug for a guy like me, hiding a secret like I was hiding. But it wasn’t cheap like today. And when you really want something, but you can’t afford it, there’s only one option. At first I was just selling to stay high, but I have to be the best at whatever I do. Not a bad quality when you’re managing a 5-star restaurant. Horrible quality when you’re selling meth. I went from a quarter-gram, to a gram, to an ounce, to a kilogram. Never violent, never hurt nobody. But the drug turned me into a sociopathic scumbag. I’d rip people off, and not give them their drugs. I’d get 57 parking tickets on a car I was borrowing. I withdrew from all my friends, all my family. My mother never gave up on me, I will say that. She’s relentless. It was four years of unanswered voicemails: ‘Why are you doing this? What are you running from? Why, why, why?’ There were no voicemails from my father. But I did see him once, at the garden shop. I’d lost 20 lbs. I hadn’t shaved. I hadn’t showered. He said: ‘Whatcha doin’ Johnny? You’re breaking your mother’s heart.’ And that was it. He could never tell me that I was breaking his heart too, because that would require an expression of emotion. But I didn’t care. I didn’t care about anything. I wasn’t even Johnny Gargano anymore; I was a taker. And every taker runs out of things to take, and people to take from. Takers end up in Room 911, with their face pressed against the carpet, and their hands cuffed behind their back. I’ll never forget when the Feds marched me out of the lobby, this 6’5” black guy walks up. He’s wearing a suit. He’s got a walkie talkie in his hand. He says: ‘Excuse me, are you John Gargano? You’re never allowed in a Lowes Hotel again.’ Even the cops laughed at that one. I said: ‘Bro, I’m going to jail for the rest of my life.’”",

        "description": "When I think back to my college friends and me, what a beautiful bubble we lived in! Don’t get me wrong. It wasn’t a fancy college—it was state school, and we were all from out of state. And we certainly weren’t rich kids: my friend J came from a Lower East Side single parent family, back when the Lower East Side was the Lower East Side.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe most comfortable of us came from middle class homes with a single professional breadwinner (engineer, dentist). Some of us had been caught in the American legal system as teenagers—although, as white teenagers, we’d had it comparatively easy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe’d all experienced prejudice, not only witnessing bigotry against friends, but coming up against it ourselves due to our ethnicity, or sexuality, or religion, or looks, or weight, or height, or comparative lack of athletic prowess, or disability, or the way we thought, or the way we talked, or what part of our town we lived in, or because we did well on tests, or because we did poorly on tests, or because of some other thing, or (usually) some multiple of the above.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn Pittsburgh, where Cadillacs were called Jew canoes, the kids who tolerated me in ninth grade called me Mini Kosher, and I was subjected to daily humiliations until I proved myself by getting arrested and becoming a low-level pot dealer. But I digress.\n\n\n\nWe weren’t rich or cheerleaders or jocks (not that those kids don’t have problems of their own), and we weren’t the kind of white kids White America approved of, but we were privileged as hell not only by skin color, but also&nbsp;because we were educated.&nbsp;Education should be a right and American public school was initially set up, however imperfectly and even accounting for the racial segregation and deep unfairness of the time, to make sure everybody, at least in principle, would be educated enough to read books, understand political issues sufficiently to participate in America’s representative democracy, take care of their children, earn a living, grill hot dogs in summer, and pay taxes—the good life.&nbsp;For the luckiest, those whose families cherished learning, those whose parents read to them, those who looked forward to a Saturday library visit to pick out new books to read (novels and history books and science books and science fiction novels and fantasy stories and books about insects and books about reptiles and books that shed at least some light on the thrilling secret mysteries of adult relationships)…\n\n\n\nThose who understood how to take tests so as to do well in school (which is a completely different thing from learning and retaining information), those whose parents encouraged reading and learning and cared and asked about grades and teachers, those with parents at least one of whom had time to spend with them, making them feel loved and safe, those who came from cultures where learning was cherished, so that their aunts and uncles talked about art and science and politics, and not just ball games and recipes&#8230;Those whose families strenuously opposed all racial and religious bigotry, who taught their kids to stand up for the underdog, those who taught their children to approach all others with love and respect (even when, in reality, approaching&nbsp;everyone&nbsp;with love and respect means you sometimes get bullied and ridiculed, because some people are damaged and hateful and will see your humanity as a weakness)…\n\n\n\nThose whose families (like all families) were far from perfect, but who somehow, despite failings and tragedies, instilled a love of learning or blew on a spark that was already present…\n\n\n\n…So that their kids could do well enough in high school to attend a college, even if they really wanted to run away and join a rock and roll band…\n\n\n\nAnd whether or not it was the most expensive or most competitive college in the land (it wasn’t), it was a place where they’d encounter other smart kids from different backgrounds and discover Truffaut and Bergman and stay up all night enthralled by great ideas or ridiculing them, cracking each other up, sleeping together, experiencing new levels of romance and heartbreak, discovering possibilities.\n\n\n\nThe ultimate privilege: having a sufficiently educated background to discover possibilities and think for yourself.\n\n\n\nIf only we all had that.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Judith\nThe post Education is its own privilege appeared first on Zeldman on Web and Interaction Design.",

Today, the Chicago White Sox will take on the Seattle Mariners in the third and final game of this set as they look for the series win. As we know, every game is important moving forward, so let’s take a quick look at the other AL Central action today, so we know what to keep an eye out for. \nThe Minnesota Twins will play two games at Yankee Stadium starting at 2:05 pm CT in a doubleheader. We are all Aaron Judge fans today. The Cleveland Guardians will play against the Kansas City Royals again tonight. Royals, please do us some good, even if it’s just for one game. I know it doesn’t mean anything at all, really, but I guess I should add the Detroit Tigers into this division analysis. They play the Los Angeles Angels. \nBack to our central focus, the team looks to rebound from a not-so-great game last night and come out strong this afternoon. \n\n\nPrior to today’s series finale at Seattle, the #WhiteSox reinstated right-handed pitcher Michael Kopech from the 15-day injured list and optioned right-hander Matt Foster to Class AAA Charlotte. Kopech will start this afternoon’s game vs. the Mariners at T-Mobile Park.— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nBefore today’s game, Michael Kopech was reinstated from the injured list as Matt Foster returned to Charlotte. \nKopech will make the start today, whos 4-9 with a 3.58 ERA and 1.21 WHIP. He looked dominant to start the season but has been struck with little injuries in the second half of the season. His last outing shouldn’t really count as his last outing, but it was against the Kansas City Royals, where he started the game but didn’t record an out before being pulled. Unfortunately, he got tagged with four earned runs from that and had two walks. He uses four pitches, with his fastball being used the most at 61.8%. He follows with a slider (26.7%), curveball (10.4%), and changeup (1.2%). \nThe Mariners will trot out Luis Castillo. The righty has a 6-5 record with a 2.71 ERA and 1.07 WHIP. He also has 133 strikeouts in 122 2⁄3 innings pitched. The two-time All-Star spent his entire career with the Cincinnati Reds before being traded to the Mariners this trade deadline. He was a huge acquisition for their starting rotation, but let’s just hope we can get some runs across against him. He also relies on four pitches, including his fastball, which is thrown 31.9%. He also uses his changeup (23.9%), sinker (23.8%), and slider (20.4%). \n\n\nToday's #WhiteSox starters in Seattle.⏰: 3:10 p.m. CT : @NBCSChicago  : @ESPN1000  : @FDSportsbook  : O/U 3 CWS Total Runs pic.twitter.com/NAVi1wfGlj— Chicago White Sox (@whitesox) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nElvis Andrus continues to lead it off, followed by Yoán Moncada at third and José Abreu at first. Eloy Jiménez will DH, and Gavin Sheets and Andrew Vaughn will take the outfield corners. AJ Pollock is in center, Josh Harrison is at second, and Seby Zavala is behind the plate. \n\n\nFolks, we’re firing up PowerPoint today. It’s Work from the Ballpark Day at @TMobilePark, so we have to make it look like we’re getting some work done... we’ll see how this goes. Anyways, here’s our starting lineup! pic.twitter.com/NSMtS1q3qG— Seattle Mariners (@Mariners) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Mariners are honestly cool. Their version of the starting lineup is in the form of a video today. \nGame time is at 3:10 pm CT. Watch on NBCSCHI and listen in at ESPN1000.",

        "link": "https://torrentfreak.com/cloudflare-rejects-role-as-internet-or-piracy-police-220901/",
        "description": "In 2017, Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince decided to terminate the account of the controversial neo-Nazi site Daily Stormer.\n“I woke up this morning in a bad mood and decided to kick them off the Internet,” he wrote at the time.\nThe company’s lawyers later explained that the move was meant as an “intellectual exercise” to start a conversation regarding censorship and free speech on the internet. However, external parties took this discussion in a different direction than the one Prince had planned.\nFor years, Cloudflare had a policy not to remove any accounts without a court order, so when it kicked out Daily Stormer and later 8Chan as well, eyebrows were raised. For example, copyright holders wondered why the company could terminate these accounts but not those of the most notorious pirate sites.\nCloudflare&#8217;s seemingly arbitrary termination choices were repeatedly cited in policy discussions and copyright litigation. In addition, it triggered an ongoing wave of termination requests.\nOver the past few days, Cloudflare found itself in the midst of a &#8216;cancel&#8217; discussion again, with people calling on the company to disconnect the harassment-linked forum Kiwi Farms. This prompted Matthew Prince to clarify the company&#8217;s stance on offensive, abhorrent, and copyright-infringing content. \nNo More Voluntary Terminations\nThe company makes a clear distinction between the various services it offers. When Cloudflare is the primary hosting platform it leaves plenty of room for voluntary terminations. For its CDN, security, and core Internet infrastructure services, voluntary actions will no longer happen.\nThis strict line in the sand is the result of discussions with policymakers worldwide. Cloudflare sees itself as an Internet utility that should remain as neutral as possible, even when its customers do despicable things.\n&#8220;Just as the telephone company doesn&#8217;t terminate your line if you say awful, racist, bigoted things, we have concluded in consultation with politicians, policy makers, and experts that turning off security services because we think what you publish is despicable is the wrong policy. \n&#8220;To be clear, just because we did it in a limited set of cases before doesn’t mean we were right when we did. Or that we will ever do it again,&#8221; Prince adds, referring to the earlier terminations. \nWave of Requests\nWhile many people applauded Cloudflare for booting out The Daily Stormer and 8Chan, these decisions were actively used against the company. Not just by copyright holders, but also by authoritarian regimes. \n&#8220;In a deeply troubling response, after both terminations we saw a dramatic increase in authoritarian regimes attempting to have us terminate security services for human rights organizations — often citing the language from our own justification back to us.&#8221;\nAs we suggested back in 2017, Cloudflare essentially handed out free ammunition to adversaries, who could use the voluntary terminations as an argument to request more restrictions. That includes kicking out pirate sites. \nCloudflare is clearly uncomfortable with this position. The company stresses that voluntary terminations will no longer happen for sites that use its CDN or security services. Instead, those demanding action will need to get a court order. \nSlippery Termination Slope\nIn recent years various courts have already ordered Cloudflare to block pirate sites. The company has complied with these orders. However, it vows to fight cases where core infrastructure is at play with tooth and nail. This includes a recent order in Italy, that required the company to block pirate sites on its public DNS resolver 1.1.1.1.\n&#8220;Unfortunately, these cases are becoming more common where largely copyright holders are attempting to get a ruling in one jurisdiction and have it apply worldwide to terminate core Internet technology services and effectively wipe content offline,&#8221; Prince writes.\nThese global injunctions would set a dangerous precedent, Cloudflare&#8217;s CEO says, as it would allow the most restrictive regimes to control what content should be available online. Preventing bad precedents is the prime reason why Cloudflare believes it is important not to intervene voluntarily in the future.\n&#8220;Holding this line we believe is fundamental for the healthy operation of the global Internet. But each showing of discretion across our security or core Internet technology services weakens our argument in these important cases.&#8221;\nIn other words, Prince doesn&#8217;t want another Daily Stormer or 8Chan that can come back to haunt the company in the future. This means that The Pirate Bay and other pirate customers have little to worry about, at least for the time being.\nUpdate September 4: Cloudflare booted Kiwi Farms after all&#8230;\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "I did a lot of shooting recently with a rented Sony FE 70-200mm F2.8 GM OSS II lens, mounted on my 2013-vintage Sony a7r camera. One result was the hummingbird above, which you&#8217;ll find among the collections here and here. Also, here&#8217;s a toddler&#8230;\n\n&#8230;and a grandma (right after she starred as the oldest alumnus at a high school reunion I where I took hundreds of other shots):\n\nThis lens is new, sharp, versatile, earns good reviews (e.g. here) and is so loved already that it&#8217;s hard to get, despite the price: more than $3k after taxes. And, though it&#8217;s very compact and light (2.3 lbs) for what it is and does, the thing is big:\n\nSo I ordered one, which Amazon won&#8217;t charge me for before it ships, on May 23, for delivery on the 24th.\nBut I&#8217;m having second, third, and fourth thoughts, which I just decided to share here.\nFirst, I&#8217;m not a fine art photographer. I&#8217;m an amateur who mostly shoots people and subjects that interest me, such as what I can see out airplane windows, or choose to document for my own odd purposes—such as archiving photos of broadcast towers and antennas, most of which will fall out of use over the next two decades, after being obsolesced by the Internet, wi-fi and 5G.\nAll the photos I publish are Creative Commons licensed to encourage use by others, which is why more than 1600 of them have found their way into Wikimedia Commons. Some multiple of those accompany entries in Wikipedia. This one, for example, is in 9 different Wikipedia entries in various languages:\n\nHere is the original, shot with a tiny Canon pocket camera I pulled from the pocket of my ski jacket.\nIn other words, maybe I&#8217;ll be better off with a versatile all-in-one camera that will do much of what this giant zoom does, plus much more.\nAfter much online research, I&#8217;ve kind of settled on considering the Sony Cyber-shot DSC-RX10 IV. It has a smaller sensor than I&#8217;d like, but it is exceptionally versatile and gets great reviews. While my Sony a7r with its outstanding 24-105mm f/4 FE G OSS lens is versatile as well, and light for a full-frame DSLR, I really need a long lens for a lot of the stuff I shoot. And I suspect this &#8220;bridge&#8221; camera will do the job.\nSo here is the choice:\n\nLeave the order stand, and pay $3k for a fully fabulous 70-200 zoom that I&#8217;m sure to love but will be too big to haul around in many of the settings where I&#8217;ll be shooting.\nCancel that order, and instead pay half that for the DSC-RX10 IV—and get it in time for my trip to Hawaii next week.\n\n[Later&#8230;] I decided to let the order stand. Two reasons. First, I&#8217;ve shot a couple thousand photos so far with the 70-200 zoom, and find it a near-flawless instrument that I enjoy playing. One reason I do is that it&#8217;s as close to uncompromising as a lens can be—especially a zoom, which by design involves many compromises. Second, I&#8217;ve never played with the DSC-RX10 IV, and that&#8217;s kind of a prerequisite. I also know that one of its compromises I won&#8217;t be able to overcome is the size of its sensor. I know megapixels are a bit of a head trip, but they do matter, and 36.4 Mpx vs 20.1 &#8220;effective&#8221; Mpx is non-trivial.\nAdditionally, I may choose in the long run to also get an a7iv camera, so my two lenses will have two bodies. We&#8217;ll see.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;",

        "description": "(2/13) “My life of crime came to an end in Room 911 of the Philadelphia Lowes Hotel. Room 911. That was the Feds fucking with me. I hadn’t been in the room for 5 minutes when there was a knock on the door. A voice said: ‘Housekeeping.’ But I knew: ‘That’s not fucking housekeeping.’ Nine guys bust in carrying every type of gun known to man. And that was the end. Part of me was glad it was over. I’d become a scumbag. A complete, sociopathic scumbag. But before any of this happened, Johnny Gargano was a pretty good person. I really believe that. Not the most emotional guy. Not the most expressive guy, but certainly not a scumbag. I believed in right and wrong. I’d bring baskets of vegetables to my friends’ mothers. I was a freaking altar boy for ten years. Not saying that means anything, those child molesting fucks. But with all things considered: a pretty good person. Then one afternoon I’m taking a nap on the couch, and there’s a knock on the door. It’s the Fed-Ex guy, with a package from the health insurance company. It says my application for coverage has been denied. Now there were only six reasons you could be denied. The first five were crazy bugs in Africa. I was a farm boy from New Jersey; I’d never been to Africa in my life. So that left the sixth thing: HIV Positive. How did I get it? Some things in life are nobody’s business. Not then, not now. It’s taken me 25 years to even talk about my diagnosis. I come from an old school Italian family where nobody talks about nothing, especially the men. Everything gets swept under the rug. Could all of this been avoided with a conversation? Who knows. But I didn’t know how to have it. I couldn’t handle the stigma. I couldn’t handle the shame.  At the time I had a garden shop, with thirty greenhouses; I left them all behind. I packed up my shit and moved to Philadelphia. This was 1997; there were no miracle drugs back then. I thought 100 percent for sure I was going to die. I didn’t know exactly what was going to happen to me, but I knew it wasn’t going to be pretty. I felt like I’d just been ejected from a roller coaster, and I said: ‘Fuck it. I’m going to do whatever the fuck I want before I hit the ground.”",

        "description": "With thousands of piracy sites operating online today, the overall chances of being targeted by the Alliance for Creativity and Entertainment are still relatively small.\nBut that presumes that all sites are equal and ACE picks victims randomly, which is certainly not the case. There will always be good reasons behind an action, they just aren&#8217;t made public.\nOn one hand, ACE is likely to have bigger, longer-term projects, with strategic or even political goals in mind. On the other, it may want to stop emerging sites from gaining momentum and repopulating a niche. But if a site has a million or more visits per month and ACE has spotted a point of leverage, the odds suddenly start to shift. \nLast week German news publication Tarnkappe reported that at least three domains belonging to HDFilme, a streaming site with around 12 million monthly visits, had suddenly started redirecting to the ACE anti-piracy portal. A similar redirect was seen on xCine, a streaming platform that had been enjoying more than four million visits per month in its own right.\nACE Confirms Shutdown of Both Streaming Sites\nIn an announcement this week, ACE confirmed it was behind the closure of both sites, which specialized in mainstream movies and TV shows directed at the German-speaking market. \n&#8220;HDFilme, xCine, and seven associated domains that had been operating since 2019, provided illegal access to more than 23,000 movies and an estimated 100,000 television series episodes; they attracted over 16 million visitors monthly,&#8221; the ACE statement reads.\nACE doesn&#8217;t detail specific domains but Tarnkappe previously reported that HDFilme domains hdfilme.io, hdfilme.tv, and hdfilme.cx were affected. We&#8217;re now able to add at least two others to the list &#8211; hdfilme.net and hdfilme.cc.\nThe main domain of xCine (xCine.me) was an obvious target for ACE, but it appears the site had another domain with minimal but growing traffic. After receiving attention from ACE, xCine.tv won&#8217;t be making any more gains. But that&#8217;s only six domains and ACE mentioned seven.\nLinking Domains Helps Investigations\nNo single piece of information allows a group like ACE to take down two popular sites, but site operators can make it easier for investigators to move to the next piece of the puzzle. \nIn this case, the operator behind HDFilme used one Google Analytics account across several domains, some related to piracy, others seemingly not. Running down that list of domains reveals Watchmoviehd.org and perhaps as expected, that also redirects to the ACE portal.\nCoincidentally or not, several new HDFilme-themed domains were registered in July and August. Who registered them is unclear but overall there are at least 170 similarly-named domains on record. The domains xCine.me and xCine.tv were also linked through the use of one analytics account but gave less information away.\nHDFilme and xCine Operated Out of Vietnam\nACE says that HDFilme and xCine were run from Vietnam by the same person, who was identified via legal actions in Europe and &#8220;cross-regional&#8221; investigative work. The anti-piracy group says the operation to shut the sites down was the first of its kind in the country.\n&#8220;Our focus on Vietnam is a key part of our ongoing efforts to reduce piracy in the Asia Pacific region and throughout the global creative ecosystem,” says Jan van Voorn, Executive Vice President and Chief of Global Content Protection for the Motion Picture Association and Head of ACE.\n&#8220;ACE will continue to target the operators of Vietnam-based piracy services who put consumers at risk of egregious malware, undermine investment into the country, reduce tax contributions to government, and stifle creativity.&#8221;\nMPA: Vietnam Has a Big Piracy Problem\nIn its submission to a 2022 report on foreign trade barriers, the MPA described the online piracy situation as &#8220;rampant&#8221; and the response to infringement in the country as &#8220;ineffective&#8221;.\n&#8220;Vietnam is host to some of the most egregious piracy sites and services in the world. These piracy sites inflict damage not only on the local marketplace but just as often harm MPA productions from around the world,&#8221; the MPA said.\n&#8220;Regardless of extensive evidence of serious infringement provided by rightsholders, there has traditionally been a lack of coordination and transparency among related ministries and agencies and a seeming lack of government commitment to ensure effective enforcement of copyright protection.&#8221;\nThe popularity of HDFilme and xCine probably made them attractive to ACE in their own right. But throw a lead from Europe and a political hot potato into the mix, suddenly there&#8217;s a strategic target. The one that Hollywood really wants is FMovies, but whether Vietnam is ready for that is another story.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

Like checking my postal mail. The mail carrier used to think I was away from home, traveling. Nope, just scared to open the mailbox.\n\n\n\nToday, I will tackle a series of important tasks I must get done before nightfall. I cannot avoid or postpone them. I’ve already tried bargaining, rationalizing, and pleading with myself, but was unable to find a loophole. What’s gotta be, gotta be. \n\n\n\nBy the end of this day, I will have done it all.\nThe post Walking Through Fear appeared first on Zeldman on Web and Interaction Design.",

        "description": "(1/13) “It’s time for the show. When those doors open at 5 o’clock, it’s showtime. I tell that to every member of my staff, it doesn’t matter how you feel: you could be hungover, you could be facing eviction, your girlfriend could be home in bed with the neighbor. None of that has anything to do with the first guest who walks in the door, who chose this restaurant instead of 10000 others, because of its 21-year reputation for impeccable service. How do we make that person feel? That’s the essence of hospitality. And when you’ve spent a good portion of your life caged up like a monkey, eating food marked ‘not for human consumption,’ you might be a little extra attuned to how people feel. I’ll never forget the day of my sentencing. Worst judge in the Southern District. A living embodiment of the arrogance of the entire criminal justice system. First time I met him he had a golf club in his hands, and he’s putting golf balls across the courtroom floor. He says: ‘We going to trial today?’ Doesn’t even look up. It’s like I wasn’t even there. And after my trial, when that motherfucker said 240 months, I lifted my hands, started counting on my fingers, and divided 240 by 12. Twenty years. For a first-time offender. That’s when the rage started. But I didn’t know where to direct it. At Congress? For passing a mandatory minimum for drug offenses? At the scumbag with the golf club? I looked at my public defender, and she just shrugs. I look at the prosecutor, and she says: ‘I’m sorry Mr. Gargano, it’s the law.’ She wasn’t sorry. I was just another point on her scorecard. Bottled water, a day-old newspaper, meant to be thrown away. Inmate #56134066. That’s all I was to any of them. She’s going to come in here one day, the prosecutor who put me away. I’ve seen her name come up twice in our reservation system, but she’s cancelled each time. But one day she’ll come. I’ll walk up her to her table. I’ll say: ‘First time here?’, and I’ll hand her my card. I want to watch her face when she sees the name. She’ll probably say: ‘I heard what happened. I’m so happy for you.’ It’s nothing but a show. Really she’ll be thinking: ‘Wow. This motherfucker really did it.’”",

        "title": "Laws of Identity",
        "link": "https://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2022/05/10/laws-of-identity/",
        "description": "When digital identity ceases to be a pain in the ass, we can thank Kim Cameron and his Seven Laws of Identity, which he wrote in 2004, formally published in early 2005, and gently explained and put to use until he died late last year. Today, seven of us will take turns explaining each of Kim&#8217;s laws at KuppingerCole&#8216;s EIC conference in Berlin. We&#8217;ll only have a few minutes each, however, so I&#8217;d like to visit the subject in a bit more depth here.\nTo understand why these laws are so important and effective, it will help to know where Kim was coming from in the first place. It wasn&#8217;t just his work as the top architect for identity at Microsoft (to which he arrived when his company was acquired). Specifically, Kim was coming from two places. One was the physical world where we live and breathe, and identity is inherently personal. The other was the digital world where what we call identity is how we are known to databases. Kim believed the former should guide the latter, and that nothing like that had happened yet, but that we could and should work for it.\nKim&#8217;s The Laws of Identity paper alone is close to seven thousand words, and his IdentityBlog adds many thousands more. But his laws by themselves are short and sweet. Here they are, with additional commentary by me, in italics.\n1. User Control and Consent\nTechnical identity systems must only reveal information identifying a user with the user’s consent.\nNote that consent goes in the opposite direction from all the consent &#8220;agreements&#8221; websites and services want us to click on. This matches the way identity works in the natural world, where each of us not only chooses how we wish to be known, but usually with an understanding about how that information might be used.\n2. Minimun Disclosure for a Constrained Use\nThe solution which discloses the least amount of identifying information and best limits its use is the most stable long term solution.\nThere is a reason we don&#8217;t walk down the street wearing name badges: because the world doesn&#8217;t need to know any more about us than we wish to disclose. Even when we pay with a credit card, the other party really doesn&#8217;t need (or want) to know the name on the card. It&#8217;s just not something they need to know.\n3. Justifiable Parties\nDigital identity systems must be designed so the disclosure of identifying information is limited to parties having a necessary and justifiable place in a given identity relationship.\nIf this law applied way back when Kim wrote it, we wouldn&#8217;t have the massive privacy losses that have become the norm, with unwanted tracking pretty much everywhere online—and increasingly offline as well. \n4. Directed Identity\nA universal identity system must support both “omni-directional” identifiers for use by public entities and “unidirectional” identifiers for use by private entities, thus facilitating discovery while preventing unnecessary release of correlation handles.\nAll brands, meaning all names of public entities, are &#8220;omni-directional.&#8221; They are also what Kim calls &#8220;beacons&#8221; that have the opposite of something to hide about who they are. Individuals, however, are private first, and public only to the degrees they wish to be in different circumstances. Each of the first three laws are &#8220;unidirectional.&#8221;\n5. Pluralism of Operators and Technologies\nA universal identity system must channel and enable the inter-working of multiple identity technologies run by multiple identity providers.\nThis law expresses learnings from Microsoft&#8217;s failed experiment with Passport and a project called &#8220;Hailstorm.&#8221; The idea with both was for Microsoft to become the primary or sole online identity provider for everyone. Kim&#8217;s work at Microsoft was all about making the company one among many working in the same broad industry.\n6. Human Integration\nThe universal identity metasystem must define the human user to be a component of the distributed system integrated through unambiguous human-machine communication mechanisms offering protection against identity attacks.\nAs Kim put it in his 2019 (and final) talk at EIC, we need to turn the Web &#8220;right side up,&#8221; meaning putting the individual at the top rather than the bottom, with each of us in charge of our lives online, in distributed homes of our own. That&#8217;s what will integrate all the systems we deal with. (Joe Andrieu first explained this in 2007, here.)\n7. Consistent Experience Across Contexts\nThe unifying identity metasystem must guarantee its users a simple, consistent experience while enabling separation of contexts through multiple operators and technologies.\nSo identity isn&#8217;t just about corporate systems getting along with each other. It&#8217;s about giving each of us scale across all the entities we deal with. Because it&#8217;s our experience that will make identity work right, finally, online. \nI expect to add more as the conference goes on; but I want to get this much out there to start with.\nBy the way, the photo above is from the first and only meeting of the Identity Gang, at Esther Dyson&#8217;s PC Forum in 2005. The next meeting of the Gang was the first Internet Identity Workshop, aka IIW, later that year. We&#8217;ve had 34 more since then, all with hundreds of participants, all with great influence on the development of code, standards, and businesses in digital identity and adjacent fields. And all guided by Kim&#8217;s Laws.\n&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://torrentfreak.com/court-orders-telegram-to-disclose-personal-details-of-pirating-users-220831/",
        "description": "With over half a billion active users, Telegram is one on the most used messaging services.\nThe application is particularly popular in India, where more than 20% of its user base resides. This includes a small subset of rather persistent pirates. \nTelegram doesn&#8217;t permit copyright infringement and generally takes swift action in response. This includes the removal of channels that are dedicated to piracy. For some copyright holders that&#8217;s not enough, as new &#8216;pirate&#8217; channels generally surface soon after. \nRemoving Channels is Not Enough\nTo effectively protect their content, rightsholders want to know who runs these channels. This allows them to take action against the actual infringers and make sure that they stop pirating. This argument is the basis of an infringement lawsuit filed in 2020. \nThe case in question was filed by Ms. Neetu Singh and KD Campus. The former is the author of various books, courses, and lectures, for which the latter runs coaching centers. \nBoth rightsholders have repeatedly complained to Telegram about channels that shared pirated content. In most cases, Telegram took these down, but the service refused to identify the infringers. As such, the rightsholders asked the court to intervene.\nTelegram Has to Identify Pirates\nThe legal battle culminated in the Delhi High Court this week via an order compelling Telegram to identify several copyright-infringing users. This includes handing over phone numbers, IP addresses, and email addresses.\nThe order was issued despite fierce opposition. One of Telegram&#8217;s main defenses was that the user data is stored in Singapore, which prohibits the decryption of personal information under local privacy law. \nThe Court disagrees with this argument, as the ongoing infringing activity is related to Indian works and will likely be tied to Indian users. And even if the data is stored elsewhere, it could be accessed from India.\n&#8220;Courts in India would be perfectly justified in directing Telegram, which runs its massive operations in India to adhere to Indian law and adhere to orders passed by Indian Courts for disclosure of relevant information relating to infringers,&#8221; the Court writes.  \n&#8220;Infringers cannot be permitted to seek shelter under Telegram’s policies merely on the ground that its physical server is in Singapore.&#8221;\nDisclosing the personal information would not be a violation of Singapore&#8217;s privacy law either, the High Court adds, pointing out that there is an exception if personal details are needed for investigation or proceedings.\nFreedom of Expression and Intermediary Protection\nTelegram also brought up the Indian constitution, which protects people&#8217;s privacy, as well as the right to freedom of speech and expression. However, that defense was unsuccessful too. \n&#8220;The right to freedom of speech or the right to life including the right to privacy cannot be used by any person or entity, let alone an infringer, in order to escape the consequences of illegal actions,&#8221; the Court concludes.\nFinally, Telegram argued that it is not required to disclose the details of its users because the service merely acts as an intermediary. \nAgain, the Court disagrees. Simply taking infringing channels offline isn&#8217;t good enough in this situation, since infringers can simply launch new ones, as if nothing had happened. \n&#8220;Merely disabling or taking down channels upon information being given to Telegram is an insufficient remedy,&#8221; the court writes, adding that these channels are &#8220;clearly hydra-headed&#8221; because pirates can start over with ease.\n&#8212;\nA full copy of the order from the Delhi High Court is available here (pdf), courtesy of Bar and Bench. \nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "(15/15) “I used to smoke sweet tips, because I thought they were feminine. But I’ve learned I like heavier cigars. I’ve learned a lot about myself these past few years. I was put in charge of hiring for our entire company. I’ve produced my own play. My bracelet is so full of charms that Garrison had to buy me another. And that one’s half-way full too. I downloaded a dating app for seniors, called Our Time. I said: ‘Lord, you designed the body. I’m losing my ever-loving mind, so I hope you understand.’ I just wanted to see what was out there. And let me tell you, there’s a lot out there. I’ve tried all the flavors: Bangladesh, Egyptian, Hispanic, African. The whole smorgasbord. I’ve dated about seventy men. And I’ve had four marriage proposals, because what I bring to the table is rich. But right now I’m on a little bit of a break from romance. I’m taking time with myself. But that’s a romance too. It’s a love that’s lacy. It’s light filtering through the leaves. It’s not harsh sun, but it’s oh-so-warm. For 55 years I never liked myself much. But now when I hear people describe me, I like that woman. I’ve worked hard on her. I might be a little quirky. Truth be told I’ve sat down and pondered if I’m batshit crazy. But I decided no, I just hover over crazy, then I flit away. Like a hummingbird. Back in Arkansas I’d hang out feeders for the hummingbirds. I’d watch em’ all day. So I don’t mind being hummingbird crazy. I can be colorful, and dance, and sing, and make mistakes. I’m not hurting anybody. I’m not taking anybody else’s oxygen. I’ve got my own space. In the evening I like to set my chair out on the sidewalk, turn on my Bluetooth speaker, light my cigar. I never just stick the fire to it. I go around all the edges, and let it breathe a little. Until there’s no dead spots. Until I’ve pulled all the life into the it. Then I sit back, take a deep breath, and watch Harlem walk by. I smoke slow. It’ll take me two hours to finish. And I’ve made myself a playlist that lasts just that long: Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Bruno Mars. Everything has an order. And when that last song starts playing, it’s time to go home.

        "description": "The popularity of user-generated content sites like YouTube has led to millions of regular people becoming proud content creators in their own right.\nSince YouTube content creators are also copyright holders, this can lead to a new perspective on the purpose of copyright law. To keep things running smoothly, content creators also need to respect any copyrights held by others.\nNot doing so could lead to copyright complaints from third parties. If YouTube users receive three complaints, their accounts could be permanently suspended, taking all videos, views, subscribers, even creative momentum away. Fortunately, most careful YouTubers never experience copyright problems.\nBut out of nowhere, disaster can still strike.\n\nThe message above was received by YouTuber John Hammond just this week. In common with similar emails received by other YouTubers recently, it mentions a genuine video he created and uploaded to YouTube. It even cites the correct YouTube URL.\nBut Hammond is not just a YouTuber, he&#8217;s also a cybersecurity researcher, and this didn&#8217;t feel right.\nClever Opening Shot &#8211; But Not That Clever\nBy including genuine information in the message and coupling that with the genuine fear of account loss, the scammers hoped that panic would lead to urgency, and that urgency would lead to less scrutiny. Hammond didn&#8217;t panic, he knew his video didn&#8217;t violate copyright.\nThe message was sent to Hammond via Google Drive, in PDF format. YouTube would never do that. Warnings appear in users&#8217; YouTube accounts so viewing them there is always the best option &#8211; unless you&#8217;re a cybersecurity guy with a penchant for rabbit holes.\nHammond followed up by doing what the message asked. He clicked the &#8216;Open Full Report&#8217; button for more information and found himself transported to an obviously-not-YouTube URL, with his email address tagged on the end. This is rarely a good thing.\n\nHammond found that the destination site acted differently depending on the user&#8217;s browser (such as Chrome or Firefox) but eventually redirected to files stored on Dropbox.\nNeedless to say, YouTube doesn&#8217;t deliver files to its users like that.\nBeware of Unnecessary Links, Multiple Downloads\nBy this point, Hammond was supposed to believe that YouTube communicates with creators via Google Drive, using a Gmail account, in questionable English. According to the text in the notification above, he was also supposed to believe that YouTube hadn&#8217;t yet decided whether he should get strike or not.\nThis ray of hope draws the target&#8217;s attention towards the outcome of the supposed copyright &#8216;moderation&#8217; process and away from the bogus copyright notice. Given the warning&#8217;s claim that any decision will stand if the user doesn&#8217;t read the full report, one can imagine that some might be tempted.\nAfter clicking &#8216;Open Full Report&#8217; for entirely different reasons, Hammond was served with a file that had been hosted by the attackers on Dropbox. It was named &#8220;YouTube Copyright Report&#8221; and came with a ZIP extension, meaning that extraction would take place on the user&#8217;s machine. \nIn general, users should be extremely cautious of files that appear on their machines as part of a process they didn&#8217;t initiate themselves, especially when the event comes out of the blue. Never trust a stranger bearing ZIPs, it rarely ends well.\n\nUsing Process Monitor on Windows 11 (inside a VM), Hammond found that the file tried to discover device information, checked if any anti-virus was running, and then repeatedly tried to contact what appeared to be an IP address in Finland.\nConclusion: RedLine Stealer Malware\nWe looked a little closer at the Finland-linked IP address and found a lot of interest in Russia, a characteristic it shares with the domain previously highlighted by John Hammond in the URL containing his email address. In respect of the latter, many other similar domains are linked and could be just as malicious, but something else caught our eye too.\nAfter tests on the domains and IP addresses, we discovered similar URLs containing other people&#8217;s email addresses and usernames. We were able to directly link one of the email addresses to an active YouTuber who may have been targeted with a similar bogus copyright complaint. \nWe haven&#8217;t received a response to the warning email we sent him earlier but the situation is potentially very serious. Hopefully he bailed on the process early enough.\n\nWhile technically experienced YouTubers may not fall for this kind of scam, it&#8217;s not difficult to see how someone who really values their YouTube channel might act emotionally in the heat of the moment. \nThat being said, the scam cannot survive when a user has a clear understanding of YouTube&#8217;s &#8216;strike&#8217; system and the methods used by the platform to communicate problems. Becoming familiar with these processes isn&#8217;t difficult but if there&#8217;s any doubt, log into YouTube, read any messages and before clicking anything, ask someone. \nNothing is so urgent it can&#8217;t wait, despite what the scammers say.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "Back when I was in advertising, one of my team’s clients was a well-known Irish Airline. They could only afford an 1/8th-page ad in the travel section of the paper. But my partners and I didn’t think creativity was dependent on budget. We were determined to deliver great ads for them—ads that would make a viewer look, even though the ad was tiny and was surrounded by other ads.So we created a standout campaign for them—the kind that would not simply be noticed, but would also make travel-focused consumers smile and encourage them to buy tickets.We blew up our tiny layouts and mounted the enlargements on illustration board, for an impactful creative presentation when we met to show the client the work.The great day came. The work was good, and we had rehearsed our presentation to perfection. We booked the conference room, had the client’s favorite snacks and beverages spread out when they arrived, and sold our little hearts out as we presented.Silence.The lead client blinked, cleared his throat, and finally said, in a thick Irish brogue:“I’m afraid it’s far too clever for our needs. It calls too much attention to itself on the page,” he explained—as if getting a distracted newspaper reader to notice his company’s message was a bad thing.The lead client asked us to set “Ireland $399” in bold type, stick a shamrock in one of the 9s, and call it a day.  Fear of getting noticed is a terrible thing. It’s also a self-fulfilling prophecy. Clickbait headlines get a deservedly bad rap in digital marketing, but you know what else should get a bad rap? Blind, boring, infinitely ignorable links and titles, that’s what.Crafting messages that get noticed and acted upon by their intended audience—the people for whom you create your company’s digital products in the first place—isn’t a crime. It’s your job. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHat tip to Mark Mazut and Tim Irwin, my fellow passengers on the above disaster. Bit o’ nostalgia for those who remember The Ad Graveyard. \nThe post Fear of getting noticed appeared first on Zeldman on Web and Interaction Design.",

        "description": "(14/15) “Lucas volunteered to bring up all my stuff from the storage unit in Arkansas. He was supposed to arrive on a Monday, so the following Sunday I scheduled a final performance of ‘One Woman’s Journey To Love.’ I wanted it to be a night to remember: my show, my songs, in my place, with my stuff. Unfortunately Lucas was delayed, and by the time he arrived we barely had time to get everything unloaded. On the night of the performance, the bathtub had stuff stacked up to the shower. Twenty-five people attended. The band set up in the kitchen, and I performed while standing in the hallway. There were some new songs in the mix: ‘My Way,’ and ‘Wild Horses,’ and ‘Raindrops Keep Falling on My Head.’ I sang a hymn for the first time. I’d never sang a hymn in my show before, because I hadn’t wanted to put people off. But it’s what I believe. So I sang ‘Lord I Need Thee Every Hour.’ At the end I gave a little monologue; I told the audience: ‘We are dealt so much in life that’s wrong. And we do so much that we wish we hadn’t. But you’re so much more than those things. You are beautiful, and you are needed in the world.’ Then I closed with ‘You Are So Beautiful,’ by Joe Cocker. Margaret stayed behind to drink a glass of wine after everyone left. We settled into the 14-foot sectional. And I started to look around, at all my stuff. Beneath my feet was the giant Oriental Rug my kids had given me one Christmas, they’d split the cost seven ways. There was my collection of antique Nancy Drew mysteries. There were my three pictures of curved bridges. The hurricane lamp, with a cardinal, that my daughter had given me. Because she knows how much I love little lights. My rooster plates, my rooster platter, the rooster lamp from Cracker Barrel. My upholstered coffee table. The drapes I’d sewn from my favorite fabric at Hobby Lobby. I’d waited weeks for it to go on sale. I never thought I could do a good job because we were so poor. But looking around at all this stuff, I realized something: it was beautiful. When it all came together, it was beautiful. Maybe I hadn’t been given many choices in life. But I always knew what beauty was. And even in the ugly, I created beauty.”",

        "description": "There&#8217;s no shortage of amazing games so far this year, but my personal favorite is an underdog: Perfect Tides, a &#8217;90s-esque point-and-click adventure about growing up as a teen on a sleepy island resort town in the early 2000s, finding an escape from real-life feelings of loneliness and loss in discussion forums and late-night AIM chats. \n\n\n\nMara and her friend Lily on the beach&#8230; definitely not on drugs\n\n\n\nThe first game from Meredith Gran, creator of the decade-long comic series Octopus Pie, it approaches challenging subjects with the confidence of someone who created narrative comics every week for ten years. I can&#8217;t think of another comics artist who has dived into game design like this, but it pays off with uniquely charming pixel art and animation, colorful writing, and a story that genuinely moved me by the end. It navigates complex feelings about family, old friends, and new loves, while also being genuinely funny.\n\n\n\nLet&#8217;s put it this way: I&#8217;ve been playing videogames for the last 35 years, but Perfect Tides is the first time I felt compelled to write a walkthrough (spoilers!) and actively participate in forums to help people finish it.\n\n\n\nThis is a long way of saying that you should play Perfect Tides on Steam or Itch, and then go back the Kickstarter for its sequel, Perfect Tides: Station to Station, which has only six days to go and still needs another $20,000 to cross the finish line. (Update: It hit the goal!)\n\n\n\n\n\nyou should probably go back this project\n\n\n\nBut you don&#8217;t have to take my word for it! Kotaku said the original game was &#8220;one of the year&#8217;s best,&#8221; the &#8220;kind of game you don’t even see coming, yet turns out to be incredible&#8221; and &#8220;perfectly captures the intensity and struggle of adolescence.&#8221; AV Club called it a &#8220;harrowing, funny, beautiful, horrifying, and ultimately reassuring work of art.&#8221; Polygon summed it up as &#8220;devastatingly honest.&#8221; My favorite review was from Buried Treasure&#8217;s John Walker, who wrote, &#8220;It is the most extraordinary exploration of what it is to be a teenager, told with such heart, such truth.&#8221;\n\n\n\nSpoilers Ahoy\n\n\n\nIf you&#8217;ve already played Perfect Tides, I want to mention two key moments that are so wonderful, and yet so easy to miss in your first playthrough, they&#8217;re worth replaying it for. THESE ARE SPOILERS!\n\n\n\nFirst, if you didn&#8217;t manage to patch things up with Lily, you missed a long sequence with her in the final season of the game. (To get the full experience of that sequence, you&#8217;ll need to find a specific MP3 and put into the game directory when prompted: a remarkable breaking-the-fourth-wall sidestep around copyright licensing that I&#8217;ve never seen in a game before.)\n\n\n\nSecond, there are two major endings. If it feels anticlimactic, you likely didn&#8217;t resolve your conflicts with Lily, Simon, and your family. There are 95 possible points, but you don&#8217;t need them all to get the best ending. Feel free to use my 100% completion guide for help getting there.\n\n\n\nPerfect Tides isn&#8217;t perfect. Like any classic point-and-click adventure, there are some clunky bits here and there, and you&#8217;ll likely need the occasional hint or glance at a playthrough to finish. But it&#8217;s so worth it.\n\n\n\nMara talks to an online friend",

        "description": "(13/15) “The first thing I did when I got a real paycheck was hire a real estate broker. I told him that I only had one requirement. He said: ‘Not in New York. Not at your price point.’ But I told him: ‘I’m a praying woman.’ Sure enough he called the very next day. He said: ‘You’re not going to believe this. But I found a place in Harlem.’ We went to see it that very night. It was a one-bedroom, right around the corner from a cigar shop. I walked straight into the living room, took out my tape measure, and measured the walls. 14 feet exactly, just big enough for my sectional. And I knew I was home. Lucas was so proud of me. And Garrison bought me a second charm for my bracelet. It was a little house, with ‘Home Sweet Home’ written on it. But my other children still weren’t speaking to me. After I moved in, I went on Facebook and printed out their photos. I put them all over the apartment. Because I wanted to feel like they were still part of my life. Their birthdays were always tough for me. So were the holidays. I’d never lived alone before, so I was dreading my first Christmas in the new apartment. I made sure to plan out my entire day: I was going to read all morning, cook some salmon for lunch, then crawl into bed at 4 PM to watch the Christmas Prince on Netflix. The plan was going great. When I finished my reading, I was so proud of myself. I thought: ‘I’m almost through Christmas Day.’ Then I looked at the clock and it was only 10:15 in the morning. And I lost it. I just lost it. I went through my whole apartment, and took down all the pictures of my children. I stuffed them in a drawer. I couldn’t face them. I felt like a horrible mother, and a hypocrite. For all those years I’d gone from church to church, teaching about marriage and motherhood. I told everyone: ‘Put Jesus first, others second, and yourself last.’ But that isn’t what I’d done. I moved to New York and put myself first. And now I had five kids that wouldn’t talk to me. The old feelings of guilt and shame started washing over me. I let myself go for a few minutes, but then I pulled myself back up. Jab with the left. Jab with the left. Cross with the right, and fuck that shit.”",

        "description": "In June, the US Copyright Claims Board was launched. \nThrough this venue, hosted at the US Copyright Office, rightsholders can try to recoup alleged damages outside the federal court system.\nJust over a hundred cases have been filed thus far, mostly by smaller independent creators, but some large companies have found their way to the board as well. \nMcDowell&#8217;s Copyright Troubles\nLate last week, Paramount Pictures filed a claim against JMC Pop Ups, which is known for its pop-up restaurants carrying movie or TV show themes. This includes a McDowell’s, modeled after the restaurant prominently featured in &#8220;Coming to America.&#8221;\nIn the movie, McDowell&#8217;s ran into copyright issues due to its similarities with the multi-billion dollar McDonald&#8217;s franchise. In this case, however, Paramount Pictures wants to protect the McDowell&#8217;s brand against an external threat.\nAccording to the claim, the restaurant copied a wide variety of copyrighted materials without permission.\n&#8220;In creating and marketing the Infringing Restaurant, JMC copied countless copyrighted materials from the works, including but not limited to the menu, the character names and likenesses, and the recreations of well-known McDowell’s restaurant from the Coming to America universe.\n&#8220;Specifically, the Infringing Restaurant’s menu used numerous well-known indicia of the Works, including the &#8216;Big Mick&#8217; with a &#8216;non-seed bun&#8217;,&#8221; the movie studio adds in its complaint. \nFrom the Menu\nAdvance Warnings\nThe legal action shouldn&#8217;t come as a surprise to JMC Pop Ups. For more than a year, Paramount&#8217;s lawyers have repeatedly reached out to the company, asking it to cease the allegedly infringing activity. \nThe restaurant owners didn&#8217;t believe that they had infringed Paramount&#8217;s rights. Instead, they announced plans to open a new McDowell&#8217;s in Springfield from May 20 to June 5. That announcement was a step too far for Paramount. \nAfter JMC failed to confirm that the event would be canceled, Paramount decided to take the matter to the Copyright Claims Board. The choice of venue shows that the movie studio is mostly concerned about stopping the infringements, as available damages are limited. \nParamount notes that the pop-up McDowell&#8217;s misleads the public, who may think that it&#8217;s an official Hollywood-backed venture, which it isn&#8217;t. This is all the more problematic because the food isn&#8217;t that great, according to some reviewers.\nFood Discomfort?\n&#8220;JMC misused Paramount Pictures’ intellectual property to deceive parents and children into believing that the Infringing Restaurant is affiliated with, or authorized by, Paramount Pictures.&#8221; \n&#8220;To make matters worse, the quality of the food is in serious question, as consumers have reported feeling discomfort after eating at the Infringing Restaurant,&#8221; Paramount Pictures adds.\nThrough the Copyright Claims Coard, the movie studio requests an award of $30,000 in statutory damages, the maximum available. In addition, it hopes to prevent any further infringements. \n&#8216;Creative Celebration&#8217;\nAttorney John Powell, who represents the restaurant, still believes that McDowell&#8217;s didn&#8217;t infringe on Paramount&#8217;s copyrights and trademarks. \n“The McDowell’s pop-up was a creative celebration of a fake restaurant,” the lawyer told the WSJ, adding that “JMC is disappointed by Paramount’s heavy-handed response to fans of its films.”\nParticipation in the Copyright Claims Board proceeding is not mandatory. JMC has the right to opt-out if it wishes to do so. Should that happen, Paramount can still take the matter to federal court where statutory copyright damages can reach $150,000 per work and legal fees are much higher. \nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "(12/15) “I was still in the shelter at Christmastime, so Garrison flew in from Arkansas to be with me. We ate a Christmas meal together. We went and looked at the windows on 5th Avenue. And right before he left to go home, Garrison gave me a small box, with a bracelet inside. On it there was a single charm, with the skyline of New York City. He told me: ‘This is your New Life Bracelet. And I’m going to get you a charm for every new accomplishment.’ From that day on—whenever things got hard, I’d twirl that charm between my fingers, and trust that things would get better. Every morning the shelter guard would wake me up at 3 AM, so I could catch the train to Brooklyn. I worked the opening shift at Starbucks. But I never minded. Loving on people has always been my favorite thing to do. I knew all my customers’ names. I’d memorized their orders. My favorite thing was when I got to write their name on the cup. I’d always draw a special little curve underneath, just to let them know they were special. One of my favorite customers was a man named Eric. He sometimes came in with his husband. And he was quick to grin, so whenever I had a break we would get to chatting. I had no idea what he did for work. But I told him the same thing that I told all my favorite customers: ‘If you know anybody who’s looking for a receptionist, keep me in mind.’ It turns out that Eric was the CEO of a consulting company, and he asked me to put together a resume. All I’d ever done was church work. So there wasn’t much to put on there, but in the end it didn’t matter. The interviewer told me that the office printer wasn’t working. He said: ‘Let’s not worry about your resume. Tell me your story instead.’ When I finished he asked if he could give me a hug. And they ended up creating a position just for me: HR Assistant. My starting pay was $50,000 a year, with benefits. A few days after I got hired, Eric took me out to coffee. He told me: ‘I know you think I got you this job, but I didn’t pull any strings. I handed them your resume, and all I said was: I have an unorthodox candidate.’”",

        "description": "Copyright holders are increasingly demanding that ISPs should block access to pirate sites in order to protect their business.\nThis is also the case in Australia, where blocking injunctions became commonplace in recent years. \nThus far, hundreds of sites have already been blocked. This includes many well-known players including The Pirate Bay, YTS, RARBG, Fmovies, and Flixtor. \nMore Blockades Incoming\nLast week, Netflix, Village Roadshow, and several Hollywood film studios filed a new site blocking request, their second blocking demand this year. The case lists all major Australian ISPs as defendants but the targeted domains have yet to be published publicly. \nThe Australian reports that the copyright holders identified 52 new pirate sites in their most recent push. The names of the sites aren&#8217;t mentioned but based on the five previous blocking lawsuits, it&#8217;s likely a mix of torrent, streaming, and linking portals. \nIt generally takes a few months for Australia&#8217;s Federal Court to hand down a decision. However, no major complications are expected as local ISPs generally don&#8217;t object. In the meantime, copyright holders are not sitting still.\n&#8216;Dynamic&#8217; Blocking Amendments\nIn addition to obtaining new blocking orders, Netflix, Disney, and the other rightsholders actively expand existing blockades. Just last week, the Federal Court granted an expansion to an injunction it handed down earlier this year. \nThe new order adds 18 new domain names, including Primewire.mx, Moviesjoy.sc, 123moviess.se, and Putlocker.vc. These new domains are all related to previously blocked sites, through their use of a similar domain name, for example.\n\nThe original order clarifies that these extensions can be used to target additional sites that appear to be &#8220;associated with any of the Target Online Locations (based on its name, branding or the identity of its operator) and making available online the same or substantially the same content&#8230;&#8221;\nThese &#8220;dynamic&#8221; injunctions help the rightsholders to swiftly update blocklists. After an amendment is granted by the court, the domain names have to be blocked for a period of three years, which can be extended if needed. \nLast week&#8217;s blocking expansion is not the first this year. In July, the movie companies previously requested an update to a December 2021 blocking order, adding 45 new domain names. These include quite a few 123movies variants, such as 123-movies.fun, 123movie.sh, and 123movies.day. \nA full list of the domain names added in the two recent blocking expansions is available below. \n&#8212;\nOn August 22 Justice Nicholas amended the February 22, 2022 blocking order with the following domain names:\n&#8211; soap2dayfree.co\n&#8211; soap2dayhd.com\n&#8211; soap2day.rs\n&#8211; primewire.mx\n&#8211; new-primewire.com\n&#8211; moviesjoy.plus\n&#8211; moviesjoy.sc\n&#8211; 123moviess.sc\n&#8211; 123moviesc.cyou h\n&#8211; 123moviess.se\n&#8211; new123movies.la\n&#8211; gomovies.cyou\n&#8211; real-gomovies.com\n&#8211; new-gomovies.online\n&#8211; putlockers.pro\n&#8211; putlockers.llc\n&#8211; putlocker.vc\n&#8211; putlocker.pics \nOn July 5 Justice Nicholas amended the December 21, 2021 blocking order with the following domain names:\n&#8211; 123-movies.fun\n&#8211; 123-movies.dev\n&#8211; 123-movies.ag\n&#8211; 123-movies.sx\n&#8211; 123-movies.gy\n&#8211; 0123movies.click\n&#8211; 123movies.gl\n&#8211; 123watchmovies.co\n&#8211; 123moviesh.to\n&#8211; 123movie.sh\n&#8211; 123moviesfree.so\n&#8211; 1234movies.live\n&#8211; 123movies.college\n&#8211; 123moviesready.org\n&#8211; 123-movies.ninja\n&#8211; 123moviesfree.rest\n&#8211; 123movieshd.icu\n&#8211; 123movies.wiki\n&#8211; 123moviesfree4u.co\n&#8211; 123moviesgo.club\n&#8211; 123moviestv.me\n&#8211; ca123movies.com\n&#8211; 0123movie.ltd\n&#8211; movies123.click\n&#8211; movies123.studio\n&#8211; 123moviess.la\n&#8211; 123movies.day\n&#8211; 0123movies.ltd\n&#8211; movies123.click\n&#8211; movies123.studio\n&#8211; 123moviesss.la\n&#8211; 123movies.day\n&#8211; 0123movies.ltd\n&#8211; 123moviescc.cc\n&#8211; 0123movie.ru\n&#8211; fmovies2.cx\n&#8211; fmoviesto.cc\n&#8211; fmoviesf.me\n&#8211; fmoviefree.net\n&#8211; himovies.tv\n&#8211; hdmovie5.tv\n&#8211; hdmovie5.to\n&#8211; hdmovie5.cam\n&#8211; hdmovie5.art\n&#8211; bflix.gg\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "In common with many countries in Europe, Austria couldn&#8217;t escape pressure from rightsholders to implement site blocking to prevent piracy.\nLocal ISPs didn&#8217;t like the idea but following a ruling by the European Court of Justice in 2014, rightsholders took legal action to have sites blocked. ISPs fought all the way to the Supreme Court, but to no avail. Concerns over net neutrality were also brushed aside.\nMovie companies went on to target several major streaming sites and then in 2015, The Pirate Bay, 1337x and other torrent sites were blocked following action by music industry group IFPI.\nIn the years that followed, many more domains were blocked following rightsholder complaints. Publishers also joined the action with Sci-Hub and Libgen blocks but at the end of 2019, instructions for ISPs to block pirate sites suddenly stopped after several domains belonging to notorious streaming site Movie4K were added to the register.\nBlocking Resumes &#8211; Badly\nAfter a considerable pause, last week ISPs were instructed to block a new batch of domains following legal action by Satel Film GmbH. They included domains operated by BurningSeries, SerienStream, Fmovies and SeasonVar &#8211; around 30 overall. Another blocking order, obtained by DOR Film, targeted another 40 domains.\nThis batch was closely followed by yet another blocking order obtained by collecting society Wahrnehmung von Leistungsschutzrechten GmbH (LSG). Austrian ISPs were instructed to block music piracy site NewAlbumReleases.net and 10 additional unblocking site domains facilitating access to it. \nThe ISPs also received instructions to block music piracy site Canna Power. If the instructions had stopped at Canna-Power.to and Canna.to, that would&#8217;ve been the end of the matter, but that wasn&#8217;t the case here.\n\nThe court-sanction blocking instructions also contained a list of IP addresses to be blocked at the same time &#8211; all of them belonging to Cloudflare and used by a large number of innocent sites, as well as the piracy site in question. After more than a decade of blocking orders around the world, this was a rookie mistake but that didn&#8217;t reduce the consequences.\nISPs Had No Choice But to Obey The Court\nAfter internet users in Austria began to complain of unexpected website outages on Sunday, Der Standard says it began asking questions.\nUp until now, ISPs have been given lists of domains so that blocking can be conducted by DNS. This time IP addresses were supplied in addition to domains and because non-compliance can lead to legal action, ISPs had no choice but to follow the orders. Worryingly, ISP Magenta said that the whole thing could&#8217;ve been avoided. \nPreviously, through a process involving the Austrian Regulatory Authority for Broadcasting and Telecommunications (RTR), it was possible for ISPs to offer their input on blocking. That is no longer the case.\n&#8220;In the past, RTR had the option of a determination procedure. Internet providers could use this to check in advance whether a block is permissible or not. However, this procedure no longer exists due to a supreme court ruling,&#8221; the company told Der Standard.\nIn this case, RTR can check whether the blocks are admissible, but only after the damage has been done.\nCloudflare Works on Technical Solution, Calls for Action\nApproached for comment, Cloudflare said it was working hard to find a way around the blocks. It also called for the public to get involved in the debate while putting pressure on the government.\n&#8220;We are currently working on finding a technical solution for the affected websites. At the same time, Austrian Internet users are being asked to put pressure on politicians. Perhaps then the knowledge will prevail there that the blocking of IP addresses always has undesirable side effects,&#8221; the company&#8217;s statement reads.\nBlocking can have undesirable side effects but the more fundamental problem is the drive to conduct site blocking via agreements between stakeholders, negotiated in private processes, with no public oversight. \nIf Austrian ISPs hadn&#8217;t published the details of what they are required to block, the public would&#8217;ve had blank screens and no answers today. Publishing blocking lists for scrutiny should be required wherever blocking is put in place but according to rightsholders, that only serves to encourage piracy.\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "(11/15) “I’d always head straight to the gym after my shift at Starbucks. Martin trained me for free the entire time I was in the shelter. He told me that he was going to turn me into a fighter. He was hard on me. He said I had more problems than a math book. And if I ever complained, he’d call me a drama queen. One afternoon I came in upset, because I’d just gotten an email from my husband, saying I was outside the will of God. It had really shaken me. But when I told Martin what happened, all he said was: ‘Fuck that shit.’ He told me to get in the ring. And as he wrapped my hands, he said: ‘We’re going to do things a little different today. Every time you throw a cross, you’re going to say: ‘Fuck that shit.’ I laughed. I said: ‘Oh, no. I don’t talk like that.’ But Martin wasn’t laughing. He said: ‘You’ll talk like that today.’ I looked around the gym, and it was just me and him. So I gave it a try. Jab with the left. Jab with the left. Cross with the right, and: ‘Fuck that shit.’ Martin was wearing the pads on his hands; and he’s saying: ‘Louder. kid. Louder.’ He said: ‘Nobody fucks with you, nobody.’ Which wasn’t true of course, because I’d been fucked with my entire life. But I tried it again, this time even louder: ‘Fuck that shit.’ Louder. ‘Fuck! That! Shit!’ We did it for thirty minutes. With each punch, I got louder and louder until I was screaming. At first those words were just about my husband, and the email he had sent. But as I kept hitting the pads, those words became something else. It became my way of giving voice to everything that was done to me in the name of God. The psychological abuse in the marriage. The sexual abuse as a child. All the guilt I’d been made to feel, all the shame. Fuck. That. Shit. It was wrong. I’ve known it was wrong my whole life. But I never defended myself. Or if I tried, it was: ‘Get back in your place.’ But now I was doing something. I was fighting back. At the end of the day when I walked out the door, I felt relieved of so much pain.  Martin called me over to the desk. He said: ‘Listen, kid. From now on, every time someone tries to mess with you, or makes you feel less than, you gotta say it: ‘Fuck that shit.’”",

Here&#8217;s What I Want You To Know About Being &#8216;Pro-Life.&#8217; (Content warning: rape.)\n\nSophia is in her 20s now. I wonder how she has healed, how she has processed that trauma. Did she get to go to college? Has she been able to trust an intimate partner? Has she been pregnant on her own terms at the time of her choosing? Does she have a child? I can see her wide face and her soft smile in my mind&#8217;s eye and I know now, just as I knew then, that the decision to terminate Sophia&#8217;s pregnancy, supported by the ones who loved her the most, was a pro-life decision.\n\nAnd:\n\nI remember how tiny that clinic room felt. There was no room for politicians signing evil bills flanked by child props as old as Sophia, no room for Supreme Court justices who claim to value life while wondering aloud how pregnancy can be an undue burden. No room for those extraneous, unnecessary, useless others in that most intimate of spaces. Our clinic rooms will always be too small for anybody but providers and our patients.\n\n Tags: abortion&nbsp;&nbsp; Dipti S. Barot&nbsp;&nbsp; medicine&nbsp;&nbsp; USA",

        "description": "A class action lawsuit filed by Maria Schneider against YouTube more than two years ago has support from artists who believe big tech should do better.\nWhile that opinion is widespread in the music industry, no musical artists of any description joined Schneider in the class action, despite the plaintiffs oozing confidence in their allegations. \nMass copyright infringement, failure to suspend repeat infringers, and breaches of the DMCA are all featured in a case that seems to have one key goal &#8211; Content ID access for all artists no matter how popular, so they can defend their work from pirates on YouTube.\nYouTube hasn&#8217;t given an inch and believes all of the claims in the class action are without merit. At least one of the members of the putative class acted fraudulently, YouTube claims, and it can easily dismiss every other allegation. On Friday, YouTube informed the court that it will move for summary judgment in October. If the claims in its motion are deemed credible, a YouTube win is almost inevitable.\nIt&#8217;s Not Infringement if You Have Permission\nAccording to YouTube, Maria Schneider&#8217;s allegations of mass copyright infringement plus violations of the DMCA due to YouTube&#8217;s removal of Copyright Management Information (CMI) simply cannot succeed.\nIn 2008, Schneider reportedly gave her publisher, Modern Works Music Publishing (MWP), the exclusive right to license her compositions. In turn, MWP granted YouTube/Google a blanket license to use all MWP-controlled works, which included Schneider&#8217;s entire back catalog. Furthermore, YouTube says it holds separate licenses to Schneider&#8217;s works, relating to any content uploaded by the musician or her agents to YouTube.\nSchneider claims the MWP license is invalid, YouTube says, since her publisher didn&#8217;t get permission from her to license anything to YouTube.\n&#8220;Even assuming that were true, it makes no difference because Schneider’s consent was not a condition precedent to MWP’s right to license her works. The license is valid and dispositive. And as to the other license, Schneider has said nothing at all,&#8221; YouTube&#8217;s motion reads.\nPart of Schneider&#8217;s claims relate to YouTube&#8217;s removal of CMI from uploaded tracks but YouTube says the musician refuses to identify the tracks where this supposedly happened. Nevertheless, YouTube says Schneider&#8217;s claim still fails because the blanket rights license obtained from her publisher granted the company permission to reformat videos containing her works. Schneider can&#8217;t prove intent either (17 U.S.C. § 1202(b)), YouTube says.\nSchneider Didn&#8217;t Move Quickly Enough\nDo people ever read the Terms of Service on sites like YouTube? Sometimes perhaps, but if anyone is considering legal action, giving them the once over first can reveal some interesting restrictions.\n&#8220;When Schneider created her YouTube account and uploaded videos to YouTube, she agreed to YouTube’s TOS, including its provision that any claim relating to YouTube’s services be brought within one year of accrual,&#8221; YouTube says.\n&#8220;Beyond that, the governing statute of limitations requires her claims be brought within three years of accrual (17 U.S.C. § 507(b)) — that is, when a plaintiff has actual or constructive knowledge of the claims.\n&#8220;Schneider admits to having actual knowledge of dozens of her infringement claims years before she sued, and discovery shows she had constructive knowledge of even more. She also had actual knowledge of YouTube’s supposed § 1202 violations [CMI] more than three years before she sued.&#8221; \nSupporting Evidence\nAccording to YouTube, Schneider agreed to its Terms of Service (TOS) on several occasions, including when she created the &#8216;Maria Schneider Official Page&#8221; in 2012. \nWhen users agree to the TOS, they give YouTube &#8220;extensive rights&#8221; to any content they upload, including a license for YouTube and YouTube users to use the content across the YouTube service. Any claims relating to the service must be brought within a year.\nSchneider&#8217;s copyright infringement claims against YouTube relate to 78 works. 76 of those works are musical compositions but according to YouTube, Schneider&#8217;s copyrights only cover the musical compositions (i.e sheet music), not sound recordings. In respect of the two remaining works where she does own rights to the sound recordings, no infringement allegations are within the statute of limitations period.\nOne of Schneider&#8217;s central claims, that she was denied access to Content ID, is incorrect according to YouTube. MWP, which granted YouTube a blanket license covering her back catalog, used Content ID on Schneider&#8217;s behalf. When &#8216;infringing&#8217; content was monetized, Schneider received payments from MWP.\n&#8220;Schneider’s infringement claims fail on multiple grounds. The Works-in-Suit were licensed through MWP and the Terms of Service,&#8221; YouTube notes in summary.\n&#8220;Schneider’s CMI claim fails because she cannot make out a prima facie case and because any removal of CMI by YouTube was authorized. And both her CMI claim and many of her infringement claims are also time-barred. Together, these overlapping grounds dispose of all of Schneider’s claims against YouTube.&#8221;\nYouTube&#8217;s motion for summary judgment against Schneider can be found here (pdf)\nFrom: TF, for the latest news on copyright battles, piracy and more.",

        "description": "(10/15) “My first night in the shelter I found a folding chair and sat with my back against the wall. I needed to feel something solid against my back. I didn’t know if there was going to be a bottom that I could hit, and bounce back up. Or if it was just going to be darkness and I’d never come out again. I was scared. But I was also angry. I felt like my identity had been stolen. From the time I was two years old, until the night I entered the shelter, somebody else had been in control of my life. Each day for ‘check-in’ the women would line up against a brick wall. But I never wanted to be in that line, so I would walk around the neighborhood until the last minute. One day I noticed that a boxing club had opened a few blocks down. They were offering trial lessons for $40, so I decided to go see what it was all about. There weren’t many athletic clothes in the shelter’s clothing closet. So I came to my lesson wearing faded blue men’s swimming trunks, an oversized T-shirt, and my black Starbucks work shoes. The owner’s name was Martin. And one thing about Martin, is that he’s always saying ‘kid.’ He took one look at me when I walked in the door, and said: ‘What’s your greatest fear kid?’ I told him I had a fear of defending myself. Because as a child I’d been abused by men in our church, over and over. And if I raised my arms to defend myself, they abused me worse. I asked Martin if we could maybe start with a speed bag. But he told me they didn’t have a speed bag. He threw me a towel, and said: ‘Get in the ring, kid. I’m about to change your life.’ He had me doing exercises named after animals: crab stuff, and bear stuff, and duck things. I thought I was going to die. The whole time he was telling jokes. They were bad jokes, but he kept me so scrambled that I forgot about my fear. That first day he taught me how to do the ‘jab, jab, cross.’ Two jabs with the left, and a cross with the right. And I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the hitting. When we finished Martin asked me when I was coming back. I told him I couldn’t, because I didn’t have any money. He said it didn’t matter. He called out to the person running the desk, and said: ‘Hey! Put this kid on my list!’”",

        "description": "(9/15) “It was magic that night. I didn’t miss any lines, or any beats. I sang seventeen of my favorite love songs: ‘Somewhere Over The Rainbow,’ Unforgettable,’ ‘Love Look What You’ve Done to Me.’ Toward the end of the show I sang ‘Dance With Me,’ by Orleans. I told the audience that for eight years I’d begged my husband to waltz with me, but he never would. He kept saying that I was too short. When I started to sing, the whole audience got up and danced with me. In that moment I could feel my chains breaking. It might have been the first time in my life I felt completely free. On the night of my performance, I’d been living in New York for just over a year. And a year is a long time to have someone living in your house. Lucas never made me feel like a burden, but I felt like a burden. For months I’d been praying to God: ‘Help me find a way out of here.’ And he answered that prayer. Just not in the way I was expecting. One morning Lucas told me that we needed to talk. He said that Margaret had been offered a job out-of-state, and she was going to take it. He invited me to come with them. I couldn’t bare the thought of starting all over again, in a new place. But most of all I didn’t want to be a burden. So I told him: ‘Thank you. I’m alive because of you, but I’m going to stay.’ When Lucas moved away, I lost the last bubble of protection between me and New York City. Garrison begged me to come live with him in Arkansas. He had an extra room in his apartment. But he was living in the town where I was born, and I just couldn’t do it. I told him: ‘If it gets bad, I’ll come live with you.’ And he said: ‘Mama, a homeless shelter is bad.’ I told him: ‘Not bad enough.’ I checked into a private shelter in Chinatown. There were thirty women in one room with fifteen bunk beds. On the night I was admitted, they made me have my picture taken for a photo ID card. I had to sign a piece of paper, to prove that I was homeless. It was one of the hardest things I’ve ever had to do. When I put my signature on that line, I felt like I was sealing my doom.”",

        "description": "Adam Serwer writing in The Atlantic about the leaked Supreme Court opinion draft penned by conservative justice Samuel Alito that will, if it remains substantially unmodified, overturn Roe v Wade and other precedents that guarantee the right to an abortion in the United States.\n\n&#8220;The majority can believe that it&#8217;s only eviscerating a right to abortion in this draft,&#8221; Stephen Vladeck, a law professor at the University of Texas at Austin, told me, &#8220;but the means by which it does so would open the door to similar attacks on other unenumerated rights, both directly, by attacking the underpinnings of those doctrines, and indirectly, by setting a precedent for such an attack.&#8221;\n\nAside from rights specifically mentioned in the text of the Constitution, Alito argues, only those rights &#8220;deeply rooted in the nation&#8217;s history in tradition&#8221; deserve its protections. This is as arbitrary as it is lawless. Alito is saying there is no freedom from state coercion that conservatives cannot strip away if conservatives find that freedom personally distasteful. The rights of heterosexual married couples to obtain contraception, or of LGBTQ people to be free from discrimination, are obvious targets. But other rights that Americans now take for granted could easily be excluded by this capricious reasoning.\n\n&#8220;In a series of cases beginning in the early 1920s, the Court carved out a protected space for family, marriage, and children that the government is constrained from regulating,&#8221; Kimberly Wehle wrote last December. &#8220;A rollback of Roe could split this sphere open if the conservative theory that implied rights are constitutionally invalid takes hold, and states begin passing draconian laws that creep into other areas of intimate personal life.&#8221;\n\nAnd:\n\nOn the grounds that it constitutes a form of religious discrimination, conservatives will be able to claim an exemption from any generally applicable rule they do not wish to follow, while imposing their own religious and ideological views on those who do not share them. Although the right-wing justices present this rule in the language of constitutionalism, they are simply imposing their ideological and cultural preferences on the rest of the country.\n\nAbortion, same-sex marriage, birth control, rights for trans persons, other LGBTQ protections, other civil rights &#8212; it&#8217;s all on the table, they&#8217;re coming for all of it.\n\nUpdate: See also This is just the beginning:\n\nI ask you to re-read the above passage and substitute for the word &#8220;abortion&#8221; any other modern liberty not mentioned in the Constitution: the right to use contraception, same-sex marriage, the right of same-sex couples to adopt children, marriage between different &#8220;races,&#8221; the right of any consenting adults to engage in sex, the right of unmarried couples to live together, and the rights of LGBTQ people to be treated with equal dignity.\n\nEach of the above rights &#8212; now widely accepted &#8212; was criminalized or prohibited in many U.S. states until the latter part of the 20th century. Under Justice Alito&#8217;s reasoning, because the Constitution &#8220;makes no reference to those rights&#8221; and they were &#8220;unknown&#8221; in American jurisprudence until recently, the Constitution affords them no protection. Alito does handsprings to claim the draft ruling does not reach other rights rooted in the same legal ground as Roe and Casey. But there is no difference under Alito&#8217;s reasoning between abortion and contraception, same sex marriage, same-sex adoption, and bans against &#8220;fornication,&#8221; &#8220;sodomy,&#8221; cohabitation, and &#8220;miscegenation.&#8221;\n\nThis is just the beginning.\n\n Tags: abortion&nbsp;&nbsp; Adam Serwer&nbsp;&nbsp; legal&nbsp;&nbsp; politics&nbsp;&nbsp; Samuel Alito&nbsp;&nbsp; Supreme Court&nbsp;&nbsp; USA",

        "link": "https://waxy.org/2022/08/exploring-12-million-of-the-images-used-to-train-stable-diffusions-image-generator/",
        "description": "One of the biggest frustrations of text-to-image generation AI models is that they feel like a black box. We know they were trained on images pulled from the web, but which ones? As an artist or photographer, an obvious question is whether your work was used to train the AI model, but this is surprisingly hard to answer.\n\n\n\nSometimes, the data isn&#8217;t available at all: OpenAI has said it&#8217;s trained DALL-E 2 on hundreds of millions of captioned images, but hasn&#8217;t released the proprietary data. By contrast, the team behind Stable Diffusion have been very transparent about how their model is trained. Since it was released publicly last week, Stable Diffusion has exploded in popularity, in large part because of its free and permissive licensing, already incorporated into the new Midjourney beta, NightCafe, and Stability AI&#8217;s own DreamStudio app, as well as for use on your own computer. \n\n\n\nBut Stable Diffusion&#8217;s training datasets are impossible for most people to download, let alone search, with metadata for millions (or billions!) of images stored in obscure file formats in large multipart archives.\n\n\n\nSo, with the help of my friend Simon Willison, we grabbed the data for over 12 million images used to train Stable Diffusion, and used his Datasette project to make a data browser for you to explore and search it yourself. Note that this is only a small subset of the total training data: about 2% of the 600 million images used to train the most recent three checkpoints, and only 0.5% of the 2.3 billion images that it was first trained on.\n\n\n\nScreenshot of the LAION-Aesthetic data browser in Datasette\n\n\n\nGo try it right now at laion-aesthetic.datasette.io!\n\n\n\nRead on to learn about how this dataset was collected, the websites it most frequently pulled images from, and the artists, famous faces, and fictional characters most frequently found in the data.\n\n\n\nData Source\n\n\n\nStable Diffusion was trained off three massive datasets collected by LAION, a nonprofit whose compute time was largely funded by Stable Diffusion&#8217;s owner, Stability AI.\n\n\n\nAll of LAION&#8217;s image datasets are built off of Common Crawl, a nonprofit that scrapes billions of webpages monthly and releases them as massive datasets. LAION collected all HTML image tags that had alt-text attributes, classified the resulting 5 billion image-pairs based on their language, and then filtered the results into separate datasets using their resolution, a predicted likelihood of having a watermark, and their predicted &#8220;aesthetic&#8221; score (i.e. subjective visual quality).\n\n\n\nCollage of some of the images with the highest &#8220;aesthetic&#8221; score, largely watercolor landscapes and portraits of women\n\n\n\nStable Diffusion&#8217;s initial training was on low-resolution 256&#215;256 images from LAION-2B-EN, a set of 2.3 billion English-captioned images from LAION-5B&#8216;s full collection of 5.85 billion image-text pairs, as well as LAION-High-Resolution, another subset of LAION-5B with 170 million images greater than 1024&#215;1024 resolution (downsampled to 512&#215;512).\n\n\n\nIts last three checkpoints were on LAION-Aesthetics v2 5+, a 600 million image subset of LAION-2B-EN with a predicted aesthetics score of 5 or higher, with low-resolution and likely watermarked images filtered out.\n\n\n\nFor our data explorer, we originally wanted to show the full dataset, but it&#8217;s a challenge to host a 600 million record database in an affordable, performant way. So we decided to use the smaller LAION-Aesthetics v2 6+, which includes 12 million image-text pairs with a predicted aesthetic score of 6 or higher, instead of the 600 million rated 5 or higher used in Stable Diffusion&#8217;s training.\n\n\n\nThis should be a representative sample of images used to train Stable Diffusion&#8217;s last three checkpoints, but skewing towards more aesthetically-attractive images. Note that LAION provides a useful frontend to search the CLIP embeddings computed from their 400M and 5 billion image datasets, but it doesn&#8217;t allow you to search the original captions.\n\n\n\nSource Domains\n\n\n\nWe know the captioned images used for Stable Diffusion were scraped from the web, but from where? We indexed the 12 million images in our sample by domain to find out.\n\n\n\nNearly half of the images, about 47%, were sourced from only 100 domains, with the largest number of images coming from Pinterest. Over a million images, or 8.5% of the total dataset, are scraped from Pinterest&#8217;s pinimg.com CDN.\n\n\n\nUser-generated content platforms were a huge source for the image data. WordPress-hosted blogs on wp.com and wordpress.com represented 819k images together, or 6.8% of all images. Other photo, art, and blogging sites included 232k images from Smugmug, 146k from Blogspot, 121k images were from Flickr, 67k images from DeviantArt, 74k from Wikimedia, 48k from 500px, and 28k from Tumblr.\n\n\n\nShopping sites were well-represented. The second-biggest domain was Fine Art America, which sells art prints and posters, with 698k images (5.8%) in the dataset. 244k images came from Shopify, 189k each from Wix and Squarespace, 90k from Redbubble, and just over 47k from Etsy.\n\n\n\nUnsurprisingly, a large number came from stock image sites. 123RF was the biggest with 497k, 171k images came from Adobe Stock&#8217;s CDN at ftcdn.net, 117k from PhotoShelter, 35k images from Dreamstime, 23k from iStockPhoto, 22k from Depositphotos, 22k from Unsplash, 15k from Getty Images, 10k from VectorStock, and 10k from Shutterstock, among many others.\n\n\n\nIt&#8217;s worth noting, however, that domains alone may not represent the actual sources of these images. For instance, there are only 6,292 images sourced from Artstation.com&#8217;s domain, but another 2,740 images with &#8220;artstation&#8221; in the caption text hosted by sites like Pinterest.\n\n\n\nArtists\n\n\n\nWe wanted to understand how artists were represented in the dataset, so used the list of over 1,800 artists in MisterRuffian&#8217;s Latent Artist &amp; Modifier Encyclopedia to search the dataset and count the number of images that reference each artist&#8217;s name. You can browse and search those artist counts here, or try searching for any artist in the images table. (Searching with quoted strings is recommended.)\n\n\n\nOf the top 25 artists in the dataset, only three are still living: Phil Koch, Erin Hanson, and Steve Henderson. The most frequent artist in the dataset? The Painter of Light himself, Thomas Kinkade, with 9,268 images.\n\n\n\nFrom a list of 1,800 popular artists, the top 10 found most frequently in the captioned images\n\n\nUsing the &#8220;type&#8221; field in the database, you can see the most frequently-found artists in each category: for example, looking only at comic book artists, Stan Lee&#8217;s name is found most often in the image captions. (As one commenter pointed out, Stan Lee was a comic book writer, not an artist, but people are using his name to generate images in the style of comic book art he was associated with.)\n\n\n\nSome of the most-cited recommended artists used in AI image prompting aren&#8217;t as pervasive in the dataset as you&#8217;d expect. There are only 15 images that mention fantasy artist Greg Rutkowski, whose name is frequently used as a prompt modifier, and only 73 from James Gurney.\n\n\n\n(It&#8217;s worth saying again that these images are just a subset of one of three datasets used to train the AI, so an artist&#8217;s work may have been used elsewhere in the data even if they&#8217;re not found in these 12M images.)\n\n\n\nFamous People\n\n\n\nUnlike DALL-E 2, Stable Diffusion doesn&#8217;t have any limitations on generating images of people named in the dataset. To get a sense of how well-represented well-known people are in the dataset, we took two lists of celebrities and other famous names and merged it into a list of nearly 2,000 names. You can see the results of those celebrity counts here, or search for any name in the images table. (Obviously, some of the top searches like &#8220;Pink&#8221; and &#8220;Prince&#8221; include results that don&#8217;t refer to that person.)\n\n\n\nDonald Trump is one of the most cited names in the image dataset, with nearly 11,000 photos referencing his name. Charlize Theron is a close runner-up with 9,576 images.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollage of generated portraits of Donald Trump and Charlize Theron from Stable Diffusion\n\n\n\nA full gender breakdown would take more time, but at a glance, it seems like many of the most popular names in the dataset are women.\n\n\n\nStrangely, enormously popular internet personalities like David Dobrik, Addison Rae, Charli D&#8217;Amelio, Dixie D&#8217;Amelio, and MrBeast don&#8217;t appear in the captions from the dataset at all. My hunch was that the CommonCrawl data was too old to include these more recent celebrities, but based on the URLs, there are tens of thousands of images from last year in the data. (If you can solve this mystery, get in touch or leave a comment!)\n\n\n\nFictional Characters\n\n\n\nFinally, we took a look at how popular fictional characters are represented in the dataset, since this is subject matter that&#8217;s enormously popular using Stable Diffusion and Craiyon, but often impossible with DALL-E 2, as you can see in this Mickey Mouse example from my previous post.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“realistic 3d rendering of mickey mouse working on a vintage computer doing his taxes” on DALL·E 2 (left) vs. Stable Diffusion (right)\n\n\n\nFor this set of searches, we used this list of 600 fictional characters from pop culture to search the image dataset. You can browse the results here, or search for any other character in the images table. (Again, be aware that one-word character names like &#8220;Link,&#8221; &#8220;Data,&#8221; and &#8220;Mario&#8221; are likely to have many more results unrelated to that character.)\n\n\n\nCharacters from the MCU like Captain Marvel (4,993 images), Black Panther (4,395), and Captain America (3,155) are some of the best represented in the dataset. Batman (2,950) and Superman (2,739) are neck and neck. Luke Skywalker (2,240) has more images than Darth Vader (1.717) and Han Solo (1,013). Mickey Mouse barely breaks the top 100 with 520 images.\n\n\n\nNSFW Content\n\n\n\nFinally, let&#8217;s take a brief look at the representation of adult material, another huge difference between Stable Diffusion and any other model. OpenAI rigorously removed sexual/violent content from its training data and blocked potentially NSFW keywords from prompts.\n\n\n\nThe Stable Diffusion team built a predictor for adult material and assigned every image a NSFW probability score, which you can see in the &#8220;punsafe&#8221; field in the images table, ranging from 0 to 1. (Warning: Obviously, sorting by that field will show the most NSFW images in the dataset.)\n\n\n\nIn their announcements of the full LAION-5B dataset, LAION team member Romain Beaumont estimated that about 2.9% of the English-language images were &#8220;unsafe,&#8221; but in browsing this dataset, it&#8217;s not clear how their predictors defined that. \n\n\n\nThere&#8217;s definitely NSFW material in the image dataset, but surprisingly little of it. Only 222 images got a &#8220;1&#8221; unsafe probability score, indicating 100% confidence that it&#8217;s unsafe, about 0.002% of the total images — and those are definitely porn. But nudity seems to be unusual outside of that confidence level: even images with a 0.9999 punsafe score (99.99% confidence) rarely have nudity in them.\n\n\n\nIt&#8217;s plausible that filtering on aesthetic ratings is removing huge amounts of NSFW content from the image dataset, and the full dataset contains much more. Or maybe their definitions of what is &#8220;unsafe&#8221; are very broad.\n\n\n\nMore Info\n\n\n\nAgain, huge thanks to Simon Willison for working with me on this: he did all the heavy lifting of hosting the data. He wrote a detailed post about making the search engine if you want more technical detail. His Datasette project is open-source, extremely flexible, and worth checking out. If you&#8217;re interested in playing with this data yourself, you can use the scripts in his GitHub repo to download and import it into a SQLite database.\n\n\n\nIf you find anything interesting in the data, or have any questions, feel free to drop them in the comments.",

        "description": "Last month, I finally got access to OpenAI&#8217;s DALL·E 2 and immediately started exploring the text-to-image AI&#8217;s potential for creative shitposting, generating horror after horror: the Eames Lounge Toilet, the Combination Pizza Hut and Frank Lloyd Wright&#8217;s Fallingwater, toddler barflies, Albert Einstein inventing jorts, and the can&#8217;t-unsee &#8220;close up photo of brushing teeth with toothbrush covered with nacho cheese.&#8221;\n\n\n\n\n“plasticine nerd working on a 1980s computer”\n\n\n\n“macro photo of beautiful living gummy candy worm on a human hand”\n\n\n\n“Combination Pizza Hut and Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater”\n\n\n\n\nDALL·E 2 diligently hallucinated each image out of noise from the compressed latent space, multi-dimensional patterns discovered in hundreds of millions of captioned images scraped from the internet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#8220;two slugs in wedding attire getting married, stunning editorial photo for bridal magazine shot at golden hour&#8221;\n\n\n\nThe prompt that finally melted my brain was the one above, with images of slugs getting married at golden hour. I originally specified a &#8220;tuxedo and wedding dress&#8221; with predictable results, but changing it to &#8220;wedding attire&#8221; gave the AI the flexibility to depict variations of what slugs might marry in, like headdresses made of cotton balls and honeycomb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI’ve never felt so conflicted using an emerging technology as DALL·E 2, which feels like borderline magic in what it’s capable of conjuring, but raises so many ethical questions, it’s hard to keep track of them all.\n\n\n\nThere are the many known issues that OpenAI’s acknowledged and worked to mitigate, like racial or gender biases in its image training set, or the lengths they’ve gone to avoid generating sexual/violent content or recognizable celebrities and trademarked characters.\n\n\n\nBut it opens profound questions about the ethics of laundering human creativity:\n\n\n\nIs it ethical to train an AI on a huge corpus of copyrighted creative work, without permission or attribution?Is it ethical to allow people to generate new work in the styles of the photographers, illustrators, and designers without compensating them?Is it ethical to charge money for that service, built on the work of others?\n\n\n\nThere are basic fundamental questions about whether it’s even legal: these are largely untested waters in copyright law and it seems destined to end up in court. Training deep learning models on copyrighted material may be fair use, but only a judge can decide that. (The fact that OpenAI&#8217;s removing some results from the image training set, like celebrity faces and Disney/Marvel characters, suggests they’re well aware of angering the biggest litigants.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&#8220;realistic 3d rendering of mickey mouse working on a vintage computer doing his taxes&#8221; on DALL·E 2 (left) vs. Stable Diffusion (right)\n\n\n\n\n\nAs these models improve, it seems likely to reduce demand in some paid creative services, from stock photography to commissioned illustrations. I empathize with the concerns of artists whose work was silently used to train commercial products in their style, without their consent and with no way to opt-out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe world was just starting to grapple with the implications of this technology when, on Monday, a company called Stability AI released its Stable Diffusion text-to-image AI publicly.\n\n\n\nStable Diffusion is free, open-source, runs on your own computer, and ships without any of the guardrails and content filters of its predecessors. It comes with a Safety Classifier enabled by default that tries to determine if a generated image is NSFW, but it&#8217;s easily disabled. \n\n\n\n\n&#8220;Obama comforting Trump&#8221;\n\n\n\n&#8220;photo of Scarlett Johansson by Diane Arbus&#8221; \n\n\n\n&#8220;Kanye West in the Taliban&#8221;\nSamples of celebrity images generated by Stable Diffusion users\n\n\n\nUnlike existing AI platforms like DALL·E 2 and Midjourney, Stable Diffusion can generate recognizable celebrities, nudity, trademarked characters, or any combination of those. (Try searching Lexica, the newly-launched Stable Diffusion search engine, for example output.)\n\n\n\nReleasing an uncensored dream machine into the wild had some predictable results. Two days after its release, Reddit banned three subreddits devoted to NSFW imagery made with Stable Diffusion, presumably because of the rapid influx of AI-generated fake nudes of Emma Watson, Selena Gomez, and many others.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe permissive license on Stable Diffusion allows commercial services to implement its AI model, such as NightCafe, which encourages paying customers to generate art in the styles of living artists like Pendleton Ward, Greg Rutkowski, Amanda Sage, Rebecca Sugar, and Simon Stålenhag, who has spoken out against the practice.\n\n\n\nList of artist modifiers in NightCafe\n\n\n\nOn top of it, Stable Diffusion&#8217;s terms state that every image generated with their Dream Studio is effectively public domain, under the CC0 1.0 Public Domain license. They make no claim over the copyright of images generated with the self-hosted Stable Diffusion model. (OpenAI&#8217;s terms says that images created with DALL·E 2 are their property, with customers granted a license to use them commercially.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA common argument I&#8217;ve seen is that training AI models is like an artist learning to paint and finding inspiration by looking at other artwork, which feels completely absurd to me. AI models are memorizing the features found in hundreds of millions of images, and producing images on demand at a scale unimaginable for any human—thousands every minute.\n\n\n\nThe results can be surprising and funny and beautiful, but only because of the vast trove of human creativity it was trained on. Stable Diffusion was trained on LAION-Aesthetic, a 120-million image subset of a 5 billion image crawl of image-text pairs from the web, winnowed down to the most aesthetically attractive images. (OpenAI has been more cagey about its sources.)\n\n\n\nThere&#8217;s no question it takes incredible engineering skill to develop systems to analyze that corpus and generate new images from it, but if any of these systems required permission from artists to use their images, they likely wouldn&#8217;t exist.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStability AI founder Emad Mostaque believes the good of new technology will outweigh the harm. &#8220;Humanity is horrible and they use technology in horrible ways, and good ways as well,&#8221; Mostaque said in an interview two weeks ago. &#8220;I think the benefits far outweigh any negativity and the reality is that people need to get used to these models, because they&#8217;re coming one way or another.&#8221; He thinks that OpenAI&#8217;s attempts to minimize bias and mitigate harm are &#8220;paternalistic,&#8221; and a sign of distrust of their userbase.\n\n\n\nToday we all made the World a more creative, happier and communicative place.More to come in the next few days but I for one can&#8217;t wait to see what you all create.Let&#8217;s activate humanity&#8217;s potential.— Emad (@EMostaque) August 22, 2022 \n\n\n\nIn that interview, Mostaque says that Stability AI and LAION were largely self-funded from his career as a hedge fund manager, and with additional resources, they&#8217;ve created a 4,000 A100 cluster with the support of Amazon that &#8220;ranks above JUWELS Booster as potentially the tenth fastest supercomputer.&#8221; \n\n\n\nOn Monday, Mostaque wrote that they plan to use those compute resources to expand to other AI-generated media: audio next month, and then 3D and video. I&#8217;d expect Stability AI to approach these new models in the same way, with little concern over their potential for misuse by bad actors, and with even less attention spent addressing the concerns of the artists and creators whose work makes them possible.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike I said, I&#8217;m conflicted. I love playing with new technology, and I&#8217;m excited about the creative potential of these new tools. I want to feel good about the tools I use.\n\n\n\nI don&#8217;t trust OpenAI for a bunch of reasons, but at least they seemed to try to do the right thing with their various efforts to reduce bias and potential harm, even if it&#8217;s sometimes clumsy. \n\n\n\nStable Diffusion&#8217;s approach feels irresponsible by comparison, another example of techno-utopianism unmoored from the reality of the internet&#8217;s last 20 years: how an unwavering commitment to ideals of free speech and anti-censorship can be deployed as a convenient excuse not to prevent abuse.\n\n\n\nFor now, generative AI platforms are some of the most resource-intensive projects in the world, leading to a vanishingly small number of participants with access to vast compute resources. It would be nice if those few companies would act responsibly by, at the very least, providing an opt-out for those who don&#8217;t want their work in future training data, finding new ways to help artists that do choose to participate, and following the lead of OpenAI in trying to minimize the potential for harm.\n\n\n\nI don&#8217;t pretend to know where these things will go: the risks may be overblown and we may be at the start of a massive democratization in the creation of art, or these platforms may make the already-precarious lives of artists harder, while opening up new avenues for deepfakes, misinformation, and online harassment and exploitation. I&#8217;d really like to see more of the former, but it won&#8217;t happen on its own.",

        "description": "Vitreous humor lines the backs of our eyeballs. We are born with a full supply of the stuff, but as we age, it begins to dry out or evaporate or some damn thing—the ophthalmologist shining a beam into my eye wasn’t overly explicit on this point. \n\n\n\nSometimes the stuff detaches and comes to the front of the eye. It can be discolored, particularly if the detached part used to be close to the optic nerve. The result is a vitreous floater, which is like having a microscopic slide of an insect’s leg in front of one of your eyes. One eye sees the world. The other eye sees the world but also sees the microscopic slide of the insect’s leg.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt times the “slide” moves around. At night there can also be white flashes that go off every two minutes or so—spaced just far enough apart to work like Chinese water torture.\n\n\n\nThe ophthalmologist told me it’s caused by aging, it happens to most people eventually, and there’s nothing doctors can do about it, other than monitor the situation to make sure it doesn’t get worse—because if it gets worse, that could be a sign of something more serious.\n\n\n\nThe ophthalmologist at the space-age eye hospital told me that over time I would see less of it, or learn to ignore it, or something—he wasn’t overly explicit on this point.\n\n\n\nI’m to go back and see him again in a month.\nThe post A little vitreous humor appeared first on Zeldman on Web and Interaction Design.",

        "description": "I DREAMED I’d boarded a ship that was slowly making its way to an exotic vacation locale, somewhere on the other side of the world. I’d bought a giant new steamer trunk for the voyage. I thought I’d have a cabin to myself, but, below decks, the ship was like a passenger train, with row upon row of seats. Voyagers had to sleep sitting up in these seats, and we had to hunt for a vacant seat. At first, I had a row of seats to myself, but I realized that the remaining seats would soon be filled, and perhaps by a group of noisy, aggressive people who knew each other. I’d be the odd one out. So I moved into an occupied row, next to a Japanese passenger who was already half-asleep, his hat pulled halfway down over his eyes, and was traveling by himself, like me. My arrival woke him, slightly, and he nodded to acknowledge me, then closed his eyes again. I realized, as I settled in beside him, each of us slouching away from the other for privacy, that I did not have my trunk with me, and did not know where it was being held. I couldn’t even be sure that it had made it onto the ship.\n\n\n\nThe ship docked at an American city for a quick break. It was a quaint old town, with buildings that seemed to date back hundreds of years, including a picturesque ruin or two. The dock was filled with similarly set-up cruise ships; this was obviously a major rest stop for the seaborne travel industry. The dock was infinite, an endless perspective of identical cruise ships, each disgorging thousands of passengers who merged into an oncoming throng. So many were coming that they raised the dust before them. I wondered how the quaint old town could possibly accommodate so many travelers.\n\n\n\nI had wandered into the city for many blocks when I realized I didn’t have my wallet with me—it was packed in the trunk, presumably back on the ship. I came to this sudden understanding while trying to complete a trivial purchase at the register of a small store. \n\n\n\n“I came on a ship, my wallet’s on board, perhaps we could call the ship and have them read you my credit card number?” I suggested to the frowning cashier.\n\n\n\n“Which ship?”\n\n\n\nI didn’t know.\n\n\n\n“Where’s she headed?”\n\n\n\nI suddenly didn’t know that, either.\n\n\n\n“Look, I’m on a three-week cruise,” I said. “I don’t remember where I’m going. I don’t know why my family’s not with me.”\n\n\n\nThe embarrassing admission did little to improve my standing with the cashier.\n\n\n\nCross-fade.\n\n\n\nI had given up and was trudging back to the ship when I realized I did not know where it was docked. I asked townspeople where the dock was located, but they frowned at me as if I were mentally ill or horribly disfigured, and scurried quickly away. So I wandered, through blocks that resembled Dresden after the Allied bombardment, with no adults to be seen—only underfed, half-naked children, who darted past like hurrying ghosts, presumably scouring the bombed-out buildings for scraps of food or dry places to shelter.Dissolve.\n\n\n\nAfter hours of walking at random, I began to pass buildings that looked vaguely familiar, and thought that I must be approaching the dock again. I could hear distant gulls, their cries half-muted and oddly modulated as they echoed off the broken buildings of the old city. \n\n\n\nIf I came out upon the dock, would I remember which ship I’d been traveling on? \n\n\n\nWhat was my name? Could my luggage identify me if I knew where the crew had stowed it? Could I describe my luggage to help them search for it? No, it was new and I was unfamiliar with its design. I couldn’t even remember what I’d packed, except for a faint impression that I’d stowed the contents in many small boxes inside the trunk. \n\n\n\nBut to even reach that impasse of being unable to describe my luggage, I’d have to first identify my ship, and they all looked the same. My ship might already have left. And I didn’t even know its destination.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7 June 2021\nThe post The ship and the city appeared first on Zeldman on Web and Interaction Design.",

If Spotify exposes you to new music, Last.fm helps remind you of great music in your existing collection that may have slipped your mind. (Not an advertisement. I use last.fm and get great pleasure from how it helps me discover and fuss with my music, as I once spent hours in the old days stacking and rearranging my LPs and tapes.)And that’s how I stay out of the pool halls.Public Service P.S: If you do decide to try last.fm, please, by all means, pay the small monthly subscription fee if you can. Doing so supports the under-resourced team that keeps the service going. It also removes the ads, making the site usable (the ads are a nightmare), and gives you the option to view your music as a visual grid, like those shown in my screenshots. The grid-view makes the site. It gives you, not just a visual record collection, but a visual artist collection, if you’ll allow the conceit.

        "description": "This looks interesting: a feature-length documentary on the life and work of Robert Caro and his longtime editor Robert Gottlieb, directed by Gottlieb&#8217;s daughter Lizzie Gottlieb.\n\nPulitzer Prize winning writer Robert Caro and legendary editor Robert Gottlieb have been working - and fighting -  together for 50 years. At 86, Caro is battling time to finish work on his long-promised fifth and final volume of The Years of Lyndon Johnson. Now 90, Gottlieb continues to edit, write and pursue his myriad and unexpected passions, attempting  to &#8220;love and be silent&#8221; until he and Caro can begin to edit Caro&#8217;s final masterwork.\n\nDirected by Gottlieb&#8217;s daughter Lizzie Gottlieb, Turn Every Page is an intimate look into artistry, mortality, antagonism, and friendship. Gottlieb chronicles the behind-the-scenes drama of the making of Caro&#8217;s The Power Broker and The Years of Lyndon B. Johnson volumes. The film is a deep-dive into the power dynamics of creative collaboration, the peculiarities and work habits of two ferocious intellects, and the culmination of a journey that has consumed both of their lives.\n\nNo trailer and no release date that I can find, but I will absolutely see this whenever it comes out. See also the New-York Historical Society&#8217;s ongoing exhibition, &#8220;Turn Every Page&#8221;: Inside the Robert A. Caro Archive.\n\n Tags: Lizzie Gottlieb&nbsp;&nbsp; movies&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Caro&nbsp;&nbsp; Robert Gottlieb",

In this way, self-immolators like Thich Quang Durc become almost inhuman, even holy. At the same time, the act establishes an entirely personal connection because the real question at hand isn&#8217;t really, &#8220;Why did he do that?&#8221; Rather, the self-immolator is asking you &#8212; with all the intimidation and self-righteousness a person can muster &#8212; &#8220;Why don&#8217;t you care even half as much as I do?&#8221;\n\n Tags: Jay Caspian Kang&nbsp;&nbsp; Wynn Bruce",

Here are a few of my favorites:\n\nCultivate 12 people who love you, because they are worth more than 12 million people who like you.\n\nAnything you say before the word &#8220;but&#8221; does not count.\n\nWhen you forgive others, they may not notice, but you will heal. Forgiveness is not something we do for others; it is a gift to ourselves.\n\nEfficiency is highly overrated; Goofing off is highly underrated. Regularly scheduled sabbaths, sabbaticals, vacations, breaks, aimless walks and time off are essential for top performance of any kind. The best work ethic requires a good rest ethic.\n\nIf winning becomes too important in a game, change the rules to make it more fun. Changing rules can become the new game.\n\nThe best way to get a correct answer on the internet is to post an obviously wrong answer and wait for someone to correct you.\n\nDon&#8217;t wait for the storm to pass; dance in the rain.\n\nWe tend to overestimate what we can do in a day, and underestimate what we can achieve in a decade. Miraculous things can be accomplished if you give it ten years. A long game will compound small gains to overcome even big mistakes.\n\nA wise man said, &#8220;Before you speak, let your words pass through three gates. At the first gate, ask yourself, &#8220;Is it true?&#8221; At the second gate ask, &#8220;Is it necessary?&#8221; At the third gate ask, &#8220;Is it kind?&#8221;\n\nTo rapidly reveal the true character of a person you just met, move them onto an abysmally slow internet connection. Observe.\n\nTake note if you find yourself wondering &#8220;Where is my good knife? Or, where is my good pen?&#8221; That means you have bad ones. Get rid of those.\n\nIf you loan someone $20 and you never see them again because they are avoiding paying you back, that makes it worth $20.\n\nCopying others is a good way to start. Copying yourself is a disappointing way to end.\n\nThe chief prevention against getting old is to remain astonished.\n\nOk that got out of hand&#8230;there&#8217;s a lot of good stuff on that list! I am definitely in receiving mode these days for wisdom.\n\n Tags: Kevin Kelly&nbsp;&nbsp; lists",

        "description": "I enjoyed this roast of how we handle money in America by The Daily Show&#8217;s Ronny Chieng.\n\n\n\nHe goes after income & sales taxes:\n\nAmerica decided filing taxes should be as quick and painless as getting a root canal at the DMV. You got your 1099s, your Form 1040, your Schedule C, your R2-D2, your Blink-182. You spend days trying to figure out what you owe the government and then the government tells you if are you right because apparently they knew the whole frigging time. It is like the world&#8217;s most pointless game show.\n\nTipping:\n\nEverywhere else, a tip is a show of appreciation, not a GoFundMe for someone who doesn&#8217;t earn a living wage. A waiter&#8217;s ability to pay rent shouldn&#8217;t be dependent on how generous Becky feels after three martinis.\n\nAnd our currency:\n\nIn other countries, every denomination is a different size because it makes it easier to tell them apart, especially if you are blind. But apparently blind people don&#8217;t need to use money in America &#8216;cause look at this shit. Same exact size, all of it. You gotta look over each individual bill to figure out which slaveowner to hand over.\n\n(thx, meg)\n\n Tags: currency&nbsp;&nbsp; money&nbsp;&nbsp; Ronny Chieng&nbsp;&nbsp; taxes&nbsp;&nbsp; USA&nbsp;&nbsp; video",

        "description": "On the 26th flight of Ingenuity, NASA&#8217;s helicopter on Mars, it spotted and photographed the wreckage of the Perseverance rover&#8217;s landing gear, protective shell, and parachute. From a NY Times article on the photos:\n\n&#8220;There&#8217;s definitely a sci-fi element to it,&#8221; Ian Clark, an engineer who worked on Perseverance&#8217;s parachute system, said of photographs released on Wednesday. &#8220;It exudes otherworldly, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;\n\nPart of the reason NASA had Ingenuity go take a look is to see how all of that equipment held up during the landing process. Data from the photos will inform future missions.\n\n&#8220;Perseverance had the best-documented Mars landing in history, with cameras showing everything from parachute inflation to touchdown,&#8221; said JPL&#8217;s Ian Clark, former Perseverance systems engineer and now Mars Sample Return ascent phase lead. &#8220;But Ingenuity&#8217;s images offer a different vantage point. If they either reinforce that our systems worked as we think they worked or provide even one dataset of engineering information we can use for Mars Sample Return planning, it will be amazing. And if not, the pictures are still phenomenal and inspiring.&#8221;\n\nIn the images of the upright backshell and the debris field that resulted from it impacting the surface at about 78 mph (126 kph), the backshell&#8217;s protective coating appears to have remained intact during Mars atmospheric entry. Many of the 80 high-strength suspension lines connecting the backshell to the parachute are visible and also appear intact. Spread out and covered in dust, only about a third of the orange-and-white parachute &#8212; at 70.5 feet (21.5 meters) wide, it was the biggest ever deployed on Mars &#8212; can be seen, but the canopy shows no signs of damage from the supersonic airflow during inflation. Several weeks of analysis will be needed for a more final verdict.\n\nIt is really remarkable, the images we&#8217;re seeing from Mars, taken by a robotic helicopter.\n\n Tags: astronomy&nbsp;&nbsp; Ingenuity&nbsp;&nbsp; Mars&nbsp;&nbsp; NASA&nbsp;&nbsp; Perseverance&nbsp;&nbsp; photography&nbsp;&nbsp; science&nbsp;&nbsp; space",

        "description": "Lucas Boland/Caller Times / USA TODAY NETWORK\n    \n\n  After flirting with a .400 OBP in High-A, infielder Will Wagner has largely maintained his pace since jumping to the upper minors.  The James Click front office had limited draft resources in their first two years on the job, but that didn’t stop them from continuing the club’s trend of finding solid roster-filling options with low initial investments. Among the best examples so far are 2020 undrafted free agent signing Justin Dirden, who has rapidly hit his way up the ladder this season, and utility infielder Will Wagner, son of former Astros closer Billy, who has performed like a future big leaguer since being drafted in 2021’s 15th round. Despite his elite bloodlines, Will has remained under the radar for much of his amateur and pro career, but that is starting to change with his continued strong performance. \nA member of the 2017 prep class, Wagner was a well regarded but not highly coveted prospect out of Virginia who projected as a solid but unspectacular college player in the eyes of most. He has never been a standout athlete which tempered projections, but a solid defensive acumen on the infield and impressive hitting skills were strong enough that he had little trouble securing D1 offers. He ended up committing to Liberty, and put together two seasons as a full time starter, plus a handful of additional starts his freshman year and the shortened 2020. He was one of the tougher outs in the A-Sun in each of those campaigns, posting a .382 OBP as a 20 year old sophomore in 2019 a .399 as a fourth year junior in 2021, while also boosting his slugging percentage from .444 to .538. \nThe high level production generated some real pro interest for Wagner, but he was still contending with questions about his athleticism, and COVID forcing him to stick around for four years made him an older prospect by draft day 2021, so he remained available into mid day three, when the Astros finally called his name. Houston was a logical destination, and not just because of his father’s success there- despite not lighting up stopwatches or radar guns, Will was able to demonstrate some defensive versatility by playing both second and third base in college, and his plate discipline numbers were in elite territory, so he checked a lot of typical Astros boxes. \nHaving been 22 years old on draft day, the clock was ticking for Wagner more or less right away, so the Astros wasted no time in getting him onto a pro field with Low-A Fayetteville later that summer. There, Wagner continued to demonstrate top flight command of the strike zone, hitting .299/.388/.436 with 5 steals in as many attempts in a 31 game taste. His strong performance gave the Astros enough confidence to push him immediately to High-A Asheville to begin 2022, where he was able to maintain his production with a .276/.392/.405 slash in 199 PAs. His power production continued to be limited, but with a 32/41 BB/K ratio he continued to look like a very polished hitter. \nWith just 76 total minor league games under his belt, the Astros went ahead and pushed Wagner to Double-A in early June. It understandably took him a bit of time to find footing following the promotion- he was under the Mendoza line for much of the rest of the month- but his production has gradually improved since early July, to the point that his slash through 63 games is now a very respectable .258/.372/.387. Wagner maybe 24 years old now, but given his experience level, it’s difficult to take much issue with what he has done at the Double-A level so far. There were concerns that Wagner’s below average bat speed could make him susceptible to velocity in the upper minors, but so far he has proven that his movements are efficient enough to make things work at the plate. \nNobody would deny that Wagner has limitations in his game- his power is mostly to the gaps with the occasional pull side shot, but left handed hitters who control the zone like he does don’t grow on trees, especially ones who can handle multiple infield positions to boot. The rare package of skills that he can provide make him one of the likelier major leaguers in the system after the top tier in my estimation, even though he’s unlikely to ever rank especially close to the top of the system.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3632706-south-carolina-judge-rules-firing-squad-electric-chair-unconstitutional/",
        "description": "A South Carolina judge this week ruled that authorizing the execution of inmates by firing squad or the electric chair is unconstitutional.\n\n\n\nIn a 39-page opinion issued Tuesday, 5th Judicial Circuit Court Judge Jocelyn Newman said South Carolina \"turned back the clock and became the only state in the country in which a person may be forced into the electric chair if he refuses to elect how he will die.\"\n\n\n\n\"In doing so, the General Assembly ignored advances in scientific research and evolving standards of humanity and decency,\" Newman wrote, arguing that executing death row inmates by firing squad or electric chair violates the state's constitution, which protects against cruel, corporal and unusual punishments.\n\n\n\nThe ruling means the state is barred from executing inmates by those methods, but Gov. Henry McMaster (R) said he plans to appeal the case to a higher court, according to The State.\n\n\n\nSouth Carolina has not carried out an execution since 2011 because the state cannot procure the chemicals needed to execute inmates through lethal injection. \n\n\n\nPharmaceutical companies have shied away from providing the necessary materials for lethal injection amid pressure to not support executions. In South Carolina, laws to help procure the drugs have failed to pass in the state legislature.\n\n\n\nLawmakers passed legislation last year that codified death by firing squad into law, giving death row inmates the option to choose between lethal injection, firing squad or the electric chair. \n\n\n\nWith the state unable to procure the materials for lethal injection, that gives inmates two options, with the electric chair the default.\n\n\n\nIn March, South Carolina's Department of Corrections said they were ready to carry out executions by firing squad after spending $53,000 renovating the death chamber of the Capital Punishment Facility at Broad River Correctional Institution in Columbia.\n\n\n\nSeveral civil rights organizations spoke out against the planned executions, including the American Civil Liberties Union of South Carolina and South Carolinians for Alternatives to the Death Penalty.\n\n\n\nHillary Taylor, interim director for the anti-death penalty group, said in May that \"we do not believe that death has a place — that execution has a place — in our criminal justice system.\"\n\n\n\n\"One in nine sentences has to be overturned,\" Taylor said in a statement. \"If we had airplanes where one in nine planes crashed, there would be a problem, and we would stop that. Within the executions we have done, there have been at least six cases of botched executions with the electric chair.\"\n\n\n\nThe state is looking to execute several death row inmates, including Richard Moore, who was convicted in 2001 for the murder of a convenience store clerk.\n\n\n\nMoore and three other inmates filed a case in May 2021 to contest the execution methods by firing squad and electric chair.\n\n\n\nThe South&nbsp;Carolina&nbsp;Supreme Court granted a temporary stay in May of this year after the inmates filed amended complaints ahead of their execution dates in the spring. \n\n\n\nThe 5th Circuit Court heard arguments in August, with experts testifying that firing squads and the electric chair are not perfect methods and can result in excruciating pain for inmates when botched. Other experts called by the state testified that inmates would lose consciousness relatively quickly and thus avoid suffering.\n\n\n\nJudge Newman agreed with the plaintiffs in her ruling this week, writing that in an execution by electric chair — a method only available in seven other states — inmates \"continue to move, breathe, and even scream after the shock is administered,\" while using a firing squad \"constitutes torture\" if fired ammunition does not fully incapacitate the heart.\n\n\n\n\"Because both methods are unconstitutional, the statute’s creation of an inmate’s right 'to elect the manner of their execution' is violated by the fact that an inmate does not have a choice betweentwo constitutional methods of execution,\" the judge wrote.",

        "description": "Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) said that men needed to advocate for women in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's overturning of Roe v. Wade. \n\n\n\nIn an interview with GQ published online Wednesday, the progressive firebrand said that it takes groups that aren't affected by an issue to speak up for those who are often marginalized. \n\n\n\n“But we know that when white folks take up space and say the right thing in rooms of other white people, that is the most shifting activity that can happen, more sometimes than any protest or any person writing a letter to the editor or anything like that. And we need men to be speaking up in that way as well,” Ocasio-Cortez said. \n\n\n\n“But I think men, sometimes they think, I’m not a woman. This doesn’t affect me the most.”\n\n\n\nHer comments were part of a sweeping feature in GQ, highlighting her ascension as a leading progressive on Congress, her struggles with both parties and the recent overturning of Roe. \n\n\n\nOcasio-Cortez said that men are also adversely impacted by the patriarchy, adding that they, too, benefit from the advancement of women’s rights, like the right to abortion.\n\n\n\n“For almost every woman that has gotten an abortion, there’s a man who has either been affected or liberated by that abortion too,” Ocasio-Cortez said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe also cited higher completed suicide rates and lower counts of doctor visits among men, underscoring a societal “stigma around men being vulnerable” that she asserted holds both men and women back.\n\n\n\n“In this moment it’s really only going to be the vulnerability of men, and men talking to other men, that gives us the greatest hope of shifting things the fastest, soonest,” Ocasio-Cortez said.\n\n\n\nThe second-term congresswoman, who rocketed to political stardom when she ousted incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley in the state’s 2018 Democratic primary, also responded to a question about running for president. \n\n\n\nHer experience as a congresswoman, she told GQ, showed her “how deeply and unconsciously, as well as consciously, so many people in this country hate women” and women of color in particular.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“People ask me questions about the future. And realistically, I can’t even tell you if I’m going to be alive in September. ... And it’s not just the right wing. Misogyny transcends political ideology: left, right, center. This grip of patriarchy affects all of us, not just women; men, as I mentioned before, but also, ideologically, there’s an extraordinary lack of self-awareness in so many places.”",

        "description": "Four LGBT and health advocacy groups filed a lawsuit on Wednesday against a Florida rule that prevents people from using Medicaid to pay for gender-affirming medical care.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe rule from the state’s Agency for Health Care Administrators (AHCA), which went into effect last month, removed Medicaid coverage for puberty blockers, hormones and gender-affirming surgeries for transgender Floridians.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA release from Lambda Legal, a civil rights organization that focuses on protecting LGBT rights and one of the groups involved in the lawsuit, stated that the AHCA ignored expert testimony and thousands of public comments opposing the rule during the public comment period of the process.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe organizations filed the lawsuit on behalf of four transgender individuals, including August Dekker, a 28-year-old transgender man.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDekker said in a statement that the rule denies him access to treatment that he is not able to afford otherwise. He said everyone deserves to feel safe in their existence, but the ban will hurt transgender Medicaid beneficiaries’ physical and mental health.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s truly awful and unfair to feel like the state is targeting your existence,” Dekker said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOmar Gonzalez-Pagan, a counsel and health care strategist for Lambda Legal, said the rule is motivated by politics and bias instead of science. He said it ignores the AHCA’s mission to provide “Better Health Care for All Floridians.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKaty DeBriere, the legal director at the Florida Health Justice Project, another one of the groups involved in the suit, said the state is targeting low-income transgender individuals with the rule, which would continue health inequities by eliminating safe and reliable health care for some of Florida’s most marginalized residents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe groups filed the lawsuit against Simone Marstiller, the secretary of the AHCA, in her capacity leading the agency. \n\n\n\nBrock Juarez, the communications director for the ACHA, told The Hill in a statement that only treatments that are found to be safe and effective and meet \"medical necessity criteria\" are to be covered under the agency's rules.\n\n\n\n\"These partisan motivated organizations seem to be so blinded by their own political agenda that they ignore the evidence found in our thorough rulemaking process and in the AHCA report that proceeded it,\" he said.\n\n\n\nThe agency completed a report on gender-affirming care in June at the request of the state health department, concluding that several services for treating gender dysphoria, like puberty blockers, hormones and surgery, are not consistent with \"widely accepted professional medical standards.\"\n\n\n\nThe report also concluded that these treatments have the potential for harmful long-term effects and said that studies supporting these treatments are \"weak to very weak.\"\n\n\n\nThe Lambda Legal release states that a team of legal and medical experts from Yale University and University of Texas Southwestern issued a report debunking claims in the AHCA's report. The team said the report makes \"unfounded\" criticism of robust research and cites sources with \"little or no scientific merit.\"\n\n\n\nThe plaintiffs argue that the rule violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and the Affordable Care Act’s (ACA) protection against sex discrimination. \n\n\n\nThey also argue it violates the Medicaid Act’s requirement for states to provide services to treat physical and mental health conditions and its requirement that eligible recipients receive the same amount of medical assistance as other recipients.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Department of Health and Human Services said in a statement on Wednesday that the rule likely violates Section 1557 of the ACA, which prohibits health programs that receive federal funding from discriminating based on sex and other characteristics.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe department added that it plans to work to protect state Medicaid beneficiaries’ access to gender-affirming care.\n\n\n\nThis story was updated at 4:46 p.m.",

        "description": "Former secretary of State and Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday that  the current Republican Party displays “too many characteristics” of authoritarianism. \n\n\n\n“The problem is, if you go through the hallmarks of authoritarian regimes, you see too many characteristics unfortunately on our Republican side,” Clinton told \"The View.\"\n\n\n\n“My most fervent hope is that Republicans themselves will begin to reject all of that verbally, vocally, in their voting, and kind of reconstitute the Republican Party to where it used to be and not the party of Trump, which I think is very dangerous to the country,” she added.\n\n\n\nHer comments come amid a GOP backlash to President Biden saying last month that the philosophy of the former President Trump-aligned MAGA wing of the Republican party was “like semi-fascism.”\n\n\n\nClinton also criticized the Republican Party in an interview with CBS News on Tuesday, telling the GOP to “grow a backbone” and “stand up to this guy.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Clinton told CBS that she has&nbsp;no plans to ever run for president again, she said she will do everything she can to ensure the next president “respects our democracy and the rule of law and upholds our institutions,\" adding that Trump does not fit the description.\n\n\n\nClinton’s name recently returned to public discourse after several Republicans compared the classified documents recovered from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence to Clinton’s use of a private email server as secretary of State. Clinton hit back at the comparisons, noting that she had no classified emails on the server.\n\n\n\nClinton’s comments on the GOP echo the case that Biden has been making ahead of November's midterm elections, arguing that Trump's sway over the party poses an existential threat to democracy. \n\n\n\n“Not every Republican, not even a majority of Republicans, are MAGA Republicans. Not every Republican embraces their extreme ideology,” the president said last week in Philadelphia. \n\n\n\n“But there’s no question that the Republican Party today is dominated, driven and intimidated by Donald Trump and the MAGA Republicans. And that is a threat to this country.”",

        "description": "Updated September 7, 2022 at 2:55 PM ETPresident Barack Obama and first lady Michelle Obama headed to the White House Wednesday for the unveiling of the couple&#x27;s official portraits.It marked the first time in 10 years since a sitting president has invited former leadership back for a revealing of the portraits — a tradition that stalled when an unveiling did not take place during the Trump years.Tapped for the assignment of a lifetime were artists Robert McCurdy, for the president, and Sharon Sprung, for the first lady.&quot;These portraits have a special significance, Obama said, adding that &quot;it was important to find the right people to paint them.&quot; Obama thanked Sprung for capturing Michelle Obama, &quot;Her grace, her intelligence – and the fact that&#x27;s she&#x27;s fine,&quot; Obama said, as the former first lady rolled her eyes, later thanking him for his &quot;spicy remarks.&quot; Obama said McCurdy captured all his flaws – his grey hair, his large ears – and quipped that he had talked him out of wearing a tan suit for the image.&quot;His work is so precise that at first glance it feels like a photograph,&quot; Obama said, explaining that the style helps viewers connect with the subject, and get an &quot;honest sense&quot; of who he is.Portrait of former President Barack Obama by Robert McCurdyThe White House&quot;When future generations walk these halls and look up at these portraits, I hope they get a better honest sense of who Michelle and I were. And I hope they leave with a deeper understanding that if we could make it here, maybe they can, too. They can do remarkable things, too,&quot; he said.The former first lady spoke about how the tradition of unveiling the portraits matters as part of the peaceful transition of power in America – and as a representation of the American Dream.&quot;If the two of us can end up on the walls of the most famous address in the world, then again it is so important for every young kid who is doubting themselves to believe that they can, too. That is what this country is about,&quot; she said.The president of the White House Historical Association described the paintings as nontraditional and unconventionalIn a video with the Obama Foundation, Sprung and McCurdy discuss the approach they took to painting the couple. &quot;I wanted people to pass by the painting and recognize her, or be more curious about her, or to read more about her, but to get her,&quot; Sprung said.Former first lady Michelle Obama is painted wearing a formal blue dress and is seated on a sofa in the Red Room. The process, Sprung said, took 18 months.Portrait of former first lady Michelle Obama by Sharon SprungThe White HouseIn former President Obama&#x27;s painting, he&#x27;s standing in the center of the canvas, dressed in a black suit with a gray tie.&quot;The subject ultimately for me was the idea of the gaze — two people looking directly at each other with nothing else to load the narrative,&quot; McCurdy said.  &quot;The painting is not telling the story of Barack Obama. It&#x27;s telling the story of the relationship of the viewer with this particular person. And that&#x27;s a two-way street.&quot;Stewart McLaurin, president of the White House Historical Association, described the two paintings as nontraditional, unconventional and different.&quot;To some people they will be a surprise and different because they are nontraditional. To others, they will be very affirming,&quot; McLaurin said.The artist, he noted, depicted only the former president. There is no background. &quot;He is the centerpiece,&quot; McLaurin said. &quot;The portrait of Mrs. Obama is a little bit different than that. It is a very colorful portrait. It highlights her sense of fashion and style. It is depicted in furniture that is easily recognizable from the White House collection. And so there&#x27;s a fitting or a nod to a more traditional feel, but in... a style of painting that I think is also very suitable to her interest and her personality.&quot;A look at the artists, Robert McCurdy and Sharon SprungMcCurdy has a broad portfolio, having done portraits of the Dalai Lama, Toni Morrison, Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Nelson Mandela and Warren Buffett. He is best known for oil paintings that look nearly like photographs.McCurdy said it usually takes him over a year to paint a portrait, and they start with many different actual photos.&quot;This is the speech that everybody gets when they sit for me: So to look directly into the lens. To not smile. Not gesture. And just hold into that moment, again where we&#x27;re trying to extend time rather than slice it like a photograph. We&#x27;re not looking for a gestural moment. We&#x27;re looking for a more meditative or transcendent moment. So that&#x27;s what we do,&quot; McCurdy told the White House Historical Association. &quot;The setup is quite elaborate.&quot;Sprung, who began working as an artist at the age of 19, got started by reaching out to and eventually working with Aaron Shikler, who did the portraits of former first ladies Jacqueline Kennedy and Nancy Reagan as well as and former President John Kennedy.&quot;As that time passed and I got better, people would ask me to do their portrait rather than buy a painting of a different subject,&quot; Sprung said. &quot;That was a great way to start, because then I knew that people wanted what I did, not what I could do.&quot;Sprung is currently working on portraits of Patsy Mink, the first woman of color and Asian-American woman elected to Congress. Previously she did a portrait of Jeannette Rankin, another former representative.The White House Historical Association has organized the presidential portraits since the 1960s, and has since made it a goal to acquire portraits of all presidents and first ladies. These portraits of the Obamas, unlike those commissioned for the National Portrait Gallery and unveiled in 2018, will hang in the White House. According to the association, presidents and first ladies often select their artists before leaving the White House. But the process for completing the paintings can take years.When was the last White House portrait unveiling?In 2012, Obama invited George W. Bush and his wife Laura Bush to the White House for their unveilings. That event has gone down in history as a comedic affair, with Obama quipping that Bush left him a &quot;really good TV sports package&quot; and Bush dropping jokes about his painting. Bush noted that when the British burned the White House in 1814, Dolley Madison famously saved a portrait &quot;of the first George W.&quot;&quot;Now Michelle, if anything happens,&quot; Bush said, gesturing to his portrait, &quot;there&#x27;s your man.&quot;Although McLaurin said the Obama portraits have been done for some undisclosed period of time, there is no specific protocol or instruction for the timing for the unveiling.&quot;Perhaps the most classic example was the Kennedy portraits [which] were not revealed until the Nixon presidency, and even so they were done so quietly,&quot; said McLaurin.Before Obama and Bush, Bush hosted the Clintons in 2004 and the Clintons hosted George H.W. and Barbara Bush in 1995, which has led some to believe the tradition was skipped during the Trump administration.Representatives for Obama and Trump did not respond to requests for comment.The Trumps, however, have begun conversations with the White House Historical Association regarding their own portraits and an artist have been identified, according to McLaurin, though he is unsure where they are in the process of creating the portraits.&quot;That takes time. But it will happen eventually, just like they all do,&quot; said McLaurin. &quot;And at some point in time, they will be added to the White House collection.&quot; Copyright 2022",

The roster moves continued for the Pittsburgh Pirates on Wednesday as it was announced that they claimed 1B/C Zack Collins and RHP Junior Fernandez off waivers.\n\n\nThe Pirates have claimed 1B/C Zack Collins from the Blue Jays and RHP Junior Fernández from the Cardinals. Both players have been optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis. To make room on the 40-man roster, Cam Vieaux was designated for assignment.— Justice delos Santos (@justdelossantos) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nCollins, 27, was designated for assignment yesterday by the Toronto Blue Jays after putting up a miserable .194/.266/.417 slash line this season. The former first round pick of the Chicago White Sox never caught wind in the MLB as he failed to post a batting average above .200 all but one year, which was in 2021 when he hit .210.\n\n\nZACK COLLINS MASHES @CanadaBarstool pic.twitter.com/GFxCXF3Ycw— Starting 9 (@Starting9) April 24, 2022\n\n\n\nFernandez, 25, appeared in 13 games for the St. Louis Cardinals this season and posted a 2.93 ERA in just over 15 innings pitched, all of which were in relief. \nThe Cardinals designated him for assignment on Monday to make room for RHP Jack Flaherty, who was activated off the 60-day injured list. \nFernandez is no stranger to the Pirates, however, as back on Aug. 11, 2019, he made his MLB debut against the Bucs. In that game, he gave up two earned runs and struck two hitters out over two-thirds innings pitched.\n\n\nIn 2019, hitters swung at 30 of Junior Fernandez's sliders.They whiffed on 22 of them (73.3 percent!). pic.twitter.com/7UjiBeTdgN— Max Goldstein (@MaxSportsStudio) January 4, 2020\n\n\n\nBragging rights to whoever can guess who he gave up the runs to.\nBoth Collins and Fernandez were optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis.

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/chromebook-rugged-edu-drop-test-water-spills-hinges/",
        "description": "Ruggedized Chromebooks are nothing new at this point.  We&#8217;ve seen these classroom-ready devices in all sorts of shapes, forms and sizes over the years.  And we&#8217;ve also taken the claims that manufacturers make about them at face value the entire time, too.  To be fair, I always assumed the claims about the ability to survive water, 4-foot drops and a bit of stress on the chassis were all legit for all of these rugged Chromebooks.  But then again, we&#8217;ve never really tested it out, either.  So, we thought it was time to do just that and then some.\n\n\n\nPutting ruggedness to the test\n\n\n\nFor our initial tests, we wanted to prove that the advertised claims actually stand up to some pretty intense handling.  In a controlled setting, we tested the strength of the HP Chromebook 11 MK EE G9&#8217;s (ugh, Chromebook names) anchored key caps, the ability for the device to resist a full cup of water (nearly 12 ounces), the ability of the hinge to absorb incredibly rough handling, and finally the Chromebook&#8217;s ability to withstand some pretty nasty 4-foot drops onto hardwood.\n\n\n\nAll of these characteristics are listed on HP&#8217;s official spec sheet for this particular Chromebook, so we stayed completely within bounds of what the manufacturer claims it can withstand.  The latter parts of our testing strays far outside those boundaries, but we&#8217;ll get to that afterwards.  For these initial tests, we really wanted to take HP (and all other EDU Chromebook makers for that matter) up on their assertions that these rugged Chromebooks can handle a beating.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rugged Chromebook passed with flying colors\n\n\n\nAnd handle a beating it did!  Sure, I was able to pry off a key cap with a butter knife, but attempting to do so with just my hands felt nearly impossible.  The ridiculous amount of water spilled directly on the keyboard and trackpad, the holding of the device by the corner of the display, and the multiple drops from around 4-feet had no ill effect on the device whatsoever.\n\n\n\nOur qualification for passing each test was the ability for the Chromebook to still compute afterwards, and with each one, the device kept plugging away just fine.  Apart from the missing key cap, you probably wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell that we put it through some serious stress.\n\n\n\nSo that concluded our initial tests with some very impressive results.  At the end of the day, you can feel quite confident that these rugged Chromebooks are capable of withstanding ridiculous amounts of abuse and are able to keep functioning just fine in the aftermath.  I expected the water or the drops to pose a problem, but I was very impressed by the ability of this Chromebook to take a beating and just keep getting back up off the mat.\n\n\n\nTaking it to the next level\n\n\n\nFor the next part of the video, we really wanted to get a specific point across: though rugged Chromebooks can take a serious beating, they are not indestructible.  The drop-ready and spill-resistant chassis can only take so much, and we wanted to put that to the test.\n\n\n\nSo, in an effort to prove this out, we took to the roof of a nearby apartment building, a solid 2.5 stories off the ground, and dropped the Chromebook on the asphalt from the top.  It was a little nerve-wracking and a lot of fun, but the end result was a technically broken Chromebook.  \n\n\n\nI say &#8216;technically&#8217; because to our complete surprise, nearly all of the chassis was still intact after the huge fall.  The display cracked and we couldn&#8217;t get the display output to function any more, so the Chromebook was definitely unusable after this test.  Still, we lost no more keys, we had very little breakage in the chassis, and there&#8217;s a chance that a replaced screen might have brought life back to the device.\n\n\n\nAnd then we did it again.  At this point, the device was toast, so we went for one more drop to see if we could get the huge explosion of plastic we were expecting.  But this Chromebook wasn&#8217;t ready to fall apart, and most of it stayed together and held up even upon another 2.5-story drop.  This time around, parts of the base and lid did separate, but it was far less destructive than you would expect.\n\n\n\nWhile it goes to show you these Chromebooks aren&#8217;t invincible, it does show just how crazy-rugged they actually are.  If you are buying one of these for a school or for a student, keep that in mind.  Sure, you should still treat it like a laptop and be careful with it whenever possible.  But you can also take a bit of a breath, relax, and know that these rugged Chromebooks are ready to take on the worst treatment and live to tell about it.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Workers in the United States work hard, but most live with the anxiety that they or someone they love will experience a health problem that they won’t be able to address without losing their income or even their job. And many parents who are welcoming a new child cannot take paid time away from work to concentrate their attention on their growing family.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA lack of paid family and medical leave harms not just workers and their families but the broader economy by pushing workers out of the labor force and making it harder for them to go back to work when the temporary issue abates.\n\n\n\nA federal paid leave program would ensure that workers across the country can continue to support their families when family or medical concerns arise — as they are bound to do. But until the federal government acts, more states need to step up because workers can’t wait any longer. And if the past 30 years have shown us anything, it’s that the market alone won’t provide this support. Only&nbsp;one in four employers&nbsp;currently provide paid family leave, and only&nbsp;one in 20 of the lowest-paid workers&nbsp;benefit from that protection.\n\n\n\nMeaningful action at the state level in recent years has improved protections for workers in some regions. This spring,&nbsp;Maryland&nbsp;and&nbsp;Delaware&nbsp;became the newest states to join nine others and the District of Columbia in establishing their own paid leave programs. These programs — in California, Connecticut, D.C., Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island and Washington — allowed&nbsp;millions of workers&nbsp;to take time off work to care for themselves or loved ones. Still, roughly&nbsp;two-thirds&nbsp;of U.S. workers live in states without a program.\n\n\n\nWhy are we the only wealthy nation that lacks a federal program? When our federal social insurance system (composed of programs like Unemployment Insurance, Social Security, and Medicare) was established,&nbsp;fewer than 1 in 3 workers were women&nbsp;— and women who worked were mostly women of color, immigrants and women with low socioeconomic status. Policymakers crafting the social insurance system centered the needs of white, male workers with few caregiving responsibilities and pushed female workers’ needs for economic security aside.\n\n\n\nGiven that nearly every worker today is likely to need to take paid leave at some point in their lives, the lack of paid leave hurts all of us. Indeed, experts across the political spectrum agree that paid leave is crucial to bringing the social insurance system into the 21st century and redressing the inequities baked into our policies. Extending paid family and medical leave to the full workforce is among the key steps that policymakers should consider to assure adequate income across the lifespan according to a&nbsp;recent report from the National Academy of Social Insurance.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe evidence from states that have these programs make their benefits abundantly clear. In Washington state, the most recent state to implement paid leave,&nbsp;over 290,000 claims were approved in 2020 and 2021, providing income to help families pay their bills while they attended to the needs of a new child, their own serious medical need or the medical need of a loved one. In California, which has the longest-established program, the risk of poverty and&nbsp;infant hospitalizations are down&nbsp;while&nbsp;parental involvement&nbsp;and&nbsp;mothers’ employment levels are up.\n\n\n\nCalifornia’s paid leave law&nbsp;reduced small businesses’ costs&nbsp;and research in&nbsp;both California and New Jersey&nbsp;showed mothers are more likely to work in the five years after having a child, benefiting not only families’ economic security but states’ economic growth.\n\n\n\nIn the long run, federal action is needed to ensure universal access to paid leave. A range of different state programs poses challenges for multi-state employers, and, of course, passing a new paid leave law in Pennsylvania won’t help workers in Mississippi. But implementing state programs now allows us to experiment with the policy and make improvements. It also provides models for a strong federal paid leave program in the future.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, each time a state passes a paid leave law, it creates positive change in the lives of its workers and the strength of its economy. Our state legislatures are powerful, often overlooked, political bodies. They should all ensure that no worker needs to choose between paying the bills or caring for a loved one.\n\n\n\nAlix Gould-Werth is the director of Family Economic Security Policy at The Washington Center for Equitable Growth and Kathleen Romig is the director of Social Security and Disability Policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.",

        "description": "Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) tested positive for COVID-19, his office announced on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n“After experiencing mild symptoms, @SenatorMenendez tested positive for #COVID19,” Menendez's communications director, Francisco Pelayo, tweeted. “He's following @CDCgov guidelines while working remotely for the people of NJ. The senator is in good spirits and incredibly thankful to have been fully vaccinated and boosted.”\n\n\n\nMenendez is the third Democratic senator to test positive for the virus this week.\n\n\n\nSen. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) announced he tested positive earlier on Wednesday while in India for a planned eight-day trip as part of an economic delegation. His office said Ossoff would isolate in the country and expects to return to the United States next week.\n\n\n\nSen. Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.) on Tuesday announced she also tested positive and will work remotely throughout the week.\n\n\n\nSen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.) will also miss votes this week, his office said. Burr is recovering from hip replacement surgery, but the North Carolina Republican said he similarly expects to return to Washington next week.\n\n\n\nThe three lawmakers’ diagnoses and Burr’s absence comes as the Senate returns to the Capitol this week after a multi-week recess.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith the Senate’s 50-50 makeup, any absence can swing the odds of a piece of legislation's success if lawmakers vote strictly along party lines.\n\n\n\nThe chamber is slated to hold multiple votes on President Biden’s judicial nominees this week.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are also looking to pass a bill that would protect marriage equality on the federal level by requiring that states recognize marriages performed legally in other states. However, infected lawmakers'  offices indicated they plan to return next week, likely before a vote.\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on Wednesday he will bring a vote to the floor “in the coming weeks” as Democrats look to garner Republican support since the bill would require at least 10 Republican votes if all Democrats vote in favor.\n\n\n\nThe Senate also has to pass government funding and reauthorize Food and Drug Administration user fees before Sept. 30.",

        "description": "The Federal Reserve’s top regulatory watchdog said Wednesday the bank will test out ways next year to help financial firms figure out the risks they face from climate change and climate-related events.\n\n\n\nFed Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr said in a Wednesday speech the bank will launch a pilot exercise next year for the major banks it supervises to help get a better sense of the risks climate change poses to the financial system. The exercise would likely require firms to explain how several different climate-related financial shocks would affect their books and ability to serve customers.\n\n\n\n“The Federal Reserve is working to understand how climate change may pose risks to individual banks and to the financial system,” Barr said in a Wednesday speech at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.\n\n\n\nBarr’s remarks were his first since being confirmed to the Fed in July as the bank’s top regulatory official. As vice chair of supervision, Barr spearheads the Fed’s oversight of major financial firms, including the Fed’s annual stress testing of the largest U.S. banks.\n\n\n\n“The Federal Reserve's mandate in this area is important, but narrow, focused on our supervisory responsibilities and our role in promoting a safe and stable financial system,” Barr said.\n\n\n\nSince President Biden’s election in 2020, the Fed has moved toward studying the various ways climate change and a global shift away from fossil fuel energy could affect the financial system.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFinancial experts say banks and financial firms could face steep losses as the pace and intensity of natural disasters increase, causing massive insurance payouts and reducing the value of properties in areas prone to extreme weather. A steep, steady reduction in fossil fuel usage and uptake of renewable energy sources could also trigger shockwaves through the financial system.\n\n\n\nWhile central banks and financial watchdogs around the world have largely agreed on the need to assess climate-related financial risks, the issue is politically divisive in the U.S.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have long pushed the Fed and other financial regulators to pay closer attention to the ways climate change could rattle the financial system. Some progressive lawmakers and activists have also called on the federal government to steer financing away from fossil fuel-related projects and toward initiatives meant to fight climate change.\n\n\n\nFed officials from both parties have said the bank should and will study the ways climate change could pose risks to the banks it regulates but have refused to use its regulatory power in pursuit of climate-related goals.\n\n\n\nThose assurances have done little to convince Republican lawmakers, who have blasted the Fed for even considering climate-related financial risks and accused the bank of plotting against politically disfavored industries.",

        "description": "Andrew Yang is a failed politician. His two campaigns for public office &#8212; the 2020 presidential race and the 2021 race for New York City mayor &#8212; ended in defeat. Whatever it is Yang is selling, it appears voters just aren&#8217;t buying it.In 2022, Yang is back with an even less marketable idea: a so-called &#8220;moderate party&#8221; that will supposedly be the answer to the polarization in American politics.FrameLab is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support this work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.There are some major problems with this idea. The biggest: It&#8217;s basically impossible to unify political moderates behind any full set of ideas. This explains why this supposed moderate party &#8212; founded by Yang, former New Jersey Gov. Christine Todd Whitman and former Rep. David Jolly (both longtime Republicans) &#8212; has zero ideas in its platform.&nbsp;The moment a &#8220;moderate party&#8221; takes a position on a controversial issue, the folly of the enterprise will be exposed.To be clear, political moderates do exist. These are biconceptuals &#8212; people who are conservative on some issues and progressive on others. Americans use both conservative and progressive modes of thought, which they apply to different areas in different ways. There is no singular &#8220;moderate&#8221; worldview because there is no one set of ideas that defines a &#8220;center&#8221; or &#8220;moderation.&#8221;Remember that there is no ideology of the moderate &#8212; no set of views held by all moderates. A moderate progressive has mostly progressive views, but also some conservative ones. A moderate conservative has mostly conservative views, but also some progressive ones. But there is no single set of policies that defines a &#8220;middle.&#8221;&#8212; &#8220;The All NEW Don&#8217;t Think of An Elephant: Know Your Values and Frame The Debate.&#8221;When we think of a moderate, the classic model is someone who is liberal on social issues but conservative on things like taxes. Yet such moderates tend to find their place within one of the two major parties, becoming moderate Democrats or Republicans.Take, for example, the issue of forced birth. What is the uniformly moderate position on whether a woman has a right to choose to avoid forced birth by getting an abortion?&nbsp;What is the uniformly moderate position on whether the Supreme Court was right to overturn Roe v. Wade?Yang can&#8217;t say. When asked this very question by Jim Acosta on CNN, Yang sputtered his way through a non-answer.&#8220;I personally think that women&#8217;s reproductive rights are fundamental human rights, but the Forward Party has a, not left or right, but forward stance on even the most divisive and contentious issues,&#8221; Yang said.&#8220;You wanna run the country, you&#8217;re gonna have to make some hard decisions, Andrew,&#8221; Acosta replied.&nbsp;This is precisely the point. If there was a way for a party to succeed in politics without taking a position on controversial or polarizing issues, someone would have figured it out by now.What does a &#8220;forward&#8221; even mean as a political position? Should we move forward by protecting the fundamental right of women to determine their own healthcare? Or should we move forward with laws that impose forced birth on women whether they want it or not?Yang appears to believe there&#8217;s no need for his organization to take a side on abortion rights, which is an issue of fundamental freedom.The party&#8217;s slogan should be: &#8220;Not left. Not right. Nowhere.&#8221;The Yang party has an untenable &#8212; and immoral &#8212; political position.&nbsp;&nbsp;As Archbishop Desmond Tutu said: &#8220;If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.The Forward Party is based on a backward idea that doesn&#8217;t make sense from a political or cognitive science aspect. But dumb ideas can also be dangerous.But with enough money and publicity, Yang&#8217;s delusional party could attract just enough third-party votes to harm the Democratic Party in key states, as has happened in past races.It&#8217;s hard to see how aiding and abetting an increasingly authoritarian Republican Party will help to increase political moderation. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s clear that Yang isn&#8217;t interested in the political repercussions as much as he is interested in self-promotion for his bland ambition.Why would anyone believe that Democrats would switch to Yang&#8217;s moderate party? Is it because Democrats tend to think of themselves as \"open-minded\"? People that \"open-minded\" would have no clear thoughts left that have not flown out of their brains. No one who believes in the Democratic Party's ideas would abandon them for nothingness.Moderation is the moderation of something &#8212; something right or left. Moderation is not neutral. Yang misunderstands the very notion of moderation, and therefore what a \"moderate\" is. That&#8217;s why he foolishly believes he can build a political movement around the absence of positive ideas.FrameLab is a reader-supported publication.

        "description": "Photo by Liam Nguyen on UnsplashDonald Trump&#8217;s world is made up of two kinds of people: Winners and Losers.FrameLab is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support this work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.&#8220;Donald Trump has made&nbsp;clear time and time again that, in his view, the worst thing that can happen to a person is to be judged a &#8216;loser,&#8217;&#8221; wrote Peter Wehner of The Atlantic in February.Trump, of course, depicts himself as a winner &#8211; someone who is always right, always strong and always victorious. In contrast, he views &#8220;losers&#8221; as those who are weak, unsuccessful &#8211; or who make personal sacrifices for the greater good.For example, Trump has regularly described American soldiers as &#8220;losers.&#8221; In 2018, he reportedly canceled a trip to visit the graves of Americans who died fighting against Hitler&#8217;s Germany in World War Two because he considered the dead soldiers to be &#8220;losers&#8221; and &#8220;suckers.&#8221; (And because he didn&#8217;t want to get his hair wet!)&#8220;In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, &#8216;Why should I go to that cemetery? It&#8217;s filled with losers,&#8217;&#8221; according to a story in The Atlantic. &#8220;In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as &#8216;suckers&#8217; for getting killed.&#8221;Trump also infamously called Sen. John McCain a &#8220;loser&#8221; because McCain&#8217;s plane was shot down over Hanoi and captured by the North Vietnamese in 1967. He remained a prisoner of war&nbsp;until 1973 and sustained wounds that left him with lifelong physical disabilities. Trump, on the other hand, avoided the Vietnam War by claiming to have bone spurs.Yet Trump had the gall to call McCain a &#8220;loser&#8221; for what he suffered during his service in Vietnam.&nbsp;&#8220;I like people who weren&#8217;t captured,&#8221; said Trump. &nbsp;In contrast, Trump saw himself as a winner because he avoided the draft by getting a doctor to diagnose him as having bone spurs that made him unfit for the military.In reality, of course, Trump is a big loser.&nbsp;He&#8217;s a serially bankrupt businessman who lost the popular vote twice. In 2020, he lost the presidential election to Joe Biden. Trump then fomented the January 6 insurrection, a violent but failed coup attempt that tried to make Loser Trump into a winner by force.Adding to Trump&#8217;s woeful litany of failures: His business dealings are under investigation. His former chief financial officer, Allen&nbsp;Weisselberg, is set to go to trial on tax fraud charges. Trump himself could possibly face charges for his role in the insurrection and related schemes to overturn the election through fraudulent schemes.All of this has definitively established Trump as a loser. This is fatal to his brand because Trump sold himself to his followers as a winner &#8211; even saying that his supporters would \"get tired of winning\" because was such a winner.Yet Trump&nbsp;lost to Joe Biden, a leader he regularly derides as weak. What does it say about Trump that he would lose to Biden? Trump would have to be weaker than Biden for this to happen. Once again, by his own definition, Trump is undeniably a loser.Being seen as a loser is what Trump fears this most. The &#8220;loser&#8221; label undermines his status as an authoritarian figure, making it impossible to uphold his image as a &#8220;strict father&#8221; conservative. A strict father must be a strong winner, not a whiny loser who gets defeated by politicians he publicly disregards as weak.This helps explain why he is so focused on lying about&nbsp;the 2020 election. For Trump to be seen as a strong leader and a winner, his followers must believe his fictional story about the 2020 election. They must believe that the election was stolen from Trump, and that Trump actually won big but has been cheated out of victory. This fairy tale shields his ego and image, and it keeps the support of his most fervent supporters. As long as they see Trump as an unfairly disenfranchised winner, he retains his power over them.But, sensing Trump&#8217;s inherent weakness, some members of the Republican establishment have begun trying to distance themselves from Trump the loser. The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post have attacked him as unfit for office. Rupert Murdoch&#8217;s Fox channel, which helped to propel Trump to power, is now giving him the cold shoulder.Republicans like Mike Pence and Ron DeSantis, former Trump acolytes, have begun to build the case for their own candidacies. (Yet, as authoritarians, they will fall back in line with Trump if he manages to seize power again.) But their current efforts to move the Republican Party beyond Trump demonstrates the degree to which his status as a loser has damaged him and made him vulnerable to challenge.But let&#8217;s be clear: This big loser remains a danger to the nation. His failed insurrection demonstrated the fact that he is willing to engage in a violent overthrow of democracy in order to maintain power. If he manages to retain control of the GOP, and if he somehow returns to power, there is no limit to the amount of illegality and damage he will be willing to do to avenge his humiliation and prove himself a \"winner.\"He would be aided and abetted by a Republican Party that will do anything to impose its minority beliefs on the majority of Americans &#8211; even if it means pretending that a loser is a winner.Further Readings:&#8220;Can Ron DeSantis displace Donald Trump?&#8221; Dexter Filkins, The New Yorker&#8220;Once home to Trump, Fox now ignores him,&#8221; Jeremy W.

        "description": "Photo by Drei Kubik on UnsplashIf liberals do not concern themselves very seriously and very quickly with the unity of their own philosophy and with morality and the family, they will not merely continue to lose elections but will as well bear responsibility for the success of conservatives in turning back the clock on progress in America &#8212; &#8220;Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think,&#8221; 1996FrameLab is a reader-supported publication. To receive new posts and support my work, consider becoming a free or paid subscriber.These words, written when Bill Clinton was president, have regrettably come true. Even as far back as three decades ago, it was clear that Republicans were intent on repealing things like abortion rights, as they have now succeeded in doing for tens of millions of women.All of us know that this project to undo progress won&#8217;t stop there. Today&#8217;s Republican Party has devolved into an overtly authoritarian force. Its goal: to impose its twisted version of morality on every aspect of our lives. As laid out in &#8220;Moral Politics&#8221; nearly three decades ago, their moral worldview is a hierarchical structure that serves the interests of the long-held status quo.The main goal of &#8220;conservatism&#8221; has always been the conservation of patriarchy and racism to preserve dominant social status for the wealthy, the white, the male, the Christian, etc. In the Trump era, Republicans have made it clear that they will no longer let elections stand in the way of getting what they want. As they see it, there is no wrong way to achieve what they believe to be right. The ends justify the means when you are &#8220;right.&#8221;It&#8217;s hard to defeat such an incisive and organized belief system with lists of policies, but this is essentially what Democrats have long tried to do. There have been some bright exceptions, like Barack Obama&#8217;s 2008 campaign. For the most part, however, Democrats have consistently allowed Republicans to win the framing war. (A subject on which Dr. Lakoff has written several books&#8230;)In 2022, at least one Democratic leader appears to grasp this failure, and he&#8217;s trying to do something about it. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has gained national attention over the past few weeks for his efforts to push Democrats to sharpen their communications efforts and reframe the debate. In ads, tweets and media appearances, Newsom has launched a one-man campaign to rally Democrats in defense of freedom.&#8220;Freedom is under attack in your state,&#8221; said Newsom in an advertisement that ran on Fox News in the state of Florida. &#8220;Republican leaders &#8212; they&#8217;re banning books, making it harder to vote, restricting speech in classrooms, even criminalizing women and doctors. I urge all of you to join the fight, or join us in California, where we still believe in freedom.&#8221;Newsom has also sought to reframe the meaning of the phrase &#8220;pro-life,&#8221; arguing that a true pro-life agenda would support things like healthcare, expanded education, gun safety protections and policies to reduce pollution and fight climate change.&#8220;Spare me their mantra on being pro-life,&#8221; Newsom said of Republican states rushing to make abortion illegal. &#8220;They don't deserve that status.&#8221;On Friday, Newsom unveiled a new ad campaign, this one targeting the state of Texas. The ads frame gun protection laws as &#8220;pro life&#8221; and blast Texas Gov. Greg Abbott for supporting abortion restrictions that endanger lives.&#8220;If Texas can ban abortion and endanger lives, California can ban deadly weapons of war and save lives. If Governor Abbott truly wants to protect the right to life, we urge him to follow California&#8217;s lead,&#8221; the ads read.Newsom&#8217;s communications campaign has led to speculation that he may run for president. Such speculation aside, it&#8217;s refreshing to see a Democratic leader finally try to proactively reframe the debate. At a time when the Republican Party has made it clear that they its members do not consider democracy and freedom as permanent features of life in the United States, it&#8217;s important to say that.Freedom is the most crucial idea in America. We all cherish and support freedom, yet the very meaning of the word is disputed. Freedom means different things to different people, depending on their moral worldview. Over time, our definition of freedom has been expanded to include a greater number of people, and our freedoms have expanded in a progressive direction. We have seen an expansion of citizen participation and voter rights, the expansion of opportunity, the expansion of worker rights, and the expansion of public education. All of these have helped to expand freedom for a greater number of Americans.What radical Republicans aim to do is reverse many of these hard-won gains and go back to the time before these progressive freedoms were established. They want to conserve their own distorted version of freedom &#8212; a &#8220;freedom&#8221; that does not include many of the freedoms that have been expanded over the past centuries to include more people and more situations. They want to undo voting rights, worker protections, civil rights and environmental protections &#8212; all essential to modern American freedom. Their successful effort to undo Roe v. Wade after decades of trying attests to their zeal for rolling back women&#8217;s freedom.&#8220;Freedom defines what America is &#8212; and it is now up for grabs. The radical right is in the process of redefining the very idea. To lose freedom is a terrible thing; to lose the idea of freedom is even worse.&#8221; &#8212; &#8220;Whose Freedom?: The Battle Over America&#8217;s Most Important Idea,&#8221; 2006So, what can be done? First, Democrats must do a better job of speaking openly about what&#8217;s at stake: freedom. That&#8217;s what Newsom is trying to do. For decades, radical Republicans have sought to lay claim to the words &#8220;freedom&#8221; and &#8220;liberty&#8221; by constantly applying them to Republican ideas policies. Rarely have Democrats competed to define these terms, despite the fact that they are crucial to American political thought.And so we now live in a time when our very freedoms are at stake, thanks to longstanding Republican efforts to roll back the clock on democracy and freedom.Newsom has the right idea, but it will take more than one governor to reframe the debate after decades of failure by the Democratic establishment. Remember: This is not about buzz words or slogans. It&#8217;s no mere &#8220;messaging problem.&#8221; It&#8217;s about exercising a basic effort to define the ideas and values that unite most Americans, and it&#8217;s about clearly saying how those ideas and values are threatened by Republican authoritarianism.Further readings:Gavin Newsom: &#8216;Florida Freedom,&#8217; Washington Post, 2022&#8216;Whose Freedom?&#8217; by George Lakoff, New York Times, 2006&#8216;Freedom&#8217; Means Something Different to Liberals and Conservatives.

        "description": "Photo by Ishaq Robin on UnsplashIn this age of disinformation and propaganda, we&#8217;re lucky to have an increasing number of writers thinking about how political framing and communications strategies shape our reality. They are helping to illuminate how political actors tilt narratives to their own benefit and use journalistic processes in order to undermine democracy.Below are some crucial, thought-provoking reads that we highly recommend to FrameLab fans.How the press helps fascism&nbsp;In a must-read interview with Prof. Jay Rosen of NYU, former Chicago newspaper editor Mark Jacob offers up a searing indictment of political news coverage. Since leaving journalism in 2016, Jacob has become a passionate critic of flawed journalistic processes that give equal weight to truth and lies.&#8220;I used to edit Page 1 stories for the Chicago Tribune, including many from Washington,&#8221; wrote Jacob in a series of tweets that got Rosen&#8217;s attention. &#8220;In this thread, I explain why the media (including me) have been unintentionally complicit in the rise of fascism that threatens our democracy.&#8221;Jacob elaborates on his critique in his interview with Rosen. Among other things, he describes a newsroom culture in which editors and reporters end up &#8220;thinking of a news story as a stage that allowed Republicans and Democrats to perform their talking points, rather than as a way to inform readers about the issues and the facts as much as possible.&#8221;While this approach is problematic under any circumstance, it&#8217;s especially dangerous in an age of weaponized lies, rising fascism and attempted insurrection. Says Jacob:The Republican disinformation about the Jan. 6 committee, for example. If you&#8217;re obligated to run a quote by Republican leaders on that, you&#8217;re going to run a lie. And if you don&#8217;t debunk it at the same time, you&#8217;re enabling the liars.Read the interview in its entirety: &#8220;He used to edit political stories at the Chicago Tribune. Now he says the press is failing our democracy,&#8221; by Jay Rosen at PressThink.And how journalists can outwit authoritarianism&#8230;How can journalists do a better job of protecting the truth (and democracy) against authoritarian tactics? Margaret Sullivan of the Washington Post highlights tips from a new 28-page resource called &#8220;The Authoritarian Playbook: a media guide.&#8221;The guide, produced by Protect Democracy, outlines the tactics authoritarians use to gain control in society. Sullivan summarizes the authoritarian tactics outlined in the guide:They attempt to politicize independent institutions. They spread disinformation. They aggrandize executive power at the expense of checks and balances. They quash criticism and dissent. They specifically target vulnerable or marginalized communities. They work to corrupt elections. They stoke violence.The guide also suggests ways in which reporters and editors can outwit authoritarian tactics to protect the truth (and democracy). For example:The report urges journalists not to unwittingly help spread disinformation. Don&#8217;t magnify political lies by repeating them in headlines. Beware of the &#8216;illusory truth effect,&#8217; in which disinformation can be spread inadvertently by stories that seek to debunk it.Truth sandwich, anyone?We&#8217;ll be poring over the guide, which Sullivan recommends as essential reading for every citizen interested in the preservation of democracy.&#8220;While the guide is intended for journalists, every American would benefit from reading it &#8212; especially in conjunction with the House committee hearings on the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection,&#8221; writes Sullivan.Read the entire column: &#8220;How journalists can spot the signs of autocracy &#8212; and help ward it off,&#8221; by Margaret Sullivan at the Washington Post.Are you helping Marjorie Taylor Greene?On that note, the Blue Walls newsletter drills down on how Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene uses Trumpian outrage tactics to attract a steady stream of criticism from Democrats. Of course, this only helps her to strengthen her base.&nbsp;From Blue Walls:But here&#8217;s the thing: She&#8217;s playing us.Maybe this isn&#8217;t intentional. Maybe she&#8217;s brilliant enough to know exactly how to titillate our liberal brains and make us join her viral marketing team, again.Doesn&#8217;t matter.The result is the same. Her job is to prove that we, the libs, hate her. And in a district that&#8217;s&nbsp;45% more Republican&nbsp;than the average congressional district, that counts as constituent service.Trump may be off of Twitter, but social media is full of other MAGA types saying outrageous things in order to provoke a response. They largely follow the strategy we laid out in &#8220;Taxonomy of Trump Tweets&#8221; in January 2018.Unfortunately, Trump&#8217;s political apprentices continue to use these tactics successfully in 2022. And too many of us continue to take the bait.Read the entire post: &#8220;How to get off the Marjorie Taylor Greene viral marketing team&#8221; by LOLGOP at Blue Walls.And finally&#8230;An age of mass hysteria?What explains Trump&#8217;s effect on his most loyal followers? New York Times columnist Charles Blow describes Trump&#8217;s power as an ability to create &#8220;mass hysteria.&#8221;By feeding them a steady diet of lies and outrage, Trump has whipped his supporters up in a frenzy of disreality. Disconnected from reality because of their blind obedience to Trump, they live in a world of alternate facts. On January 6, 2021, this mass hysteria led to a violent insurrection at the United States Capitol.Blow compares the former president&#8217;s effect on his followers to other notable instances of &#8220;psychotic contagion&#8221; in history:There were relatively limited and brief hysterias, like the dancing plague of 1518, when hundreds of people in the European city of Strasbourg (then part of the Holy Roman Empire, but now part of France) joined in a seemingly inexplicable &#8220;dancing epidemic&#8221; that lasted for weeks, as people fell dead of strokes and heart attacks.And who can forget the Salem witch trials of the late 1600s? After multiple people were accused of practicing witchcraft, 19 were hanged, several died in jail and another was crushed to death.Why it&#8217;s important:&nbsp;Trump&#8217;s ability to frame reality for his followers demonstrates the power of his authoritarian communication strategies &#8212; and why he remains a danger to democracy. The former president has tapped deeply into the conservative psyche, and he&#8217;s proven his willingness to abuse this power to further his political interests.

        "description": "Twitter in the crosshairs. Photo by Jeremy Bezanger on UnsplashElon Musk seems clearly brilliant about a few things, like rocket ships and electric cars. On many other subjects, however, Musk clearly has no clue what he&#8217;s talking about. Unfortunately, his supersized hubris blinds him to this fact. This is especially true on the subject of politics, where Musk regularly demonstrates a sophomoric grasp of reality. But it extends to other areas as well.In 2018, Musk proposed using submarines to rescue a group of Thai children trapped in a cave. When the lead researcher rejected the submarine as an unworkable solution, Musk called him a pedophile. In the end, all of the children survived with help from actual cave rescue experts (and without any help from Musk&#8217;s fantasy submarine).In 2020, when California was desperately in need of ventilators to help COVID patients, Musk heroically offered to donate 1,000 of the devices. But instead of shipping the real ventilator units, Musk dumped a supply of much cheaper (and basically useless) BiPAP machines on the state&#8217;s hospitals. Lacking any medical expertise, Musk perhaps didn&#8217;t know the difference between the two devices.Also in 2020, Musk infamously called public anxiety over COVID &#8220;dumb,&#8221; blasted public safety measures as &#8220;fascist&#8221; and predicted a quick end to the pandemic. Two years later, over 1 million Americans are dead and we find ourselves in the middle of yet another surge of a new variant.We also find ourselves watching yet another tiresome public display of Musk&#8217;s unfortunate tendency to express loud opinions on subjects where he lacks knowledge.Last month, the Tesla impresario declared his plans to buy San Francisco-based Twitter and take the company private. Musk&#8217;s overture to Twitter sparked public outcry from those who feared his plans to turn the site into a Trumpian white supremacist disinformation platform. Since Twitter has an outsized influence on journalism and political discourse, Musk&#8217;s detractors feared he would buy the site in order to empower racists, bullies and disinformation. And one of Musk&#8217;s first promises as Twitter&#8217;s would-be owner was to allow Trump back onto the site.At first, Twitter seemed prepared to fight off the Musk invasion, adopting a &#8220;poison pill&#8221; strategy to fend off a hostile takeover. Once Musk made a $44 billion offer to buy the social media company for $54.20 a share, however, the bird app&#8217;s leaders started singing a different tune.&#8220;In principle, I don&#8217;t believe anyone should own or run Twitter,&#8221; said Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey, describing Twitter&#8217;s main purpose as a noble service to humanity. &#8220;It wants to be a public good at a protocol level, not a company. Solving for the problem of it being a company however, Elon is the singular solution I trust. I trust his mission to extend the light of consciousness.&#8221;No one should own Twitter &#8212; except a megalomaniacal CEO who is willing to pay $44 billion to make Twitter a safe space for Trump, white supremacists and disinformation?Apparently, Dorsey&#8217;s definition of &#8220;light of consciousness&#8221; can best be summed up by the poop emoji. Musk tweeted this popular emoji &#8212; a visual representation of a smiling fecal specimen with eyes &#8212; at Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal on Monday during a debate over the existence of fake accounts on the site. The animated response came in the aftermath of Musk's declaration that he was putting his Twitter purchase on hold to determine whether the company is telling the truth when it estimates that only 5% of the site&#8217;s accounts are inauthentic. When Agrawal responded with a well-reasoned tweet about how the company estimates the number of fake accounts, Musk retorted with a turd.It was the latest in a series of apparent efforts by Musk to publicly humiliate and damage Twitter. Legally, Musk is supposed to refrain from publicly attacking the company as part of the deal. True to form, however, he&#8217;s breaking the rules and waging an insult campaign against the company he purportedly seeks to own. It seems like a preview of what&#8217;s to come &#8212; if Musk goes through with his purchase of the app.Twitter&#8217;s stock price has plummeted, with Musk&#8217;s public irrationality plunging the company&#8217;s price far below the price he agreed to pay. The past few weeks have provided a dramatic rollercoaster ride of events in which Musk has telegraphed has intentions by attacking Democrats and expressing alignment with far-right figures while parading his na&#239;ve view of content moderation (and his willingness to overpay for the ability to wield control over it). All while simultaneously sinking the stock prices of both Twitter and Tesla.On Wednesday, as Tesla shares tumbled, Musk waded further into political analysis by declaring that he will now vote for Republican candidates.&#8220;In the past, I voted Democrat, because they were (mostly) the kindness party,&#8221; he wrote on Twitter. &#8220;But they have become the party of division &amp; hate, so I can no longer support them and will vote Republican.&#8221;In reality, Musk&#8217;s conservative politics came as a surprise to no one except Musk himself. He&#8217;s a white, male, union-busting billionaire who publicly criticized California&#8217;s COVID protection rules as &#8220;fascist&#8221; but doesn&#8217;t seem bothered by the new abortion bans passed in his new home state of Texas. The idea of converting to the Republican cause at a moment when the GOP&#8217;s defining characteristics are racial hate and insurrection tells us everything we know about Musk&#8217;s political leanings. (His conversion to the GOP cause also came one day before Insider ran a story about a $250,000 settlement with a SpaceX flight attendant who accused him of sexual harassment.)Like Trump, Musk&#8217;s political positions appear driven by selfishness. He despises unions and COVID protections because they interfere with his desire to maximize his own profits and do as he pleases. Like Trump, his worldview is shaped by what&#8217;s good for his own interests, not what&#8217;s good for anyone else. Like Trump, he enjoys creating spectacles and making himself the center of negative attention on Twitter. Like Trump, Musk&#8217;s politics are simple, not complicated. It&#8217;s all about him.Less clear, however, is what Twitter is getting out of this bizarre episode. Its stock price has sunk, it just fired key executives and many demoralized employees are reportedly eyeing the exits.If anything, the Musk debacle has removed any illusion that the company&#8217;s supposedly high-minded ideals are anything more than empty PR. Turns out all the talk about preserving democracy and spreading consciousness was just boilerplate marketing gobbledygook. In reality, Twitter is simply a weapon for harvesting user data and exerting an outsized influence over political discourse. And it&#8217;s for sale to the highest bidder.&nbsp;In fact, as the press has reported, it was Twitter founder Jack Dorsey who suggested that Musk buy the company and take it private.&nbsp;The result of this &#8220;singular solution&#8221; has been a real-time disaster for the involved parties, but it&#8217;s been enlightening for everyone else. Collectively, we are helping to create and empower a communications weapon that will very likely fall into the wrong hands one day and be used as a tool to destroy democracy and spread hate and lies. Regardless of whether Musk buys Twitter, Twitter&#8217;s users should reexamine the app&#8217;s role as &#8220;public square&#8221; for political thought. At the very least, Twitter&#8217;s users &#8212; the sole source of its power &#8212; should find a way to organize and exert more power over the platform&#8217;s fate. By doing so, they can make it exceedingly clear that a fascist free-for-all version of the tweet app will quickly go the way of MySpace, Friendster and the dodo bird.Further readings:Jaron Lanier on &#8220;10 Arguments for Deleting Your Social Media Accounts Right Now.&#8221;",

        "description": "Photo by Gayatri Malhotra on UnsplashFraming the truth at the deepest moral level matters. What have been called &#8216;women's issues&#8217; are freedom issues, and these have not been adequately framed as such. (from &#8220;The ALL NEW Don&#8217;t Think of An Elephant: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate.&#8221;)A woman&#8217;s right to control her own reproductive health is fundamentally a matter of freedom. Women should have the right to control their own bodies and make their own healthcare and family decisions, including the decision over whether to have an abortion. When women are stripped of this right, they are stripped of equality, liberty and freedom.&nbsp;News that conservative judges on the United States Supreme Court plan to overturn these freedoms came as a shock but not a surprise. The Republican Party has long sought to overturn current law and restrict the freedom of women to choose what&#8217;s right for them. It took decades, but Republicans finally stacked the court with enough ultra-conservative justices to overturn laws that the most recent additions to the panel had claimed were settled by precedent.&nbsp;They lied in order to get their way and impose their moral worldview on everyone else (also not a surprise). For conservatives, the ends justify the means as long as they accomplish their aim &#8212; imposing their form of morality on everyone else. This is a dark moment in American history. It&#8217;s easy to feel hopeless and powerless, and such feelings are natural in a moment like this. Though the draft opinion is not yet final, it&#8217;s important for Americans to prepare for the worst and expect a long struggle ahead.A struggle for freedomThis is a struggle for freedom. It&#8217;s also a struggle between two opposing versions of freedom. Freedom is the most important concept in American politics &#8212; our defining national concept &#8212; yet two very different versions of freedom exist here.&nbsp;For example, conservatives have opposed public health protections like vaccine mandates and mask rules on the grounds that government should not interfere with a person&#8217;s individual freedom to decide what is best for their body. Yet many conservatives support restricting the freedom of women to choose what is best for their own body when it comes to reproductive health.Republicans frame their opposition to abortion as an effort to save lives. But many of these same conservatives opposed vaccines, masks and other commonsense scientific protections designed to save lives from COVID, which has killed over 1 million Americans. Pro-death conservatismThat&#8217;s a pro-death, not pro-life, stance. On many issues, the conservative version of freedom is better described as pro-death. Just look at the debate over guns. Conservatives frame guns as freedom no matter how many people &#8212; including children in schools &#8212; lose their lives. They also frame the burning of fossil fuels as an issue of freedom and &#8220;independence&#8221; even though global warming threatens every life on the planet.Such hypocrisies are easy to point out, but keep in mind that hypocrisy is a feature, not a bug, of conservative thought. They don&#8217;t care about the hypocrisy as long as the outcomes reflect their moral belief system. Exhibit A: Donald Trump. Conservatives, like most people, do not view the issues through the lens of logic and reason. They view them through the lens of their moral values. Those moral views are captured in the list below: All conservative policy can be explained by the &#8220;moral hierarchy&#8221; represented in this list.Banning abortion makes sense from the conservative point of view because, according to the conservative moral hierarchy, men should have control over women (men over women). Evangelical Christians and other religious conservatives also oppose abortion rights on religious grounds, and thus believe (according to the conservative moral hierarchy) that their Christian beliefs should dictate what women can do with their bodies (God over man, Christianity over other religions).&nbsp;Evangelicals are a key part of the Republican base, which helps explain why abortion rights have been a conservative target for decades. Even conservatives like Donald Trump &#8212; who once supported abortion rights &#8212; must work to overturn abortion rights in order to maintain any power base in the Republican Party.&nbsp;On The BibleSuch conservatives don&#8217;t really believe a fetus is a baby and do not adhere to religious beliefs in any other part of the lives. For example, The Bible prohibits lying, yet every other word out of Trump&#8217;s mouth is a lie. The Bible also condemns usury and collecting interest on many forms of loans, yet conservatives would never support a law to ban the collecting of interest on loans.You get the idea. The logic of conservative moral logic is totally inconsistent when it comes to supporting &#8220;life&#8221; or following The Bible. But it is always consistent when it comes to enforcing the conservative moral hierarchy. This is important because the conservative hierarchy is key to understanding the conservative view of freedom.&nbsp;To conservatives, an issue can only be viewed as a freedom issue if it adheres to the conservative moral view of what people should be able to do. The conservative definition of freedom only includes things which conservatives consider morally right. This conservative definition of freedom represents a radical departure from the traditional definition of freedom and represents a great threat to American freedom.The idea of freedom has different interpretations, depending on your moral and political worldview. (&#8220;Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think,&#8221; 1996)Most progressive thought is also based on the idea of freedom, but Democrats and progressives rarely base their arguments on freedom. Instead, they have largely ceded the freedom frame to Republicans, who frame everything from guns to environmental destruction as matters of freedom.&nbsp; But could any freedom be more fundamental or visceral than a woman&#8217;s right to control her body when it comes to reproduction? &#8220;Choice&#8221; &#8212; a consumer term &#8212; signifies a function of freedom, not the essential freedom itself.&nbsp; With the vast majority of American supporting a women&#8217;s freedom over their bodies, it&#8217;s important to call the abortion issue what it is: A fundamental issue of freedom and liberty. Framing matters &#8212; and so does freedom. Progressives and Democrats must stop ceding the freedom frame to conservatives whose policies threaten both freedom and democracy.",

        "description": "Why are Republicans so weak when it comes to stopping crime and protecting public safety?&nbsp;You are probably not accustomed to seeing the question framed this way. Normally, Republicans attack Democrats on the issue of crime. So, this fact may surprise you: Pro-Trump states with conservative leaders have higher rates of murder, violent crime, property crime and drug overdose deaths than most Democratic states.&#8220;The GOP presents crime as a simple problem to fix,&#8221; wrote FrameLab co-author Gil Duran in The San Francisco Examiner. &#8220;Just flood the streets with police and impose draconian sentences for even low-level offenses. But there&#8217;s a major glitch in the narrative: Republican states tend to have higher rates of violent crime than Democratic states.&#8221;&#8220;In 2020, per capita murder rates were 40% higher in states won by Donald Trump than those won by Joe Biden,&#8221; according to &#8220;The Red State Murder Problem,&#8221; a report from Third Way, a think tank. &#8220;Eight of the 10 states with the highest murder rates in 2020 voted for the Republican presidential nominee in every election this century.&#8221;Of course, this hasn&#8217;t stopped Republican politicians from traditionally framing Democrats as lacking when it comes to dealing with crime &#8211; despite publicly-available data &#8212;reveals the opposite to be true. Across the board, Republican states tend to fare worse than Democratic ones on crime. Republican states have the nation&#8217;s highest rates of murder, violent crime, property crime and drug overdose deaths.&nbsp;This is an important fact to keep in mind during an election year when Republicans will seek to use the crime issue as a political weapon against Democrats. It&#8217;s crucial to frame the issue truthfully and refuse to allow disinformation to put Democrats on the defensive. For decades, Republicans have successfully done this, forcing Democrats into a tragic competition to see who can lock up the most people through draconian criminal justice policies.Photo by H&#233;di Benyounes on Unsplash&#8220;Republican officeholders do a better job of blaming Democrats for lethal crime than actually reducing lethal crime,&#8221; wrote the authors of the Third Way report.As a result, overzealous incarceration has destroyed many lives &#8211; mostly those of poor, Black and brown people. It has also failed to increase public safety, as evidenced by the persistently high crime rates in Republican states that emphasize policing and prison.Another key fact: New Mexico, the Democratic state with the highest rates of crime, also &#8220;locks up a higher percentage of people than any democracy on earth,&#8221; according to the nonprofit&nbsp;Prison Policy Initiative.If prison solved crime, New Mexico would be the safest place on the planet.So, if Republican states have the highest rates of crime, why do Republicans insist on pursuing criminal justice polices that fail to increase public safety?For Republicans, the point of draconian laws and mass incarceration is not to necessarily solve the problem of crime. The point is to punish individuals in accordance with the conservative &#8220;strict father&#8221; moral code, which holds that people must be severely punished as retribution for wrongdoing. It doesn&#8217;t matter whether the approach is effective. It only matters whether conservatives consider the approach morally correct.Criminal justice reform, which states like California have embraced, takes a different moral approach. It seeks evidence-based solutions to address the roots of crime and increase public safety. It imposes consequences, including prison, to those who break the law repeatedly or violently. But it also takes into account the fact that overly harsh punishments and unnecessary imprisonment for minor crimes can increase, rather than reduce, crime.Reform embraces the moral position that increasing public safety and addressing the root causes of crime is more important than mere retribution. The reform mindset reflects empathy rather than vengeance, and it values positive results over cruel punishment. Empathy is a key component of democracy (you can&#8217;t have democracy without empathy), and a society rooted in empathy rather than cruelty will always have less crime.That&#8217;s because empathetic societies take care of their people, reducing the economic and social factors that drive most crime. On the other hand, societies rooted in cruelty and vengeance appear to produce citizens who are more likely to engage in cruelty and vengeance against their neighbors.So, the next time you hear someone trying to frame crime as a partisan issue, remember that Democratic states do a better job at protecting public safety than some of the staunchest Republican states. You&#8217;ll never convince most Republicans, no matter how much data you provide (remember: if the facts don&#8217;t fit the frame, the facts bounce right off). However, you can help people with open minds &#8211; or people who have been misinformed by press coverage and political talking points &#8211; to understand the truth: Governance by empathy tends to increase empathy and care for others in society. Governance by threat of cruelty and vengeance tends to increase cruelty and vengeance &#8212; and hence crime &#8212; in a society. &#8212; George and GilFurther reading:&#8220;Let&#8217;s obliterate myths about Republicans and crime,&#8221; San Francisco Examiner&#8220;The Red State Murder Problem,&#8221; Third Way\"The real story about crime Republicans won&#8217;t tell you,&#8221; Jonathan Capehart, Washington Post&#8220;Dangerous states: Which states have the highest rates of violent crimes and murders?&#8221; USA Today&#8220;The role of empathy in crime, policing and justice.&#8221;",

        "description": "This is an edition of Up for Debate, a newsletter by Conor Friedersdorf. On Wednesdays, he rounds up timely conversations and solicits reader responses to one thought-provoking question. Later, he publishes some thoughtful replies. Sign up for the newsletter here.Question of the WeekToday’s question concerns affairs of the heart.Last week on Twitter, a presumably young person posted this question: “Literally BAFFLED as to how people found love before dating sites and social media. Was settling the norm? Or did everyone just happen to be romantically compatible with the person sitting nearest to them in class?” Thousands of people responded, including Kat Rosenfield, who mused on “the challenge of explaining to an entire generation that the frictionless matching achieved by algorithm is not only not better than the old-school kind, but generally, vastly inferior.”What do you think about the app era of dating or the in-real-life era that preceded it? Insights born of personal experience are encouraged but not required. I hope to hear from every age cohort.Send responses to conor@theatlantic.com.Conversations of NoteEvery year, like any good Californian raised on The Beach Boys and Bruce Brown, I mourn the end of summer. But this year, writing from Europe as each day is shorter and temperatures fall with each week, I feel a special sense of foreboding about the coming months. After shutting down a major gas pipeline into Europe, Russia announced this week that it will not resume energy shipments until the West ends sanctions imposed over the war in Ukraine.Already, this week gas prices have surged 35 percent, even as the euro has hit a 20-year low. What will happen when winter arrives and much of the continent finds itself struggling to keep the heat on? Widespread political unrest is one possibility. “An estimated 70,000 people protested in Prague against the Czech government on Saturday, calling on the ruling coalition to do more to control soaring energy prices and voicing opposition to the European Union and NATO,” Reuters reports. “Organisers of the demonstration from a number of far-right and fringe political groups including the Communist party, said the central European nation should be neutral militarily and ensure direct contracts with gas suppliers, including Russia.”I wonder if large crowds will take to the streets of Berlin and Paris, and beyond, this December or January or February. Still, the economist Tyler Cowen is betting that Moscow’s gambit for leverage will fail. “Europe bears the full burden today, and rather soon in the winter to come,” he writes. “Over time, however, Europe will adjust and the Russian position and threat value will weaken each period. It would make sense as a strategy if Russia were about to start negotiating for peace, but that is not my prediction. It also would make sense if Russia thinks Europe is at the very end of its rope, and now will crack. That also does not seem correct for me.”The War in UkraineIn a Claremont Review of Books essay titled “Why Are We in Ukraine?,” Christopher Caldwell begins by arguing that the United States has made itself a central player in the conflict.He writes:\r\nIt is pursuing a three-pronged strategy to defeat Russia through every means short of entering the war—which, of course, raises the risk that the United States will enter the war. One prong is the state-of-the-art weaponry it is supplying to Ukraine. Since June, thousands of computer-guided artillery rockets have been wreaking havoc behind Russian lines. A second prong is sanctions. With western European help, Washington has used its control of the choke points of the global marketplace to impoverish Russians, in hopes of punishing Russia. Finally, the U.S. seeks to rally the world’s peoples to a culture war against an enemy whose traditionalism, even if it does not constitute the whole of his evil, is at least a symbol of it.\r\nIn Caldwell’s telling, things aren’t going well:\r\nThe economic sanctions, far from bringing about the collapse Blinken gloated over, have driven up the price of the energy Russia sells, strengthened the ruble, and threatened America’s western European allies with frostbite, shortages, and recession. The culture war has found few proponents outside of the West’s richest latte neighborhoods. Indeed, cultural self-defense may be part of the reason India, China, and other rising countries have conspicuously declined to cut economic ties with the Russians.\r\nHis lengthy analysis of the dangers the conflict poses to U.S. interests culminates in this advice:\r\nThe attempt to isolate Russia from the American world system has had a striking unintended consequence—the possible founding of an alternative world system that would draw power away from the existing one. Twenty years ago, under George W. Bush, the United States removed the Iraqi deterrent from Iran’s neighborhood, transforming Iran overnight into a regional power. This year, under Joe Biden, the United States has made China a gift of Russia’s exportable food and mineral resources. We are displaying an outright genius for identifying our most dangerous military adversary and solving its most pressing strategic challenge. The attention of China is now engaged. Joe Biden argues that any wavering in the cause of obliterating Russia will be understood by China as a green light on Taiwan. He may have a point, but the U.S. management of the Ukraine situation over the past decade has constituted encouragement enough.\r\n\r\nAdministration officials often describe Russia’s invasion of Ukraine as a war of choice. Although this may have been true at the outset, it is not now. Vladimir Putin and the Russia he rules cannot stop fighting. As long as the United States is involved in arming Russia’s enemies and bankrupting its citizens, they are quite right to believe themselves in a war for their country’s survival. The United States, thus far in a less bloody way, is also involved in a war it chose but cannot exit—in this case, for fear of undermining the international system from which it has drawn its power and prosperity for the past three quarters of a century. Now may seem like the wrong moment to make peace. But seldom in wars such as this one do the prospects for peace grow more favorable with time.\r\nFor a different perspective, see George Packer’s recent Atlantic essay, “Ukrainians Are Defending the Values Americans Claim to Hold.” As Packer sees it, “Moral clarity can be blinding, and most subjects worth writing about are complicated. But a few things are morally clear: slavery, and genocide, and Russia’s attempt to destroy Ukraine.” After traveling there to deliver medical supplies, he shared an anecdote that doubles as a case for international involvement:\r\nThe Russian way of war is a form of shock and awe whose intended effect is not just to leave cities and towns uninhabitable and undefended, but to overwhelm the survivors and render them utterly passive, as if they are facing not a recognizable human enemy but a force of nature, or some kind of supernatural power, an impersonal god that destroys whatever it touches.\r\n\r\nBut one evening something happened that put me in a different frame of mind. I was walking back to my hotel along Khreshchatyk, the main avenue that runs through Kyiv’s Maidan. The streets were nearly empty as the 10 o’clock curfew approached. An air-raid siren began to wail. Few Kyivans paid the alarms much attention anymore, but I quickened my pace. I passed two women in the orange uniforms of city workers. At this hour, they were sweeping out the gutters. I suddenly realized that Kyiv’s streets were incredibly clean, with hardly a scrap of trash anywhere. A lot of effort went into keeping the city, with its broad squares and grand facades in pale blues and pinks and yellows, orderly and pleasing. Everywhere you looked, lilac bushes were in bloom—they were blooming all around the ruins of Irpin and Bucha, too, and along the embankments of the railroad tracks between Lviv and Kyiv—and chestnut trees were covered in shaggy white flowers, and beds of red and yellow tulips spread out around monuments. None of this was natural, any more so than the destruction that artillery and missiles rained down on innocent people going about their lives. Human hands had tried to ruin the city, and human hands were keeping the ruins beautiful.\r\n\r\nI had heard that so many people wanted to help clear the rubble from Ukraine’s destroyed cities, wait lists were needed to organize all the volunteers. But somehow it was the sight of those two women sweeping the street just before curfew that brought home to me the obscene wrongness of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. Here was a country with a tragic history that had at last begun to build, with great effort, a better society.\r\n\r\nWhat made Ukraine different from any other country I had ever seen—certainly from my own—was its spirit of constant self-improvement, which included frank self-criticism. For example, there’s no cult of Volodymyr Zelensky in Ukraine—a number of Ukrainians told me that he had made mistakes, that they’d vote against him after the war was won. Maxim Prykupenko, a hospital director in Lviv, called Ukraine “a free country aspiring to be better all the time.” The Russians, he added, “are destroying a beautiful country for no logical reason to do it. Maybe they are destroying us just because we have a better life.” Shitting on the floor of a newly renovated house after killing or driving out its owners—that, in an image, is Russia’s war against Ukraine.\r\nTo Fight Climate Change, Get a White RoofEric Scigliano makes that compelling argument here.What Is School For?In a recent symposium on that subject, The New York Times published a number of different answers, including one by the authors Heather C. McGhee and Victor Ray, who argue that “school is for making citizens.” To them, that means resisting efforts by some Republicans to restrict how educators are able to teach about race and gender. They write:\r\nContemporary attacks on teaching true history are authoritarian attempts to impose a sanitized curriculum. America’s book banners and anti-critical race theory zealots are following a path well worn by authoritarian regimes in Russia and Hungary, which have issued laws targeting the teaching of L.G.B.T.Q. issues. In the current U.S. debates, both the authoritarians and those people committed to multiracial democracy recognize that education is inherently political, because it enables students to understand, question and change their world. For the latter, this is the point; freedom comes from having the tools to comprehend a range of good and bad experiences and weigh the options for charting their future. Despite wails to the contrary from activist groups like Moms for Liberty, who claim accurate teaching of America’s history will harm white children, research shows that all students benefit from reading accurate but critical accounts. Lessons about racism make students more likely to engage and empathize across race. Such cross-racial solidarity is essential for members of our most diverse generation.\r\nResponding at Slow Boring, Matthew Yglesias, who is also opposed to restrictions on educators, counters that schools are nevertheless making a mistake if they focus on advancing social justice rather than teaching reading and math.He writes:\r\nCitizenship is important, and it is one of the functions of the school system, but the best (and most realistic) way for K-12 schools to foster effective citizenship is to teach kids foundational literacy and math skills. Incorporating works about history or politics into the curriculum is a great idea insofar as it helps keep students engaged, but it’s best to make those core skills the North Star and try to avoid hubris and tons of polarized fights about tangential issues. Unfortunately, the median American reads at something like a 5th or 6th grade level … Diving into the data does show that the foreign-born population brings the average down a bit, which doesn’t really reflect on the school system. The typical person born in the United States is probably at an 8th grade level rather than 6th. Still, that’s low. Ta-Nehisi Coates’ “Case for Reparations” scores … above the reading level of the typical American … All of which is to say that improving the level of basic reading competency is basic citizenship education. To read the books that progressives see as foundational to their understanding of race in American history, you need to be able to read better than the typical American can. And of course to really receive a well-rounded citizen-like education in these subjects, you also need to read good books written by people on the other side of some of these arguments.\r\nI agree with Yglesias about the paramount importance of reading skills. As for how schools ought to handle contested topics, I’ve previously argued and still believe that a viewpoint-diversity curriculum is an underrated approach to acculturating young people to be good citizens.Provocation of the WeekTo mark the death of the journalist Barbara Ehrenreich, The Nation has resurfaced an essay that she wrote in 1983 about men, women, and how they ought to relate to one another in the modern world. An excerpt:\r\nThe old feminine ideal—the full-time housewife with station wagon and suburban ranch house—has been largely replaced by the career woman with skirted suit and attaché case. The collapse of the breadwinner ethic, and with it the notion of long-term emotional responsibility toward women, affects not only the homemaker who could be cut loose into poverty but the financially self-sufficient working woman. We face the prospect of briefer “relationships,” punctuated by emotional dislocations and seldom offering the kind of loyalty that might extend into middle age. If we accept the male revolt as a fait accompli and begin to act on its economic consequences for women, are we not in some way giving up on men? Are we acquiescing to a future in which men will always be transients in the lives of women, and never fully members of the human family?\r\n\r\nI would like to think that a reconciliation between the sexes is still possible … But what would be the terms of such a reconciliation? We cannot go back to a world where maturity meant “settling,” often in stifled desperation, for a life perceived as a “role.” Nor can we accept the nightmare anomie of the pop psychologists’ vision: a world where other people are objects of consumption, a world of chance encounters of a “self” propelled by impulse alone. I see no other ethical basis for a reconciliation than the feminist principle that women are also persons, with the same need for respect, for satisfying work, for love and for pleasure as men. In a “world without a father,” that is, without the private system of paternalism built into the family-wage system, we will have to learn to be brothers and sisters.\r\nAs ever, thanks for all your emails, and dissents are always welcome. See you next week.",

That just scratches the surface as to what’s new here.\nIf you’re curious about how these new iPhones compare to models from the past, we’ll have you covered pretty soon with a spec comparison.

Michigan judge on Wednesday ruled a state law passed in 1931 that banned abortions cannot be enforced, citing the state's constitution and the right to privacy that it provides.\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Michigan filed the lawsuit against the Michigan state government in April to halt a near-total abortion ban from going into effect. The 1931 law, which was triggered after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, banned all abortions except in situations where the mother's life was endangered due to her pregnancy.\n\n\n\nNo exceptions for incest or rape are included in the ban.\n\n\n\nMichigan Court of Claims Chief Judge Elizabeth Gleicher wrote in her decision that the law \"violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Michigan Constitution.\" She found that the law was unconstitutional because it would \"deprive women of their right to bodily integrity and autonomy, and the equal protection of the law.\"\n\n\n\nIn her ruling, Gleicher noted that there are no laws that provide support for a mother or her child if they suffer from ill health as a result of pregnancy or lack social support to fall back on or if giving birth forces a woman to forgo pursuing a career or education.\n\n\n\n\"This is the legal landscape against which the Court must evaluate the undisputed evidence in this case,\" Gleicher wrote, further adding that the law would \"endanger the health and lives of women seeking to exercise their constitutional right to abortion.\"\n\n\n\nThe defense in the lawsuit had argued that an abortion ban had nothing to do with bodily integrity on the basis that pregnancy did not involve \"nonconsensual entry into the body.\" \n\n\n\nGleicher wrote in her opinion that this argument was \"easily\" dispensed, saying, \"As any woman who has experienced pregnancy and delivery knows, the process is utterly transformative of every bodily function.\"\n\n\n\n\"When pregnancy is desired, the word 'intrusion' is likely low on the list of a mother's descriptors of the process. But when pregnancy is unwelcome, dangerous, or likely to result in negative health consequences, it is indeed a 'bodily intrusion,'\" Gleicher added.\n\n\n\nThe judge further pushed back against other arguments raised by the defense, writing, \"Michigan's Constitution protects the rights of all pregnant people to make autonomous health decisions.\"\n\n\n\nIn August, Oakland County Judge Jacob Cunningham had similarly blocked county prosecutors from enforcing the same 1931 law, writing that \"the harm to the body of women and people capable of pregnancy in not issuing the injunction could not be more real, clear, present and dangerous to the court.\"",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&nbsp;The holidays are just a few months away and it's always better to book flights earlier to save money.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPhil Dengler, co-owner of the travel site The Vacationer, recommends booking Thanksgiving flights before Halloween for the best deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDengler also recommends securing a flight for Christmas by Thanksgiving at the latest to snag a cheaper ticket.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraveling around the holidays is a pain but booking plane or train tickets can make getting to, or getting away from, loved ones a little less stressful.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe busiest travel days for the Thanksgiving holiday are typically the day before Turkey Day, Wednesday, Nov. 23 and the last day of the holiday weekend Sunday, Nov. 27. So, those who hate traffic jams or crowds should avoid traveling on those days.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor Thanksgiving travel, the cheapest tickets will be up for grabs in June or July but there is still time to find a deal on airfare, according to Phil Dengler, co-owner of the travel site The Vacationer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I view Halloween as the cutoff date for getting a reasonable price on a Thanksgiving flight but aim to get booked by the middle of September,” Dengler said in an email. “After Halloween, prices will increase considerably.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe same rule applies for plane tickets around Christmas time, but travelers should really give themselves a hard deadline before Thanksgiving to avoid shelling out hundreds of extra dollars.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor cheaper flights and less hassle around Thanksgiving Dengler recommends flying out on these days:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSunday, Nov. 20&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMonday, Nov. 21&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTuesday, Nov. 22&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThursday, Nov. 24 ( Thanksgiving Day flights tend to be cheap)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd coming home on these dates:&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFriday, Nov. 25 (Black Friday)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMonday, Nov. 28&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTuesday, Nov. 29&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPredicting the busiest travel days around Christmas is a little bit trickier. But Dengler expects these days to be the most hassle-filled travel days this December:\n\n\n\nThursday, Dec. 22&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFriday, Dec. 23&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMonday, Dec. 26&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTuesday, Dec. 27&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInstead, Christmas travelers should consider flying out on these days for cheaper and less packed flights:&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSunday, Dec. 18&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMonday, Dec. 19&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTuesday, Dec. 20&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSaturday, Dec. 24 (Christmas Eve)&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSunday, Dec. 25 (Christmas Day)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd think about booking a flight on these days to come home to avoid the holiday rush:  \n\n\n\nWednesday, Dec. 28&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThursday, Dec. 29&nbsp;",

        "description": "Thank you to all who submitted questions about the first two chapters of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Think of An Elephant.&#8221; Below you will find the full Q&amp;A from Dr. Lakoff.Many of the submitted questions were more general in scope rather than specific to the first to chapters of the book, and that&#8217;s fine. We want to make these Q&amp;A features a regular part of the newsletter (and make the newsletter a more regular part of your reading).So, for next week, please feel free to submit questions about sections 3-5 of &#8220;Don&#8217;t Think of An Elephant.&#8221; Or, you can ask any question and, if George is game and has relevant knowledge on the topic, he will answer it. Question: You've said not to use the language of the Right. Is that \"ever\"? For a long time, I have felt that the Pro-Choice mantra of \"MY body, MY choice!\" sounds cold, especially to those who feel genuine compassion for the fetus/potential child. I've thought we should \"FLIP the Script\" and declare that it's liberals and progressives who are the ones who are Pro-Life since we do all that we can to protect children and other humans after they are born, and right-wingers are generally fighting policies to protect the health and lives of people AFTER birth. Your thoughts on the occasional use of 'flipping\" their language? Thank you.&#8212; Veronica AdamsDr. Lakoff responds: You are right that &#8220;choice&#8221; is a terrible framing of the abortion issue. A more sensible &#8212; and real &#8212; framing is whether a woman has control over her body, especially during the period what a fetus can&#8217;t survive outside of the womb and is part of a woman&#8217;s body. You are also right that &#8220;Right-wingers are generally fighting policies to protect the health and lives of people AFTER birth.&#8221; Progressives are Pro-life-health-and-care &#8212; all of what a child needs.Question: Do you have suggestions on how to create new frames? I realize it is necessary and helpful with research institutes and larger frame labs but is this something grassroots can experiment with on a smaller scale? If so, suggestions on how to do that?&#8212;Rikard LindeDr. Lakoff responds: The study of framing was created by my late colleague at UC Berkeley, Charles Fillmore, who noticed that every word is implicitly and almost always unconsciously defined relative to a &#8220;frame,&#8221; a structure of concepts that makes sense of common activities. For example, the word &#8220;breakfast&#8221; can be understood (1) as a morning meal shortly after one normally wakes up, or (2) the elements of that meal, e.g., coffee, eggs, cereal, toast, etc. For example, a sign reading &#8220;Breakfast served all day&#8221; refers to frame (2), while &#8220;In Texas, many people have steak for breakfast&#8221; refers to frame (1).New frames have such a structure of concepts, but apply to different activities and the concepts relevant to those activities. Frame structure may exist unconsciously in the minds of many people, but frames have to be pointed out to be made conscious. This often requires being discussed in the media, with the frame being spelled out consciously, for example, the idea that Russia is a violent aggressor in Ukraine and that the Russian military is controlled by Putin.Question: One of the challenges in Australia, as in the US, is the rise of conservative voting among the blue collar working people. There's a gender overlay here as working class jobs are often highly segregated and, in Australia, blue collar unions are often male-dominated at membership and leadership levels and have a distinctly \"Disciplinary Father\" culture. How might reframing impact on these political and workplace cultures effectively?&#8212; Phil O&#8217;DonoghueDr. Lakoff responds: You&#8217;ve given real-world facts that come with implicit framings central to the common understanding of those facts: (implicitly framed fact 1) Blue collar unions in Australia with mostly male members, and (implicitly framed fact 2) union leaders with strict father morality. You can&#8217;t simply impose new frames on facts that are already implicitly framed in the minds of most of the relevant populations. The conditions for &#8220;reframing&#8221; have to be favorable. In this case they are not.Question: Are Strict Father Morality and Nurturant Parent Morality worldviews unique to American politics, or are they also common in other cultures around the world? The two contrasting notions of family parenting styles seem like they might have been around for a long time, perhaps since the dawn of humanity?&#8212;Tom P. in LansingDr. Lakoff responds: You are right. Those parenting styles have been around a long time and have a lot to do with human biology and roles of mothers and fathers.Question: Although you refer to the religions of the Puritans and/or Pilgrims in the Q&amp;A section at the end of the book (noting that it was the Quakers, Unitarians, and Universalists who offered a kinder theology), I don't think you use the word \"Calvinism\" anywhere in the book. As I see it, the Strict Father model is an embodiment of Calvinism. That brand of theology also had the view that if one was born rich, it was a sign of God's favor, and of those who were poor, widowed, orphaned, etc., that God just didn't love them and they were going to hell (the destination of the majority of people), so they didn't even bother with any sort of charities, just poorhouses. And they believed there was nothing a person could do about their predetermined fate, no matter how she/he lives their life. A \"saved\" person would be known by the upright way s/he appeared and conducted themselves, and even if they did bad things, they were still saved. And a saint of a damned person would still spend eternity in hell.My understanding is that ~70% of those living in New England in 1776 were Calvinists. 250 years isn't that Widespread belief systems like that don't just disappear, although they can morph some.The only difference I see with those who currently live by the Strict Father model is that it doesn't seem they live entirely in predestination. One can be saved by accepting Jesus (and doing as the church tells them). And in their thinking, even if born poor or \"lowly,\" it is possible to become rich, and therefore upright, moral, and worthy.I'm curious if you noted the parallels, and if so, why you didn't mention Calvinism. &#8212;Veronica AdamsDr. Lakoff responds: Calvinism is a very special case, and not widespread these days. I&#8217;ve met only one person who was brought up with Calvinism. She never accepted it and managed to create a life outside of it. I live in Northern California and haven&#8217;t encountered any widespread Calvinism I can remember. &nbsp; Question: Thank you for identifying how the term &#8220;hypocognition&#8221; identifies a huge and ongoing progressive deficiency. I don't know if this is jumping ahead, but I'll be writing on the abortion issue where conservative \"pro-life\" and \"partial-birth abortion\" framing has drastically affected the abortion debate for many years. I recently read where a progressive group used the term \"forced birth,\" I assume to counter progressive hypocognition in this area. I was thinking of adding \"state-mandated forced birth\" when describing pregnant women now devoid of legal abortions as an realistic health choice. Any thoughts?&#8212; L. James Johnston Dr. Lakoff responds: You are right that &#8220;forced birth&#8221; would be applicable to conditions in many states and is well worth being seriously introduced to current discourse. &#8220;State-mandated&#8221; is too general; progressive governments don&#8217;t mandate it. The terminology should reflect conservative control in states that mandate it.Question: It took me a long time to process the concept of \"people vote their identity/values,\" but I finally got it. It was hard to give up that \"facts won't set you free\"! I certainly still struggle with it. I've recently read &#8220;The Status Game&#8221; by Will Storr. He suggests we all are consisted of a variety of identities and there is a status game associated with each. As long as we recognize and play a multitude of different identities, we stay healthy and maintain relationships. When we focus in on one/few - the game starts to tighten and close up &#8212; leading to ridiculous levels of fealty and to the point where insulting and breaking the norms and values of other identities is not just ok, but vital. Sounds a bit familiar to me.I'm wondering if you have read that and what insights/comments/connections you have/see?&#8212;Brian PostDr. Lakoff responds: I haven&#8217;t read the Storr book.Question: Could you give an example of a progressive issue framed with and without values and principles... So examples of the same issue but with different framing.&#8212;Rikard LindeDr. Lakoff responds: A progressive issue could only become a progressive issue if framed (perhaps unconsciously) with progressive values.&nbsp;The study of framing was created by my late colleague at UC Berkeley, Charles Fillmore, who noticed that every word is implicitly and almost always unconsciously defined relative to a &#8220;frame,&#8221; a structure of concepts that makes sense of common activities. For example, the word &#8220;breakfast&#8221; can be understood (1) as a morning meal shortly after one normally wakes up, or (2) the elements of that meal, e.g., coffee, eggs, cereal, toast, etc. For example, a sign reading &#8220;Breakfast served all day&#8221; refers to frame (2), while &#8220;In Texas, many people have steak for breakfast&#8221; refers to frame (1).&nbsp;New frames have such a structure of concepts, but apply to different activities and the concepts relevant to those activities. Frame structure may exist unconsciously in the minds of many people, but frames have to be pointed out to be made conscious. This often requires being discussed in the media, with the frame being spelled out consciously. For example, consider the idea that Russia is a violent aggressor in Ukraine and that the Russian military is controlled by Putin.&nbsp;Question:  Don't Think of an Elephant\" makes the point about how even negating a frame reinforces it but is there ever a point where the necessity of refuting something might outweigh that? For example, would it hurt Democrats more to simply say \"I do not support or agree with defunding police\" or would reframing look like trying to avoid the issue at this stage vs a blunt refutation?&#8212;David McAvoyDr. Lakoff responds: They would need to say more. For example, &#8220;Police are necessary to protect our communities and to catch and prosecute criminals. We have police review boards in our communities to ensure that the police act lawfully. Defunding the police would work against protecting our communities. &#8221;",

        "description": "For those of you participating in the virtual book club for &#8220;The ALL NEW Don&#8217;t Think of An Elephant: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate&#8221;: The question period is now open for the introduction and Part 1 of the book.The introduction focuses on how &#8220;reframing is social change&#8221; and provides some basic information on the concept of framing.Facts matter enormously, but to be meaningful they must be framed in terms of their moral importance. Remember, you can only understand what the frames in your brain allow you to understand. If the facts don&#8217;t fit the frames in your brain, the frames in your brain stay and the facts are ignored or challenged or belittled.Part 1 consists of &#8220;Framing 101: Theory and Application.&#8221; It contains background on the moral structures that differentiate conservative and progressive framing. It also provides concrete examples of how framing has been used to great effect in American politics and examines how and why such framing works.When you are arguing against the other side, do not use their language. Their language picks out a frame &#8211; and it won&#8217;t be the frame you want.A reminder on how the virtual book club works:1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Read the materials!2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Submit any questions or comments via Substack comments, Facebook comments or Twitter comments. Please specify if you would like us to use your name if we respond to your question.3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Questions will be answered via this Substack newsletter (and in a special episode of the FrameLab podcast).It&#8217;s that easy! We will be taking questions on the introduction and Part 1 until Friday. So there&#8217;s still time to do the reading if you haven&#8217;t already. (The book is available to buy in many books stores and through outlets like&nbsp;Bookshop,&nbsp;East Bay Booksellers,&nbsp;Powell&#8217;s&nbsp;and&nbsp;Amazon. Or you can support your local bookstore or public library, which may even offer a free e-book or audiobook for use.)Looking forward to your questions,George and Gil",

        "link": "https://georgelakoff.substack.com/p/will-the-press-let-trump-brand-social",
        "description": "Sometime in the next few weeks, a former president of the United States will launch a new social media app. Its purpose: To bolster his authoritarian political aspirations by creating a new tech platform for his hallmark lies and disinformation.The launch of this new propaganda tool will pose a serious challenge for the press, which must consider how to cover it without becoming a super-spreader of its deceitful and manipulative products.Donald Trump told 30,573 lies during his time in office, according to an official count by the&nbsp;Washington Post. His defeat in the 2020 election only intensified his zeal for lying. His Biggest Lie of All &#8211; that he did not lose the election to Joe Biden &#8211; inspired the&nbsp;violent insurrection&nbsp;at the United States Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. The election lies, coupled with his electoral defeat, led Facebook and Twitter to finally ban him. The former president must now create his own social media platform if he wishes to lie with impunity.Trump cannot survive without lies. His lies define him. He tells bold and shameless lies about everything. He even lies about lying. Like other would-be dictators, he uses lies as a calculated strategy to create a counter-reality for his followers.&#8220;Fascist politics exchanges reality for the pronouncements of a single individual, or perhaps a political party,&#8221; wrote&nbsp;Jason Stanley&nbsp;in &#8220;How Fascism Works: The Politics of Us and Them.&#8221; &#8220;Regular and repeated obvious lying is part of the process by which fascist politics destroys the information space. A fascist leader can replace truth with power, ultimately lying without consequence. By replacing the world with a person, fascist politics makes us unable to assess arguments by a common standard. The fascist politician possesses specific techniques to destroy information spaces and break down reality.&#8221;In an Orwellian twist, Trump&#8217;s new social media app will literally attempt to brand his lies as truth by calling the platform &#8220;TRUTH Social.&#8221; With this move, the former president is trying to manipulate the press into associating the words &#8220;Trump&#8221; and &#8220;truth&#8221; in the minds of readers. He views repetition of the word &#8220;truth&#8221; in relation to his new lying machine as essential.The press must outsmart this trap. It would be gravely irresponsible to allow the former president (or anyone) to present lies and disinformation under the banner of truth. Of course, the naming scheme of Trump&#8217;s new platform complicates the matter, since it&#8217;s the general practice of media outlets to call things by their official corporate names. In this case, however, incautious use of the platform&#8217;s official name would aid and abet the war against truth and democracy. Newsroom leaders must address this issue carefully.One idea: Refuse to go along with the scheme by using its name sparingly, and only while placing it squarely in the context of Trump&#8217;s constant and strategic use of lies. Using the &#8220;truth sandwich&#8221; structure, reporters can give readers the necessary information without falling into the former president&#8217;s linguistic trap.For example:Truth:&nbsp;The former president, who was removed from other social media platforms for spreading falsehoods about the 2020 election and helping to foment the insurrection on Jan. 6., is launching his own social media platform.Contextualized lie/falsehood/trap:&nbsp;In a twist, a president known for constant lies is calling his app &#8220;TRUTH Social&#8221; and promising it will not censor political views.Truth:&nbsp;However, since the political views of Trump supporters largely depend on falsehoods &#8211; especially concerning the 2020 election &#8211; it seems likely that the new app will exist to promote the former president&#8217;s lies and attack the truth.Again: Press outlets should use the misleading &#8220;truth&#8221; label sparingly. The official name could be used once (in proper &#8220;truth sandwich&#8221; context) and then replaced with &#8220;the app&#8221; or &#8220;Trump&#8217;s app&#8221; in the rest of the story. Keeping the false &#8220;truth&#8221; label out of the headline will be especially important (and challenging).Another approach: Journalists could refuse to reward Trump&#8217;s trickery by refusing to use the app&#8217;s official name at all. They could inform their readers of this policy and explain why, given the former president&#8217;s assaults on democracy, the press and the truth, they will not participate in efforts to rebrand him as a figure of truth.&#8220;Big Lie Media&#8221; or &#8220;DJT Lies&#8221; would be more accurate names for a Trump app. While we can&#8217;t expect most journalists to go that far, all responsible members of the press should avoid marketing lies as truth &#8212; which is exactly what the former president is trying to do.Another big question: How will the press cover the former president&#8217;s antics on the new app? Hopefully, we will not repeat the mistakes of 2016, when the constant elevation of his outrageous tweets and statements helped to put him in the White House.&nbsp;Authoritarianism and fascism pose an existential threat to the free press. The machinations of a twice-impeached former president who incited violent insurrection and now seeks to overthrow American democracy through a campaign of lies must be covered strategically, not objectively.George and GilFurther readings:Can a former California dairy farmer help Trump slay Facebook and Twitter?

        "description": "What are Republicans for?&#8221; asked President Joe Biden during his recent one-year press conference. &#8220;What are they for?&#8221;I spent most of my career trying to answer this question. Several of my books &#8211; including &#8220;Moral Politics: How Liberals and Conservatives Think&#8221; and &#8220;The ALL NEW Don&#8217;t Think of An Elephant!: Know Your Values and Frame The Debate&#8221; &#8211; deal with the question in clear and direct terms.Yet Democratic leaders appear to remain in the dark about the fact that most Republicans have a completely different worldview, one that is increasingly incompatible with the outdated notion of bipartisanship or the crucial idea of democracy.Today&#8217;s Republican Party has no interest in compromise or collaboration. The GOP has bloomed into a full-fledged enemy of the American idea of government and become an aspiring authoritarian organization. Fearing the power of the majority vote, Republicans are working feverishly to dismantle the machinery of democracy and make it harder for Americans to exercise the basic right to vote. The GOP has replaced loyalty to the country with the worship of one man, Donald Trump, who considers himself more important than the nation. Trump and his party demand that the Republican faithful be willing to sacrifice their lives on the altar of lies (as we have seen with the attempted insurrection of January 6 and the anti-scientific campaign against COVID vaccines).This is all happening in public view, with full-throated participation from all but a handful of Republican leaders. In fact, one of the most terrifying aspects of today&#8217;s Republican Party is the utter shamelessness with which it peddles lies, conspiracies and anti-democratic ideas (with help from the Fox channel and other propaganda operations). This is not a political party that is planning for a future in which it must reach &#8220;across the aisle&#8221; to build coalitions and find agreement with the opposition.Today&#8217;s GOP seeks to destroy democracy. It wants a future in which voters, laws and the Constitution no longer matter. If these Republicans get their way, the only thing that will matter is the opinion of an authoritarian leader who will dictate the definitions of right and wrong, legal and illegal, true and false. This authoritarian outlook has already devoured the GOP. The only question now is whether it can conquer the rest of the country.None of this should come as a surprise to anyone familiar with how Republicans think, which is based on a specific moral framework that has been fully exposed in the Trump era. I have written about this moral framework in seven books and have tried to get Democratic leaders and progressives to pay attention to the logic behind strict conservative thought. Unfortunately, the hour is getting late, American authoritarianism is on the march and we are living the consequences.What are Republicans for? A world in which voters wield no power over political outcomes. A world in which the law is whatever the strongman leader says it is. A world in which lies become truth and truth becomes lies. A world in which the rights and freedoms of the majority are systematically stripped away to empower the tyranny of the few. A world in which the white, the male, the Christian, the rich, the straight and the old wield maximal power over everyone else.This explains many things about today&#8217;s Republican Party &#8211; including the reason why GOP leaders have no interest in collaborating with President Biden or helping him &#8212; or any Democratic leader &#8212; to succeed.So, what can we do about it? The first step is to understand what we&#8217;re dealing with so that we can understand the dynamics at play. Unless we understand the frames behind conservative political thought, we will be unable to counteract their strategies and tactics. And the only way to understand them is through study and discussion.During February and March, we will be hosting a virtual but interactive book club to review and discuss the ideas set out in &#8220;The ALL NEW Don&#8217;t Think of an Elephant: Know Your Values and Frame the Debate.&#8221; The book has five parts and an introduction, and we will go through it part-by-part over the span of a few weeks. I will answer questions and provide commentary to help readers understand the book in the greatest depth possible. Answers will be provided via the FrameLab podcast and this newsletter.The book is available to buy in many books stores and through outlets like Bookshop, East Bay Booksellers, Powell&#8217;s and Amazon. Or you can support your local bookstore or public library, which may even offer a free e-book or audiobook for use. We will plan to start the discussion and Q&amp;A sometime in mid-February, so this gives everyone a chance to acquire a copy of the book and read the intro and Part One.Are you in? Please let us know in the comments section, subscribe to the FrameLab newsletter and be on the lookout for further instructions in the coming weeks. (And a big Thank You to the hundreds of readers who have already expressed an interest in participating!)George Lakoff",

        "description": "Why do conservatives increasingly support the overthrow of American democracy? It may boil down to a basic lack of empathy.&#8220;Democracy depends upon empathy,&#8221; says Dr. Lakoff in the latest episode of the FrameLab podcast. &#8220;The whole point of democracy is caring about what other people feel and what their interests are, and that their interests are represented. In general, Republicans don&#8217;t care about that &#8230; They have a sense of what&#8217;s right and what&#8217;s wrong and they want to impose it.&#8221;In episode 20 of FrameLab, taped in December, we discuss the meaning of the January 6 attack on the United States Capitol and the conservative attack on voting rights across the nation. With the fate of democracy at stake, can Democratic leaders and the free press withstand the tactics and strategies of an authoritarian GOP hellbent on stealing the next election if necessary? Listen to hear what we think.Framing immigration To this point, we also discuss whether the press has learned any lessons about how nefarious actors work to frame political debates to spread hate and disinformation. Readers familiar with Dr. Lakoff&#8217;s work and listeners of the FrameLab podcast know conservatives have long bested progressives at framing political debates.This is largely because conservative political communicators tend to understand the power of marketing and communication better than progressives, who seem to believe each individual is a rational thinker making a rational choice from a rational set of options presented in a rational format.Unfortunately, that&#8217;s not how things work.Instead, conservative billionaires have poured tons of money into conservative think tanks that spend lots of money to study language, frame debates, train speakers and flood the media with &#8220;experts&#8221; whose job is to convince people that right-wing policy positions represent &#8220;moderate&#8221; or &#8220;centrist&#8221; Americans. With enough repetition, millions of Americans hear these messages and they start to seem true. When polls begin to reflect these messages, and when even Democratic politicians repeat them, they can indeed&nbsp;become&nbsp;true.Repetition is crucial. The more you can get a message or idea repeated, the more it can change how people perceive an issue or think about the world. This explains why large corporations spend billions to bombard consumers with advertising.In this episode, we discuss a recent column by Los Angeles Times columnist Jean Guerrero, who wrote a piece headlined &#8220;Stop letting hate groups control the immigration debate.&#8221; In it, she detailed how a handful of anti-immigrant groups linked to a white nationalist named John Tanton have succeeded in infiltrating mainstream media outlets.&#8220;Top-tier news outlets also keep giving prominence to organizations that peddle anti-immigrant views, including those classified as hate groups by the Southern Poverty Law Center, such as the&nbsp;Federation for American Immigration Reform&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Center for Immigration Studies,&#8221; wrote Guerrero. &#8220;Media Matters for America said it&nbsp;found&nbsp;that since January 2019, the New York Times, the Washington Post, the Los Angeles Times, the Wall Street Journal, Reuters and Associated Press published 203 articles that cited those groups or the&nbsp;ideologically aligned&nbsp;NumbersUSA, often without &#8216;sufficient context&#8217; about their backgrounds.&#8221;&nbsp;Guerrero rightly put the blame on major media outlets for buying into these efforts to create &#8220;anti-immigrant hysteria.&#8221; She highlighted the pressure major news outlets put on Vice President Kamala Harris to visit the United States-Mexico border last year. The press played right into the hands of anti-immigrant conservatives and &#8220;hounded&#8221; Harris until she visited the border. Of course, this failed to appease anti-immigrant conservative operators who accused her of going to the wrong part of the border.And it&#8217;s not clear what Harris was supposed to accomplish with a border visit anyway. She can&#8217;t fix the complex problems driving immigration with a wave of her hand. There&#8217;s nothing she could see with her own eyes that she couldn&#8217;t see through drone footage or data collected by U.S. Customs and Border Control.No, the &#8220;border visit&#8221; was simply a Republican frame: The vice president had to visit the border -- or else she was running away from the border issue. Because conservatives said so.The press swallowed it hook, line and sinker. In the end, the VP had no choice but to comply. She went to the border, where nothing was accomplished and where her choice of sites (El Paso) only inspired a new stream of criticism from anti-immigrant conservatives.Remember: There is usually no way to win when you accept the opposition&#8217;s frame.Would legitimate news outlets repeatedly quote anti-immigrant organizations founded by a white nationalist if they had to include the relevant context? It seems unlikely. Yet a study by Media Matters for America found that only 15% of stories quoted such sources &#8220;provided sufficient context of their extremist ties or of their connections to the Trump administration or restrictionist immigration officials.&#8221;So, here&#8217;s one simple but important reform for the press: Stop quoting hate groups and organizations connected to white nationalists without &#8211; at the very least &#8211; telling readers the truth about the source. When a group is motivated by racism and hate, does it deserve a chance to frame the debate?&#8216;Defund&#8217; as framing failIn the latest episode of the FrameLab podcast, we also discuss why &#8220;defund the police&#8221; failed as a political framing. It played directly into conservative hands and has helped put Dems on the run from charges of being weak on public safety. The only people who seem to use the slogan now are conservatives, who use it to falsely smear Democratic policies toward public safety. We&#8217;ll write more on this topic soon, and would love to hear your thoughts.You can listen to the full episode here or wherever you get your podcasts.George and Gil",

        "description": "&#8220;Vaccines, essentially, have to do with empathy. If you care about other people, if you have empathy for them, you don't want them to get sick, or get sick of something they could die from, or spread a disease. You know, this is not an issue of just individual responsibility, which is what conservatives tend to talk about. It's a matter of social responsibility.&#8221;In this new episode of the FrameLab podcast, we discuss the issue of freedom as it relates to vaccines and public health measures, like masks, that help protect people from COVID-19.Click here to listen to FrameLab on Soundcloud.Click here to listen to FrameLab on Apple Podcasts.Click here to listen to FrameLab on Spotify.For twenty months, we have lived with a deadly and highly contagious virus. Victory over the virus has required cooperation and sacrifice from every one of us. It has required us to pull together, to follow new health rules and guidelines, and for each of us to act to protect one another.It has also required us to trust science to lead the way out of a deadly pandemic that has killed over five million people worldwide, including nearly 750,000 Americans.Unfortunately, not everyone is on board with health, safety and science. Some conservatives and anti-vaccine activists have framed public health efforts as an assault on freedom. They seem to define freedom as an individual&#8217;s right to do whatever they wish, regardless of how it affects others. They also undermine science, sowing distrust through disinformation and misinformation.The results have been deadly, especially in conservative communities where anti-vaccine stances are often framed in terms of &#8220;freedom.&#8221; &nbsp;The COVID pandemic has now become a &#8220;pandemic of the unvaccinated,&#8221; with virtually all of the new deaths happening among the unvaccinated. In a quest for an absolute form of individual freedom, many Americans &#8211; misled by politicians and propagandists &#8211; have been led to their deaths.But freedom doesn&#8217;t mean freedom to spread deadly diseases and harm public health. Freedom in society requires empathy and responsibility. Listen to the latest episode of the FrameLab podcast to hear our discussion of this issue. And please subscribe!George and Gil",

        "description": "&nbsp;In American history, no idea has mattered more than the idea of freedom.Yet, we have two very different ideas of freedom in this country. The traditional definition of freedom is progressive. Freedom means expanding citizen participation, expanding voting rights for everyone and expanding education and economic opportunity.But there is a conservative version of \"freedom\" that is, in many ways, the opposite of these things. To many conservatives, protecting \"freedom\" means curtailing things like voter participation, civil rights and a woman's right to choose. These conservatives want to go back to a time before activist movements expanded our central American freedoms to more people.For example, the right to vote is an essential freedom. Yet conservatives are engaged in a nationwide voter suppression campaign because they fear that voter turnout &#8212;especially Black and Latino turnout &#8212; will result in fewer conservatives elected to office.The COVID-19 pandemic has also heightened tensions between our dueling definitions of freedom. The pandemic has proven that conservatives and progressives tend to have very different views of freedom and what it means.Conservatives like Texas Gov. Greg Abbott have framed the rejection of vaccine requirements, masks and public safety shutdowns as violations of \"personal freedom.\" Thousands of Republicans, following their leaders, have refused to get vaccinated or follow basic science. As a result, many have died of COVID, losing their ultimate freedom &#8212; their freedom to live.Yet, no matter how many stories we hear about conservatives dying after scoffing at vaccines or masks, many continue to resist common sense and basic science. Republican Allen West, running for governor of Texas, recently continued to rail against vaccination from the hospital bed where he was fighting COVID.The rejection of life-saving vaccines and masks has become part of the extreme conservative definition of freedom. What does this tell us about conservatives' definition of freedom, and how does this twisted definition affect other parts of our political discourse? In the next episode of the FrameLab podcast, we'll examine liberty, death and the conservative idea of freedom.If you have any questions on the topic, please let us know and we'll try to answer them (and let us know if we can use your name).Thank you for subscribing!A big thank you to all of our new subscribers.

        "description": "Photo by Dylan Buell/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The bullpen will still have to pitch a bit, I’m sure. Since homering as part of a 3-hit debut, it’s been a bit more calm for Cincinnati Reds rookie Spencer Steer. He’s the owner of just a lone hit since that day, a double yesterday in what’s admittedly still just his fourth big league game.\nPerhaps it seems as if he’s been around a bit longer already due to where he’s been used, however, as he’s already seen time at 3B, 1B, and as the team’s DH. Today, he’ll slide over to 2B to get a start and give Jonathan India the chance to DH for the day, showing just how versatile the Reds believe he can be for them both now and in the future.\nInfield versatility might well end up a big part of how the Reds form their next decent lineup, for the record, as they’ve acquired roughly a half-dozen shortstops as part of this rebuild alongside shortstop Elly De La Cruz and shortstop Matt McLain - with Jose Barrero maybe, just maybe, still an option in the infield somewhere, too. It looks as if Steer is going to get a look just about everywhere as the Reds get ready for that.\nThat’s the fun part about tonight’s 7:40 PM ET game, at least. There’s also the aspect that Mike Minor is going to start again and that the bullpen will likely get a good shot at further blowing the score wide open, something they capitalized on greatly last night. \nSteer &amp; Co. will get a chance to go after Chicago rookie Javier Assad, at least, and hopefully they’ll do enough thumping to make it a worthwhile barnburner.\nGo team.\nReds Lineup\n\n\nSpencer Steer gets his first big league start at 2B!

The independent Climate Change Authority will recommend future targets. These are sound and useful elements and will serve Australia’s climate policymaking well.Yet three important elements are not in the bill: a long-term roadmap to net zero, securing the future of the Climate Change Authority, and measures for a proper national conversation on our journey to net zero emissions. And the 43% emissions reduction target should be considered only a starting point.What will the shift to net zero emissions mean for our economy? Continue reading...",

(credit: Ars Technica)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLike a cat trying to hide its pain, Apple's Series 3 Watch quietly disappeared Wednesday afternoon following announcements of the company's newest Apple Watches, including an ultra-premium rugged Apple Watch Ultra. There wasn't room in Apple's lineup for the S3, nor was there likely room on the S3 for WatchOS 9. Series 3 would have been 5 years old on September 22.\nThe Series 3 stuck around in Apple's lineup for a strangely long period, outlasting every other Series release except 7 (which it really might have tied, depending on how you time these things). It was the \"discount\" Apple Watch, even if it was only $30-$50 less than the Apple Watch SE at times and often far more expensive than third-party refurbished Apple Watches. In July, Ars Technica's Corey Gaskin wrote in an Apple Watch buyers' guide that the Series 3 was \"more like a little toy at this point,\" and was only—maybe—worth it for putting on kids who don't notice their phone ringing.\nAs with most lives, the Series 3's had a different, brighter look at the start. It was the first Apple Watch with an (activated) altimeter for stair-climb and elevation tracking, spoken responses from Siri, and most importantly, LTE connectivity, allowing you to use it without having a phone nearby for Bluetooth tethering. This was seen as a boon to runners, cyclists, and anybody seeking to loosen the umbilical connection they felt to their phone. It could be, Ars wrote at the time, the Watch's watershed moment.Read 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

In its place is a 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Plus, which marries the screen size and battery life of the iPhone Pro Max phones to the lesser processor, display quality, and camera system of the standard, no-adjective iPhone 14.\nApple has also removed the iPhone 12 mini from its store. The company continues to sell the old iPhone 12 at a cheaper $599 starting price, but the mini model that you could still buy yesterday is no longer available. That means that the iPhone 13 mini is the last of Apple's small-screened iPhone X-style designs still standing.Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge / SEM Micrograph of a tardigrade, more commonly known as a water bear or \"moss piglet.\" (credit: Cultura RM Exclusive/Gregory S. Paulson/Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTardigrades are micro-animals that can survive in the harshest conditions: extreme pressure, extreme temperature, radiation, dehydration, starvation—even exposure to the vacuum of outer space. Scientists at the University of Tokyo have now identified the mechanism to explain how tardigrades can survive extreme dehydration in particular, according to a new paper published in the journal PLoS Biology—a protein that forms a protective gel-like network to protect dried-out cells.\nAs we've reported previously, the creatures were first described by German zoologist Johann Goeze in 1773. They were dubbed tardigrada (\"slow steppers\" or \"slow walkers\") four years later by Lazzaro Spallanzani, an Italian biologist. That's because tardigrades tend to lumber along like a bear. Since they can survive almost anywhere, they can be found in lots of places: deep-sea trenches, salt and freshwater sediments, tropical rain forests, the Antarctic, mud volcanoes, sand dunes, beaches, and lichen and moss. (Another name for them is \"moss piglets.\") \nWhen their moist habitat dries up, however, tardigrades go into a state known as \"tun\"—a kind of suspended animation, which the animals can remain in for as long as 10 years. When water begins to flow again, water bears absorb it to rehydrate and return to life. They're not technically members of the extremophile class of organisms since they don't so much thrive in extreme conditions as endure; technically, they belong to the class of extremotolerant organisms. But their hardiness makes tardigrades a favorite research subject for scientists.Read 9 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Then in fall 2021, the Distributed Denial of Secrets published a massive data leak, revealing names and addresses of 38,000 Oath Keepers and donors. Sorting through the data, the Anti-Defamation League Center on Extremism (COE) saw an opportunity to cross-reference public data on listed members and map out approximately how far Oath Keepers has come in furthering its mission to establish a secure \"foothold in mainstream seats of power\" throughout the US.\nIn a report published this week, COE identified 373 people in the Oath Keepers database believed to be active law enforcement officers, 117 people who seem to be currently serving in the military, and 81 public officials who either currently hold or are running for public office in 2022.Read 16 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

They achieve a majority of at least 218 seats in 74% of simulations. If the Democrats lose control of Congress, Joe Biden will no longer be able to pass laws along party lines. Gridlock will mark the rest of his presidential term.&#8221;\n&#8220;But Republicans’ strong chance of flipping the House is the only good news that our forecast offers them. The model assigns a 78% probability to the Democrats’ retaining control of the Senate. Only a few months ago, any Democrat would have been thrilled with a one-in-four chance of holding the House.&#8221;",

They reflect the growing concern among Democrats and liberal activists seeking to find a way to end the political careers of the former president and the officials who helped him try to cling to the presidency, including through several new and in some cases arcane strategies.&#8221;",

Meshroom is a performance environment that forms an intellectual/intentional community around an open dancefloor. It is a space for transcending narrow languages, ungrounding from fixed realities, and co-creating temporary worlds in movement. Meshroom is shaped by the movement, dreams, hopes, and queerness of everyone in the room: it is a weaving of wild minds and soft bodies. All visitors are welcome to move, rest, witness, think, melt, and dance with live music and occasional performances.  The event will be photo and video documented for archival use and purposes.  Credits:  Live electro-acoustic music: Michael Grigoni / Steve Anderson / Ethan Foote  Meshroom is curated by Marika Niko and Leo Ryan (MFA in Dance '23), supported by the MFA in Dance: Embodied Interdisciplinary Praxis.

Democratic Senate candidate John Fetterman on Wednesday vowed to debate Republican nominee Mehmet Oz as Oz ramped up his criticism of Fetterman for not having already committed to a debate between the two.\n\n\n\n“We’re absolutely going to debate Dr. Oz, and that was really always our intent to do that,” Fetterman said in an interview with Politico. “It was just simply only ever been about addressing some of the lingering issues of the stroke, the auditory processing, and we’re going to be able to work that out.”\n\n\n\nFetterman did not tell Politico which debate he intended to participate in. He told the news outlet that it would take place on a “major television station” in Pennsylvania “sometime in the middle to end of October.”\n\n\n\nOz’s campaign, which has pushed Fetterman to commit to a debate, poked fun at Fetterman’s announcement, dubbing it a “secret debate.” Fetterman is recovering from a stroke he suffered in May that has left with lingering auditory issues.\n\n\n\n\"BIG NEWS! John Fetterman has agreed to debate at a SECRET DEBATE. We don't know WHERE. We don't know WHEN. We don't know HOW. It's a big SECRET!\" Oz campaign spokesperson Brittany Yanick said in a statement.\n\n\n\n\"John Fetterman's campaign is embarrassing themselves. Let's be clear - Dr. Oz's campaign won't agree to a SECRET debate. It has to be a REAL one with REAL journalists asking REAL questions. Sorry John - imaginary debates don't count!\" she added.\n\n\n\nOz has been trailing Fetterman in recent polling in the Pennsylvania Senate race for Sen. Pat Toomey’s (R-Pa.) seat. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report recently shifted their rating of the race from “toss up” to “lean Democrat.”\n\n\n\nFormer President Trump visited the state last weekend to boost to several of his endorsees, including Oz, making his second appearance in Pennsylvania this year so far. In a further effort to boost Oz, a pro-Oz group launched an ad this week hitting Fetterman over a 2013 incident in which Fetterman pulled a gun on a Black man whom he suspected of committing a wrongdoing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFetterman has previously defended himself over the incident.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Oz’s campaign for comment.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTinder, its parent company Match Group and the Human Rights Campaign are urging the Senate to pass the Respect for Marriage Act, a piece of federal legislation that would safeguard same-sex and interracial marriage rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new ad campaign on the Tinder dating app will spotlight LGBTQ+ couples who met on the platform and direct current users to a landing page with an email template they can send to their senators that encourages them to support the bill.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act passed the House in July and is expected to be voted on by the Senate in the coming weeks. President Biden has signaled support for the measure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dating app Tinder and the Human Rights Campaign, a national LGBTQ+ rights group, on Tuesday announced the launch of an initiative urging the Senate to pass the Respect for Marriage Act.\n\n\n\n“As a company who has created more than 75 billion matches around the world, including helping millions of LGBTQIA+ people of diverse backgrounds find their partners, we consider passage of this legislation to be imperative, and strongly support its quick passage,” reads a news release from Tinder and its parent company Match Group.\n\n\n\nAccording to Tuesday’s announcement, an ad campaign on the Tinder app will spotlight LGBTQ+ couples who met on the platform and direct current Tinder users to a landing page with an email template they can send to their senators that encourages them to vote in favor of the bill.\n\n\n\nThe dating app has more than 75 million active users worldwide, according to company data, and more than 7 million in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe measure was passed by the House in July, with 47 Republicans joining all Democrats in supporting the legislation. The Senate is expected to vote on the bill in the coming weeks, but it is unclear whether the measure has enough support among Republicans to advance.\n\n\n\nPresident Biden has said he will sign the legislation into law if it passes the Senate.\n\n\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act, introduced in July in response to an opinion by Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas suggesting the Court revisit its decision in Obergefell v. Hodges, would address a national patchwork of marriage laws by requiring states to legally recognize same-sex and interracial marriages if those unions are valid in the states in which they were performed.\n\n\n\nStatutes or constitutional amendments prohibiting same-sex marriage remain on the books in more than 30 states, according to the Movement Advancement Project, and would be enforceable if the Court voted to overturn Obergefell, which legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015.\n\n\n\nThe Respect for Marriage Act would also officially repeal the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the 1996 law that defined marriage as a union between one man and one woman.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA section of DOMA preventing the government from recognizing same-sex marriages for the purposes of determining federal benefits was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 2013, but the remainder of the law is still technically in place, albeit unenforceable under Obergefell.Support for marriage equality among American voters rose to an all-time high of 71 percent in June, according to polling from Gallup, and nearly 60 percent of Americans in a Politico and Morning Consult poll published in July said the right to same-sex marriage should be shielded by federal legislation.",

        "description": "Housing and Urban Development Secretary Marcia Fudge on Wednesday tied her job success to the results she delivers to disadvantaged communities.\n\n\n\n\"We currently face a 1.5 million home shortage in this country. We need strong, inclusive, sustainable communities and affordable homes for the people that live in them. And if I don't do more for communities like yours, then I have not done my job and I won't go out that way,\" Fudge told the National Association for Latino Community Asset Builders (NALCAB).\n\n\n\nNALCAB, a network of nonprofit organizations dedicated to growing wealth among Hispanics, is holding its annual three-day national conference in Washington, D.C.\n\n\n\nThe group's focus is to advance economic mobility in Latino communities, with a focus on building generational wealth through a range of economic activities, including homeownership.\n\n\n\n\"We are really focused on helping close the racial and ethnic wealth gap, and our members are doing that through all sorts of economic development interventions that all have the aim of advancing economic mobility for Latinos in the United States,\" NALCAB CEO Marla Bilonick told The Hill in a recent interview.\n\n\n\nHistorically, homeownership has been a key builder of wealth in the United States.\n\n\n\nWhile the Latino homeownership rate reached 48.4 percent in 2021, it's still below the peak 49.7 percent rate in 2007, before the financial crisis, according to a report by the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals.\n\n\n\nThe growth in homeownership over the past two years was outpaced by the homeownership growth among non-Hispanic whites, according to the report, despite faster population growth among Hispanics.\n\n\n\nThat's a contributing factor to the ethnic wealth gap, the difference in total average assets between white and Hispanic families.\n\n\n\nAccording to a report published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, a typical — or median — Hispanic family in 2019 owned $38,000 in total wealth, compared to $184,000 for the typical white family.\n\n\n\nThe Black-white gap was even greater, as the typical Black family owned about $23,000 in total wealth.\n\n\n\nFudge's invitation as the keynote speaker underlined the importance of homeownership for NALCAB, but the conference is scheduled to touch on a series of economic issues, from business ownership to a session on development for rural communities in Puerto Rico.\n\n\n\nThe overall focus for NALCAB is to help its member organizations implement asset-building programs in the communities they serve.\n\n\n\n\"The assets that are being built are homes that are owned, businesses that are owned and grown, jobs that are created,\" said Bilonick.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"The recognition that we're really building assets that can be passed down to a next generation is the way that we focus on closing the racial wealth gap. And of course, there are other levers to be pulled, but all of our members share that in common that they're looking to advance economic mobility for Latinos through these interventions that help them to build assets,\" she added.",

        "description": "Appointments to get the booster shots are open at the state-run vaccination site at the Mall of America.  State officials said last week that sites in Duluth, St. Paul, Rochester and Moorhead will start taking appointments next week. The reworked COVID booster shot could become part of our yearly routine, like the flu shot. The White House coronavirus coordinator said yesterday that the new Omicron boosters, which are set to be released this week, signal a new normal for the virus. To tell us more about the science behind the vaccines and how they work, Dr. Abinash Virk spoke with Cathy Wurzer. She’s an infectious disease specialist at the Mayo Clinic. The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity. Click the audio player above to listen to their conversation.Could you explain how these vaccines work?These are very similar to the prior boosters, except that these are called the bivalent boosters. That means that they have very similar mRNA to the initial vaccines, but also have the mRNA spike protein for the BA. 4 and 5, which are the more common variants that we are seeing. So these are different from the boosters that were recently given earlier this year.And these vaccines have stirred discussion of durable immunity. Can you talk about that concept? What does it mean exactly?It means how long will the immunity actually last. So what we saw with the primary series and also with the previous boosters, the emergence of new variants did go down. And the protection against severe disease also went down to some extent. And so the question is, will the new boosters provide good immunity? And how long will this be good for? This is something obviously we will have to see as we go into the future, based on what we know from previous boosters and vaccination, we should at least have a good six months or more of protection.Should folks wait or try to get one as soon as possible?Timing is a difficult thing, right? We know from the previous two years that the cases have started going up in November and peaked in early January. And that I think it would be helpful for people to make sure that they have their boosters before November, but you really can&#x27;t be too perfect, because you could be imperfect. And it could be that we have a wave earlier than that. And you may miss that. So, in general, we&#x27;re kind of recommending that people should just go ahead and get them. Because we potentially may have another wave of a different variant or even continuing BA. 4 and BA. 5. It&#x27;s good for people to just go ahead and get the vaccine whenever they get it available to them.Does this booster help clarify what&#x27;s meant by being up to date on COVID vaccines?Yes. Being up to date with COVID vaccines was a moving target, as you know, because we had the primary series and then we have the boosters. But going forward, we will hopefully only have one booster a year, sort of similar to influenza, based on the prevailing variant that&#x27;s globally present and that hopefully, we won&#x27;t have to have multiple and different types of boosters as we go forward. It is a change from where we were, and hopefully the future will be just cleaner in terms of what kind of boosters we get.How does that message resonate with those who may have been hesitant to get the shot to begin with?I think what we can at least reassure people is that we have seen through the primary vaccine as well as the boosters and now with the new booster that we have been able to decrease hospitalizations, deaths, severe disease and people should continue to get these boosters. If they&#x27;ve had their primary series, definitely go ahead and get this new booster. If they haven&#x27;t had any vaccination at all, we still urge people to go ahead and get started with your primary series, and then get the new boosters two months after they finish the primary series. There&#x27;s lots of data to show that these vaccines have been very effective in decreasing the burden of disease in the United States and globally.What about vaccines and long COVID?What we have seen so far is that people who are vaccinated are slightly less likely to have long COVID. And so again, that&#x27;s another reason to recommend vaccination for people who have never had it.I wonder about mask wearing, especially in areas that have a high infection rate.Most people are not masking anymore. I think, in general, we are still recommending people who are at increased risk of severe disease to be masked, particularly when they are in crowded locations or indoor locations, especially as we&#x27;re going into the fall and winter. People who are elderly and those who have multiple comorbidities like diabetes, or other additional diseases, or people who are immune suppressed — they don&#x27;t mount as good as an immune response as people who are immune competent. And so you do need to layer your protection with masking and hand hygiene, and some degree of social distancing, if you can.And as a physician, as a person who has studied this, what are you watching for in the next few weeks?We will be watching for hopefully increased uptake of the vaccine of the booster. We are also continuing to monitor the levels of infections as well as hospitalizations in the country to kind of get a sense of how is this winter going to evolve? We will obviously monitor the wastewater viral presence as well where a higher prevalence of infection is.What&#x27;s this time like from where you sit as an infectious disease specialist?It&#x27;s completely unprecedented. I&#x27;ve been doing this for 28 years and I feel that we are definitely in an era of change. And if you really think back from 2009 onwards, there have been quite a number of outbreaks and the number of outbreaks seem to be increasing. What is this related to? Is this related to global travel? Is this related to other economic and climate change issues? There&#x27;s just a lot of change happening. And, of course, in parallel, there are a lot of additional human factors that are contributing to these increases and these outbreaks.Things like vaccine hesitancy, distrust of medical information and also misinformation. And so I think there&#x27;s a lot of factors that are going into the presence and evolution of these new outbreaks.Subscribe to the Minnesota Now podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.  We attempt to make transcripts for Minnesota Now available the next business day after a broadcast.

        "description": "Photo by Quinn Harris/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Cubs go for two in a row over the visitors from Cincinnati. Wednesday notes...\n\n\nATTENDANCE WATCH: The Cubs have announced 2,191,150 tickets sold through Monday, 67 dates. With 14 dates remaining they must average 22,061 per date to get to 2.5 million and 29,204 per date to get to 2.6 million. The Cubs have not sold fewer than 2.6 million tickets in any year with full capacity at Wrigley Field since 1997 (fewest since: 2,623,194 in 1998 and 2,642,682 in 2013).\n\nTHE FRIENDLY CONFINES: The Cubs are 12-6 in their last 18 home games since July 17, and overall are 29-38 at home. If they can go 12-2 in the 14 remaining home games (obviously, not an easy task!) they can still have a winning season at Wrigley Field. They haven’t had a losing season at Wrigley since 2013 (31-50).\n\nHE’S HOT: Seiya Suzuki, last 16 games since August 21: .364/.444/.546 (20-for-55), four doubles, two home runs, eight walks, seven runs scored.d\n\nSO IS HE: Nick Madrigal, last 24 games since August 5: .308/.376/.352 (28-for-91), four doubles, eight walks, 11 runs scored.\n\nWALKATHON: The Cubs’ 11 walks Tuesday were their most in a nine-inning game since September 13, 2017 vs. the Mets. The Cubs haven’t walked 12 times in a nine-inning game since September 19, 2010 against the Marlins. The franchise record for such things is 15, set in an 18-5 win over the Mets, September 16, 1972. (Must be something about September!)\n\nHere are today’s particulars.\nCubs lineup:\n\n\nHere is tonight's #Cubs starting lineup vs. Cincinnati! pic.twitter.com/HNx0aB1W1X— Chicago Cubs (@Cubs) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nReds lineup: \n\n\nSpencer Steer gets his first big league start at 2B! Powered by @PNCBank pic.twitter.com/lrTDYhOpJf— Cincinnati Reds (@Reds) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nJavier Assad, RHP vs. Mike Minor, LHP\n  \n        \n      Larry Kave/Myrtle Beach Pelicans\n  \n\n  \n        \n      USA TODAY NETWORK\n  \n\nThe graphic below shows quite the pitch arsenal for Javier Assad — six different types of pitches thrown in just three MLB appearances, and a total of 186 pitches thrown.\nThat’s all good! Assad has shown he can handle most MLB hitters, the results have been good, and more starts this month should improve his confidence.\nHe’s obviously never faced the Reds or anyone on their active roster.\nMike Minor has been around a long time and has made 16 starts for the Reds this year, exactly zero of which have been against the Cubs. In fact, if you think you haven’t seen much of Minor against the Cubs, you’re right — just once since 2014. That was a single start in 2019 for the Rangers against them, on Opening Day no less. Just two current Cubs (Willson Contreras and David Bote) from that game are still on the team, and just one current Cub has faced him more than a handful of times (Franmil Reyes, 2-for-10, two walks).\nOverall this year, Minor has just been bad, at age 34 this is likely his last season. A couple of good recent starts have lowered his season ERA to under 6.00 for the first time in 2022.\nThe Cubs should really hit this guy hard.\n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \n  \n        \n      Statcast\n  \nToday’s game is on Marquee Sports Network. Here’s a list of providers currently carrying Marquee. \nHere is the complete MLB.com Mediacenter for today.\nMLB.com Gameday\nBaseball-reference.com game preview\nPlease visit our SB Nation Reds site Red Reporter. If you do go there to interact with Reds fans, please be respectful, abide by their individual site rules and serve as a good representation of Cub fans in general and BCB in particular.\nThe 2022 Game Thread procedure will be like last years, similar to what we’ve used for Spring Training.\nYou’ll find the game preview posted separately on the front page two hours before game time (90 minutes for some early day games following night games).\nAt the same time, a StoryStream containing the preview will also post on the front page, titled “Cubs vs. (Team) (Day of week/date) game threads.” It will contain every post related to that particular game, including the First Pitch Thread and the overflow thread, as well as the recap when it’s published. The recap will also live on the front page as a separate post.\nYou will also be able to find the preview, First Pitch Thread and the overflow thread in the box marked “Chicago Cubs Game Threads” at the bottom of the front page (you can also find them in this section link). The StoryStream for each game can also be found in that section.\nThe First Pitch thread will post at five minutes before game time, then an overflow thread at 90 minutes after the scheduled game time.\nDiscuss amongst yourselves.",

But this time around, you’re only saving ten dollars: they cost $169, compared to $179 for the MagSafe version (which can also be charged with a Lightning cable).\nFor those looking to trade convenience for savings, foregoing wireless charging used to be a genuinely good option, saving you 20 percent.

        "description": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.Russia is fighting a war to turn back history, but Ukrainians—and even the oppressed people of Belarus—refuse to go back under Moscow’s fist. Their resistance should inspire Americans to renew our democracy.But first, here are three new stories from The Atlantic.\r\n\tDonald Trump is caught in a double bind.\r\n\tThe right-wing war on free speech could backfire.\r\n\tThe strongest signal that Americans should worry about flu this year\r\nWhy They FightThe powerful cover of the October issue of The Atlantic features stories on Ukraine and Belarus. Reading them, I felt something like vertigo, a strange sense of living in the wrong timeline. This is an edition of the magazine that, in an earlier life, I would have regarded as an exercise in speculative fiction, the kind of alternate-history thought experiment pioneered by writers such as Harry Turtledove and Philip K. Dick: A major war is raging in Europe as Ukraine fights off Russia and volunteers from Belarus join the fray. The 30 members of NATO—30? And soon to be 32?!—are providing weapons to Ukraine and holding the line in the West.I guess I shouldn’t have fallen off the path and killed those butterflies when I used a time machine to hunt a Tyrannosaurus rex.I find all of this especially disorienting because my first career, before the years I spent teaching U.S. military officers, was as a “Sovietologist.” I studied Russian, read the works of Lenin, and traveled to the U.S.S.R. I pored over Kremlin communiqués and examined photographs in Soviet newspapers to figure out who was standing next to whom and thus which communist functionary had which job in the leadership. When the Soviet Union fell—itself a dizzying event that went from a seeming impossibility to a reality in less than a decade—I took on a new scholarly endeavor studying post-Soviet democracy and thinking about how Western policies might help give freedom in Russia and other former Soviet republics a fighting chance.But even then, a shadow loomed over my optimism: Belarus. I saw Minsk’s dictator, Alexander Lukashenko, who ascended to the presidency in 1994, as something like the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come—the dreaded future that could overtake Russia and the other former Soviet republics if their experiments in democracy failed. “Belarus,” I wrote in 1999, “has, in a matter of a few years, made great strides in returning to the Soviet past its president so openly reveres.” (Indeed, Lukashenko controls Belarus to this day.) I was also concerned about Ukraine, a country whose first two decades of independence were mired in corruption and an identity crisis driven by the division between Ukrainian nationalists and the pro-Russian population.Both Belarus and Ukraine were caught in Russia’s immense gravitational field, and their futures were unavoidably tied to events in Red Square. The Kremlin, of course, is once again a bastion of autocracy, and its master, Vladimir Putin, is trying to reestablish something like the Soviet Union. I never thought Putin’s demented fantasy had much hope of success, but although I didn’t expect democracy to flourish in the post-Soviet world, I also didn’t think anyone in Moscow would be unhinged enough to launch a major war and court global disaster.And yet, here we are. Ukraine is fighting back and, in the process—as George Packer notes in his article—defending the kinds of values the people of the United States once claimed to revere. I was especially struck by the kind of civic involvement and spirit of voluntarism that Americans once knew so well:\r\nA whole society mobilized: This was my first, and most lasting, impression. The mayor of Lviv, Andriy Sadovyi, described Ukraine in crisis as “a beehive.” Nearly everyone I met had looked for something to do as soon as Russia attacked—some way to be useful without waiting for instructions from a higher authority.\r\nThe Soviet experience killed trust and initiative among the subjects of the Soviet empire, yet Putin’s attempt to restore that empire has instead restored something like civic virtue in Ukraine. Derided by Putin and other Russians as a fictional country, Ukraine is now much more an example of a cohesive nation than Putin’s somber and dispirited Russia. Reading the passage above, I wonder how many of my fellow citizens in America could rise above their bickering and grievances to cooperate this way. It was possible in the country I once knew; today, I’m not so sure.Meanwhile, volunteers from Belarus are heading into the fight. They hope to both save Ukraine and topple Lukashenko, who was almost certainly voted out of power two years ago but instead chose violence over accepting the likely outcome. (Sounds familiar.) For these young men, the two battles are part of the same war. As Anne Applebaum writes:\r\nThe Russian invasion of Ukraine was a turning point, a different level of threat, a shock to the system, a “spit in the face.” If Ukraine does not win, one of them told me, “we will have to say goodbye to any idea of a free Belarus.”\r\nAgain, I am struck by the fortitude of people who had the choice to simply pick up and leave. “Most of the men I spoke with have other options,” Anne notes, and “they could have good lives outside Belarus if they wanted to.” These people are too young to remember the Soviet Union, but they have made their choice to defy Putin’s Soviet restoration. If the Soviet Union has to fall twice, so be it.This same spirit of courage and democratic commitment once moved Americans, the people who volunteered to defend their nation—not just with military service, but in any way they could—from the day after Pearl Harbor to the day after 9/11. The United States sees itself as an inspiration for democratic movements around the world; perhaps those same movements should now inspire us as well.Related:\r\n\tUkrainians are defending the values Americans claim to hold.\r\n\t“Lukashenko is easier to unseat than Putin.”\r\nToday’s News\r\n\tVladimir Putin said he would meet with President Xi Jinping of China next week.

By now, NASA had hoped, the gumdrop-shaped capsule—designed to carry astronauts someday—would be sending all kinds of data back home, showing engineers how its first journey to space was going.\r\n\r\nBut the capsule is still here, sitting atop a giant rocket that has so far refused to leave Earth. NASA spent weeks hyping up the inaugural flight of the Space Launch System, the rocket at the center of America’s ambitious effort to land astronauts on the moon again in this decade. Celebrity appearances and musical performances were lined up. There were enough Krispy Kreme doughnuts at the Kennedy Space Center to feed the whole state of Florida. Even the vice president flew in.

The 2016 Star Wars movie Rogue One, available to stream on Disney+. It was a minor miracle, our critic writes—and deserves some credit ahead of the upcoming Disney+ prequel series Andor.Play our daily crossword.P.S.The invasion of Ukraine is the end of a period that began (at least as a personal impression) sometime in the early 1990s, when the dust of the Soviet collapse was settling and Russians were coming to terms with their history. I’ll pass along my recommendation for some excellent history written by a Soviet historian tomorrow, but today, I want to point you to an astounding and moving 1994 film titled Burnt by the Sun—a study of love and betrayal during a summer in the early 1930s, when Stalin’s purges were closing in on one Russian family.It is a flawed but beautiful film, which makes it all the more tragic that its director, Nikita Mikhalkov, is now a Russian nationalist and Putin loyalist who supported the annexation of Crimea in 2014 and now supports the war in Ukraine. It’s important to separate the art from the artist, but it is hard to watch Burnt by the Sun and realize that its creator learned nothing from his own creation.— TomIsabel Fattal contributed to this newsletter.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/rangers-to-promote-josh-jung.html",
        "description": "The Rangers are going to promote prospect Josh Jung, per Levi Weaver of The Athletic. Brad Miller is going to go on the 10-day injured list with a hip issue, per Evan Grant of the Dallas Morning News. That will create a spot on the active roster for Jung, but he will also need a corresponding move to get him onto the 40-man roster.\nJung, 24, was selected by the Rangers with the eighth overall pick in the 2019 draft and has been considered one of the top prospects in the sport ever since. He played 44 games in the minors that year, mashing the whole way through. In 2020, he jumped onto Baseball America&#8217;s top 100 list, coming in at #93.\nOf course, 2020 brought the pandemic and all levels of the minor leagues were canceled, putting a dent in the plans of prospects all across the sport. As things were ramping back up for 2021 and they were all hoping to get back on track, Jung hit another setback. In March, he underwent surgery for a stress fracture in his foot, which was expected to lengthen his absence from organized baseball for another six to eight weeks.\nDespite those setbacks, once Jung was finally healthy, he made up for lost time in a big way, finishing 2021 on an incredible tear. He finally made his season debut in Double-A on June 15 and played 43 games at that level, hitting .308/.366/.544 for a wRC+ of 140. He was promoted to Triple-A on August 20 and somehow hit even better. In 35 games for the Round Rock Express, his slash line was .348/.436/.652, wRC+ of 166. That strong finish to his campaign launched him all the way up to #26 on Baseball America’s list going into this year.\nIt seemed possible that Jung could make his MLB debut early in 2022, maybe even cracking the Opening Day roster. However, he suffered a shoulder strain in February while lifting weights as part of his preseason training program. He had to undergo surgery, which was expected to keep him out for six months. He returned to action in August, seemingly not missing a beat. In 30 games this year, he&#8217;s hitting .267/.323/.542, hitting nine homers in that short time. Although the shoulder injury slowed him down, it only delayed the inevitable.\nJung is now considered the #42 prospect in the game by Baseball America, #12 by FanGraphs, #24 by ESPN, #39 by MLB Pipeline and #54 by Keith Law of The Athletic. Just a few days ago, the Rangers seemed committed to keeping Jung down while giving the playing time at the hot corner to Ezequiel Duran, though it seems the injury to Miller has altered the plans. Duran is having an intriguing debut season, hitting  .240/.282/.373 for a wRC+ of 86. However, he could also be moved to other positions, having spent some time in his career at second base, shortstop and center field. Miller&#8217;s been used mostly as a designated hitter recently, with that spot now freed up somewhat for days when the Rangers want both Jung and Duran in the lineup.\nIf Jung can meet the lofty expectations placed upon him by his prospect status, he could be the final piece of a Rangers infield that could be set for years to come. Shortstop Corey Seager is in the first of a ten-year deal he signed in the offseason. Marcus Semien has second base locked after signing a seven-year deal this winter. Nathaniel Lowe is enjoying a tremendous breakout season over at first, which MLBTR&#8217;s Steve Adams wrote about just yesterday. Lowe is under team control for four seasons beyond the current campaign. There&#8217;s a lot of change in the wind in Texas, as they just recently fired their manager and president of baseball operations, but it&#8217;s possible that this infield could be a solid foundation for them to build upon in the coming years, helping them emerge from a lengthy rebuilding period.\nIf Jung can stick with the big league club from here on out, he is on pace to reach arbitration for the first time after 2025 and free agency after 2028. Future option assignments could delay those timelines, however. Jung also won&#8217;t reach 60 days of service time here in 2022 and is unlikely to get 130 at-bats. That means he will retain rookie/prospect status through the winter, which could have ramifications for the team. Under the new collective bargaining agreement, players with less than 60 days of service who appear among two preseason Top 100 lists at Baseball America, ESPN or MLB Pipeline can net their team a bonus amateur draft choice based on their early-career finishes in awards voting, so long as their club carries them on the MLB roster for a full service year. If Jung cracks the Opening Day roster next year and he wins a Rookie of the Year or places highly in MVP balloting during his first couple seasons, the club could pick up an extra draft choice down the line.\nImage courtesy of USA Today Sports.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/injury-notes-carpenter-gonsolin-kopech-lowe.html",
        "description": "The miraculous Matt Carpenter comeback was put on pause last month when the infielder/outfielder for the Yankees fractured his foot. On August 10, it was reported that he would need surgery and be reevaluated in a month, with the club hopeful he could return in 6-8 weeks. Here we are almost a month later and Carpenter has made progress but not much. Bryan Hoch of MLB.com reports that Carpenter underwent some X-rays that showed healing but it isn&#8217;t enough to get him out of his protective walking boot. He&#8217;ll be reevaluated again in 10-14 days, says manager Aaron Boone.\nThat essentially eliminates any chance of Carpenter returning at the short end of that 6-8 time frame and even puts the longer end of it in doubt. By the time that next evaluation rolls around, it will already have been six weeks since the injury. Even if Carpenter gets good news at that point, he will surely need some kind of rehab assignment to get him back into game shape after such a long layoff. That could also be a challenge if the injury lingers, as most minor league teams will be winding down their seasons in the coming weeks. The Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre RailRiders are the Yankee affiliate that goes the latest, though their last scheduled game is September 28, three weeks from today.\nPrior to the injury, Carpenter was on an absolute tear, hitting 15 home runs in 47 games and slashing .305/.412/.727 for a wRC+ of 218. It&#8217;s all the more remarkable given that Carpenter was hitting at a below-average rate in the previous three seasons. The club has seemingly missed that hot bat, going 10-13 since August 10. They have a 4 1/2 game lead over the Rays and a six game cushion on the Blue Jays in the AL East race.\nSome other tidbits from around the league&#8230;\n\nDodgers righty Tony Gonsolin was placed on the IL due to a forearm strain August 29, but since the move was retroactive to August 26, he&#8217;s eligible to come off in a few days. Gonsolin has been playing catch in recent days, which is perhaps a sign that he&#8217;s not far from returning. However, it&#8217;s not all good news, with Juan Toribio of MLB.com relaying word from manager Dave Roberts that Gonsolin isn&#8217;t progressing as quickly as they initially hoped for. The Dodgers are virtually guaranteed a bye through the first round of the playoffs and can take their time with Gonsolin, though it&#8217;s at least noteworthy that the plan isn&#8217;t on schedule so far. The righty had enjoyed a tremendous breakout season, throwing 128 1/3 innings with a 2.10 ERA, 23.7% strikeout rate, 7.2% walk rate and 43.2% groundball rate.\nWhite Sox righty Michael Kopech landed on the IL August 23 due to a knee strain but was activated today after a minimum stint. After missing all of 2019 and 2020, Kopech threw 69 1/3 innings last year and has already jumped up to 110 2/3 here in 2022, coming into today&#8217;s action. He&#8217;s fared well overall on the season, registering a 3.58 ERA, though his 21.4% strikeout rate and 12% are both a bit worse than league average, with a .228 BABIP likely helping him keep that ERA down. The club will be looking for a strong finish from Kopech and the team overall, as they are currently three games back of the Guardians in the Central and 7 1/2 out of a Wild Card spot.\nThe Rays have reinstated infielder Brandon Lowe from the IL, per Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times. Lowe landed on the shelf due to a right triceps contusion but has now returned after a minimum stay. It was the second IL stint of the year for Lowe, who also missed about two months due to a back issue. Despite the multiple ailments, he&#8217;s still hitting .234/.319/.405 on the season for a wRC+ of 114. That&#8217;s a bit of a drop-off from his previous seasons but still 14% above league average.

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Even as the Yankees’ AL East lead remains on shaky ground, their MVP just keeps surging. How far will each go? Welcome to SB Nation Reacts, a survey of fans across Major League Baseball. Throughout the year we ask questions of the most plugged-in New York Yankees fans and fans across the country. Sign up here to participate.\nAaron Judge has just kept hitting homers throughout August and early September, but until Sunday, the Yankees’ AL East lead kept shrinking. So for the latest SB Nation Reacts poll, we’re going to zero in on both those topics.\nFirst off, with Judge at 55 homers with 26 games to go after the doubleheader opener today, predict how many he’ll have at the end of the season! We’ve listed a few different ranges to choose from, including ones that involve tying Babe Ruth or Roger Maris, and ones that feature various degrees of passing them (or coming up short). So you make the call!\nThe other one is a simple binary poll. Will the Yankees survive and win the AL East? Or will they complete their collapse and have to settle for, at best, a Wild Card spot? Vote “Yes” or “No” to let us know.\nPlease take our survey",

        "description": "Mary Harrington:\n\nWe can also kiss goodbye to the “marketplace of ideas”. This might have seemed plausible when everyone aspired to long-form, deliberative, rationalism and a broadly shared moral framework. When these are things of the past, we all absorb disaggregated, de-contextualised snippets of information at speed, our reading material rewards us for not concentrating long enough to think something through, and we can see everyone else thinking in real time on our screens? \n\nAh yes, I remember it well: that halcyon era when everyone sat around reading Hobbes’s Leviathan and earnestly buttonholing passersby in impassioned search for a shared moral framework.\nHarrington relies heavily on a melancholy essay by Adam Garfinkle on the subject of Literacy Lost, and for people like Harrington and Garfinkle I have some questions: \nDo you know anything — anything at all — about the history of literacy? About what people in any society, any society in the whole world, at any point in history, could read and did read? For instance: what percentage of people in France in 1900, or England in 1850, or China in 1800, or the U.S.A. in 1950, had ever in their lives read a single book? If they had read books, how intellectually demanding and substantive were those books? If they were assigned those books in school, did they actually do the reading? How were the books taught to them? That is, were the best qualities of those books explored in ways that were comprehensible and meaningful to the students? How common, or how rare, was the education in “deep reading” that you commend? \nI ask because if you don’t have this information, then you have no business making comparative judgments between our own moment and any moment in the past. And this information is hard to find. What we do know mainly makes us want to know more. You may wish that more people read, and read good books — I certainly do — but without actual data you can’t compare us to our ancestors. \nI will just say this: I think the hidden assumption in essays like Harrington’s and Garfinkle’s is that if people weren’t on social media and staring at their iPhones they’d be reading books instead. And I don’t believe for one second that that’s a safe assumption. ",

Amy Klobuchar&nbsp;(D-Minn.) said the push to pass her antitrust legislation targeting the largest tech companies isn’t dead, despite the bill still waiting for a scheduled floor vote.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKlobuchar made her latest plug for her American Innovation and Online Choice Act in an interview with Vox’s Kara Swisher&nbsp;at the Code Conference on Tuesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bill, co-sponsored by Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), aims to limit tech companies from preferencing their own products and services over rivals’. It advanced out of the Judiciary Committee with bipartisan support earlier this year, but has yet to be called for a floor vote.&nbsp;&nbsp;Klobuchar, who chairs the antitrust subcommittee, did not give an exact date or guarantee the vote will happen before the midterms.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It is really hard to take on these subjects when you have the biggest companies the world has ever known, that control an inordinate part of the economy, opposed to it,” she said in the interview. “It is an incredible amount of money I’m up against. I have two lawyers. They have 2,800 lawyers and lobbyists. So I’m not naive about the David versus Goliath.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA cyber warning for schools\n\n\n\nThe FBI and Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) are warning cyberattacks may increase against schools as the academic year begins.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a&nbsp;joint cybersecurity advisory&nbsp;published on Tuesday, the agencies detailed that a criminal syndicate known as Vice Society is “disproportionately” targeting the education sector with ransomware attacks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“School districts with limited cybersecurity capabilities and constrained resources are often the most vulnerable; however, the opportunistic targeting often seen with cyber criminals can still put school districts with robust cybersecurity programs at risk,” the advisory reads.\n\n\n\nThe agencies outlined a series of recommendations for school districts to mitigate cyber threats, like maintaining a strong relationship with their local FBI field office and maintaining password standards.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe advisory came after the Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD)&nbsp;announced it had experienced a ransomware attack&nbsp;over the weekend.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n'BOOGALOO BOIS’ REEMERGE, REPORT SAYS \n\n\n\nThe violent extremist “boogaloo” movement is showing new signs of activity on Facebook, in spite of the social media platform’s ban on the group, according to a&nbsp;new report&nbsp;from the Tech Transparency Project.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoogaloo groups and individual “boogaloo bois” have increased their activity on Facebook following the FBI’s search of former&nbsp;President Trump’s&nbsp;Mar-a-Lago home, the Tech Transparency Project found.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe boogaloo movement appears to “see this moment as a growth opportunity for their movement” and hopes to “capitalize on the&nbsp;wave of far-right anger&nbsp;at the FBI,” the report said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeta’s response: Facebook’s parent company Meta noted when it first banned the boogaloo movement in 2020 that it was aware the group would likely attempt to “return to using our platform and adopting new terminology.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is an adversarial space, with perpetrators constantly trying to find new ways to evade our policies, which is why we work with a number of organizations to flag content and stay ahead of evolving trends,” a Meta spokesperson said on Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE OTHER ANTITRUST BILL ON DECK TOMORROW \n\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee is scheduled to debate the Journalism and Competition and Preservation Act during a meeting Thursday. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe proposal would give digital news publishers the ability to negotiate collectively with dominant tech platforms, like Google and Facebook, to distribute their content. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nA revised version of the proposal was released in August by Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) and Senate Judiciary Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.). In the House, it was introduced by Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nalder (D-N.Y.) and antitrust subcommittee chair and ranking member Reps. David Cicilline (D-R.I.) and Ken Buck (D-Colo.). &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe News Media Alliance says the bill would help the local news industry after years of tech giants cutting into their revenue.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the legislation is facing pushback from tech industry group Chamber of Progress and 20 advocacy groups that sent a letter Friday to members of the&nbsp;Senate Judiciary Committee campaigning against the legislation.&nbsp; &nbsp;In part, they argue a provision in the revised bill that doesn’t allow tech companies to “discriminate against any eligible digital journalism provider,” could force tech companies to host content “regardless of how extreme” it is.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBITS &amp; PIECES\n\n\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: A better strategy to rein in Big Tech&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNotable links from around the web:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFrom Boom to Gloom: Tech Recruiters Struggle to Find Work (The New York Times / Erin Griffith) &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis Is Snap’s Turnaround Plan (The Verge / Alex Heath)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese companies are looking at using rockets to blast cargo across the planet (CNN / Jackie Wattles)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLighter click: every single time &nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne last thing: US condemns Iran’s attack \n\n\n\nThe U.S. National Security Council (NSC) on Wednesday called for Iran to be held accountable for an “unprecedented” cyberattack it said the country committed against Albania in July.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNSC spokesperson Adrienne Watson said in a release the United States condemns Iran’s actions and plans to hold Iran accountable for threatening the security of an ally and setting a “troubling precedent” for cyberspace.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA cyberattack temporarily&nbsp;shut down&nbsp;multiple Albanian government digital services and websites on July 15.

        "description": "Welcome to The Hill’s Campaign Report, tracking all things related to the 2022 midterm elections. You can expect this newsletter in your inbox every&nbsp;Tuesday, Wednesday&nbsp;and&nbsp;Thursday&nbsp;leading up to November's election.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEmail us tips and feedback: Max Greenwood (mgreenwood@thehill.com), Julia Manchester (jmanchester@thehill.com), and Caroline Vakil (cvakil@thehill.com). \n\n\n\nEven odds on Nevada Senate race\n\n\n\nWhile Senate races in places Pennsylvania, Georgia and Arizona have gotten the bulk of the media attention this summer, the Nevada Senate contest is an especially important one to watch.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat’s because it could make or break&nbsp;Democrats’ chances of&nbsp;retaining their majority in the Senate. And in Nevada, which is known for tight races —&nbsp;Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D) won her first Senate election in 2016 with just over 2 percentage points —&nbsp;this year’s election is expected to be another nailbiter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow one GOP strategist summed up the race:&nbsp;“This is the most important race on the map for Republicans or Democrats.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat Democrats are saying:&nbsp;“Democrats have shown that they have the ability to get out the vote and win close races in Nevada,” one Democratic operative said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs Caroline Vakil and Julia Manchester&nbsp;write, this swingy Senate race between Cortez Masto and Republican challenger Adam Laxalt&nbsp;in already very swingy state is likely going to hinge on abortion and the economy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe issue of abortion is going to be a particularly interesting one given that abortion rights up to 24 weeks are already protected in the state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats are already trying to put&nbsp;Laxalt on defense. The Senate Democrats’ campaign arm is airing an ad this week hitting Laxalt on his abortion stance and for previous comments he reportedly made. His campaign told The Hill that the ad was “wildly inaccurate” and “dishonest.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother issue to factor into this Senate race? How effectively&nbsp;candidates can court Latino voters, given that one in five (that’s roughly 165,100 people) are expected to vote this November.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoth campaigns, for example, have worked on Latino and Hispanic outreach through ad buys in addition to other means. Other groups have also sought to&nbsp;engage with voters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We are making sure that we are not leaving a door behind,” Cecia Alvarado, executive director of the Democratic-leaning group aimed at engaging Latino voters, Somos Votantes, said. “They have been put into the label that this is not a frequent voter, but we don’t believe in those labels. We believe in talking to our communities.” \n\n\n\nOz ramps up attacks on Fetterman  \n\n\n\nRepublican Pennsylvania Senate candidate Mehmet Oz and his allies are ramping up attacks on Democratic candidate&nbsp;John Fetterman as recent polls show the celebrity doctor trailing the state’s lieutenant governor.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWednesday marked one of the sharpest attacks in the contest yet. The American Leadership Action, a political committee backing Oz,&nbsp;rolled out a 30-second ad&nbsp;targeting Fetterman over a 2013 incident in which he brandished a gun at a Black man whom he suspected of committing a crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe spot is meant to appeal to Black voters in the state, with the ad airing on networks with robust Black viewership including Black Entertainment Television, the Oprah Winfrey Network, ESPN and MSNBC.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt comes as Oz’s campaign is working to close the gap in polls with Fetterman. Oz has recently attacked Fetterman for not agreeing to participate in upcoming Senate debates. On Tuesday, Oz and retiring Sen. Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) held a press conference calling on Fetterman to debate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Democrat’s campaign has launched its own series of attacks, many online, against Oz. And Fetterman’s allies are following suit as well. On Wednesday, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee launched a mobile billboard around Pittsburgh reminding voters of the raucous GOP Senate primary in Pennsylvania as Oz and former candidate David McCormick prepared to unite for a national security panel.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd on Tuesday, Fetterman’s campaign&nbsp;rolled out a video&nbsp;contrasting his statements defending legal abortion access for women with those of Oz calling the procedure “murder.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast week former President Trump traveled to Pennsylvania to stump for Oz and Republican gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano, with the hopes of galvanizing his base around the two GOP candidates. But Oz also appears to be trying to appeal&nbsp;to a more moderate base as well. At a press conference on Tuesday, Oz&nbsp;said that he would have certified&nbsp;President Biden’s 2020 win over Trump, a notable break with the former president.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I would not have objected to it,” Oz said. “By the time the delegates and those reports were sent to the U.S. Senate, our job was to approve it, which is what I would have done.” \n\n\n\nAD WATCH\n\n\n\nGeorgia Senate hopeful Herschel Walker’s (R) campaign&nbsp;is out with&nbsp;a new ad this week&nbsp;accusing Democrats of using “race to divide” the country. In the 30-second spot, called “Bring Us Together,” he airs clips of Democrats like President Biden and Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) speaking about race.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Senator Warnock believes America is a bad country full of racist people. I believe we’re a great country full of generous people. Warnock wants to divide us. I want to bring us together,” Warnock, who is Black, says in the ad.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund, a GOP group, launched 22 ads in 21 congressional districts on Wednesday. The ads touch on government spending, tax hikes, and crime. The spots will air in CT-05, PA-17, CA-47, TX-28, OR-05, NJ-07, NY-18, CA-13, CA-22, CA-27, CA-45, MI-03, MI-10, MN-02, NE-02, NM-02, OH-13, TX-15, VA-02, WA-08, and WI-03.  \n\n\n\nPOLL WATCH\n\n\n\nIn Michigan:&nbsp;A&nbsp;Detroit News/WDIV-TV poll&nbsp;shows Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) holding a 13-percentage point lead over Republican challenger Tudor Dixon. The poll shows Whitmer’s increase widening slightly since the last time a similar poll was conducted in July, which showed Whitmer 11 points ahead of Dixon.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn Florida: An AARP-commissioned poll shows Gov. Ron DeSantis (R ) holding a 3-percentage point lead over Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist. The polling showed 50 percent of likely Florida voters supporting DeSantis compared to 47 percent backing Crist. The polling, which was conducted by Fabrizio Ward and Impact Research, falls within the margin of error, virtually tying the two. \n\n\n\nThat’s it for today.

        "title": "Private schools are rebounding — but can it last?",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/education/3633013-private-schools-are-rebounding-but-can-it-last/",
        "description": "The National Assessment of Educational Progress has just reported steep drops in student achievement at the nation’s public schools. How will parents respond to the news? Is the downward trend in private education enrollments about to be reversed?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBefore COVID-19, private school enrollments were headed downhill. Between 1964 and 2019, the percentage of students attending private schools fell from 14 percent to 9 percent of all school-age children,&nbsp;an all-time low.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThen, in fall 2020, most public schools kept their doors closed.&nbsp;Only 24 percent of public school students attended school in person, as compared to&nbsp;&nbsp;60 percent of private school children, according to&nbsp;Education Next&nbsp;parental survey&nbsp;(which I helped design).&nbsp;The following May,&nbsp;nearly 80 percent of private schoolers&nbsp;were in class every day, as compared to only half of those at public schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLearning online was not good for students. Parents reported learning losses for 64 percent of children at public schools but only 43 percent of children at private ones. Private schools also had greater success in curbing adverse effects on children’s social relationships, emotional well-being and physical fitness.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen they opened, private schools were accused of gambling with their students’ health. Tom Carroll, superintendent of the Catholic archdiocese in Boston, recalls he “started getting letters, people saying, ‘Well, are you going to go to the funeral of every single child that you killed by opening all the schools?’” Kathleen Porter-McGee, head of a Catholic school network in New York,&nbsp;remembers,&nbsp;“it was a scary time…the fear was palpable.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen COVID spread at school proved minimal and mild, the private school bet paid off. “From the point [when schools announced closures] to roughly the middle of October, the phones kept ringing,” Carroll recalls. “So we gained about 4,400 students,” Our poll indicates a 2 percent gain in private school share between 2019 and 2022. If the survey is on the mark, it means a shift of 1 million students from the public to the private sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite these short-term gains, ever-rising costs still impede further growth. In 1979,&nbsp;median school tuition was $554. Since that time prices have escalated at&nbsp;twice the rate&nbsp;of the consumer price index. Today, the average tuition at private schools is&nbsp;more than $12,000 annually. What many middle- and working-class families could once afford is now available to them only at considerable sacrifice.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTuition hikes are likely to continue indefinitely. Education is a labor-intensive industry.&nbsp;It takes as much time today for a teacher to instruct a class of 20 as it did a century ago. For as long as that continues, schools must charge higher tuitions to pay salaries that keep pace with rising wages in the rest of the economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrivate educators must also worry about competition from charter schools. Like private schools, most charters claim to offer safe, well-disciplined classrooms. But, unlike private schools, charters are tuition-free.&nbsp;“In New York we have to bring our A game, because we’re competing for students against the most well-known and top performing charter networks in the country,”&nbsp;says Porter-Magee.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHomeschooling is emerging as another challenge. The percentage choosing that option has doubled from 3 percent to 6 percent since the pandemic. Homeschooling is also morphing into hybrid forms, such as neighborhood pods, home-private school combinations and micro-schools where parents teach.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 1,200 high-prestige schools that belong to the National Association of Independent Schools (NAIS) have the fewest worries. Even though tuition for the approximately 1 percent of the school-age population attending these schools averages a hefty $26,866 a year, they will survive if “one percenters” continue to do well.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCatholic school leaders are more concerned. According to&nbsp;Carol Ann MacGregor,&nbsp;professor at&nbsp;Waterloo University,&nbsp;“Catholic schools educated more than&nbsp;75 percent of all school children at their peak in the mid-1960s.”&nbsp;But the Catholic share of the private sector dropped to around 50 percent&nbsp;by 1993, and today it is less than 35 percent — an extraordinary loss in market share.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCatholic schools have a fine academic track record. Most studies of college enrollment rates show that Catholic schools typically outperform nearby public schools.&nbsp;Positive impacts&nbsp;of a Catholic education are especially large for&nbsp;African Americans.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut as the supply of teaching nuns waned, Catholic education costs have skyrocketed. Also, dioceses were forced to pay out more than $3 billion dollars in&nbsp;lawsuit settlements&nbsp;to victims of clergy abuse.&nbsp;Nor did it help when increasingly prosperous Catholic immigrants abandoned their cramped religious schools in central cities for spacious public schools and playgrounds in the suburbs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChristian schools are now the fastest growing segment of the private sector. White Southerners rushed to these institutions when public schools desegregated in the 1960s.\n\n\n\nToday, school leaders say they welcome African American students, who constitute&nbsp;11 percent of their enrollments.&nbsp;According to Jeff Keaton, a leader of the Christian school movement in Virginia, the country is now entering a “second Great Awakening in Christian education.” In Virginia, applications spiked when controversies over critical race theory, the 1619 Project and school gender policy filled the airways during the state’s 2021 gubernatorial campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIs a Great Awakening for private schools at hand? Perhaps. “Millions of American parents . . . are fed up with being considered nuisances and dismissed by the public school establishment,”&nbsp;says Betsy DeVos, former U.S. secretary of Education.&nbsp;Since the pandemic,&nbsp;more than 20 red and purple states&nbsp;have enacted or expanded school-choice laws of direct benefit to private schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the new laws are limited in scope. Even if all the new options were fully utilized, private school enrollments would increase by only 3 percent, leaving the share of students in the private sector below its 1964 level. Unless governments offer larger subsidies to every family that wishes to attend private school, major expansion of the private sector is unlikely. \n\n\n\nPaul E. Peterson is a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and a member of the Koret Task Force on K–12 Education. He is also the Henry Lee Shattuck Professor of Government and director of the Program on Education Policy and Governance at Harvard University.",

        "description": "Back to school season is generally a time of hope and optimism. But for families whose children rely on free or reduced-price breakfast or lunch, this school year is off to a confusing and stressful start. Our students deserve better.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEarly in the COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) implemented a waiver program that allowed public schools to serve free meals to all students for the 2020-21 school year. The program also offered schools flexibility around when and how they could serve meals, which was critical during an unpredictable time of school closures and supply chain shortages. Alongside other pandemic aid, the program helped relieve hunger — U.S. food insecurity levels in 2020 did not statistically change from 2019 levels, due to programs like this one.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile the Keep Kids Fed Act extended these critical waivers through the summer, we are now in a position where as of Sept. 30, we need leaders to act — again — so that millions of students do not go hungry.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s well-known that school meals benefit students, resulting in fewer visits to the nurse, improved attendance, better test scores, and more. What’s less well-known is that every dollar invested in U.S. school meal programs returns $2 in societal benefits by improving health outcomes and reducing childhood poverty.\n\n\n\nLast fall, The Rockefeller Foundation and the Center for Good Food Purchasing released the True Cost of Food: School Meals Case Study, which calculated the total costs and benefits of U.S. school meal programs. The case study found that these programs generate $40 billion in health and economic equity benefits — more than twice what’s spent to run them — for a net value of more than $20 billion every year. That rate of return, which would make any investor envious, calls for more investment, not less.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEighty four percent of low-income households with school-age children access free or reduced-price lunches at school. The financial benefit of receiving these meals lifts over 722,000 children above the poverty threshold, and addresses some of the factors associated with childhood poverty, including food insecurity.\n\n\n\nOur case study found that new investments in school meal programs could create an additional $10 billion in annual benefits to society and help transform communities. By optimizing the ways schools purchase food, including sourcing from local suppliers, a comprehensive program could produce another $1.3 billion in annual net value. Food purchasing dollars can support local economies, worker livelihoods, and environmental health, while also generating more equitable returns to farmers, food workers, and suppliers of color.\n\n\n\nSchool meals are healthier than the average American diet for most of the 30 million children who participate in national programs, scoring better than average on the Healthy Eating Index. On school days, these children consume as much as half their daily calories at school.\n\n\n\nIncreasing their nutrition quality even further by shifting away from processed meats and foods high in added sugar and sodium, and toward meals higher in whole grains, legumes, and vegetables, could yield an additional $1.5 billion per year by helping to prevent diet-related diseases and providing environmental and climate benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd extending free meals to significantly more children, these programs could generate more than $7.5 billion in societal value each year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe extension of the USDA’s pandemic relief program was an important stop-gap measure. But to truly nourish the next generation of Americans, we need to stop passing months-long extensions and make healthy school meals available to all students — permanently.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFederal leaders should be following the example set by California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and Vermont in adopting policies that deliver healthy school meals not only to the relief of students and their families, but to school districts and other community programs which are often tasked with helping to catch those students who fall through the cracks after not qualifying for reduced meals, but who continue to arrive at and depart from school hungry.\n\n\n\nRoy Steiner is the Senior Vice President of Food Initiatives at The Rockefeller Foundation.&nbsp;",

Although, if the Minnesota Twins can do their job in both games of their doubleheader with the Yankees, losing to the Rays does help in the side goal of ensuring that the Yankees do, in fact, suck.\nNick Pivetta has been a rock for the Sox this year, even if his performance sank like a stone during July. Every five days he goes out and takes the ball. However he’s been brutal against the Rays this season. Like really, really bad: they’re hitting .364/.431/.659 against him as a unit. On the one hand, no one is that good and Pivetta isn’t that bad. On the other? Whatever he’s been doing hasn’t been working. With any luck, his pitch mix tonight will be the right one. \nLuckily for Boston, the team opposing pitcher Jeffery Springs has struggled against this year is the Red Sox. BoSox hitters have struck .277/.346/.511 against the lefty in three starts this year. This is where there is a “however”\nXander Bogaerts and Rafael Devers are not in the lineup tonight. \n\n\nDual extension news??? One can dream. https://t.co/EVwPholAMo— Will Middlebrooks (@middlebrooks) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nWhile we’d all like to be there with Will Middlebrooks and imagine the left side of the infield huddled with Chaim Bloom signing stacks of papers (or is this kind of thing done electronically these days. I mean, is Bloom even in Tampa? Would he fly down for that?) it’s probably more for rest than anything else. Carrying the team clearly is wearing on Bogaerts’ back.",

        "description": "Welcome back, Tyler Wells! | Tommy Gilligan-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Kyle Stowers is in the lineup! That’s cool.  The Orioles changed the game plan today, pulling starting pitcher Tyler Wells from his scheduled rehab start and inserting him as the big league starter instead of Dean Kremer. Roch Kubatko has the details on this move and what it means for both Wells and Kremer in his pre-game blog post. The quick rundown is this:\n\nWells is functioning as an opener tonight and won’t go much beyond the the 30 pitches he threw in his last rehab start. \nWells will continue to be built up as a starter, just at the major league level. \nKremer will pitch in relief tonight but then he’s back in the rotation. Never fear, Kremerheads! \n\nThis is good news. The bullpen has been worked hard of late and if Wells can perform the way he was pre-injury, it will be a real boost. \nI know that we all sound like broken records at this point, but this is a must win game. A win will get the Orioles back to 2.5 games behind the Blue Jays. They can’t afford to be down 4.5 with so few games remaining. \nAlek Manoah will be a very tough nut to crack for the Orioles. In his 26 starts he’s given up two or fewer runs 20 times. Four times he has given up four earned runs, and one of those times was to the Orioles! So that’s...something? \nOrioles lineup\n1. Cedric Mullins (L) CF\n2. Adley Rutschman (S) C\n3. Anthony Santander (S) RF\n4. Ryan Mountcastle (R) 1B\n5. Gunnar Henderson (L) DH\n6. Kyle Stowers (L) LF\n7. Ramon Urias (R) 3B\n8.

        "description": "Photo by Justin Edmonds/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Freeland dominates, Rockies homer-fest continues Kyle Freeland had one of his best performances of the season and the offense combined for two homers and two doubles on a nine-hit day to secure the win on a hot afternoon Wednesday at Coors Field. The win not only sealed a series victory against the Brewers, who fell 3.5 games behind in the NL Wild Card race, but it was also Colorado’s first win in four chances after a walk-off win the day before. \nToglia and Trejo tag team\nThe Rockies offense got to work in the second inning when Brendan Rodgers got things going with a one-out single. Toglia followed that up with an RBI double to right field and advanced to third on a fielding error. Not bad for the rookie’s first hit at Coors Field.\n\n\nMichael Toglia's RBI double scores Brendan Rodgers pic.twitter.com/oGmT6wxSLC— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nElias Díaz connected for the Rockies third consecutive hit, singling in Toglia to make it 2-0. Alan Trejo then doubled the Rockies lead with his second homer of the year, a 398-foot blast to left field. \n\n\nBats are still boomin' in LoDo @AlanTre13 pic.twitter.com/b9b3JCBkdX— Colorado Rockies (@Rockies) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Rockies added on in the third inning when Yonathan Daza led off with a single and Rodgers drew a two-out walk. Toglia made Milwaukee starter Eric Lauer pay by rocketing a 1-0 slider 421 feet to the left field bleachers to put the Rockies up by a score NFL fans would recognize. The bomb was Toglia’s second of the year and first-ever at Coors Field.\n\n\nIt's Toglia time! @Rockies up by a touchdown and PAT pic.twitter.com/kIiSN9n6GP— AT&amp;T SportsNet™ | RM (@ATTSportsNetRM) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nThe offensive outpouring has seen the Rockies score 22 runs against the Brewers with a total of seven homers while going 2-1 vs. Milwaukee at Coors Field. The Rockies are averaging 0.9 homers per game this year, which ranks No. 13 in the National League and No. 22 overall in MLB. \nFreeland dominates \nKyle Freeland was on Wednesday afternoon. Despite the heat that was 94 degrees at first pitch and climbed into the upper 90s throughout the afternoon, Freeland matched his season-high of eight strikeouts in a six-inning, one-walk, one-run performance that only required 85 pitches. Freeland only gave up two hits, blending his slider and curveball to keep the Brewers off balance. Freeland got the ball rolling by striking out Christian Yelich and Willy Adames back-to-back to start the game. In the second, he caught Rowdy Tellez looking and Keston Hiura swinging. Even though he gave up a single to Luis Urias and walked Yelich in the third, he got out of it with two ground balls and a flyout. Freeland recorded eight ground-ball outs in the game. The only run came in the fifth when Hiura led off with a triple that carried to the right field wall. Hiura came in to score when Victor Caratina hit a grounder to Trejo. On the day, Freeland recorded 15 swing and misses.\n\n\nKyle Freeland6 IP2 H1 R1 BB8 Ks pic.twitter.com/PcbdT7Fw5J— RoxGifsVids (@RoxGifsVids) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nDaza continues to dazzle\nIn his second game after returning from the IL after dislocating his shoulder, Daza continued to bring his energy and great hitting to the Rockies. He went 2-for-4 with a double, single, and two runs scored. He’s now 4-for-8 with four runs scored, four RBI, two doubles, one homer, and a 1.125 slugging percentage. Daza came around to score the Rockies final run of the game in the seventh when C.J. Cron hit an RBI groundout for his 90th RBI of the year. Díaz also went 2-for-4 with an RBI and a run scored.\nBullpen not great, but does enough\nJustin Lawrence worked a nice seventh inning, giving up a single to Andrew McCutchen, but avoiding any further damage by striking out two and getting a ground out. In the eighth, Yelich hit an RBI double to make it 8-2 before Lawrence struck out Hunter Renfroe to end the inning. In the ninth, Jake Bird got into some trouble when he dished up solo homers to McCutchen and Luis Urias. That cut the Rockies lead to 8-4 and got Carlos Estévez up in the bullpen, but was able to escape worse damage when Rodgers made a great diving play to knock down a would-be single by Caratini, but got the ball and fired it to Toglia to end the game.\nUp next\nThe Rockies will have a day off on Thursday before opening a three-game set against Arizona at Coors Field beginning Friday. Germán Márquez (8-10, 4.86 ERA) will be on the mound for the Rockies, while the Diamondbacks will look to Zach Davies (2-4, 3.74 ERA).",

        "description": "Really Great Things. Photograph by Scott Etkin.\nBy Scott Etkin and Lisa Kava\nReally Great Things, the high-end clothing boutique on Columbus Avenue between 73rd and 74th Streets, has closed. The spacious glass shop, which had been operating in that space for more than two decades, offered personal service for a curated set of European-designed clothes, shoes and accessories for everyday wear and special occasions. The boutique was the stylist behind some notable figures, such as: chef Carla Hall, former United States Ambassador to the UN Rosemary DiCarlo, and film producer Valda Witt. “The Really Great Things family would like to thank all of our clients, friends and neighbors for a wonderful 26 years at 284 Columbus Ave. Please stay tuned,” the website says. WSR will update with more information soon. (Thanks to Lisa and Faye for the tips.)\nMade in New York Pizza. Photograph by Scott Etkin.\nMade in New York Pizza opened a new location on Amsterdam between 72nd and 73rd Streets. Less than 10 blocks away from the pizzeria’s existing store on 80th and Amsterdam (which remains open), the second shop serves to “increase our delivery footprint,” they wrote in a message to WSR. While the new shop doesn&#8217;t have a delivery driver yet, it currently makes deliveries within a few block radius. The Infatuation wrote that it’s a good pizza option on the UWS, if you’re too far south to get to Mama’s Too. The new shop takes the place of Joe Coffee. (Thanks to Joeanna for the tip.) \nRoyale Cleaners. Photograph by Mark.\nRoyale Cleaners at 689 Columbus Avenue (on 93rd Street) has a “temporary disruption at their storefront,” as of September 6th. A sign on the door informs customers to call or text (212-662-5935) to arrange pick up of outstanding dry cleaning or laundry. “We are in a bit of a situation right now as there are issues with the landlord,” the manager told WSR. “We are hoping this is temporary and are trying to work it out.” Royale Cleaners is still operating, the manager assured us. “Customers can call us to drop off laundry and dry cleaning, which we will then send to our warehouse and arrange to return when clean. Please call a day in advance, to give us notice.” If Royale Cleaners is unable to agree on a deal with the current landlord, they will look for a new storefront in the neighborhood, the manager said. (Thanks to Mark for the tip.)\nEl Coco. Photograph by Scott Etkin.\nEl Coco, a taqueria with locations in Chelsea and Hell’s Kitchen, has opened at 104 West 73rd Street, near Columbus Avenue. Open daily from noon to 10pm, it has an “all day happy hour” featuring $5 margaritas, $4 tacos, and $3 empanadas. In the back of the restaurant, there’s a covered patio, which fits around 30 people, and is also available for private events. El Coco replaces Portofino Sun, the beauty and tanning salon.\nColumbus Gourmet Food. Photograph by Scott Etkin.\nColumbus Gourmet Food on Columbus between 72nd and 73rd was closed by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Division of Environmental Health. The pizzeria and deli had a “B” grade posted in its storefront window from its last Sanitary Inspection, issued in April. (Thanks to Mark for the tip.)\nNote: WSR saw workers carrying fixtures out of Columbus Gourmet on Wednesday afternoon around 4:00 PM.\nPhotograph by Carol Tannenhauser.",

        "description": "Russian President Vladimir Putin on Wednesday said Russia has \"not lost a thing\" from the war in Ukraine and has strengthened itself during the conflict while he strived to paint the Western world as struggling with economic crises.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the Eastern Economic Forum in Vladivostok, Russia — where he delivered opening remarks castigating the Western world for about half of his speech — Putin acknowledged the war has polarized his country but said Russia will \"stand to benefit\" from the effort and that he would \"carry it through\" to the end.\n\n\n\n\"I'm confident that we have not lost a thing, nor are we going to lose anything,\" the Russian leader said at the annual economic and trade forum for Eastern world leaders. \"The greatest achievement is a stronger sovereignty for Russia, which is an inevitable outcome for what is currently happening. It's true we see a certain polarization in the world and inside the country, but I think we will only stand to benefit from that.\"\n\n\n\nPutin also claimed that Russia did not initiate the war in Ukraine. His forces invaded the Eastern European nation in late February after he called Ukrainian leaders \"nazis\" and puppets of the West.\n\n\n\n\"We did not start anything as far as military action goes. We're trying to end the military action,\" Putin said. \"The military action started in 2014 after a coup d'état in Ukraine by those who did not want a normal, peaceful development, who wanted to suppress their people.\"\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Ukrainians seeking closer ties to the European Union erupted in protest after pro-Russian President Viktor Yanukovych suspended an association agreement with the 27-member nation economic bloc. \n\n\n\nSecurity forces killed around 100 protesters before pressure grew and Yanukovych was forced to flee to Russia. Putin responded by annexing the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine and fomenting rebellions in the eastern region of the nation before he invaded the country full force in February.\n\n\n\nThe war has dragged on without a decisive victory from either side, but over the spring, Russian troops were pushed out of the capital region of Kyiv and the western portion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nRussia is concentrating its attacks in the east and has taken some key cities. Ukraine recently announced that a large counterattack to reclaim territory is underway.\n\n\n\nU.S. officials, who are heavily backing Ukraine financially along with other Western nations, estimated in August that Russia has suffered around 70,000 to 80,000 casualties in under six months. There are reports of soldiers resigning from the army in protest.\n\n\n\nInside Russia, the war is considered to be divisive, although it's unclear how strong the opposition is.\n\n\n\nRussia over the spring passed laws to criminalize language about the war in Ukraine, which Putin calls a \"special military operation,\" and has cracked down on protesters. From late February to early March, more than 13,000 Russians protesting the war were arrested.\n\n\n\nAt the economic forum on Wednesday, an important event for trade and foreign investment in Russia, Putin downplayed the slew of Western sanctions employed against his country.\n\n\n\nThe Russian leader also portrayed the U.S. and its allies as \"slipping\" on the world stage because the dollar and European currencies have decreased in value as the countries face high inflation rates.\n\n\n\n\"The whole system of international relations has seen irreversible, tectonic shifts,\" Putin said. \"The level of industrial development Europe has attained — the quality of life, social and economic stability, all of that —has sort of been burned to fuel by the sanctions machine.\n\n\n\n\"Back in spring, many foreign corporations were racing to announce their pullout from Russia, thinking that it was our country that would stand to suffer the most,\" he continued. \"But as we can see [it's] Europe itself shutting down production facilities and jobs.\"\n\n\n\nThe European Council estimated last month that Russia's inflation rate climbed to 22 percent, compared to an 8.5 percent increase in the U.S. \n\n\n\nThe council also said trade has plummeted in Russia, with both exports and imports of products down more than 30 percent.\n\n\n\nBut Putin argued Russia was \"overcoming financial and technological aggression\" from the West and his nation was trending \"upward' while the Western world was trending \"downward.\"\n\n\n\n\"We have stabilized our currency market, our financial market, [and] the inflation rate is going down,\" the Russian leader claimed. \"Russia as a sovereign nation will always protect our national interests.\"",

        "description": "Former President Obama and first lady Michelle Obama had their official portraits unveiled at the White House today. The latter's portrait captured the former first lady&nbsp;looking “fine,”&nbsp;according to her husband.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA judge in Texas ruled on Wednesday that provisions in the Affordable Care Act requiring employer health plans to cover HIV prevention drugs violated religious freedom laws.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelcome to Overnight Health Care, where we’re following the latest moves on policy and news affecting your health. For The Hill, we’re Nathaniel Weixel and Joseph Choi. Subscribe here.\n\n\n\nFederal judge rules against ObamaCare provisions\n\n\n\nA federal judge in Texas on Wednesday ruled that key parts of the Affordable Care Act that require insurers to cover many preventive services for free are unconstitutional.\n\n\n\nJudge Reed O’Connor — who struck down the entire ObamaCare law in 2018 — also ruled that the law’s requirement that health plans cover HIV prevention drugs violates the religious freedom of a Christian-owned company.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Texas employers who challenged the provision argued it violates the Religious Freedom Restoration Act by forcing people to pay for coverage that conflicts with their faith and personal values.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpecifically, they said paying for health plans that cover HIV prevention drugs, known as PrEP, makes them “complicit in facilitating homosexual behavior, drug use, and sexual activity outside of marriage between one man and one woman.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFallout:&nbsp;Under ObamaCare, any service or drug that gets an “A” or “B” rating from the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) must automatically be added to that list of free services.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut O’Connor ruled any services recommended by members of the USPSTF are invalid because they “are unconstitutionally appointed.”Insurers would be able to charge for cancer screening, substance abuse treatment, colonoscopies, depression screenings and many other services if the ruling stands.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFamiliar name:&nbsp;The ruling came in response to a lawsuit filed by Jonathan Mitchell, a former Texas solicitor general. Mitchell is the architect of Texas’s abortion law that offers a $10,000 award to private citizens who successfully sue abortion providers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nHochul lifts mask mandate on mass transit \n\n\n\nNew York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) on Wednesday announced the state’s health department will lift its mask mandate for public transit, shelters and correctional facilities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHochul declared the move “a new normal” in the state’s fight against COVID-19, adding that officials will still encourage mask-wearing on transit and the mandate remains in effect for health care facilities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Getting vaccinated, boosted is our best shot, but also we have to restore some normalcy to our lives,” Hochul said at a press conference. “And so, we’ll be talking about a new normal starting today.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMask requirements will remain in health care facilities such as hospitals and nursing homes.The mask mandate for public transit in the state has been in effect since April 2020. State and local officials have gradually scaled back New York’s initial requirement to wear face coverings in public when social distancing wasn’t possible as the pandemic progressed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHochul on Wednesday said she expected many to still wear masks on public transit and urged the public to follow newly posted signage in subway stations that reads, “let’s respect others’ choices.”\n\n\n\nFollowing Hochul’s announcement, the New York Taxi &amp; Limousine Commission also loosened mask rules in yellow cabs and rideshare vehicles.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nSENATE DEMS OUT WITH COVID\n\n\n\nThree Democratic senators have disclosed positive COVID-19 diagnoses so far this week, with one lawmaker quarantining overseas due to his infection.\n\n\n\nSen.&nbsp;Bob Menendez&nbsp;(D-N.J.) announced his&nbsp;positive test&nbsp;Wednesday afternoon, saying he was experiencing “mild” symptoms.Sen.&nbsp;Jon Ossoff&nbsp;(D-Ga.)&nbsp;announced he tested positive&nbsp;earlier on Wednesday while in India for a planned eight-day trip as part of an economic delegation. His office said Ossoff would isolate in the country and expects to return to the United States next week.Sen.&nbsp;Jacky Rosen&nbsp;(D-Nev.) on Tuesday&nbsp;announced she also tested positive&nbsp;and will work remotely throughout the week.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe split vote:&nbsp;With the Senate’s 50-50 makeup, any absence can swing the odds of a piece of legislation’s success if lawmakers vote strictly along party lines.\n\n\n\nRepublican Sen. Richard Burr (N.C.) also announced that he had tested positive for the coronavirus earlier this week.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe chamber is&nbsp;slated to hold multiple votes&nbsp;on President Biden’s judicial nominees this week.\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nABOUT 1 IN 4 YOUNG ADULTS GETTING MENTAL HEALTH CARE: CDC \n\n\n\nAlmost a quarter of all young adults received mental health care treatment last year, according to&nbsp;recently released&nbsp;data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\n\n\nObserved trends:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe number of adults aged 18 to 44 who received mental health care in the past 12 months saw the biggest increase from 2019, rising from 18.5 percent to 23.2 percent. The percentage of all adults who received mental health treatment also increased from 19.2 percent in 2019 to 21.6 percent in 2021.The percentage of adults aged 45 to 64 who received treatment saw a more modest increase from 20.2 percent to 21.2 percent, while the percentage of adults aged 65 and older decreased slightly from 19.4 percent to 18.9 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWho was counted:&nbsp;The CDC considered adults to have received mental health treatment if they reported taking prescription medication for their mental health, receiving counseling or therapy from a mental health professional or both.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNon-Hispanic Asian adults remained the least likely to receive treatment in each of the three years reviewed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nMich. judge declares 1931 abortion ban unconstitutional\n\n\n\nA Michigan judge on Wednesday ruled a state law passed in 1931 that banned abortions cannot be enforced, citing the state’s constitution and the right to privacy that it provides.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPlanned Parenthood of Michigan filed the lawsuit against the Michigan state government in April to halt a near-total abortion ban from going into effect.&nbsp;&nbsp;The 1931 law, which was triggered after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, banned all abortions except in situations where the mother’s life was endangered due to her pregnancy. No exceptions for incest or rape are included in the ban.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ruling:&nbsp;Michigan Court of Claims Chief Judge Elizabeth Gleicher wrote in her decision that the law “violates the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses of the Michigan Constitution.” She found that the law was unconstitutional because it would “deprive women of their right to bodily integrity and autonomy, and the equal protection of the law.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is the legal landscape against which the Court must evaluate the undisputed evidence in this case,” Gleicher wrote, further adding that the law would “endanger the health and lives of women seeking to exercise their constitutional right to abortion.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe defense in the lawsuit had argued that an abortion ban had nothing to do with bodily integrity on the basis that pregnancy did not involve “nonconsensual entry into the body.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“When pregnancy is desired, the word ‘intrusion’ is likely low on the list of a mother’s descriptors of the process. But when pregnancy is unwelcome, dangerous, or likely to result in negative health consequences, it is indeed a ‘bodily intrusion,'” Gleicher wrote.\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nSen.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/international/3633096-ukraines-military-chief-warns-of-direct-threat-of-russian-nuclear-weapons/",
        "description": "Ukraine’s top military leader warned Wednesday that the \"direct threat\" of Russia's nuclear weapons remains a major factor in its decision-making amid conflict in the country.  \n\n\n\nGen. Valeriy Zaluzhnyi, the commander in chief of Ukraine’s armed forces, and Lt. Gen. Mykhailo Zabrodskyi said in an article published in state news outlet Ukrinform that the possibility of world powers engaging in \"limited\" nuclear warfare cannot be ruled out.\n\n\n\n\"It is hard to imagine that even nuclear strikes will allow Russia to break Ukraine's will to resist,\" they said. \"But the threat that will emerge for the whole of Europe cannot be ignored.\"\n\n\n\nZaluzhnyi and Zabrodskyi said any Russian attempt at taking steps toward using nuclear weapons should be preempted by world powers “employing the entire arsenal of means” at their disposal. \n\n\n\n\"After all, starting from this moment, the Russian Federation will become not only a threat to the peaceful coexistence of Ukraine, its neighbors, and a number of European countries but also a truly global-scale terrorist state,\" they said.\n\n\n\nThe military members said Russia has shown neglect of global nuclear security in a conventional war through its actions in the Russia-Ukraine conflict. They pointed to Russia setting up a military base at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant and deploying heavy artillery on its premises as evidence.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts and world leaders have expressed concerns that shelling around the plant could lead to a nuclear disaster in the area. Inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency visited the plant last week to examine it, and the agency’s leader announced on Friday that two would remain at the plant permanently to continue to inspect it. \n\n\n\nRussia and Ukraine have accused each other of shelling around the plant, which is the largest in Europe. Russia captured the plant earlier in the war.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZaluzhnyi and Zabrodskyi said the other factor that contributes to Ukraine’s decisionmaking is the country’s access to significant resources and funds.\n\n\n\n\"Ukraine's effort to survive an onslaught of a superpower requires, and will continue to require, significant material resources and funds,\" they said.\n\n\n\nThey added that many populations worldwide have trouble imagining World War II-style combat operations in real life despite media coverage of the conflict.\n\n\n\n\"Air raid sirens, missile attacks and bombardments of peaceful settlements, flows of refugees and prisoners of war, river crossings operations, and tank breakthrough attempts – for most people across the world, all of this remains only a ghostly history of the last century’s two world wars,\" the leaders said.\n\n\n\nBut these effects of the war have become an “integral” part of everyday life for Ukrainians, they said.",

        "description": "Photo by Lachlan Cunningham/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Spencer Strider overcame a rough first inning and Atlanta’s offense came to life late in a 7-3 win over the Athletics The Atlanta Braves extended their winning streak to seven-straight games Wednesday afternoon with a 7-3 win over the Oakland Athletics. \nAfter record setting performance in his last start, Spencer Strider’s day got off to a tough start Wednesday. He walked Vimael Machin to begin the game before Seth Brown lined out to center for the first out. Strider then issued another free pass to Sean Murphy. Stephen Vogt followed with a double off the left center wall that scored Machin to give Oakland a 1-0 lead. Ramon Laureano then grounded out sharply to Dansby Swanson for the second out. Murphy scored on the play to make it 2-0. Strider issued yet another walk to Jonah Bride, but then struck out Cody Thomas to bring the inning to an end. \nAfter not walking a batter in his last outing, Strider issued three in the first and needed 36 pitches to navigate the first. He came back out for the second and got a much-needed quick inning. He added two more strikeouts in the third. \nWhile Strider struggled to start, Oakland lefty Ken Waldichuk held Atlanta’s offense in check over the first three innings. Travis d’Arnaud reached on an infield single in the second, but was left stranded. Waldichuk induced three more fly outs in the third including a deep fly by Ronald Acuña Jr. that Laureano ran down on the warning track. \nThe Braves finally got to Waldichuk in the fifth as he hit d’Arnaud with a pitch and then allowed a two-run shot to right center off the bat of Vaughn Grissom. \n\n\n           @GrissomVaughn | #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/7RrVbReeg3— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Braves took the lead in the sixth. Waldichuk got Acuña to ground out for the first out, but then gave up a solo home run to Swanson to make it 3-2. \n\n\nDANS @LieutenantDans7 | #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/SSGqy8yqfk— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nStrider settled in after the tough start and retired 15 straight before allowing a two-out single to Vogt in the sixth. He came back and struck out Laureano to leave Vogt stranded. \nThat would close the book on Strider who was impressive again allowing two hits, three walks and two runs to go along with nine strikeouts in six innings. He threw 103 pitches with 36 of those coming in the first inning. \nThe Braves added some much-needed insurance in the seventh. Grissom recorded his sixth hit of the series with a one-out single in the seventh. Michael Harris then extended his hitting streak to 14-straight games with a single of his own to left. Marcell Ozuna followed with a single to left that scored Grissom to make it 4-2. Robbie Grossman followed with a two-run double to the gap in right center to make it 6-2. \n\n\nDos, man#ForTheA pic.twitter.com/5V9mhzvtN7— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nAfter another pitching change, Acuña greeted Norge Ruiz with an opposite field single to score Grossman and make it 7-2. \n\n\nMake it 7️⃣!@ronaldacunajr24 | #ForTheA pic.twitter.com/tMHEyNkcLD— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nCollin McHugh issued a leadoff walk to Jonah Bride, but then struck out the next three batters he faced in the seventh. Tyler Matzek allowed a solo home run to Seth Brown to make it 7-3, but nothing else in the eighth. Raisel Iglesias retired the side in order in the ninth to end the game. \nWith the win, Atlanta completes the two-game sweep and goes a perfect 4-0 against Oakland. They are 86-51 on the season and keep the pressure on the Mets who are in Pittsburgh for a doubleheader Wednesday. Atlanta will enjoy an off day Thursday before heading up to Seattle to begin a three-game series against the Mariners.",

(credit: Samuel Axon)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCUPERTINO, Calif.—Today, Apple revealed its 2022 flagship iPhone lineup, including the iPhone 14, iPhone 14 Plus, iPhone 14 Pro, and iPhone 14 Pro Max. While there were few surprises after months of accurate leaks, and the fundamental design hasn't changed yearly, there are some interesting new things to see—particularly with the Pro phones.\nWe spent a few minutes handling the new devices and taking photos at a showroom within Apple's Steve Jobs Theater. While we only had a few moments with each device, we walked away with the impression that at least as much as things change, they ultimately stay the same. The phones feel the same in your hands and offer most of the same features as other recent flagship iPhones.\nTo that point, here are our photos of the iPhone 14 and iPhone 14 Plus. The 6.7-inch Plus phone replaces the 5.4-inch mini in the iPhone 14 lineup, while the iPhone 14 has pretty much the same dimensions as the iPhone 13.Read 5 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: Getty | Mark Wilson)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDisgraced e-cigarette-maker Juul has agreed to pay $438.5 million to 33 states and Puerto Rico to settle an investigation into whether the vaping giant deceptively marketed its products and intentionally targeted children and teens, who are most vulnerable to nicotine addiction.\nThe mammoth settlement comes as the company continues its fight for survival with the US Food and Drug Administration. In June, the FDA made the dramatic move of denying marketing authorization for all Juul products, effectively forcing the e-cigarette maker off the US market. Juul quickly won administrative stays, though, and the FDA announced in July that it would re-review Juul's products. In the meantime, the company is allowed to continue selling its products, but its ultimate fate remains precarious.\nThe legal settlement and regulatory uncertainty are the latest fallout from Juul's alleged role in fueling a nationwide \"epidemic\" of youth vaping, which peaked in 2019. Juul became notorious for appealing to children and teens as vaping among middle and high school students skyrocketed.Read 8 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Ars Technica)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday was Apple's big day for product announcements, but some of Labor Day's best deals continue to roll on. Though not from the product families Apple spoke about today, discounts on MacBook Pros are among the top values right now. The 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pros are on sale for the lowest prices we've seen ($1,599 and $2,099, respectively), discounted at $400 less than their typical starting prices. In our guide, we noted the 14-inch MacBook as the best in Apple's stable for software developers, engineers, and researchers, while the 16-inch MacBook is best for designers, artists, and other visual creatives. Both offer more ports than a MacBook Air.\nThe Google Pixel 6 lineup is also on sale, matching the lowest prices we've seen on these already value-stuffed phones. The entire lineup is seeing temporary price cuts, including the Pixel 6 ($499 $580), Pixel 6 Pro ($649 $855), and more entry-level Pixel 6a ($399 ($445). We're fans of the entire lineup. Our reviews editor, Ron Amadeo, called the Pixel 6 a \"great flagship smartphone,\" later noting in a separate review that the Pixel 6a pares down this formula \"to perfection.\"\nElsewhere around the web, there's still a sale on Apple's AirPods Max over-the-ear ANC headphones (unfortunately, there haven't been any further discounts on the first-generation AirPods Pro since today's announcement of the second generation), a handful of Google Nest Hub devices, a hefty discount on NBC's Peacock streaming service, and some free video games for Amazon Prime members.

        "description": "Photo by Kelsey Grant/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Fiddling around with another measure of bullpen suckiness \n\nToday's Lineups\n\n\n\n\nDIAMONDBACKS\nPADRES\n\n\n\n\nJosh Rojas - 3B\nHa-Seong Kim - SS\n\n\nKetel Marte - 2B\nJuan Soto - RF\n\n\nJake McCarthy - RF\nManny Machado - 3B\n\n\nEmmanuel Rivera - 1B\nJosh Bell - DH\n\n\nDaulton Varsho - DH\nJurickson Profar - LF\n\n\nCorbin Carroll - LF\nWil Myers - 1B\n\n\nCooper Hummel - C\nJake Cronenworth - 2B\n\n\nAlek Thomas - CF\nAustin Nola - C\n\n\nGeraldo Perdomo - SS\nJose Azocar - CF\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTommy Henry - LHP\nYu Darvish - RHP\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs if anyone needed it, last night was further proof that the D-backs’ bullpen is an issue. Between them, our two main closers, Ian Kennedy and Mark Melancon, have combined for 27 saves... and 17 losses, in only 95 innings of work. With another Win Probability well into the negative eighties, these two men have now combined to be worth -312% there this year. Oh, yeah: they’re also far and away the most expensive relievers on the roster, earning close to $11 million between them. I think Caleb Smith is about the only other bullpen arm who is not at league minimum this season. \nBut I was tooling around with some figures, and decided to try and come up with a measure of relief effectiveness based on Win Probability and innings pitched. Keeping it simple, I went for WP divided by IP. Basically, it’s the change in the chances of a team winning for every inning pitched by the reliever. I drew an arbitrary, but it feels reasonable, cutoff of thirty innings of work this season, which gave me 226 qualifying relievers. That’s an average of about 71⁄2 per team, so more or less a full bullpen. The resulting metric had a range of 7.15 down to -4.64: Coincidentally, the median guy is Caleb Smith, at 0.49. it makes sense it skews positive, as most really bad relievers probably will get DFA’d before reaching 30 innings. \nHere’s a link to the full spreadsheet. By this metric, the best reliever in the majors this season is... Daniel Bard, the Rockies closer and former D-backs motivational speaker. While other relievers have a lower ERA, he has piled up +358% in barely fifty innings for a score of 7.15. The worst, to my surprise, is not Melancon, but Art Warren of the Reds: In 36 innings, he is at -167% of WP, for that -4.64 score. Melancon does rank 225th of 226, at -4.31, and Kennedy is not much better, his -2.62 coming in 210th. But what stands out for Arizona in general is they do not have a single reliever in the top 60. Our highest ranked arm is Kyle Nelson, #61 with a score of 1.60. Here’s the full list of Arizona bullpen pitchers:\n\n#61: Kyle Nelson, 1.60\n#96: Joe Mantiply, 0.83\n#113: Caleb Smith, 0.49\n#162: Noe Ramirez, -0.80\n#210: Ian Kennedy, -2.62\n#225: Mark Melancon, -4.64\n\nCollectively, Arizona’s bullpen has posted a collective WP of -414%, with ranks them 28th in the majors, ahead of just the Giants (-419%) and Marlins (-480%). So they’re basically one more meltdown and blown lead away from being the worst in the majors...",

        "description": "Both Sens. Joe Manchin (D) and Charles Schumer (D) say an upcoming stopgap bill will feature permitting reform, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen is set to make a big promise on fossil fuels and the Federal Reserve will pilot climate risk analysis.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is Overnight Energy &amp; Environment, your source for the latest news focused on energy, the environment and beyond. For The Hill, we’re Rachel Frazin and Zack Budryk. Subscribe here. \n\n\n\nManchin: Permitting reform promised for funding bill\n\n\n\nSen.&nbsp;Joe Manchin&nbsp;(D-W.Va.) said Wednesday that Democratic leadership told him the permitting reform he has pushed for will be included in a government funding measure known as a continuing resolution.\n\n\n\n“Permitting is in,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAsked Wednesday whether he was told by leadership that the reforms would be included in the funding measure, he answered affirmatively.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe story so far:&nbsp;Manchin, the Senate's most conservative member and a key swing vote, has pushed for legislation that would speed up the process for approving energy and infrastructure projects.\n\n\n\nWhen Manchin announced his support for the Democrats’ climate, tax and health care bill this summer, he and Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a joint statement that they would separately pass a deal to reform the permitting process for these projects as part of the deal.\n\n\n\nBut the push has come under fire from progressives, led by Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), who have raised concerns about the potential for undermining environmental reviews and helping the fossil fuel industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGrijalva, who chairs the House Natural Resources Committee,&nbsp;has circulated&nbsp;a letter asking leadership to separate the Manchin deal out of the continuing resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHis office told The Hill last week that they had more than 40 signatories so far and were still circulating at that time.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe has argued that these measures are largely ones that are supported by Republicans and shared concerns with environmentalists that expedited reviews could harm vulnerable groups.\n\n\n\nSCHUMER COMMITS\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) promised on Wednesday to pass a side deal on permitting reform with Manchin despite growing opposition from progressive House Democrats.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSchumer said he will put permitting reform legislation that would speed the development of fossil fuel and other energy projects in the stopgap spending measure Congress needs to pass to keep the federal government funded beyond Sept. 30.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Our intention is to add it to the CR,” Schumer told reporters Wednesday, referring to the short-term continuing resolution to fund the government, which he said must get passed this month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe decision will make it tougher for House progressives, who feel little obligation to help Manchin pass one of his top energy development priorities, to block it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more from Rachel and The Hill’s Alexander Bolton. \n\n\n\nYellen: US to ‘rid’ itself from fossil fuel dependence\n\n\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen is set to call out the fossil fuel industry in a Thursday speech on the Biden administration’s economic agenda to be delivered in Detroit, Mich., where oil and gas companies have long held influence in the U.S. auto manufacturing sector.\n\n\n\nThe visit to Detroit comes on the heels of the Democrats’ passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which includes $14.2 billion worth of subsidies for electric vehicles meant to wean the auto industry off of gasoline in an effort to reduce U.S. transportation emissions that are contributing to a rise in global temperatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We will rid ourselves from our current dependence on fossil fuels,” Yellen’s prepared remarks say.&nbsp;“Our plan — powered by the Inflation Reduction Act — represents the largest investment in fighting climate change in our country’s history. It will put us well on our way toward a future where we depend on the wind, sun, and other clean sources for our energy,” her remarks continue.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYellen’s speech will also emphasize the role that private capital can play in addressing climate change, putting her generally in line with the economic, social and corporate governance (ESG) movement.\n\n\n\nThe ESG movement in the financial sector pursues environmental and social equality objectives through divestment practices and getting board members with particular political views elected to company boards.“By mobilizing private capital, the clean energy tax credits implemented by Treasury will propel our economy and workers to a leadership position in the fastest growing markets and technologies of today and the future, with positive spillovers to the rest of the world. And in the process of boosting domestic clean energy production, the law will support our energy security and insulate us from the type of fossil fuel-driven energy volatility that we’ve seen in the past year,” her remarks say.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFrom the other side:&nbsp;Republicans at the state level have been mobilizing to block ESG practices, which they view as harmful to their economies, with various initiatives in states like West Virginia and Texas that include a blacklist of financial firms that “[boycott] energy companies” and a request for documents from certain institutional investors on Wall Street.\n\n\n\nTexas state Sen. Bryan Hughes (R), whose State Affairs Committee sent letters to asset management giant BlackRock and three other firms asking for information on ESG practices, said in an interview with The Hill that he is concerned about corporate power advancing a “left-wing agenda.”\n\n\n\n“You know how it goes. BlackRock comes to Company X and says we own however many million shares in your company, and if you want us to vote for your directors and your compensation, then you better do what we say,” Hughes said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s one thing for that power to exist, but when we see a handful of firms control this amount of the stock market and we see them moving in lockstep using that power for this left-wing agenda, it’s just something we’ve never seen in America,” he said.\n\n\n\nBlackRock previously stated it does not boycott fossil fuel companies, but CEO Larry Fink has said that he believes capitalism can change the way societies operate.\n\n\n\n“Capitalism has the power to shape society and act as a powerful catalyst for change,” he wrote in a 2022 open letter to CEOs, adding that “companies perform better when they are deliberate about their role in society” and that “the relationship between a company, its employees, and society is being redefined.”\n\n\n\nRead more from The Hill’s Tobias Burns.\n\n\n\nFED VICE CHAIR: BANK TO LAUNCH PILOT CLIMATE RISK ANALYSIS IN 2023\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s top regulatory watchdog said Wednesday the bank will test out ways next year to help financial firms figure out the risks they face from climate change and climate-related events. \n\n\n\nFed Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr said in a Wednesday speech the bank will launch a pilot exercise next year for the major banks it supervises to help get a better sense of the risks climate change poses to the financial system. The exercise would likely require firms to explain how several different climate-related financial shocks would affect their books and ability to serve customers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The Federal Reserve is working to understand how climate change may pose risks to individual banks and to the financial system,” Barr said in a Wednesday speech at the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBarr’s remarks were his first since being confirmed to the Fed in July as the bank’s top regulatory official. As vice chair of supervision, Barr spearheads the Fed’s oversight of major financial firms, including the Fed’s annual stress testing of the largest U.S. banks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The Federal Reserve’s mandate in this area is important, but narrow, focused on our supervisory responsibilities and our role in promoting a safe and stable financial system,” Barr said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince President&nbsp;Biden’s&nbsp;election in 2020, the Fed has moved toward studying the various ways climate change and a global shift away from fossil fuel energy could affect the financial system.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFinancial experts say banks and financial firms could face steep losses as the pace and intensity of natural disasters increase, causing massive insurance payouts and reducing the value of properties in areas prone to extreme weather. A steep, steady reduction in fossil fuel usage and uptake of renewable energy sources could also trigger shockwaves through the financial system.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile central banks and financial watchdogs around the world have largely agreed on the need to assess climate-related financial risks, the issue is politically divisive in the U.S.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more from The Hill’s Sylvan Lane. \n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nEurope Is Sacrificing Its Ancient Forests for Energy (The New York Times) America’s electric utilities spent decades spreading climate misinformation (Grist) California heat wave nearly broke the power grid (Los Angeles Times) Utah’s Great Salt Lake Is Disappearing, With Mounting Economic Costs (The Wall Street Journal) \n\n\n\n📖  Lighter click: New word on the block\n\n\n\nThat’s it for today, thanks for reading.

        "description": "The Biden administration is expected on Thursday to publish its final rule unwinding a Trump-era policy that sought to limit immigration of those it feared may rely on social services.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) will unveil a rule that would roll back the Trump administration's so-called public charge rule, restricting immigration pathways for those seeking to become U.S. citizens only if they are “primarily dependent on the government for subsistence.”\n\n\n\nThe rule would be a departure from a Trump-era policy requiring prospective new citizens to forecast whether they might at any time rely on government aid, including barring those who received assistance from one program over the course of a year.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration stopped defending the Trump-era rule in litigation just months after taking office.\n\n\n\nDHS then offered its own proposed update for the rule in February, calling it a break from the “harsh approach” taken by its predecessor that “caused many noncitizens to be fearful of accessing benefits that Congress intended them to have.”\n\n\n\n“The 2019 public charge rule was not consistent with our nation’s values,” DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a press release at the time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Under this proposed rule, we will return to the historical understanding of the term ‘public charge’ and individuals will not be penalized for choosing to access the health benefits and other supplemental government services available to them,” he said.\n\n\n\nWhile the Trump-era rule also considered reliance on a broad array of government services as potentially disqualifying, the Biden proposal narrowed that list. Use of food stamps, Medicaid,or housing benefits would not be used to determine if someone was a public charge.",

        "description": "National Gallery, LondonHis paintings could be strangely clunky yet his vision was staggering  – which is why this passionate artist, who captured an America in perpetual peril, still speaks to us todayThe black sailor lies back on his broken, doomed craft. All around him, the sea chomps and shudders. And there is a storm coming, to judge from the spinning column of grey water on the horizon. A ship is ploughing through these troubled waters but will it care enough to help? The sharks seem to know it won’t. They expect a meal any moment now. They roll and glide by the boat, flashing their giant mouths and tiny eyes.This is Winslow Homer’s 1899 masterpiece The Gulf Stream, and there could not be a more timely loan to the National Gallery from New York’s Metropolitan Museum of Art as the US is consumed by its history of racial injustice and premonitions of disaster, even of a second civil war. Is America doomed, like this sailor? Is it a wreck about to be torn apart by its own divisions, savaged by the circling shark of a second Trump candidacy? Homer hasn’t any answers but he poses the question of how a nation with such a legacy of slavery can ever escape its past. Continue reading...",

        "description": "CNN: “While volunteer partisan observers have always been trained by political parties and non-profit groups in Michigan, the Wayne County GOP had also invited poll workers &#8212; people hired and paid by the local clerk&#8217;s office. They are in charge of running the election, and their responsibilities can include checking voter IDs, counting ballots, and even securing voting equipment at the end of the day. Poll workers are required to engage in non-partisan training overseen by the local clerk and are only identified as Republicans for the purposes of making sure there is equal representation of both major parties working the election, according to the Michigan Bureau of Elections.”\n\n\n\n“During the Wayne County training call, obtained by CNN, the presumption that Democrats cheat &#8212; thus justifying Republican rule-breaking &#8212; permeated the discussion. It offers a snapshot of one of the ways Trump-backing, MAGA-minded conspiracy theorists are intervening in the election process across the country, sometimes encouraging poll workers or volunteer observers to violate election rules in hopes of finding evidence that Democrats might be doing the same.”\n\n\n\n“It&#8217;s an approach election experts fear could spur chaos and conflict in November&#8217;s mid-term elections and in 2024.”",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  This game was a wayward adventure seemingly doomed at multiple points, but it goes in the win column. While the Yankees had already fought back in the inning, it seemed like another walk-off opportunity was going to pass them by in the 12th inning. After a ridiculously dumb game that had seen them struggle against Twins rookie Louie Varland in his MLB debut, they had rallied, but failed to seize their chances at walk-off wins in several different innings.\nAfter Oswald Peraza failed to add his three-hit day, the 12th was left up to former Triple-A Scranton teammate Oswaldo Cabrera, who had been in a terrible slump of late: 0-for-25. Sure, his defensive chops had been impressive, as he demonstrated earlier in this game, but he looked at bit lost at the plate. Plus, considering how the rest of this game had gone, it would be understandable to assume that this game was headed for a 13th inning.\nInstead, Cabrera managed to squeak through a single, giving the Yankees a wild 5-4 walk-off win over the Twins.\nThe Twins got off to a fast start, quickly scoring off Germán. On the first very pitch of the game, Luis Arraez laced a double to center. While Germán then got the next out, he then allowed a home run to Jose Miranda that just curved around the foul pole in left to give the Twins the early lead.\nAfter the Yankees wasted Peraza’s first career hit in the third (a double), the Twins added another run in the fourth in a very annoying sequence. After two quick outs, the inning was kept alive after a ball back up the middle hit off Germán and settled safely for a Jake Cave single. Gary Sánchez then hit a popup that probably should’ve led to the last out of the inning, but center fielder Estevan Florial seemed to misread it off that bat, and the ball dropped in just in front of him. The inning still had life, and that led to Minnesota’s third run when Gilberto Celestino added another single.\nThe Yankees would then get on the board in the bottom of the fourth, courtesy of the exact source that any fan would expect. Aaron Judge led off the frame with a home run, his 55th of the season.\n\nWith the blast, Judge became the Yankees’ single-season leader for homers by a right-handed hitter, topping Alex Rodriguez’s 2007 total of 54. It also surpassed another of Judge’s 2016 teammates, Mark Teixeira, for the most long balls in the 13-year history of new Yankee Stadium (114).\nPeraza recorded his second career hit in the sixth inning when he led off the frame with a single. While Varland stayed in for one more batter (who he retired), that hit would lead to the end of his debut with Judge on the horizon. Reliever Griffin Jax came in and actually did the job against Judge, getting him to pop up. However, for once, the damage would come from someone else in the lineup. Gleyber Torres came through with a pivotal two-run home run, tying things up.\n\nIt was only Torres’ third dinger since the start of August, but it was at least a prime opportunity to deliver. The Yankees probably wouldn’t have made it to extras without it.\nWandy Peralta came in for the seventh, ending Germán’s day. In his six innings, Germán allowed three runs on seven hits and one walk, striking out six. He mostly settled down after the first inning, discounting the run in the fourth, which was only partially his fault.\nPeralta threw a scoreless frame, and would be replaced by Jonathan Loáisiga for the eighth. Although he retired the first batter of the inning, things then got iffy when Minnesota picked up back-to-back singles. The Yankees then got one out and narrowly missed one of the more impressive double plays you’ll see, but Minnesota was 90 feet away from retaking the lead. Nonetheless, Loáisiga went on to fan pinch-hitter Max Kepler on three pitches to get out of the jam.\nIn the bottom of the eighth, Peraza picked up a third hit on the day, but the Yankees failed to take advantage, especially after the Twins intentionally walked Judge. Clay Holmes followed that with a 1-2-3 inning that included a couple nice defensive plays, including one by Peraza.\nIn the bottom of the ninth, the Yankees had a chance at a walk-off. Even before the big chance, Miguel Andújar reached on an error, only for Tim Locastro to be thrown out after he overslid while trying to steal second. But down to the last out of the inning, Isiah Kiner-Falefa reached on a single. He then got to third after he stole second and advanced another base on a throwing error. Florial hit a grounder that very nearly snuck through the infield, but an impressive play by Carlos Correa on a grounder allowed Minnesota to escape by just getting Florial out at first.\nIt seemed like the top of the 10th was going to start very badly when Arraez singled to right. However, what happened next was fairly humorous. The extra innings automatic runner, Celestino, seemed to hesitate upon rounding third and was easily thrown out by Oswaldo Cabrera.\n\nIt was Cabrera’s fifth outfield assist of the year, which is fairly remarkable considering his lack of experience in right field before getting called up.\nThe Yankees failed to win the game in the 10th after suffering a bit of bad luck when the umpires did not move Florial on what was arguably a balk. The long afternoon rolled on with Ron Marinacco in for the 11th, and the right-hander threw a fairly simple inning.\nThe home half of the 11th would feature one of the more infuriating sequences of these recent Yankees’ struggles. With Michael Fulmer on the mound, the Yankees were able to load the bases thanks to both an intentional and unintentional walk to Judge and Torres respectively. With still nobody out in the inning, Ronald Guzmán, 0-for-4 with four strikeouts in his Yankee debut to that point, grounded into a double play. To make matters worse, he appeared to be somewhat ducking out of the way of the throw to first after the Twins had gotten the out at home.\n\nIt was not a matinee that Guzmán will fondly remember. Pinch-hitter Marwin Gonzalez came up short, and the game continued.\nIn the 12th, the Twins’ finally took advantage of one of their extra-inning chances, as Celestino singled home a run. Marinaccio would then have to be removed after walking the bases loaded. Fellow rookie Greg Weissert came in and got out of the jam with some big outs against Correa and Miranda, but the Yankees now needed to rally.\nThat rally got off to the perfect start when Kiner-Falefa singled to tie things up. After IKF stole second and Florial went down on strikes, Jose Trevino managed to drop a single into shallow right field. It wasn’t deep enough to score the runner and, to make matters worse, Trevino got strayed too far off first and was on the verge of being tagged out. Kiner-Falefa then also went a little too far off the bag and induced a throw over to third. Thankfully, he managed to evade the tag, with both runners ending up safe. Peraza couldn’t add to his dream day, leaving the inning up to Cabrera.\nThe 23-year-old rookie finally ended his long slump, poking through a single to win the game.\n\n\nCabrera in the clutch.   pic.twitter.com/9GIaCPFwxK— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nJust like that, the Yankees have a three-game winning streak, and their AL East lead is back up to a full five games (for now, anyway).\nThe good news — if you consider it that — is that there’s still another game to come today! The first pitch will be at 7:55pm ET with Gerrit Cole toeing the slab against Joe Ryan.\nBox Score",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Twins Twins’d all over themselves I thought I was starting this game recap late, so I started writing a game notes-style recap, but then the game just never ended, so I really had time to write a more narrative-style recap, but it’s too late now, so here’s what you get. Please direct all complaints to Joel Hernandez.\n\nGame Notes:\n\nJose Miranda was apparently inspired by his dinner last night with cousin Lin-Manuel, setting the Twins ahead with a two-run dinger in the first inning.\nThe Twins scored their third run on consecutive two-out hits by Jake Cave, Gary Sanchez, and Gilberto Celestino. For those indulging in The Twins/Yankees Drinking Game, this spelled disaster as tens of drinkers Twins fans slipped into a deep sleep prior to the 6th inning.\nLouie Varland had a fantastic debut, striking out 7 in 5.1 innings. His first career punchout was none other than Aaron Judge. \nAaron Judge tagged Varland back, however, for his first career home run allowed- Judge’s 55th of the season.\nIt took 12 innings for the Twins to lose in spite of them Twins-ing all over themselves and committing 4 errors (all in the 8th inning or later).\nTommy Watkins committed a fireable offense that ended up costing the Twins the game. Those Twins fans who were not playing TT/YDG joined in on the revelry at this point. \nThe said fireable offense was getting Manfredrunner Gilberto Celestino thrown out at home by a mile with 0 outs and the 2-3-4 hitters coming up in the 10th inning.\nJhoan Duran truly is “that guy”.\nThe Twins wisely chose to intentionally walk Aaron Judge in the 8th and 11th innings. Unfortunately, it backfired when Michael Fulmer unintentionally walked the next batter to load the bases with 0 outs.\nUnintentionally walking the next batter proved very unfortunate for Mr. Fulmer, as he proceeded to unintentionally walk Ronald Guzman, who was 0-4 and does not have a hit on the season, to hand the Yankees a walk-off win. \nJust kidding! Ronald Guzman, that beautiful boy, grounded into a 3-2-3 double play that the Twins somehow miraculously executed properly, and then Marwin Gonzalez grounded out and the Twins escaped the inning. \nThe bottom of the 11th inning was a very “Twins” move by the Yankees, if I do say so myself.\nGilberto Celestino came up big in the 12th by knocking in Manfredrunner Jermaine Palacios and putting the Twins ahead 4-3. \nCarlos Correa came up with the bases loaded later in the 12th. A real text I got from a friend was “Correa needs to exorcise the demons. This is how the curse ends.” Shockingly, he hit into an infield fly rule out, and the Twins ended up leaving ‘em loaded (just like the Yankees in the 11th, as well as all TT/YDG participants by this point). \nOn the third pitch of the bottom of the 12th, Trevor Megill gave up an RBI single. It was fun when we thought we might win for those 5 minutes between 5:55 and 6:00 PM.\nThe Yankees proceeded to walk-off in the 12th, obviously.\nCan’t wait for Game 2! The Twins bullpen is completely spent! I love playing the Yankees!\n\n\nSTUDS\nLouie Varland: 5.1 IP, 3 H, 2 ER, 1 BB, 7 K\nJhoan Duran: 2.0 IP, 1 H, 0 BB, 2 K\nCaleb Thielbar: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 BB, 2 K\nJose Miranda: 2-5, 2 RBI, 1 R, 1 BB, 1 HR\n\nDUDS\nThe 6-spot (Garlick, Kepler, Palacios): 0-5, 4 K\nTrevor Megill: 0.2 IP, 2 R, 1 K, L\n\nCOTG",

        "description": "Lumber from protected forests in Eastern Europe&nbsp; is helping feed the continent's insatiable desire for green energy, The New York Times reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nElectricity and heat from wood pellets currently counts toward European Union clean energy quotas — even as increased production turns forests in Estonia and Finland from carbon sinks to sources of greenhouse gases, according to the Times.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut that could change under new legislation that the EU Parliament will vote on next week, which would specify that only pellets pressed from waste products like sawdust would count as green energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSimilar issues have arisen from the huge boost in pellet production across the U.S. Southeast — along with pollution from pellet plants and deforestation of vital coastal forests needed for water filtration and storm defense, Slate reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat’s a problem The Wall Street Journal first called attention to nearly a decade ago — when pellet exports were less than a third of what they are now, according to figures from Biomass Magazine.  \n\n\n\nGovernment support for biomass energy has helped make the EU a major driver of U.S. exports, which passed 830,000 metric tons in June, a nearly 40 percent increase from June 2021, according to Biomass Magazine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith business booming, industry groups have decried the potential loss of subsidies. But the scientific community largely considers cutting down trees for energy to be a bad move.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Using wood deliberately harvested for burning will increase carbon in the atmosphere and warming for decades to centuries,” nearly 800 scientists wrote in a letter to the EU in 2018, last time EU biomass measures were up for a vote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelcome to Equilibrium, a newsletter that tracks the growing global battle over the future of sustainability.

Then we’ll turn to Pakistan’s unprecedented monsoons, which are threatening the livelihoods — and lives — of residents. Plus: A call from the United Nations for action on air pollution.\n\n\n\nUnsafe drinking water plagues three US cities &nbsp;\n\n\n\nHundreds of thousands of Americans remain without safe drinking water as crises hit three cities simultaneously.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe concurrent E. coli contamination in Baltimore, toxic levels of arsenic in New York City housing projects and ongoing boil water advisories in Jackson, Miss., all have different immediate causes.&nbsp;But they ultimately stem from the same core issues that are leading to water crises across America: the intersection of crumbling public infrastructure with a more unstable climate and extreme weather.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCompound disasters: These overlapping crises also highlight how racial injustice and political discord can make urban water problems worse — and how simple steps like regular monitoring can help keep problems from metastasizing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBacteria in Baltimore: Residents lined up on Wednesday morning to collect safe drinking water from the city’s Department of Public Works, the Baltimore Sun reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than 100,000 people in West Baltimore were under boil-water advisories after weekend samples revealed dangerous strains of the bacterium E. coli in the water supply, according to the Sun.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat meant a rush for water on Tuesday at places like Price Rite Marketplace. “If stores run out of water, they ain’t going to be calm,” employee Mercedes Thurman said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne silver lining: Baltimore only caught the E. coli problem early because the city has invested in regular monitoring of tap water, environmental planning professor Marccus Hendricks of University of Maryland told local television station WBFF.\n\n\n\nThe likely cause of the contamination was intrusion from sewage lines into water lines, he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nArsenic in New York: Residents of New York City’s Jacob Riis Houses — a public housing project in Manhattan’s East Village — are also lining up to receive safe drinking water and prepared food after water sampling over Labor Day weekend revealed arsenic in their water,&nbsp; New York’s Gothamist news site reported on Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLike the impacted residents of Baltimore, the inhabitants of the Jacob Riis Houses are majority Black and brown.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’re out here sitting out here in the rain.” tenant association president Daphne Williams said.“We could be at home in our own warm apartments, but we can't go up and drink our water like the mayor can drink his, in a nice warm place.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdded stress: Several tenants said they felt ill, but that nearby urgent care centers didn’t have arsenic tests, Gothamist reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I'm happy I live here. I have a nice apartment. But they gotta tell us the truth about the water,” resident Martha Lozano told the site.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFLOOD AND DROUGHT THREATEN WATER SUPPLIES&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClimate crises like floods — which led to the ongoing contamination in Jackson, Miss. — are as much a threat to beleaguered urban water systems as drought, NPR reported on Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPolitical division in Jackson: Emergency pumps restored Jackson’s water pressure on Monday, but the city of 150,000 remains under a boil-water advisory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese circumstances have sparked another round of finger-pointing by state Republicans like Gov. Tate Reeves and local Democrats like Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Monday, Reeves blamed city officials for the ongoing water crisis, and said that privatization of the city water treatment infrastructure was “on the table,” The Hill reported.&nbsp;But Lumumba released a 2020 letter on Tuesday in which the city laid out the problems with its water treatment plant, and requested the funds necessary to fix it — a letter that local officials say the state never responded to, according to Axios.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat matters: \"The residents don't really care about how we feel about each other when there's no water coming out of the tap,\" Lumumba said in a Tuesday press conference about the tiff with Reeves.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPakistan’s biggest lake traps residents in overflow\n\n\n\nPakistan’s largest lake overflowed on Tuesday for at least the third time this week, leaving residents trapped by surging water levels, according to CNN.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the past 24 hours alone, 18 people — including eight children — have died, bringing flood-related death totals to 1,343, Reuters reported, citing Pakistan’s National Disaster Management Authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRerouting water: Lake Manchar — which expanded to an area hundreds of square kilometers wide following a summer of floods — covered nearby villages with several feet of water, according to CNN.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe flooding is due to the combined impacts of a heavy monsoon and melting glaciers.&nbsp;&nbsp;Pakistani officials had already allowed the lake to overflow twice on Sunday in an attempt to reroute some of the water to less densely populated regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;Tuesday’s spillage was a natural occurrence.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCities at risk: Pakistan is encountering what CNN described as “a desperate race against time to lower water levels at the lake in Sindh,” which is the country’s second most populated province.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA full-scale breach of Lake Manchar’s banks could end up inundating adjacent cities, CNN reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWater as far as the eye can see: “You wouldn’t believe the scale of destruction there,” Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif told reporters after a visit to Sindh, according to Reuters.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It is water everywhere as far as you could see,” Sharif said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClimate-induced disaster: As many as 33 million people — out of a population of 220 million — are contending with the impacts of a disaster that officials blame on climate change, Reuters reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHundreds of thousands are homeless.&nbsp;&nbsp;Economic losses have risen to at least $10 billion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUN calls for urgent action on Clean Air Day&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnited Nations Under-Secretary-General Inger Andersen called on Wednesday for governments to ramp up regulation, regional cooperation and monitoring efforts to combat air pollution.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAndersen, who also serves as the executive director of the U.N. Environment Program (UNEP), reminded global citizens that 99 percent of world breathes unsafe air, releasing a statement on International Day of Clean Air for blue skies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA human-created paradox: “Every breath we take keeps us alive,” Andersen said. “Every breath we take is killing us.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is the paradox humanity caused when we created economies and societies that pollute the air,” she added.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat’s International Day of Clean Air? The United Nations General Assembly designated Sept. 7 as the International Day of Clean Air for blue skies in 2019, with the first such day celebrated in 2020, according to UNEP.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe designation underscores the need to improve air quality to protect human and environmental health.&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual commemoration aims to build a collaborative community, while encouraging activists to share ideas on social media using the hashtags #WorldCleanAirDay and #TheAirWeShare. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n‘Triple planetary crisis’: Pollution, climate change and biodiversity have come together to create what Anderson described as a “triple planetary crisis” that requires urgent and decisive action.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHuman health at stake: “Air pollution is at the heart of global public health, economy, agriculture, biodiversity, environment and climate crisis,” said a collective statement from the chief scientists of UNEP, the World Health Organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the World Meteorological Organization.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The evidence is overwhelming: exposure to air pollution adversely affects the health of all, but particularly the most vulnerable.” &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat can be done? Andersen pinpointed three priority areas for government action:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nImplementing air quality regulations to meet World Health Organization standards.&nbsp;Measuring air quality with low-cost monitoring equipment and digital technologies.&nbsp;Prioritizing regional cooperation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPreventable and manageable: The chief scientists echoed these sentiments, noting that in regions of the world where strong policies and monitoring systems have been put into place, cities have shown “remarkable decreases in emissions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The good news is that, while complex and requiring a coordinated government response, air pollution is a preventable and manageable threat,” the scientists stated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWater Wednesday&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMillions of Los Angeles County residents face outdoor watering ban, hemp crops can’t withstand Texas drought and the Fertile Crescent becomes less fertile.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLA County residents asked to pause outdoor watering&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLocal officials have asked more than 4 million residents of Los Angeles County to pause outdoor water for the next two weeks, NBC Los Angeles reported. The shutdown is occurring to repair a leaky water pipeline and is affecting households in southern parts of the county.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHemp fails Texas farmers amid ongoing drought&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile advocates for hemp cultivation have touted the crop as “a drought-resistant lifeline for farmers,” those who invested in the plant say they have yet to see significant growth, The Texas Tribune reported. “We can grow dryland cotton on a year like this when you never have any success with the dryland hemp crop,” one farmer told the Tribune.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe cradle of civilization is drying up&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDrought and water conflicts are drying out Iraq’s Fertile Crescent — a rich area between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers that once served as a principle cradle of Western civilization, and where 8,000 year old forms of irrigation are still used, The Guardian reported. “The green land has been transformed into a barren desert. I don’t remember seeing this in my lifetime,” one millennial farmer told the Guardian.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease visit The Hill’s&nbsp;Sustainability section&nbsp;online for the web version of this newsletter and more stories.

        "description": "Former&nbsp;President Trump's team is decrying leaks about the government's investigation and search for documents at his Florida resort following a report that FBI agents found a document about a foreign country's nuclear capabilities.\n\n\n\nA lawyer for Trump, Christopher Kise, told&nbsp;The Washington Post&nbsp;for a story Tuesday evening that such leaks \"continue&nbsp;with no respect for the process nor any regard for the real truth. This does not serve well the interests of justice.”\n\n\n\nThe lawyer warned about public confidence in the system being corroded and called for \"someone — anyone — in the Government to exercise leadership and control.\"\n\n\n\nThe statement came in response to new reporting from The Post this week that FBI agents&nbsp;found&nbsp;a document detailing a foreign nation's nuclear capabilities&nbsp;and other defenses. The foreign government was not identified.\n\n\n\nThe reported discovery adds to scrutiny over the types of documents being kept at the president's home and how they got there, even as a judge's decision to allow for an independent reviewer&nbsp;promises to shake up&nbsp;the probe into the former president's handling of classified documents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump had pushed back last month following&nbsp;another report&nbsp;from the newspaper that&nbsp;said the FBI was searching for classified nuclear documents, among other materials, in its raid at the former president's Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\n\n\n\"Nuclear weapons issue is a Hoax, just like Russia, Russia, Russia was a Hoax, two Impeachments were a Hoax, the Mueller investigation was a Hoax, and much more,\" Trump wrote on his website Truth Social on Aug. 12.\n\n\n\nTrump has continued to rail against the FBI and its probe in a series of statements and posts on his website this week, predicting \"this Hoax will fail miserably\" and insisting \"[a]ll&nbsp;American Patriots know that I always do everything 'by the book.'\"\n\n\n\nYou can read the full inventory of documents that the FBI found here via The Hill.\n\n\n\nWelcome to NotedDC: Your guide to politics, policy &amp; people of consequence in D.C.

        "description": "A worker watches as a freight train moves through a crossing near Mendon, Mo., on June 28, 2022. \n\n\n\nThe federal government has just about two weeks to avert a nationwide freight rail strike with serious implications for the country. We’ll also look at a looming funding deadline for the federal government and the side deal hinging on a shutdown countdown.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut first, we bring you up to speed on the&nbsp;California heat wave.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelcome to On The Money, your nightly guide to everything affecting your bills, bank account and bottom line. For The Hill, we’re Sylvan Lane, Aris Folley and Karl Evers-Hillstrom. \n\n\n\nPotential rail strike threatens US economy\n\n\n\nA potential nationwide freight rail strike is looming, threatening to cripple the U.S. economy ahead of the holiday shopping season and November’s midterm elections.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRoughly 115,000 rail workers could walk off the job as soon as Sept. 16 if they cannot agree to a new contract with railroads.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat’s the first day workers could legally strike after a White House-appointed panel released collective bargaining recommendations aimed at ending years of contentious negotiations.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile five unions have reached tentative agreements to implement the Presidential Emergency Board (PEB) recommendations, which call for 24 percent pay raises, most have not yet struck a deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also unclear whether workers would vote to ratify a contract that doesn't address their concerns about punishing hours and rigid schedules.&nbsp;&nbsp;A recent survey found that more than 9 in 10 railroad workers would vote to reject the PEB recommendations and go on strike.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Association of American Railroads estimates that a national rail shutdown would cost the U.S. at least $2 billion a day. Experts say that it would devastate the nation’s agricultural and energy industries and severely clog up supply chains.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCongress will likely step in:&nbsp;If workers were to strike, federal law empowers Congress to block or delay the walkout, taking away railroad workers’ only real source of leverage. But it’s not totally clear how lawmakers would approach the issue, which they haven’t tackled in 30 years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKarl has the details here. \n\n\n\nSIDE QUEST \n\n\n\nSchumer pledges to pass Manchin deal despite Democratic opposition\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) promised on Wednesday to pass a side deal on permitting reform with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) to the massive tax, climate and health care bill despite growing opposition from progressive House Democrats.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSchumer said he will put permitting reform legislation that would speed the development of fossil fuel and other energy projects in the stopgap spending measure Congress needs to pass to keep the federal government funded beyond Sept. 30.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Our intention is to add it to the CR,” Schumer told reporters Wednesday, referring to the short-term continuing resolution to fund the government, which he said must get passed this month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe decision will make it tougher for House progressives, who feel little obligation to help Manchin pass one of his top energy development priorities, to block it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Alexander Bolton explains why. \n\n\n\nANOTHER CR? \n\n\n\nCongress confronts funding deadline&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCongress is staring down a critical stretch of time to cinch a funding bill to prevent a government shutdown before September comes to a close.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLawmakers are already armed with a list of political landmines they have to carefully navigate — from an energy permitting proposal to Ukraine and COVID-19 funding — or risk blowing past the Sept. 30 deadline.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne issue that could stand in the way of a government funding bill has to do with a fast-tracking federal energy permitting agreement struck with Manchin.&nbsp;A potential standoff could come in the form of Democratic leaders in the House facing pressure from liberals who are demanding the permitting agreement be kept out of a CR.&nbsp;&nbsp;It’s also not a guarantee that enough Senate Republicans would support its inclusion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAris has more here. \n\n\n\nGREEN SCREEN \n\n\n\nFed vice chair says bank will launch pilot climate risk analysis next year&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve’s top regulatory watchdog said Wednesday the bank will test out ways next year to help financial firms figure out the risks they face from climate change and climate-related events.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFed Vice Chair of Supervision Michael Barr said in a Wednesday speech the bank will launch a pilot exercise next year for the major banks it supervises to help get a better sense of the risks climate change poses to the financial system.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe exercise would likely require firms to explain how several different climate-related financial shocks would affect their books and ability to serve customers.&nbsp;As vice chair of supervision, Barr spearheads the Fed’s oversight of major financial firms, including the Fed’s annual stress testing of the largest U.S. banks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The Federal Reserve’s mandate in this area is important, but narrow, focused on our supervisory responsibilities and our role in promoting a safe and stable financial system,” Barr said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSylvan has more here. \n\n\n\nGood to Know\n\n\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen will&nbsp;call out the fossil fuel industry&nbsp;in a Thursday speech on the Biden administration’s economic agenda to be delivered in Detroit, Mich., where oil and gas companies have long held influence in the U.S. auto manufacturing sector.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere’s what else we have our eye on:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA majority of Americans in a new Gallup poll said that inflation-driven price increases are causing moderate or severe financial hardship. Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said the push to pass her antitrust legislation targeting the largest tech companies isn’t dead, despite the bill still waiting for a scheduled floor vote.  \n\n\n\nThat’s it for today.

The public safety challenges, the promise of new endeavors in the area of public safety is pretty exciting, given my background in violence prevention, and intervention, and community building,” he said, according to multiple outlets.\n\n\n\nIf García jumped in the race he would be challenging sitting Mayor Lori Lightfoot (D) for the post. The incumbent, who was elected to the mayorship in 2019 and became the first openly LGBT Black woman to be elected mayor of Chicago, is running for a second term. Her first years in office focused in part on the COVID-19 pandemic and crime in the city.\n\n\n\nA number of candidates have already jumped into the race, including Alds. Sophia King,  Roderick Sawyer and Raymond Lopez, in addition to former Chicago Public Schools CEO Paul Vallas and state Rep. Kam Buckner (D).\n\n\n\nThe election is set to take place in 2023.\n\n\n\nGarcía said he is “conflicted” on the decision in Chicago because of the significant number of Republican congressional candidates who have expressed support for former President Trump’s claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen.\n\n\n\nHe also called his job in Washington “exhilarating.”\n\n\n\n“I am conflicted, because of the responsibility that I have to help save and protect our democracy and our republic,” the congressman said.\n\n\n\n“My great desire to be a member of Congress when immigration reform finally becomes a reality makes it so difficult” to consider departing, he added.\n\n\n\nGarcía, who represents Illinois’s 4th Congressional District, first entered Congress in 2019 after losing the 2015 election to be mayor of Chicago.\n\n\n\nGarcía lost to former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel after a runoff race.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3633209-a-speaker-mccarthy-may-be-the-only-way-to-stop-unconstitutional-student-loan-bailout/",
        "description": "Political officials from both sides of the aisle have objected to President Biden’s unconstitutional $400 billion student loan “forgiveness,” but many have questioned who has the legal standing to block this action. The answer is Congress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy using the Boehner Doctrine, the House can establish legal standing to sue the administration for infringing on its exclusive Constitutional power to appropriate money. Our government features three theoretically co-equal branches of government, except that the executive branch has been walking all over the legislative branch for years. The time has come for Congress to assert its Constitutional prerogatives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpeaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) has been quoted several times as saying she “fears” for threats to our democracy should Republicans retake power in Washington, but the greater threat is one she is loath to confront: her own refusal as Speaker of the House to provide a serious check against a runaway executive branch run by her own party. The student loan bailout is a classic example of this.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite earlier stating that only Congress had the authority to forgive student loans through legislative action, the Speaker has abandoned her responsibility and voiced total support for the White House’s plan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis federal giveaway, regardless of the Speaker’s recent flip-flop on the House’s constitutional responsibilities, can be stopped by Congress resuming its constitutional position as an equal branch of government. It could be done sooner, if “moderate” Democrats are willing to put their money where their press releases are and demand the House take action this month. If not, then the only way to reverse this decision is to elect a Republican House majority.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2014, President Obama reassigned appropriations for ObamaCare without congressional authorization. Individual members of Congress historically have not had standing to file suit. So then-Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) developed a legal doctrine that allowed the entire House, by a majority vote, to claim standing since its Constitutional powers were being infringed upon. The House adopted Boehner’s motion and in the United States House of Representatives v. Burwell, it was successful in establishing standing, at least through the federal District Court level. The suit died when President Trump took office and reversed his predecessor’s actions without the Supreme Court weighing in. That tactic is familiar to Pelosi: she used the same principle to allow the House to file suit to block President Trump’s border wall in The United States House of Representatives v. Mnuchin. The Boehner Doctrine is very bipartisan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs soon as the debt forgiveness was announced, the White House pushed back on questions about its legal authority by claiming the right to cancel the debts under the Higher Education Relief Opportunities for Students Act of 2003, which was aimed at waiving or modifying student loans for service members fighting the war on terror. The White House leaned on the “national emergency” clause of that bill, presumably referring to ongoing emergency declarations due to COVID-19.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIndeed, Pelosi herself is flouting constitutional authority to claim a national emergency for extending the proxy voting scheme she put into effect last year that gives lawmakers an “out” from reporting to work in Washington, D.C. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) has said proxy voting will end in January when Republicans retake the House.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnless the Congress and the courts check unconstitutional presidential actions, there is no limit to executive authority. Members of both parties should jealously guard their Constitutional powers, because without them, no matter who is in the White House, we create an imperial presidency that makes Congress an irrelevant part of our government.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf Democrats in Congress want the student loan bailout, they can vote to provide it. They have the entire month of September and the period after the election to do so. Heaven knows they have no trouble spending hundreds of billions of dollars at a time to the vigorous cheers of an accommodating media. But all members of Congress should insist the White House follow the Constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf not, the voters can elect a Republican congressional majority that can use the Boehner Doctrine and a reinvigorated oversight process to check a runaway executive branch.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMark Strand is President of the Congressional Institute, which publishes The Sausage Factory Blog where he writes further about Executive Overreach and congressional reform to strengthen the institution of Congress.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Photo by Ed Zurga/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The last Student Night of the season Today is a battle of disasters. The baseball team representing Cleveland, the site of numerous Cuyahoga River fires going head to head with the baseball team representing Kansas City, the site of the Hyatt Regency walkway collapse. That’s probably disrespectful of Cleveland, the current division leaders, but it kinda feels like they’re there by accident. They did absolutely nothing last offseason or at the trade deadline to improve their roster, yet here they are. Such is the nature of the 2022 AL Central: a mediocre team might just stumble ass-backwards into a division title. \nI’m not gonna lie, I haven’t been watching much Royals baseball of late. The young guys are neat, but on the whole, it’s an unpleasant viewing experience. I usually just watch the highlights after the fact. I do try to tune in to the games I cover, that way I can include little things that don’t show up in the box score. I missed last week for my fantasy football draft though. I haven’t played fantasy football since 2019, and I went into the draft having done no research. holding no plan, and having not watched an NFL game that didn’t involve the Chiefs in years. I also have a personal rule against drafting domestic abusers, so that limits my player pool somewhat. ESPN projects me to finish 10th out of 10 teams in the league. I’m like the Royals in that way: blind optimism with no clear plan.\nAnyway, Cleveland is starting Cody Morris. I’ve never heard of him, so he’ll probably toss seven shutty. So it goes.\nFirst pitch: 7:10 pm CDT\nRoyals lineup\n\n\nZack Greinke heads to the mound for tonight's series finale vs. the Guardians.#TogetherRoyal pic.twitter.com/1XtVNWpINd— Kansas City Royals (@Royals) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nGuardians lineup\n\n\nHave a sweep in our crosshairs.#ForTheLand pic.twitter.com/ttmRpuYAw0— Cleveland Guardians (@CleGuardians) September 7, 2022",

        "description": "Win probability chart donated courtesy of Eloy Jiménez and the Mariners defense Despite a downright brutal showing yesterday — and an equally alarming start to this one — the White Sox bounced back in fine fashion to take two of three from the Mariners and secure their third consecutive series win since an embarrassing home sweep to the Diamondbacks. Aided by poor Seattle defense, the Sox lineup dropped six unanswered runs on their hosts after trailing 4-0 through three innings, then rallied for three more after Seattle stuck an additional two runs on the team’s most recent bullpen additions, Jake Diekman and Joe Kelly. Eloy Jiménez carried the offense with three hits and three driven in, and Liam Hendriks shut the door for his 32nd save of the season. With Minnesota’s loss to the Yankees in the first leg of their doubleheader and Cleveland set to take on Kansas City shortly, the Sox are a half-game back of the former and 2.5 games back of the latter in the AL Central.\n\nThe Starters\nMichael Kopech’s well-anticipated return from injury didn’t quite go the way he wanted to, giving up four runs and failing to finish the fourth inning against a rolling Seattle offense. He began the game looking sharp, striking out four of the first six hitters with his fastball popping in his usual 94-96 mph range with a sharp slider that he was throwing for a strike. \nIn the third innings, however, his command went south. A walk and a pair of hits on pitches over the heart of the plate were followed by a mammoth Eugenio Suárez home run that put the visiting Sox in a 4-0 hole. A look at the locations of Seattle’s four hits and two walks against Kopech tells the story of a pitcher who suddenly had trouble knowing where the ball was going:\n  \n        \n  \nThough he recovered well to start the fourth inning, inducing two ground outs to open the frame, a Josh Harrison error shortened Kopech’s day when it was followed by a weak opposite-field double off the bat of J.P. Crawford to move runners into scoring position. Perhaps due to Kopech’s innings limit and his recent injury, Miguel Cairo chose to bring the hook after Kopech’s 74th pitch, allowing José Ruiz to finish out the inning. Kopechs’ 74 pitches looked like this: \n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \nBarely 18 hours after Logan Gilbert and the Mariners bullpen torched the Sox lineup for 14 strikeouts and a strikeout, Luis Castillo came out of the gates making them look like a warm-up act, striking out the first seven hitters — a Mariners record to open a game — with a fastball buzzing in the high-90s and a changeup/slider combination that the Sox lineup in a complete spin-cycle.\n\nThough he only struck out one more hitter the rest of the way, he remained largely in control, working into the sixth inning with an Eloy Jiménez ding dong as the only mark on his line. A quality start was not to be, however, as everything unraveled in the sixth inning: the third time through the order, the Sox were better prepared for Castillo’s high-powered inside-out attack, driving him from the game with a series of hits (two for extra bases) that were largely well-earned.\nOn the whole, Castillo’s 99-pitch outing looked like this:\n  \n        \n      Baseball Savant\n  \n\nPressure Play\nThough there was quite a bit of tension at T-Mobile Park, the peak Leverage Index (LI) checked in at 4.64 in the top of the fourth inning, when Ty France came to the plate with runners on second and third and a two-run deficit. He grounded out. \n\nPressure Cooker\nEntering the game with two on, one out, and a two-run lead, Joe Kelly’s 3.91 pLI was the highest of all performers today.\n\nTop Play\nSuárez’s second longball of the day took this category handily, as it tied the game in the seventh and added a full 25% (.250 WPA) to Seattle’s win probability.\n\n\nTop Performer\nUnsurprisingly, Eloy Jiménez’s three-hit day netted him .350 WPA, easily the highest of the game.\n\nSmackdown\nHardest hit: Suárez’s first home run left the yard at 111.4 mph, tops on the day. \n\n\nWeakest contact: Elvis Andrus’s reign lasts another day with his single on a laughably slow 26 mph tapper down the line.\n\nLuckiest hit: The aforementioned bloop J.P. Crawford double that drove Kopech from the game had a minuscule .070 expected batting average. \n\nToughest out: Most hitters got what they deserved today, as Ty France’s first-inning fly out to the right field wall had a .420 expected batting average, the highest on an out today.\n  \n        \n  \n\nLongest hit: Eugenio Suárez takes the crown for the second straight day, edging out Eloy Jiménez by two feet with his 425-foot blast.\n\nMagic Number: 4\nThis was — I kid you not — the fourth time in 2022 that the Sox have won a game despite allowing at least six runs.

        "description": "Scientists have evaluated the environmental impact of more than 57,000 food products at the grocery store.\nIf consumers knew what they learned, it could lead to a more sustainable food system and may improve our health.\n&#8220;The goal is to have a simpler, and more rigorous quantitative way to inform consumers about the tens of thousands of different items they might buy in a grocery store,&#8221; says ecologist David Tilman, a professor at the University of California Santa Barbara&#8217;s Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management and coauthor of the study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nAccording to the researchers&#8217; assessment, beef and lamb take the greatest toll on the environment, with impacts far outpacing those of other proteins such as chicken, fish, and seafood, and nuts, which also are on the higher end of the environmental impact scale.\n&#8220;Many people consider beef to taste good, and I understand why, but it is a very inefficient way to create food for humans,&#8221; Tilman says. Meanwhile, processed drinks such as soda and energy drinks were rated at the lowest impact level of food products evaluated, sharing space with plant-based grocery foods such as rice and flatbreads.\nFood life cycle\nWhile much research has gone into the environmental impacts of food commodities such as fruits, wheat, and beef, most food products contain many different ingredients, each of which has taken its own route to become part of the whole.\nThis life cycle data, which inform the total environmental impacts of producing, harvesting, transporting, and processing of said ingredients, are largely invisible to the consumer, as are the proportions of ingredients.\nAccording to the study, this information gap exists because &#8220;the exact amount of each ingredient and their supply chain in each food product are often considered a trade secret.&#8221; The sheer number of food products and their variety makes the assessment a &#8220;daunting&#8221; task for food companies and for retailers aiming to reduce their carbon emissions.\nTo overcome these limitations, the researchers, led by first author Michael Clark of Oxford University, used prior knowledge from ingredient lists to infer the composition of each ingredient. They then paired this information with environmental databases to gauge impacts across four indicators: greenhouse gas emissions, land use, water stress, and eutrophication potential (the magnitude of excess nutrients from production that can pollute surrounding environment and waterways).\n&#8220;This is the result of a decade since Mike and I started working on this,&#8221; says Tilman, who is Clark&#8217;s former advisor. &#8220;It started with doing some of the lifecycles ourselves, then using many of these life cycles that were published. And then we started critically evaluating the quality of life cycle data available for each of the major food commodities.&#8221;\nThey consulted previously published papers, conducted further analyses, and used their approach on 57,000 food products found in Tesco supermarkets, a major grocery chain in the United Kingdom and Ireland.\n&#8220;You go to a grocery store in Europe and it doesn&#8217;t look very different from a grocery store in the United States,&#8221; Tilman says. While humans around the world don&#8217;t have the exact same taste preferences, he adds, we tend to have to similar tastes, which results in more or less the same kind of food products in our stores.\nThese tastes tend to gravitate to foods that contain high levels of sugar. It&#8217;s a commodity that is both cheap and produced in abundance, with effects that have led to increased rates of obesity, diabetes, and other conditions related to overconsumption of highly processed foods that often contain high fructose corn syrup.\n&#8220;That&#8217;s what happened with the Green Revolution,&#8221; Tilman says of an unintended consequence of the world&#8217;s move in the 1950s and &#8217;60s toward high-yield, industrial farming processes that include pesticides, fertilizers, and monocultures.\n&#8220;Sugar is cheap. Fats are cheap and salt is cheap. People love salty, fatty, and sweet kinds of foods; that&#8217;s what our taste preferences are. They made total sense during our evolutionary past, and now that these foods are so cheap and readily available, we eat them in excess.&#8221;\nHealthy for people, healthy for the environment\nIn a previous study, Tilman and Clark found that, in general, diets that included healthy, less-processed foods were also healthier for the environment.\n&#8220;We know there&#8217;s a relationship there, and we wanted to apply this for individual foods,&#8221; Tilman says. As a result, the researchers&#8217; current study also ranks grocery foods by nutritional impact, with plant-based, less processed foods on the healthier end of the scale for both humans and the environment, and highly processed grains and dairy products toward the less-healthy end.\n&#8220;The healthiest diets that we know of are variants on the classical Mediterranean diet, which has many servings of fruits and vegetables a day, and whole grains,&#8221; Tilman says. &#8220;Whole grain has the advantage of having fiber, which helps slow the rate at which starch becomes sugars.&#8221;\nThe main meat is fish, he adds, with other meats used as flavoring and on special occasions. Other environmentally friendly and nutritious diets include vegetarian and pescatarian diets, provided hydrogenated fats and sugars are kept to a minimum. There isn&#8217;t enough scientific data yet to put the vegan diet in the same group, but Tilman suspects it belongs there as well.\nStill, more work needs to be done to refine the researchers&#8217; assessment. There&#8217;s a lot of variability in the proportion and type of ingredients in similar grocery store foods that can lead to differences in health and environmental impacts, and there are also alternative processes to consider, Tilman says.\nBut the hope is that this information becomes widely available, empowering people to make better food choices for the health of both their bodies and the environment.\n&#8220;I hope this information ends up on packages,&#8221; Tilman says. &#8220;And I hope because it&#8217;s on packages that companies that make different foods will willingly tell us the exact ingredients and amounts in their foods, so we can give the most rigorous, honest evaluation of their product.&#8221;\nSource: UC Santa Barbara\nThe post Greener groceries: Team finds eco impact of 57K foods appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Photo by Harry How/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Dodgers win 3rd straight series over Giants Max Muncy and Justin Turner each hit three-run home runs to lead the Dodgers over the Giants 7-3 in Wednesday’s series and homestand finale at Dodger Stadium.\nAfter a great renewal of the rivalry in last year’s season series that extended to the first playoff matchup between these two storied franchises, this season things kind of took a step back which doesn’t necessarily mean these were just regular games by any means, but it hasn’t been exactly the same.\nWhat pretty much everyone expected mostly happened. After a 107-win season, and a division title that ended the Dodgers reign over the West, the Giants have taken a step back in 2022, and simply haven’t been able to put up a real challenge for back-to-back division titles, while the Dodgers have mostly maintained their recent pace.\nThat isn’t to say that a below-.500 record was expected or that this team hasn’t underachieved, but it was within the realm of possibilities, and it’s their current reality. \nAfter getting swept in San Francisco in the middle of June, the Dodgers have bounced back well against their bitter rivals, and won nine of their last ten meetings against the Giants. In fact, Monday's loss was the only Giants win in Los Angeles all year long.\nMuncy’s hot streak even entails a decisive bunt hit \nThe Dodgers’ power-hitting left-hander has had a challenging year, but there’s nothing challenging about his current hot run with the bat, and despite the two homers he had Tuesday, Muncy came up to hit in the bottom of the fifth inning Wednesday with a chance to tie the game with a home run, and instead, he laid one down the vacated third base line, reaching safely on a bunt hit.\n\n\nMax Muncy getting a shift bunting session in. pic.twitter.com/ZMBp75rApi— Chad Moriyama (@ChadMoriyama) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Giants’ broadcast even made a point to acknowledge that it might not have been the worst thing for the visitors, given that Muncy had been red-hot with the bat, and came up as the tying run, but would you know, that Justin Turner came up next and gave the Dodgers the lead with a three-run shot.\n\n\nJustin Turner 11th Homerun of the Season pic.twitter.com/F9CaTb9EmV— Homeruns MLB (@homers_mlb) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nJustin Bruihl coughed up the lead, relieving Clayton Kershaw in the seventh inning, but it wasn’t long before the top of the lineup did its thing once again, with Trea Turner driving in the go-ahead run with a double off the wall in the eighth inning.\nAnd to wrap it up, Muncy finalized his papers as new owner of the San Francisco Giants completing his marvelous series with a three-run shot to put this one to bed, and guarantee the Dodgers another series victory.\n\n\nMax Muncy has done it all today!!   pic.twitter.com/HC0ywlV1Jo— SportsNet LA (@SportsNetLA) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nKershaw tuning up for October\nThe Dodgers are gonna play in the postseason without Walker Buehler and regardless of what kind of year he was having, and the absurd level to which this whole staff has stepped up to in his absence, the simple truth is that he’ll be missed, and everyone is going to have to do a little more come October.\nOne of the names this pitching staff will need to rely on is Kershaw. The three-time Cy Young winner is coming off his second injured list stint, and while Kershaw himself implied that his extended absence happened in part due to an abundance of caution, it is frankly understandable given his recurring back problems.\nSo far, since his return, the Dodgers have been very cautious about limiting Kershaw’s pitch count, and ultimately making sure he is ready to go for the start of the NLDS.\nKershaw ran into a bit of trouble in his first inning back at Citi Field struggling with command but has been razor sharp since, he ended that afternoon with 74 pitches over five innings in New York, and today he finished six innings on 86 pitches, managing eight strikeouts on 18 whiffs with no walks.\nThe only blip on the radar was a two-run bomb to David Villar. Another opposite field homer for these Giant hitters on a series in which the ball has really carried.\nWednesday particulars\nHome runs: Justin Turner (11), Max Muncy (19); David Villar 2 (4)\nWP — Evan Phillips (6-3) 1⅓ IP, 1 hit, 2 walks, 2 strikeouts\nLP — Zack Littell (2-3) 1⅓ IP. 3 hits, 4 runs, 2 walks, 2 strikeouts\nUp next\nThe Dodgers get an off-day before a three-game series in San Diego against the Padres. Dustin May and Mike Clevinger will face off for the opening game of the series on Friday night (6:40 p.m., SportsNet LA).",

        "description": "The telescopes of the SPECULOOS Southern Observatory in the Atacama Desert, Chile. The telescopes were used to confirm and characterize a new planet discovered by NASA, which led to the discovery of another nearby planet.ESO/P.HolárekAn international team of scientists says it has discovered two new &quot;super-Earth&quot; type planets about 100 light-years away, one of which may be suitable for life.Unlike any of the planets in our solar system, the nearly 1,600 known super-Earths are larger than Earth, but lighter than icy planets like Uranus and Neptune.Researchers at Belgium&#x27;s University of Liège announced Wednesday that they found another one while using Earth-based telescopes to confirm the existence of a different planet initially discovered by a NASA satellite in the same solar system.NASA&#x27;s satellite found planet LP 890-9b, which is about 30 percent larger than Earth and orbits its sun in just 2.7 days. ULiège researchers used their SPECULOOS (Search for habitable Planets EClipsing ULtra-cOOl Stars) telescopes in Chile and Spain to take a closer look at the planet with high-precision cameras.That&#x27;s when the stargazers discovered another planet, LP 890-9c (renamed SPECULOOS-2c by the ULiège researchers), which is 40 percentlarger than Earth and takes 8.5 days to orbit its sun.Francisco Pozuelos, a researcher at the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia and one of the main co-authors of the paper, said in a news release that the planet could be suitable to life despite being a mere 3.7 million miles from its sun. Earth, by comparison, is located over 93 million miles away from our sun.&quot;Although this planet orbits very close to its star, at a distance about 10 times shorter than that of Mercury around our Sun, the amount of stellar irradiation it receives is still low, and could allow the presence of liquid water on the planet&#x27;s surface, provided it has a sufficient atmosphere,&quot; Pozuelos said. &quot;This is because the star LP 890-9 is about 6.5 times smaller than the Sun and has a surface temperature half that of our star.&quot;NASA&#x27;s Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) searches for exoplanets orbiting nearby stars by monitoring light levels of thousands of stars. New planets are discovered when a planet passes in front of one of those stars, causing the light being monitored to dim. ULiège scientists then follow up NASA&#x27;s findings with ground-based telescopes to confirm and characterize the planets. Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "A third-grader punches in her student identification to pay for a meal at Gonzales Community School in Santa Fe, N.M. During the pandemic, schools were able to offer free school meals to all children regardless of need. Now advocates want to make that policy permanent.Morgan Lee/APWhen the government made school meals temporarily free to virtually all public school students in 2020, the intent was to buffer children and families from the spike in hunger and economic hardship caused by the pandemic. It also inadvertently turned out to be a pilot project for something anti-hunger groups had been pushing for years: making school food free, permanently, for all public school students, regardless of income.Once free meals were in place, albeit temporarily, many advocates thought that they would at least remain that way for the rest of the pandemic—if not longer. That didn&#x27;t turn out to be the case; this spring, Republicans blocked an extension of the waivers that allowed schools to serve free meals to all, which made the prospect of legislation establishing universal school meals remote.This fall, schools are once again charging for lunch and breakfast, and people who run school food programs are back to the familiar scramble to get students signed up for free and reduced-price meals — and to the familiar worry that some kids will feel stigmatized for getting free meals, end up in lunch debt or go hungry. Those arguing for universal free meals say that it would put an end to that stigma and to administrative hurdles that can prevent parents from signing their kids up.While advocates say Republican opposition to expanding school feeding programs is daunting, they haven&#x27;t given up on the idea of making school meals free for all. Instead, they&#x27;re trying to keep the momentum going by backing state-level efforts that could eventually lay the groundwork for federal action.States move to free school meals for all kidsThis year, California, Maine, Vermont, Massachusetts and Nevada will offer free meals to all public school students, regardless of their family&#x27;s income. Connecticut has also funded free meals for part of this year, and Colorado voters will decide in November whether to make school meals free to all. Universal meals legislation has been introduced in a number of other states, including Minnesota, Wisconsin, New York, Maryland and North Carolina.A state-by-state approach isn&#x27;t ideal, says Clarissa Hayes, deputy director of school and out-of-school time programs at the Food Research &amp; Action Center, but it&#x27;s still an important step — one that never would have happened if the pandemic hadn&#x27;t hit. &quot;It really moved the needle,&quot; she says. &quot;We are excited to see what&#x27;s happening in the states, and in most cases, it is a bipartisan effort and there are a lot of partners at the table.&quot;But whether action at the state level will translate into more support for federal universal school meals legislation is unclear, says Katie Wilson, the executive director of the Urban School Food Alliance. &quot;You can roll the dice,&quot; she says.While state initiatives could help popularize the idea of universal meals, they could also give federal lawmakers cover to argue that the question of whether to make meals universally free is best left to state legislatures, she says. That would sell kids short, Wilson says, noting that children&#x27;s access to healthy food should not depend on their zip codes.No matter how much support universal school meals have at the state level, Republican opposition in Congress is formidable, she says. &quot;Right now, there is just not the desire to do universal school meals at a national level from one side of the aisle,&quot; she says. &quot;So how do you change that? We don&#x27;t know. We&#x27;ve been trying for decades.&quot;Federal lawmakers will likely hear from constituents upset that kids&#x27; access to school meals has been curtailed at a time when so many families continue to struggle with food insecurity, and high food and fuel prices, says Diane Pratt-Heavner, director of media relations at the School Nutrition Association. But she says that passing universal meals legislation, of the sort that Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Ilhan Omar and other Democrats have introduced in recent years, is going to be &quot;an uphill climb.&quot;Another workaround to help hungry kidsPratt-Heavner and other advocates point to an upcoming opportunity to increase kids&#x27; access to free school meals in a less sweeping, but still significant way — the child nutrition reauthorization process. Every five years, Congress is required to reauthorize school feeding programs, and it&#x27;s a critical chance to strengthen them, advocates say. Congress is overdue to reauthorize the program, but there was finally some movement in July when House Committee on Education and Labor Chairman Bobby Scott, a Virginia Democrat, introduced a childhood nutrition reauthorization bill that was praised by anti-hunger advocates.The bill, if enacted as written, would alter the rules governing the Community Eligibility Provision. In its current form, the provision allows schools where at least 40% of students are &quot;directly certified&quot; — that is, enrolled in federal safety net programs like SNAP or TANF or are in the foster care system — to offer free meals to all students at the school, regardless of need.In the 2021-22 school year, 33,300 schools serving 16.2 million children used the provision, according to a USDA spokesperson — that&#x27;s nearly a third of the nation&#x27;s 49.5 million public school students. But advocates say that the program isn&#x27;t reaching as far as it could. That&#x27;s because under the current rules, schools that have between 40% and 62.5% of their students directly certified still have to pay for a portion of the meals they serve, which not all schools or districts can afford or want to do. It&#x27;s only when 62.5% or more of the student body is directly certified that the federal government pays the entire amount.The Scott bill would change reimbursement rates so that schools would only have to have 40% directly certified students to be fully reimbursed for all meals served. And it would allow schools or districts in which 25% of students are directly certified to participate in the program if they were willing to cover a portion of the cost.Pratt-Heavner says the bill&#x27;s provisions would help many more schools in high poverty communities offer meals to all students. But she says that it still wouldn&#x27;t help the economically-stressed families who live in wealthier communities. &quot;At the end of the day, these meals are important to all students,&quot; she says. &quot;And that&#x27;s why it&#x27;s important to just offer meals to all students, without an application, just like we offer them textbooks and bus service.&quot;This story was produced by Ag Insider, a publication of the Food &amp; Environment Reporting Network .

        "description": "CNN: “While volunteer partisan observers have always been trained by political parties and non-profit groups in Michigan, the Wayne County GOP had also invited poll workers &#8212; people hired and paid by the local clerk&#8217;s office. They are in charge of running the election, and their responsibilities can include checking voter IDs, counting ballots, and even securing voting equipment at the end of the day. Poll workers are required to engage in non-partisan training overseen by the local clerk and are only identified as Republicans for the purposes of making sure there is equal representation of both major parties working the election, according to the Michigan Bureau of Elections.”\n\n\n\n“During the Wayne County training call, obtained by CNN, the presumption that Democrats cheat &#8212; thus justifying Republican rule-breaking &#8212; permeated the discussion. It offers a snapshot of one of the ways Trump-backing, MAGA-minded conspiracy theorists are intervening in the election process across the country, sometimes encouraging poll workers or volunteer observers to violate election rules in hopes of finding evidence that Democrats might be doing the same.”\n\n\n\n“It&#8217;s an approach election experts fear could spur chaos and conflict in November&#8217;s mid-term elections and in 2024.”",

        "description": "Photo by Sarah Stier/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Game two of the doubleheader features the Yankee ace taking on the Twins rookie. There’s no rest for the weary. After a come-from-behind extra-innings victory in the first game of the doubleheader, the Yankees turn right around to do it all over again. Ace Gerrit Cole is on the mound taking on Twins rookie Joe Ryan as the Bombers try to sweep the day’s twin billing. \nCole has looked better over the last five starts with a 2.16 ERA, following a disastrous July by his standards. That said, he still struggles with the big inning, having given up five, six, four, and three runs in a single frame in four of his last seven starts. As Esteban so astutely pointed out at the beginning of last month, recurring mechanical deficiencies have caused Cole’s fastball to get crushed in his off starts, so it’s no surprise he’s leaned heavily on the slider in recent games, with the pitch carrying over a 45 percent whiff rate over the last two months. In 27 starts, Cole is 10-7 with a 3.28 ERA (117 ERA+), and 3.22 FIP while leading the AL in strikeouts (204) and innings (164.2).\nRyan actually debuted for the Twins last year, but his call-up came late enough to preserve his rookie status through this year. His 3.88 ERA on the year drops to an even more attractive 3.25 when you take away his 10-run outing against the Padres (obviously, baseball doesn’t work this way, but it still merited mention). This is the first glimpse Yankees fans get of the Minnesota rookie, so look for him to lean on a fastball in the low-90s, sliders to righties, and changeups to lefties. In 22 starts, Ryan is 10-7 with a 3.88 ERA (98 ERA+), 4.28 FIP, and 121 strikeouts in 118.1 innings.\nThe Yankees made a handful of changes to the lineup from the first game. Aaron Hicks replaces Miguel Andújar in left field and bats leadoff. Marwin González replaces Ronald Guzmán at first base following the latter’s golden sombrero in game one. Finally, Jose Trevino replaces Kyle Higashioka behind the plate.\nThe Twins on the other hand made just one change to the lineup from game one, having Sandy León take over catching duties for Gary Sánchez. They also shuffled the infield lineup, moving Luis Arraez from first to DH, Gio Urshela from DH to third, and José Miranda from third to first.\nHow to watch\nLocation: Yankee Stadium — Bronx, NY\nFirst pitch: 7:55 pm ET\nTV broadcast: YES, Bally Sports North, TBS\nRadio broadcast: WFAN 660/101.9, WADO 1380\nOnline stream: MLB.tv\nFor updates, follow us on Twitter and Instagram, and like us on Facebook.\n\n\nGame 2 up next. #RepBXFirst pitch of tonight's game is scheduled for 7:55 p.m. ETPresented by @Hilton pic.twitter.com/bvJwVcWL50— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nJoe Ryan starts the nightcap. #MNTwins pic.twitter.com/qCskJah4Z0— Minnesota Twins (@Twins) September 7, 2022",

        "link": "https://www.denverpost.com/2022/09/07/michael-toglia-kyle-freeland-rockies-beat-brewers/",
        "description": "Michael Toglia’s smile was as bright as sun-soaked Coors Field. Beyond the rookie’s celebrated glove, it was his bat that stymied the Brewers on Wednesday afternoon.\nJust nine games into his promising career, Toglia crushed a 421-foot three-run homer that stretched a 4-0 lead to 7-0 in the third. The Rockies, behind the steady left arm of Kyle Freeland, then cruised to an 8-4 win over the Brewers, who fell further behind in their chase for a wild-card spot.\n&#8220;(Kyle) did his job,&#8221; said manager Bud Black, complimenting his mix of his pitches. &#8220;&#8230; Kyle was outstanding.&#8221;\nPlaying spoiler – the only role Colorado can play at this point in the season – the Rockies won their second in a row over Milwaukee. They host Arizona for a three-game set beginning Friday after taking two of three from the Brewers.\nWhen pressed, Freeland outlined his goals for the remainder of the season.\n&#8220;Create that culture of winning in this clubhouse, regardless of what this season looks like right now,&#8221; Freeland said. &#8220;We need to show these young guys that we&#8217;re going to win, we need to teach them how to win at this level.&#8221;\nIt didn’t much matter that the home run ball, the second of Toglia’s career, landed atop a section that was almost completely empty. When he reached the dugout, having driven in three of his four RBIs on the day, his megawatt grin flashed all the way up to the press box.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s a blast,&#8221; Toglia said of his first few weeks in the majors. &#8220;It&#8217;s some of the most fun you&#8217;ll have playing baseball.&#8221;\nToglia’s career day was evidence of a prospect with staying power and one who could potentially help steward a franchise turnaround in the years to come. If nothing else, he&#8217;s one of the few reasons to keep tabs on the Rockies in September. The home run came on the heels of his first at-bat – an opposite field double to deep right that plated Brendan Rodgers for a 1-0 lead.\nNot that he’d ever advocate for turning the faucet off, but it was more support than Freeland needed. The lefty was dominant from the outset. In six innings, Freeland allowed one run on two hits and struck out eight. In his two prior starts, Colorado’s meager offense scraped together two runs total when Freeland started.\nBrewers starter Eric Lauer got blasted for seven earned runs and didn’t get out of the third inning. He left the game with elbow tightness and several crooked numbers to his name.\n\nOn Deck\nDiamondbacks RHP Zach Davies (2-4, 3.74 ERA) at Rockies RHP German Marquez (8-10, 4.86)\n6:40 p.m., Friday, Coors Field\nTV: AT&amp;T SportsNet\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM\nMarquez has been on a tear since two rocky starts in mid-August. In his last two outings, he&#8217;s tossed 14 innings, conceded four hits and only two earned runs. Both yielded Rockies wins, including one at Citi Field against the Mets. What&#8217;s more, the Rockies have won four of his last five starts. But Marquez has been a different pitcher at Coors Field than on the road. At thin air, his ERA has popped to 6.09 compared to his 3.58 clip on the road. Davies has been on a tear of his own, with Arizona winning five of his last six starts. Amazingly, he&#8217;s caught a no decision for all of them. In his last four starts, Davies hasn&#8217;t allowed more than two earned runs in a game, and in his last two, his 10:3 strikeout to walk ratio has led to consecutive wins.\nTrending: Colorado hit a season-high four homers in Tuesday&#8217;s thrilling win over Milwaukee. Randal Grichuk (15 homers on the season) cracked two of them, including the walkoff, three-run shot in the 10th.\nAt issue: The Rockies haven&#8217;t hit a grand slam so far this season, representing one of just two teams in MLB not to slug one.\nProbables: \nSaturday: Diamondbacks LHP Madison Bumgarner (6-13, 4.83) at Rockies RHP Jose Urena (3-6, 6.13), 6:10 p.m., ATTRM\nSunday: Diamondbacks RHP Zac Gallen (11-2, 2.42) at Rockies RHP Ryan Feltner (2-7, 5.85), 1:10 p.m., ATTRM",

        "description": "Photo by Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The rookies launched back-to-back jacks to vault the Tigers to victory on Wednesday. The Angels and Tigers exchanged a total of seven home runs in a bit of a slugfest, including a monster day at the plate from Eric Haase, but the good guys came out on top courtesy of back-to-back ninth inning home runs from Kerry Carpenter and Ryan Kreidler.\nWe haven’t had this much fun all season.\nThis one started out in very 2022 Tigers fashion. With one out in the top of the first, Victor Reyes laced a single to right field. Javier Báez hit a grounder to shortstop but beat out the double play turn, and Eric Haase followed with a single as Báez went first and third. Unfortunately Harold Castro’s line drive was snared on a diving play by shortstop Andrew Velazquez. Two hits. No runs.\nHutchison immediately got into some trouble as well but was also able to pitch through it. David Fletcher and Mike Trout opened the bottom of the first with singles, but Hutchison bounced back, getting Ohtani to whiff on a changeup, and then dusting Luis Rengifo with a high fastball. Taylor Ward flew out to right field, and both pitchers had survived a somewhat strenuous first inning and settled in.\nThe Tigers came back with another threat in the second as Spencer Torkelson led off with a walk and Jeimer Candelario singled to right field. However, the Tigers threatened, but did not score as Kerry Carpenter and Ryan Kreidler struck out, and Willi Castro grounded out to end the inning. Hutchison put together a 1-2-3 bottom half, with a nice play by Kreidler on a hot grounder from Matt Thaiss a minor highlight of the frame.\nAgain the Tigers got two baserunners in the third, but after a one-out single, Sandoval picked off Báez, who took his lead and was adjusting his gloves, caught completely off guard. Eric Haase followed with a single, so that was another costly Báez mistake, and Harold Castro popped up to shortstop for the third out.\n\n\nFantastic.  pic.twitter.com/K1EdvbNI3G— Jed (@TigersJUK) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nHutchison had some traffic facing the top of the Angels order in the bottom of the third, but again struck out Ohtani and got Rengifo to ground out to avoid any trouble.\nIn the top of the fourth, Spencer Torkelson led off with a moonshot 434 feet to straightaway center field on a Sandoval fastball on the outer edge, and we saw that it was good. Sandoval is one of the toughest pitchers in the game to homer against, and Tork has struggled mightily to be on time with fastballs all year. \n\n\nSpencer Torkelson hits a loud solo shot to give the Tigers a 1-0 lead, Dan Dickerson on the call #DetroitRoots pic.twitter.com/7xV4VgDfnW— Dan Dickerson Calls  (@dannydHRs) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nJust as quickly as Torkelson had given the Tigers the lead, Hutchison lost in the bottom of the fourth. Taylor Ward led off with a single to left, but Hutchison got Mike Ford, and Jo Adell’s grounder forced Ward at second, so Hutch had only the catcher, Matt Thaiss, left to deal with. He did not deal with him, as Thaiss smoked a center cut 1-1 fastball deep to center field for a two-run shot, his first of the year. 2-1 Angels.\nHaving given up the lead, but generally done his job yet again, Hutchison departed after the fourth. His final line was 4.0 IP, 2 ER, 5 H, 2 BB, 3 SO. \nWill Vest took over after the Tigers went quickly in the top of the fifth, as Hinch no doubt wanted Trout and Ohtani to see someone new. It didn’t matter to Trout, who crushed his 32nd homer to right center. 3-1 Angels. That was Trout’s four straight game with a long ball. He appears to be feeling pretty healthy to us.\nVest did bounce back against Ohtani, battling through a seven pitch AB and finally dusting the superstar with a fastball up and in that he couldn’t lay off on. However, Luis Rengifo slapped a little grounder to left field and booked it around to second base with a double. Vest walked Ward next and things were on thin ice. However, to Vest’s credit he bounced back to strike out Ford and Adell to avoid any further damage.\nThat was key as Eric Haase led off the sixth with a solo shot, his 10th, against reliever Andrew Wantz. 3-2 Angels. Harold Castro then drew a four pitch walk from the gun shy reliever. Unfortunately, Torkelson got into a 3-2 count and reached for a cutter away, grounding into a 6-4-3 double play. Candelario struck out to end the inning.\n\n\nHaase always brings his hardhat.  No. 10 for the righty. #DetroitRoots pic.twitter.com/G8A6Ekv9Ec— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nJason Foley took over in the bottom of the sixth, and he was back on point in this one. He struck out Thaiss and Velazquez, and after Fletcher singled, the right-hander blew away Trout with a hellish 97 mph sinker down and in to end the inning.\nThe Tigers finally caught up again in the top of the seventh as Kerry Carpenter smoked a double to right field. After Kreidler grounded out, Willi Castro came up with a single through the right side, and Carpenter scored to knot the game up 3-3.\nUnfortunately, as quickly as they tied it up, they lost the lead again. Andrew Chafin came on in the bottom half, getting Ohtani as the leadoff hitter. He fell behind 2-0 and Ohtani then hammered a shot to right center field for his 33rd home run on the year, and his fourth in the series. It’s just wild that the Angels are this bad with these two absolute monsters in the lineup.\nChafin did rebound, setting down the next three in order, and we were on to the eighth.\nMr. Haase wasn’t done yet in this one, and he drilled a line drive to left for a double to lead things off against reliever Jimmy Herget. Herget doesn’t throw hard, but he has a really quick, snappy release from a near sidearm arm slot. His mix of sweeping breaking balls is fairly nasty, and after Harold flew out, Torkelson and Candelario couldn’t find the heavy dose of benders Herget was spinning in there and they both struck out to squander the scoring chance. \n\n\nJimmy \"The Human Glitch\" Herget, Parachute Frisbees.   pic.twitter.com/9cmfFh9hGD— Rob Friedman (@PitchingNinja) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nJose Cisnero took over in the bottom half, and other than a Thaiss single he looked sharper this time out. But now it was last call for the Tigers to avoid another sweep.\nJose Quijada came on to close it out again the back of the Tigers order...and he did not succeed. Kerry Carpenter took the lefty deep the opposite way just fair in the left field corner for a huge, game-tying home run. That blast was Carp’s third on the year. \n\n\nKerry Carpenter - Detroit Tigers (3)  pic.twitter.com/s9qxJFxY6Y— MLB HR Videos (@MLBHRVideos) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\n\nThat home run by Kerry Carpenter was 98.8 MPH off his bat, which was his second hardest hit of his on the day. His double was 102.6 MPH— Rogelio Castillo (@rogcastbaseball) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\n\nBut wait, there’s more! Fellow rookie Ryan Kreidler was up next and he got a 94 mph heater on the inner edge, pulled his hands in, and crushed it deep to center field to give the Tigers the lead. 5-4 Tigers! Now that is a great time for your first major league home run.\n\n\n\nAnything you can do, I can do better! - @Ryan_Kreidler #DetroitRoots pic.twitter.com/iykvjuNprw— Bally Sports Detroit (@BallySportsDET) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nWilli Castro grounded out, and Victor Reyes lined out to Trout in center field, but Javier Báez (checks notes) walked, yes walked to bring Eric Haase to the dish. That was enough for Quijada, as manager Phil Nevin turned to right-hander Zack Weiss. Haase came through as well, ripping his second double of the day to left field as Báez moved to third with Harold Castro up next. Haase had a huge day with five hits, including the home run and a pair of doubles. Harold hit it squarely, but lined out to first base to end the inning. Now they just needed to hold the lead in the bottom of the ninth. \nTo make it happen, Gregory Soto would need to go through Trout and Ohtani again, so this was rather far from being in the bag just yet. However, Soto got ahead of Trout and froze him with a high sinker just in the zone. Ohtani whiffed on a fastball in on his hands for strike one, then fouled off a slider and three straight 99 mph sinkers. Soto reared back...and broke off a good slider down and away for the punchout. Striking out Trout and Ohtani is pretty good, but Soto needed to avoid a letdown against Luis Rengifo. \nUnfortunately, Rengifo singled, and then Soto walked Taylor Ward to put the tying run at second base. The fanbase roiled and raged. Nails were chewed. Antacids were gobbled. Meanwhile, the lanky frame of Chris Fetter strode out to the mound to calm his mercurial closer down. Pitcher whispering completed, Fetter returned to the dugout, and Soto blazed Matt Duffy with three straight heaters for his third strikeout of the inning, and the Tigers avoided the sweep in Anaheim.\nWell, that was fun one. Playing the kids is the way. They’ve got all the energy right now, and it was great to see them coming up big as Torkelson, Carpenter, and Kreidler all went deep. The star of this one probably has to be Eric Haase, who absolutely torched the Angels all game long for probably the best performance of his young career.",

        "description": "Isaiah J. Downing-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Elbow tightness for Eric Lauer adds insult to injury to end the road trip Box Score\nFollowing a disastrous loss last night, the Brewers looked to power themselves to their third series victory in their last four. Instead, two big innings from the Rockies early on created a hole too big to overcome, as the Brewers would lose the rubber match 8-4.\nAfter starting the game with a quick 1st inning, Eric Lauer ran into major trouble in the 2nd. Brendan Rodgers got the ball rolling with a one-out single to right. Next up, Michael Toglia doubled high off the wall in right, driving in Rodgers and ending at third after a Renfroe misplay. He wouldn’t be at third for long, as Elias Diaz made it three hits in a row on an RBI single to center. With the score 2-0, Alan Trejo launched a two-run home run to left, extending the Rockies' advantage to 4-0.\nAn already bad day got worse in the 3rd. After the Brewers could not get any runs across in the top of the inning, the home team went to work in the bottom half. After a Daza single lead off the inning, it appeared as though the Brewers would come away unharmed. Lauer got Charlie Blackman and C.J Cron to strikeout on back-to-back at-bats. However, a Rodgers walk put two on for Toglia, who hit a 421-foot moonshot to left, quickly making it 7-0 Colorado.\nLauer would leave the game following the home run to Toglia and a second meeting with the athletic trainer. After the game, it was reported that Lauer suffered elbow tightness and would miss his next start. In a discussion with reporters, Lauer said his arm “felt like jello” and that he was unable to pull down on anything, leaving pitches up.\nThe Brewers got a run in the 5th after Hiura led off the inning with a triple and Caratini drove him in on a ground out. A few innings later, an infield single and a Yelich double made it a 7-2 game. The offense struggled to get going.\nThe Rockies made it 8-2 in the 7th as a leadoff double from Daza turned into a run following back-to-back groundouts. In the 9th, following a clean inning in relief from Jace Peterson, Andrew McCutchen and Luis Urias hit solo home runs to make make it 8-4. The little spark in the 9th wouldn’t be enough to overcome the big deficit, as the Brewers would go on to lose 8-4.\nThey return home to Milwaukee tomorrow, kicking off five games in four days with a doubleheader against the Giants. Corbin Burnes will get the start for game one, while Freddy Peralta gets the game two start. Game one gets started at 3:10 pm, with game two starting 45 minutes after the conclusion of game one.",

Republicans are scrambling to play defense two months before Election Day because of the embarrassing revelation that the FBI seized dozens of classified documents from former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence.\n\n\n\nRepublican senators want to talk about Biden’s economic record and inflation but instead are being barraged by questions about Trump’s decision to stash more than 300 classified documents at his personal residence, an apparent violation of the 1978 Presidential Records Act. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe revelation late Tuesday in a Washington Post report that the discoveries included top secret information about the nuclear capabilities of a foreign country have only worsened the episode from a GOP political point of view. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMost Republicans in the Senate are treading cautiously on the gravity of Trump’s actions until they have more information about the sensitivity of the documents and how much of a risk any security breaches may pose to U.S. intelligence sources and methods. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think classified information is supposed to be handled in a certain way, and obviously we understand that here,” said Senate Republican Whip John Thune (S.D), referring to the secure facility in the Capitol basement where senators are required to review sensitive intelligence documents. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’ll know more information, I assume, in the future as more facts come out about what actually was taken, what it consisted of and then I think we’ll be able to make clear conclusions about it,” he said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThune cautioned: “The rules for handling classified information are pretty clear.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet Thune also called the FBI raid of a former president’s residence “an extreme measure.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There’s got to be a really good justification,” he said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe latest news bombshell came Tuesday with the Post’s report that FBI agents found a document describing a foreign government’s military defenses and nuclear capabilities at Mar-a-Lago. The information was so secret that only the president and Cabinet-level or near-Cabinet-level officials could authorize access to its contents, according to the Post. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome Republicans, notably Sens. Mitt Romney (R-Utah) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), are voicing serious concerns about what looks like to be a serious breach of national security protocol.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s stunning, it’s outrageous that highly sensitive documents of the United States of America were kept in an insecure place. That’s why we have laws to prevent it,” Romney said in response to the report of Trump’s position of highly classified military information. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRomney said whether a criminal prosecution is warranted “will be up to the prosecutors.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCollins, a member of the Intelligence Committee, said she’s also concerned about what the FBI reportedly found at Trump’s residence and renewed her call for a full accounting of what documents the FBI seized at Mar-a-Lago. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Of course I’m concerned there are classified documents,” said Collins, though she added there is much that remains unknown.\n\n\n\n“All we have are unsubstantiated leaks and that’s why I strongly support the request of the chairman and vice chairman of the Intelligence Committee for us to have full access to all the documents that were retrieved,” Collins said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe also asked for members of the Intelligence Committee to have access to the unredacted affidavit justifying the Mar-a-Lago raid.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOther Republicans are trying to dodge the issue, and a few of Trump’s most stalwart allies are attacking the FBI’s motives for raiding Trump’s home. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I’m going to leave it to the FBI to go through the investigation and answer questions people have had about the warrant process but at this point I’m just going to let the investigation go forward and not comment on it,” said Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.). &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), a member of Congress’s Gang of Eight, which has access to top-level intelligence briefings, on Wednesday said he hadn’t yet talked to other senior congressional leaders about what classified documents Trump had at his home and punted the issue to Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), the senior Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Having just gotten back, I have not personally talked to any of the other Gang of Eight about this,” McConnell said, referring to the top chairmen and top-ranking Republicans on the Senate and House intelligence committees as well as the top two party leaders in each chamber who have access to the highest-level briefings. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSenate sources say they expect the Gang of Eight to receive a briefing at some point about the FBI raid but that’s not expected to happen before next week. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I don’t really have any comments on this whole investigation that’s been dominating the news for the last month. I think we’re following it like all of you are,” he told reporters. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMcConnell suggested that reporters follow up with Rubio, who last month joined Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, in sending a private letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland and Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines requesting more information on the FBI search and what it found. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRubio more recently has downplayed the controversy over Trump’s possession of classified material as a “storage” issue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I don’t think a fight over storage of documents is worthy of what they’ve done, which is [a] full-scale raid,” he told an NBC affiliate in Miami. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Republicans are privately frustrated that they have to be playing defense over Trump’s hard-to-explain decisions to take boxes of classified material to Florida, despite clear federal prohibitions against doing so. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis has forced them to talk about Trump’s legal problems, a favorite Democratic topic, instead of the cost of gas, food and other staples, which have soared since Biden took office. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany Senate Republicans blame Trump for costing them their majority in January 2021 after he claimed 2020 election results in Georgia were tainted by fraud, which depressed Republican voter turnout ahead of two run-off elections, which Democratic candidates Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff wound up winning — giving Democrats 50 Senate seats and the majority. &nbsp;",

The surgery was performed by Dr. Keith Meister in Arlington Texas. \n\n\nMedical Update on Huascar Ynoa: RHP Huascar Ynoa underwent successful surgery today to reconstruct the ulnar collateral ligament in his right arm. Dr. Keith Meister performed the procedure in Arlington, Texas.— Atlanta Braves (@Braves) September 7, 2022\n\n\n\nYnoa began the season in Atlanta’s rotation, but struggled in two starts allowing 11 hits and 10 runs in 6 2/3 innings. His struggles continued at Gwinnett where he appeared in 18 games while posting a 5.68 ERA and a 4.99 FIP in 77 2/3 innings. His last appearance came on August 24 where he allowed three hits over two scoreless innings against Lehigh Valley. \nThe Braves acquired Ynoa from the Minnesota Twins in July of 2017 in exchange for veteran starter Jaime Garcia and catcher Anthony Recker. He played a key part in Atlanta’s rotation early on in the 2021 season before suffering a broken wrist after he punched the dugout bench after coming out of a game in Milwaukee. He wasn’t as effective after he returned and was scratched from a scheduled start in the Division Series due to shoulder inflammation. \nHaving the surgery this late in the season will largely rule him out for most of if not all of the 2023 season.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/09/huascar-ynoa-undergoes-tommy-john-surgery.html",
        "description": "The Braves announced that Huascar Ynoa underwent Tommy John surgery this afternoon. The hard-throwing righty had been on optional assignment to Triple-A Gwinnett, but he hadn&#8217;t pitched in over two weeks.\nOriginally a member of the Twins organization, Ynoa was dealt to Atlanta as a rookie-ball prospect in 2017. He reached the majors a couple seasons thereafter, debuting late in 2019. After a couple seasons bouncing on and off the active roster, Ynoa looked to have broken out as a rotation building block early last year. He earned a spot in the starting five and posted a 3.02 ERA with excellent strikeout and walk numbers through his first 44 2/3 innings.\nYnoa&#8217;s season was knocked off track in mid-May, however. Following a rough outing, he punched the dugout in frustration. Ynoa fractured a bone in his throwing hand and lost two months to injury. He returned in August but didn&#8217;t pitch especially well down the stretch, posting a 5.05 ERA over nine outings. He was relegated to bullpen work in the postseason, and he was diagnosed with inflammation in his throwing shoulder during the NL Championship Series. That ended his campaign, and Ynoa came into 2022 in competition for a rotation spot.\nWhile he secured a spot in the starting five out of the gate, Ynoa was hit hard in his first two outings. Atlanta optioned him back to Gwinnett at that point, and he&#8217;s spent most of the year there. Aside from a brief major league recall in mid-August &#8212; during which time he spent three days on the active roster and didn&#8217;t make an appearance &#8212; he&#8217;s played the rest of the season with the Stripers. The 24-year-old has started 17 of his 18 outings, pitching to a 5.68 ERA through 77 2/3 innings. Ynoa has punched out an above-average 25.8% of batters faced and induced grounders at a solid 48.1% clip, but he&#8217;s also been far too prone to both home runs and walks.\nThe emergence of Spencer Strider and Kyle Wright and the deadline acquisition of Jake Odorizzi combined to squeeze Ynoa out of the MLB plans. He&#8217;d still been on hand as a depth option with a reasonable amount of upside, but the Braves will now have to navigate a hit to that depth. Given the timing of the procedure, it&#8217;s likely Ynoa will miss all of next season as well. Tommy John surgery recoveries typically take upwards of 14 months, making it unreasonable to expect he&#8217;ll be able to factor in at any point before 2024.\nUnfortunately for Ynoa, that he suffered the injury while in Gwinnett means he won&#8217;t immediately land on the major league injured list. Players on the minor league IL aren&#8217;t paid at an MLB rate, nor do they collect major league service time. It&#8217;s possible the Braves eventually recall Ynoa and place him on the major league 60-day IL, which would remove him from the 40-man roster. That&#8217;d involve paying him at the MLB rate, but the hurler will be paid a Triple-A salary unless that happens.\nThe 2022 campaign was Ynoa&#8217;s final minor league option year. That means the Braves will either need to carry him on the MLB injured list to start next season or make him available to other teams via trade or release waivers.",

Biden is leading former President Trump by 6 points in a hypothetical 2024 presidential match-up, new polling shows.\n\n\n\nIn a Yahoo News-YouGov poll released Wednesday, 48 percent of registered voters said they’d cast their ballot for Biden “if the 2024 election were held today,” while 42 percent said they’d vote for Trump.\n\n\n\nBiden held a 3-point lead in the hypothetical 2020 rematch in a similar August poll. Trump’s support was steady across both surveys.\n\n\n\nThe president’s widening lead over his predecessor comes in the wake of Biden’s “Soul of the Nation” speech last week. During the rare prime-time political address, Biden lambasted Trump and his “Make America Great Again” supporters as a danger to democracy.\n\n\n\nBiden’s approval ratings have also been climbing back from record lows earlier this year amid a series of legislative wins for Democrats and declining gas prices. The new poll found the president with a 43 percent approval rating among registered voters.\n\n\n\nMore Democrats say Biden should run again than shouldn’t, a reversal of results from August.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast month, 43 percent of Democrats said Biden should not seek reelection, while 35 percent said he should. In the latest poll, 30 percent of Democrats said he shouldn’t and 44 percent said he should.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are also polling ahead of Republicans by 5 points on a generic congressional ballot, with 45 percent of registered voters saying they’d vote for the hypothetical Democratic candidate and 40 percent saying they’d back the Republican.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, just 24 percent of registered voters overall said Biden should seek reelection. Fifty-nine percent said he shouldn’t, and the rest were unsure. By contrast, 29 percent said Trump should run in 2024, while 60 percent said he shouldn’t.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConducted Sept. 2 to Sept. 6, the poll surveyed 1,634 U.S. adults weighted by gender, age, race, education, voter registration status and 2020 presidential vote. The poll had a 2.6 percentage point margin of error.",

FBI this week sought to interview a 31-year-old former Trump aide as part of its investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, according to The New York Times.\n\n\n\nFBI agents in Florida attempted to interview William Russell, who served as a special assistant and the deputy director of presidential advance operations in the White House under former President Trump and continued working with Trump after he left office.\n\n\n\nRussell has not yet been interviewed, the Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. But it signals that federal investigators are inching closer to Trump's personal orbit of advisers and confidantes.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) is probing the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol and Trump's efforts to overturn the 2020 election in his favor. It has also formed a grand jury for the case. \n\n\n\nLast month, the DOJ subpoenaed former White House counsel Pat Cipollone, who testified before the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack that he had concerns about how Trump responded on the day of the riot at the U.S. Capitol. \n\n\n\nHouse lawmakers on the committee argued in a series of hearings over the summer that Trump pushed forward a variety of schemes to stay in power, including pressuring state officials to swing the election in his favor and pushing former Vice President Mike Pence to not certify the election results.\n\n\n\nWhen Pence declined, Trump encouraged rioters to storm the Capitol, the House committee argued, and sat idly by for hours as his supporters clashed with police.\n\n\n\nThe House committee in July announced it had turned over 20 depositions to the DOJ.\n\n\n\nThe DOJ grand jury, which has considerably more legal power than the House committee, appears to still be in a fact-gathering and investigatory stage, and it's unclear what charges, if any, will be brought against the former president as a result of the probe.\n\n\n\nDOJ investigators executed search warrants on both former Trump attorney John Eastman and Jeffrey Clark, the former Justice Department assistant attorney general. \n\n\n\nThe DOJ has also brought two former Pence aides before the grand jury.",

At the end of his presidency, Trump and his team pushed to declassify these so-called ‘Russiagate’ documents, believing they would expose a ‘Deep State’ plot against him.”\n\n\n\n“Trump’s concern about preserving the Russia-related material is newly relevant after an FBI search turned up a trove of government documents at the former president’s Mar-a-Lago residence.”",

        "description": "Written by Robin Savannah Carver\n\n\n\nAcross the country, an ongoing education controversy has erupted around queerness.\n\n\n\nRepublicans in Florida and other states have moved to&nbsp;eliminate any mention of queer people&nbsp;from public schools.&nbsp;Drag queen storytimes&nbsp;have been embraced by libraries but opposed by conservatives, with some deploying vicious slogans like “kill your local pedophile.”\n\n\n\nIt’s horrific but unsurprising in a country where more than a third of adults now say they&nbsp;support banning books with stories about transgender youth. School districts across the country are doing just that, with&nbsp;right-wing activists&nbsp;even shutting down libraries&nbsp;to&nbsp;do the same.\n\n\n\nIf you’re feeling deja vu, you’re not alone. Conservatives and fascists have baselessly accused queer people of pedophilia, obscenity, and pornography for more than a century. But what is everyone afraid of?\n\n\n\n\n1/3 Protecting Trans Youth | Given right-wing school boards&#39; war on #LGBTQIA youth in #BucksCounty, like in @CBSDSchools @PennridgeSD, we share this editorial from our friends @RethinkSchools about how #PA01 allies can protect youth in schools. READ: https://t.co/s5FgsNaWP0 pic.twitter.com/UTpjE0ekoc&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) May 12, 2022\n\n\n\n\nOne possibility is that they’re afraid their children will choose to live life as a trans person. As the thinking goes, if queer people and stories are censored, kids won’t grow up queer. It’s a predictable logic, but also ineffective and cruel.\n\n\n\nI know because it’s the kind of system I grew up in.\n\n\n\nI grew up on Army bases in a Southern Baptist family. I didn’t know any trans people. Adults around me would refer to trans people with words like “shim” or say “that’s not a man or a woman, that’s an it.” Mainstream movies and shows like&nbsp;Ace Ventura,&nbsp;Little Nicky,&nbsp;Reno 911, and a million others taught me that “men in women’s clothes” were objects for scorn and disgust.\n\n\n\nI tried to look up information on trans people, but I couldn’t find anything in my school’s library or other community libraries — and online tools at those institutions filtered queer content. I told therapists that I felt discomfort with my gender, but they said it was a temporary phase because my dad was deployed overseas.\n\n\n\nMy natal puberty progressed, giving me facial hair, six-and-a-half feet of height, and a deep voice. I hated every inch of my hairy, huge body. When my despair drove me to self-harm, yet another therapist insisted it was a phase.\n\n\n\nI still remember the first time I read an article about a trans person that didn’t mock them in the famous “Transgender Tipping Point” issue of Time magazine in 2014. I was 22. I began my transition almost exactly 8 months later.\n\n\n\n\n#LGBTQ Pride and Prejudice in #BucksCounty | “#Pride Month has always been about struggle and resistance, in addition to celebration and parades &#8230; we must continue to fight for the rights of all LGBTQ+ folks,” says @PPKeystone Marlene Pray. #PA01 READ: https://t.co/I9IlEaL4h8 pic.twitter.com/obSdjgZrMF&mdash; BucksCountyBeacon (@BucksCoBeacon) June 5, 2022\n\n\n\n\nIt’s a hard life. The size of my body and pitch of my voice keep me from the “passability” of trans celebrities with&nbsp;infinite money. Nothing can reduce my height, vocal surgeries are preposterously expensive, and my (pretty good) health insurance doesn’t cover facial hair removal.\n\n\n\nSince I can’t hide my transness, I’m constantly exposed to transphobia whenever I’m in public or applying for a job. And I still deal with constant&nbsp;dysphoria.\n\n\n\nMy body and my pain are a consequence of censorship. It didn’t have to be this way.\n\n\n\nIf I had access to books like Imogen Binnie’s&nbsp;Nevada, T Cooper’s&nbsp;Real Man Adventures, or Jazz Jenning’s&nbsp;Being Jazz, I might have known enough to demand treatment sooner, or at least understand my needs better. My life would be safer and less painful in a multitude of ways today.\n\n\n\nYour own child, or your neighbor’s, might be in the same position I was. They deserve a chance to learn about trans people so they can save themselves from a lifetime of consequences. They deserve your help making sure no one takes away their opportunity to learn that they might be trans.\n\n\n\nSo speak out in support of public access to queer literature in your community at library councils, school boards, and town halls. Don’t let the book-burners erase queer history from right under our noses again.\n\n\n\nRobin Savannah Carver is a development associate at the Institute for Policy Studies.

        "description": "White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Biden administration has \"some concern\" with a Taiwan security bill moving through congress, as he said China continues to pose a \"distinct threat\" bill for the self-governing island nation.\n\n\n\nIn an interview with David Rubenstein on Bloomberg's \"The David Rubenstein Show: Peer-to-Peer Conversations,\" which will air in entirety on Sept. 21, Sullivan said he planned to meet with lawmakers on Wednesday to discuss the Taiwan Policy Act of 2022.\n\n\n\nThe bill would authorize $4.5 billion in funding to Taiwan through 2026, designate the island nation as a \"major Non-NATO ally” and impose other measure to counter China's \"aggressive influence campaigns.\"\n\n\n\n\"There are elements of that legislation with respect to how we can strengthen our security assistance for Taiwan that are quite effective and robust,\" Sullivan said. \"There are other elements that give us some concern.\"\n\n\n\nThe bipartisan legislation is sponsored by Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.).\n\n\n\nSullivan added in the interview that China has made clear that an invasion of Taiwan is still on the table.\n\n\n\n\"It remains a distinct threat that there could be a military contingency around Taiwan,\" Sullivan told Rubenstein. \"That remains one of the potential options for the reunification of Taiwan.\"\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration last week requested Congress approve more than $1 billion in arm sales to Taiwan.\n\n\n\nSullivan said the U.S. remains firm in supporting the status quo toward the contested island, which is a policy of \"strategic ambiguity\" that acknowledges Taiwan is a part of China but affirms that the People's Republic of China (PRC) does not have sovereign control over the island nation.\n\n\n\n\"There should be no unilateral changes to the status quo across the Taiwan strait,\" Sullivan said Wednesday. \"We continue to believe that and we will continue to push back against any effort to change the status quo.\"\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the National Security Agency and the White House for more information on the concerns cited by Sullivan. \n\n\n\nA PRC invasion of Taiwan has been a rising concern as Chinese officials have ramped up rhetoric on reclaiming Taiwan, which has governed independently of China since 1949.\n\n\n\nBeijing has also escalated military drills in the Taiwan Strait and around the island, which is just off the Chinese mainland.\n\n\n\nLast month, U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) led a delegation to Taiwan, drawing the ire of the PRC, which launched missiles over the island and executed unprecedented military drills.",

        "description": "Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The Mets scored plenty of runs, and Jacob deGrom had a scoreless outing. The Mets’ brief stretch of struggling against bad teams ended tonight in Pittsburgh, as the first-place team scored often and early and got a great start from Jacob deGrom. \nWith a four-run second inning, the Mets jumped out to the early lead, one that was more than enough given deGrom’s performance on the night. In total, the two-time Cy Young winner went seven scoreless innings, struck out eight, walked one, and gave up just three hits. \nThose first four Mets runs scored on a bases loaded walk to Brandon Nimmo, a wild pitch with Eduardo Escobar at the plate, and a two-run double from Francisco Lindor. And it was Lindor who drove in the Mets’ fifth run of the night with another double in the top of the fourth. Jeff McNeil followed suit in that inning, doubling in two runs himself to give the team a 7-0 lead.\nIn the seventh, Tyler Naquin double in a run before Escobar singled to plate him, giving the Mets a pair of insurance runs that were far beyond what they needed but very enjoyable nonetheless. Daniel Vogelbach singled in the Mets’ tenth run of the night a single in the eighth.\nAdam Ottavino threw a scoreless eighth inning in relief of deGrom, and the left-handed Alex Claudio followed suit in his Mets debut in the ninth inning.\nSB Nation GameThreads\nAmazin’ AvenueBucs Dugout\nBox scores\nMLB.comESPN\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      FanGraphs\n  \nWhat’s WPA?\nBig Mets winner: Francisco Lindor, +19.4% WPABig Mets loser: Daniel Vogelbach, -3.7% WPAMets pitchers: +15.9% WPAMets hitters: +34.1% WPATeh aw3s0mest play: Francisco Lindor hits a two-run double in the second, +13.2% WPATeh sux0rest play: Bryan Reynolds singles in the first, -5.4% WPA",

        "description": "Liam Hendriks celebrates after striking out the side to end the game.  | Photo by Steph Chambers/Getty Images\n    \n\n  South Siders take the series in a fantastic come-from-behind win. What a game! The Chicago White Sox beat the Seattle Mariners 9-6 this afternoon to leave T-Mobile Park with a series win against a red-hot team. This was one of those games that wouldn’t have gone Chicago’s way earlier in the season, but the team came alive to come back and pick a crucial win. \nThe game started strong for Mariners starter Luis Castillo, who struck out the first seven Sox hitters, tying the American League record. It wasn’t until the bottom of the third inning that the Mariners started the scoring against Michael Kopech. After a leadoff walk to Curt Casali, Julio Rodríguez drove him in with a double. \nWith Rodríguez on third and Ty France on first after a single, Mitch Haniger poked one out to center field for a sacrifice fly to lead 2-0. Eugenio Suárez, for his 1000th career hit, hit an absolute bomb for a two-run home run to left field to double the lead to 4-0. \nWith how things were going, it didn’t look like the South Siders would have much offense against Castillo, but Eloy Jiménez quickly cut the lead in half in the top of the fourth inning with a two-run bomb to left of his own, cutting the lead in half. \n\nKopech was already at a high pitch count going into the bottom of the fourth and allowed two runners to reach base, ending his day. He had a short outing coming off the injured list, going 3 ⅔ innings with four hits, four runs, two walks, and four strikeouts. \n\nHopefully, with time, he can work back up to more dominant outings. José Ruiz would replace him and get the final out of the inning. Ruiz would stay in to start the bottom of the fifth inning but be replaced by Jake Diekman after a Jesse Winker double. Diekman got the last out of the inning as we rolled into the top of the sixth. \nCastillo would stay on the mound to start the inning, and Seby Zavala would reach first due to a fielding error. Elvis Andrus had a beautiful bunt to reach base himself, putting runners on first and second with no outs. José Abreu singled to right to cut the deficit to just one. \n\nJiménez continued to stay on fire with a double to left field that scored Andrus and tied the game! A Sox comeback? Miggy’s boys don’t quit. Is that a thing? Can we make that a thing?\n\nSheets helped the South Siders take the lead with a sacrifice fly to score Abreu, and Andrew Vaughn added on with a double to score Jiménez. \n\n\n\nSo what started as a magical first few innings for Castillo turned into a six-run outing, as he would be replaced after Vaughn’s double. At 6-4 now, it looked like the team had a comfortable lead moving forward. \nDiekman started the bottom of the sixth inning with a walk to Sam Haggerty and a one-out single to JP Crawford to put runners on first and second. \nJoe Kelly came into the game *holds breath* and immediately walked Rodríguez. A soft grounder from France with the bases loaded would score one, cutting the lead to 6-5, but Kelly was able to get out of the inning without any further damage. \nAaron Bummer was on in the bottom of the seventh inning, in his first appearance since June. Unfortunately, he was greeted with an immediate game-tying home run from Suarez, his second of the day. \nBummer.\nHe would also allow a walk to Carlos Santana and a single to Adam Frazier to put runners on first and second with no outs. Luckily, the Bummer we all know and love returned, striking out the next two batters and getting a groundout to end the inning and keep the game tied. \nJiménez started off the top of the eighth inning with a single and was replaced at first by pinch-runner Leury García. García then went on to steal second and advance to third as the throw rolled to center field. Sheets had another terrific at bat, inducing an RBI groundout to score García from third and take a 7-6 lead. \n\nAndrus made another highlight reel play from shortstop in the bottom of the eighth inning with Vince Velasquez on the mound. \n\nJust a beautiful throw all the way from the outfield grass to end the inning. \nAndrus has been making contributions ever since joining the team, whether it be as a positive veteran leader in the clubhouse, on defense, or on offense. It’s looking to be a great pickup. \nThe White Sox went into the top of the ninth inning looking to add some insurance runs, and that’s exactly what they did against Chris Flexen. AJ Pollock and Josh Harrison had back-to-back singles, as Seby Zavala hit a sacrifice bunt that actually scored Pollock due to an overthrow from Flexen trying to field the play. \n\nThat would put runners on first and second with an 8-6 lead now, and the Mariners would go on to intentionally walk Yoán Moncada to load the bases for Abreu. Luckily, Abreu delivered on another great at-bat and hit a sacrifice fly to deep center field to score Harrison and extend the lead to 9-6. \n\nThis gave Liam Hendriks some comfort as he went in to close out the game, but he didn’t really need it as he struck out the side to end it. \n\nThis game felt like what September baseball is all about. Two good teams fighting for a playoff spot went at it, and the South Siders came out on top. As we know, the team has been playing with a different sort of spark recently, and I am fully confident they can continue that into their four-game series starting in Oakland against the Athletics tomorrow. It will be important to pick up three of four at least, but a sweep could also happen. \nFor now, we will worry about getting to the Bay Area and playing their first game tomorrow, as Dylan Cease will be on the mound against lefty JP Sears. It will be another late one, with an 8:40 pm CT start. \nThe Minnesota Twins lost their first game of the doubleheader against the New York Yankees as the second game is currently underway. The Cleveland Guardians and Kansas City Royals are also playing, so make sure to keep an eye out for those games to see where the standings will look at the end of the night. \nHave a great night, everyone, and get ready for more baseball tomorrow!",

Out went several of the big beasts of the Boris Johnson era, as the likes of Dominic Raab, Priti Patel and Grant Shapps were banished to the backbenches. She gave key jobs to her loyalists and supporters including Kwasi Kwarteng, Suella Braverman, James Cleverly and Thérèse Coffey.As the Guardian’s political correspondent, Aubrey Allegretti, tells Nosheen Iqbal, one of Truss’s first duties was to take prime minister’s questions. She struck a markedly more serious tone than her predecessor and was quickly engaged in a debate with Labour’s Keir Starmer over who would be footing the bill for her planned energy bill freeze, expected on Thursday.

        "description": "A screenshot from a bogus Apple live stream that actually seems to be a crypto scam. | Screenshot by Jay Peters / The Verge\n    \n\n  Someone on YouTube was live streaming an old interview with Tim Cook that was seemingly being used to attract attention to a crypto scam — and when it was live, tens of thousands of viewers were tuning.\nIf you’ve seen crypto scams on YouTube before, you would have recognized a lot of hallmarks of what was going on. The fake live stream was getting attention by filling its description with an array of Apple keywords in both the title and description. But when you actually opened it up, it was filled with odd messages linking to a shady-looking crypto site.\n“Apple Crypto Event 2022”\nThe stream had plenty of signs of being fake. It had a strange title — “Apple Event Live. Ceo of Apple Tim Cook: Apple &amp; Metaverse in 2022.” — and it’s was...\n  \n    Continue reading&hellip;",

        "description": "Mets outfielder Starling Marte has been diagnosed with a partial non-displaced fracture of the middle finger on his right hand, the team informed reporters (including Steve Gelbs of SNY). The club currently considers him day-to-day, although it remains to be seen if he&#8217;ll eventually require a stint on the injured list.\nMarte suffered the injury last night, when he was hit on the hand by a 96 MPH fastball from Pittsburgh&#8217;s Mitch Keller. He came out of the game a couple innings later, and he sat out today&#8217;s doubleheader. The Mets haven&#8217;t provided a timetable as to when they expect Marte to be ready for game action, although it&#8217;s seemingly encouraging they&#8217;re not immediately placing him on the injured list. The expansion of active rosters in September from 26 to 28 players gives the Mets a bit more leeway to give Marte a few days, particularly with an off day tomorrow to reassess his condition.\nSigned to a four-year, $78MM deal over the winter, Marte has had an All-Star first season in Queens. He&#8217;s hitting .292/.347/.468 through 505 trips to the plate, on par with the best offensive seasons of his career. The star outfielder has connected on 16 homers, 24 doubles and five triples. He&#8217;s chipped in 18 stolen bases (albeit with nine caught stealings) and served as the club&#8217;s primary right fielder and #2 hitter.\nThe Mets turned to Tyler Naquin in right field today, and he&#8217;d presumably pick up the majority of playing time if Marte&#8217;s forced out of action. The lefty-hitting Naquin can split time with the right-handed Darin Ruf in the corner opposite Mark Canha, with Brandon Nimmo continuing to man center field.\nNew York has been hit with a couple notable injury situations in recent days. They placed Max Scherzer on the 15-day injured list with side fatigue this morning. At 87-51, the Mets are a lock to make the playoffs, but they&#8217;re in a tight NL East battle with the defending World Series champions. New York holds a half-game lead on the Braves in a race for the division title and accompanying first-round bye.",

        "description": "&#8220;Violence no longer rests on the belief in its utility, but only on the fact of its having existed so long, and being organized by the ruling classes who profit by it.&#8221;\n\n&#8220;To be led by a coward is to be controlled by all that the coward fears,&#8221; Octavia Butler wrote in her searing admonition about choosing our leaders. &#8220;To be led by a fool is to be led by the opportunists who control the fool.&#8221; But in some deep animal sense, to be led at all is to risk handing one&#8217;s own moral conscience over to another. The paradox of our invasive species is that, because there are simply too many of us, it is our self-made fate to be governed &#8212; but we are yet to invent a form of government wholly free from evil. \nLeo Tolstoy (September 9, 1828&ndash;November 20, 1910) tussles with this paradox throughout Last Steps: The Late Writings of Leo Tolstoy (public library) &#8212; the collection of his final journals, which also gave us his reflections on science, spirituality, and our search for meaning.\nLeo Tolstoy\nWriting in the last days of the first year of the twentieth century, the elderly Tolstoy considers one of the chief hypocrisies of modern life:\nThe whole complexity of our urban life lies in the fact that people think up and accustom themselves to harmful requirements, and then use all their mental energies to satisfy them or reduce the harm caused by satisfying them&#8230; Before speaking about the goodness of satisfying one’s requirements, one ought to decide what requirements constitute goodness. That’s very important.\nMuch of this confusion stems from the sheer complexity of managing human beings at scale. Considering the obsolescence of the state as a form of government &#8212; an entity that concentrates and magnifies humanity&#8217;s most dangerous hypocrisies, making murder on a large scale, in the form of war, morally permissible even for good people who condemn it on the small scale &#8212; he writes:\nIt’s amusing, the opinion people have that non-resistance to evil by force or paying back good for evil are very good rules for individuals, but can’t be applied to the state. As though the state isn’t a combination of people, but something separate from people. Oxygen has such and such properties. But they are only the properties of the atoms and molecules of oxygen. But oxygen in big compounds acquires quite different, opposite properties. This opinion alone that states have properties which are the opposite of human ones is the most obvious proof of the obsolete nature of the state as a form of government.\nPessimism and Optimism by Giacomo Balla, 1923. (Available as a print and as stationery cards.)\nSeven years earlier, in reckoning with the fundaments of resistance to evil, Tolstoy had put it even more pointedly:\nViolence no longer rests on the belief in its utility, but only on the fact of its having existed so long, and being organized by the ruling classes who profit by it, so that those who are under their authority cannot extricate themselves from it. The governments of our day &#8212; all of them, the most despotic and the liberal alike &#8212; have become&#8230; organizations of violence based on no principle but the grossest tyranny, and at the same time taking advantage of all the means invented by science for the peaceful collective social activity of free and equal men, used by them to enslave and oppress their fellows.\nComplement with Hannah Arendt on our only effective antidote to evil, in society and in the self, and Bertrand Russell on how to heal an ailing and divided world, then revisit Tolstoy on kindness and the measure of love.\ndonating = lovingFor a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

        "description": "The Biden administration announced Wednesday night it was reviewing a Texas judge's ruling that declared a part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) requiring that health care employers provide HIV preventive drugs unconstitutional.\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre tweeted the administration was reviewing the decision because the ACA \"has been the law of the land for over 10 years.\"\n\n\n\n\"That guarantee is critical to the health and wellbeing of millions of Americans, particularly LGBTQI+ Americans, people of color, pregnant women, and others,\" Jean-Pierre wrote in a thread. \"The Administration is committed to protecting Americans’ access to free preventive health care and building upon the successes of the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\n\n\nJudge Reed O'Connor, a notorious Republican and Bush appointee for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas, ruled ObamaCare violated the religious freedom of a Christian company because the 2010 law required that private health insurers and companies provide HIV preventive drugs, known as PrEP, against their beliefs and values.\n\n\n\nThe ruling was a victory for Christian businesses Braidwood Management and Kelley Orthodontics and a defeat for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe religious Texas employers had argued the ACA violated the Religious Freedom Restoration Act because it forced them to pay for coverage that conflicts with their beliefs, including supporting the use of drugs and \"sexual activity outside of marriage between one man and one woman.\"\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has approved two PrEP pills, Truvada and Descovy, which are 99 percent effective at preventing the transmission of HIV, a virus that causes the disease AIDS.\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization says HIV is still a \"major\" global public health emergency and has killed more than 40 million people.\n\n\n\nThe ACA requires that most private health insurers cover the cost of preventive medicine and services at no cost to the patient. To determine which of those are covered under the health care law, advisory groups such as the U.S. Preventive Task Force (USPSTF) make recommendations.\n\n\n\nO'Connor also ruled against a broad range of preventive services recommended by USPSTF, saying the task force's system for deciding which services should be fully covered under the ACA is unconstitutional.\n\n\n\nAmong those preventive services the judge struck down for coverage under the ACA are colorectal screenings, depression screenings and hypertension screenings.",

Russia is not a country that can be underestimated,\" Erdoğan said at a press conference in Belgrade, Serbia, per translations in the news outlet Anadolu Agency.\n\n\n\n“I can clearly say that I do not find the attitude of the West [toward Russia] right. Because there is a West that follows a policy based on provocation,” he added.  \n\n\n\nThe Turkish president noted that he doesn’t see an end in sight to the Russia-Ukraine conflict, which has now waged on for more than half a year.\n\n\n\nErdoğan maintained Wednesday that the country is following a “balanced foreign policy between Russia and Ukraine,” according to video and translations from TRT World.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Turkey resisted NATO membership bids from Finland and Sweden, a unity move for the alliance in response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nTurkey also worked with Putin to facilitate exports through the blockaded Black Sea. \n\n\n\nThe government of Greece recently asked NATO, the European Union and the United Nations to formally condemn aggressive rhetoric from Turkey as tensions between the neighboring countries heighten.",

        "description": "Photo by Patrick Smith/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Orioles were unable to do much against starter Alek Manoah, and one bad inning from Dean Kremer was enough to seal the loss.  The Orioles went into this four-game series with the Blue Jays needing to win. They needed to take at least three out of four. Instead, it was the Jays who took three out of four, pushing the playoff hopes of the Orioles almost out of existence. \nI don’t say that with bitterness, not really. The Orioles have come such a long way. They got better before they were supposed to, and it happened so fast this year it was almost hard to believe. They are a good baseball team. Which is awesome! On this date last year they had 28 more losses than they do now. Improving almost 30 games in a year is ridiculous. They’re good enough to be in first place in the A.L. Central, for crying out loud. \nAnd the future is bright. The future is so bright. If the season ends and the Orioles aren’t in the postseason, that’s not the only chance. They’ll be back in the thick of things next year and the year after and the year after. \nAs for the grisly details of this game, the first thing to discuss is the starting pitcher shuffle that was announced a few hours before the game started. The rehabbing Tyler Wells, who was slated to make a start in the minors, was activated instead. He was slotted in as an opener in front of the previously scheduled starter Dean Kremer, who would come out of the bullpen. \nCalling up Wells made sense for a bullpen that has been stretched very thin of late. Giving him the start over Kremer rather than just planning to use him out of the bullpen wasn’t really explained beyond saying they are continuing to stretch Wells out as a starter. Was it a bad decision in retrospect? It’s hard to say, honestly. It didn’t go that great, but would it have gone differently in reverse? Would it have mattered anyway with the way the offense failed to solve Jays’ starter Alek Manoah?\nIn the first inning, it looked genius. Wells, who was on a pitch count of perhaps 30-40, needed only four pitches for a 1-2-3 inning. Four! Manoah, on the other hand, had to work. He got two quick out, although the strikeout looking of Adley Rutschman was on a ball outside the strike zone. Adley froze in place for awhile over that one before heading back to the dugout. \nAfter that, things got a little fun. Anthony Santander extended the inning with a single up the middle, setting the stage for Ryan Mountcastle’s long double to right field. As the ball rattled around in the corner, Santander flew around the bases, sliding superman-style into home plate ahead of the throw. \nMountcastle moved to third on the throw home and Gunnar Henderson worked a walk, but Kyle Stowers was unable to knock either in. He grounded out to the end the inning, but Manoah had to throw 19 pitches and the vibe was good. Unfortunately the vibe stopped being good shortly after. \nIf you like Orioles’ offense, I hope you savored that first inning. Because there was none for the rest of the game. Starting with the Stowers groundout, Manoah retired 14 batters in a row. The Orioles couldn’t do anything with him, including making him throw a decent number of pitches. Despite throwing 19 pitches in that first inning, he finished five with just 62. He was cruising. \nThe Orioles pitching? Not so much. After his excellent first inning, Wells ran into trouble in the second. Three straight batters reached to start the second against Wells, the third of which was on a pop bloop that Cedric Mullins raced in and got a glove on it, but couldn’t make the catch. Jorge Mateo had been racing out from shortstop and he also couldn’t get there. \nAfter a mound visit, Wells induced a ground ball from Lourdes Gurriel. Rougned Odor wasn’t quite quick enough to get the double play with Gurriel racing down the line. It was very close and the Orioles challenged, but lost. Gurriel was also lost to the Jays, having to leave with a strained hamstring. One run scored to tie the game. \nWells got out of the inning with no further damage, but even with his four-pitch first inning the second did him in and he was finished. Kremer finished warming up in the bullpen and came in to start the third. And he looked great. He retired the first six batters he faced before getting into trouble in what was a painful and frustrating fifth inning. \nThe fifth inning started with back-to-back singles by Santiago Espinal and Jackie Bradley, then a sharp lineout to right field that moved Espinal to third. It looked like Kremer might get out of it when the slow-running Vlad Guerrero hit a ground ball to second base. \nThe ball wasn’t hit especially hard and Odor wouldn’t make the play at second. He got the sure out at first as Espinal scored from third. From there, things really went south. Bo Bichette walked and the unstoppable Alejandro Kirk singled to knock in Bradley. With Matt Chapman at the plate, Kirk wandered off first and Rutschman tried to pick him off. The throw was wide and Mountcastle couldn’t grab it, bringing in yet another run. \nThe scoring stopped there and Kremer actually went on to pitch two more scoreless innings, plus one out in the eighth.  He just had the one bad inning. It was unfortunately one more bad inning than we saw from Manoah. \nManoah did finally give up another hit, a double to Rutschman in the sixth. But after that he got right back down to business and finished eight innings without allowing another batter to reach. His final pitching line was 8 IP, 3 H, 1 R, 1 BB, 5 K. Outside of that first inning, the Orioles couldn’t do anything with him. \nOne interesting thing that happened in the ninth inning was debut of new Oriole Jake Reed. This guy’s pitching motion was like nothing I’ve ever seen. It wasn’t exactly sidearm, but it definitely wasn’t over hand. It has a weird like, loop-de-loop in it? You might say it is Reed-iculous. \nAfter Reed flummoxed the Blue Jays in the top of the ninth, Orioles faced Jordan Romano in the bottom of the ninth looking for a miracle. The big bats were up in Rutschman, Santander, and Mountcastle. \nRutschman put together a pretty good at bat but was called out on check-swing strike three. I don’t think he went. Santander popped out. Mountcastle struck out. Blue Jays win, 4-1.\nJust like that, the Orioles are 4.5 games back of the final wild card with just 25 games to go, six more against the Blue Jays. Many many things will have to go right for the Orioles to climb back into a postseason spot. It’s not impossible. But it’s looking pretty darn improbable. \nTomorrow is an off day, and I daresay we all need it. The Orioles are back in action on Friday night against the last-place Red Sox.",

        "description": "Photo by Mitchell Leff/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Another one run loss makes for the Marlins 9th consecutive faltering.  After a month of August where the Marlins hit under the Mendoza Line, the first week of games in September hasn’t been any kinder.\nMiami began the season’s final full month 0-4 while being outscored 20-5. \nSo when they manage to scrape across 3 runs in Wednesday’s 4-3 loss, it almost calls for simultaneous celebration and head-shaking. The Fish have now lost 9 consecutive games and fall to 0-5 in September. \nEncouraging again, though, was Trevor Rogers, who, despite being tagged for 2 home runs, gave the Marlins 6 solid innings, allowing 3 runs whilst striking out 8. The outing also marked just the third time in 21 starts this season where Rogers went without walking a hitter.\nThe two home runs of note came via Edmundo Sosa and Jean Segura - the latter of which delivered the game-winning hit Tuesday’s series opener - in the 3rd and 4th inning, respectively.\n\n\nJean Segura 9th Homerun of the Season pic.twitter.com/J9llP7g8RU— Homeruns MLB (@homers_mlb) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nOpposing Rogers, Bailey Falter continued a recent stretch of good pitching, limiting Miami to 2 runs over 5.1 innings, picking up his 4th win in the process. In his last five starts dating back to July 29th, Falter has pitched to a 2.73 ERA over 29.2 innings pitched, striking out 26 while walking just 3. The right-hander has won each of his last 4 decisions dating back to the start of August. \nThe Marlins would make it interesting in the 9th thanks to Jacob Stallings’ fourth home run of the season, cutting the lead to 1.\n\n\n\n\nLooking Ahead\nThe Fish will conclude their trip to Philadelphia tomorrow night as they turn to Sandy Alcantara (12-7, 2.36 ERA). In his last start against the Phillies back on August 10th, Alcantara was cruising into the 8th inning until the Phils hung a three-spot on him in an eventual 4-3 loss. Kyle Gibson (9-6, 4.48 ERA) will look to rebound following a season-low 1.2 innings where he allowed 7 runs against San Francisco. First pitch is slated for 6:45 Eastern. \nOf Note\n\nStallings 9th inning home run snapped a 9-game stretch of 2 runs or less. According to Stathead, this marks the longest streak in the Majors this season. \nMiami’s 8 runs scored in their first games of September rank last in the big leagues. The team has hit .187/.251/.239 in that span, while also being in a three-way tie with Cleveland and Texas for the most caught stealings, 3. The Marlins also find themselves to be cellar dwellers in Slugging Percentage (.239) and OPS (.490). \n\n  \n        \n      Baseball-Savant\n      Miami Marlins (3) @ Philadelphia Phillies (4), Win Probability Graph, 7 September 2022",

        "description": "With just a month remaining in the 2022 regular season, some of the awards races are coming into view. The National League Rookie of the Year balloting will be a two-man show, with Braves teammates Spencer Strider and Michael Harris II battling one another for the hardware. Neither player entered the season as a favorite, but they&#8217;ve pulled away from the field with spectacular performances.\nHarris didn&#8217;t even reach the majors until a few days before June, but he&#8217;s started his career on a .309/.352/.538 tear. That&#8217;s elite offensive output, and while it&#8217;ll probably be difficult to keep hitting at that level while swinging and missing as often as he does, there&#8217;s far more to his game. Harris has rated as a plus defensive center fielder, and it wouldn&#8217;t be a surprise if he eventually takes home a Gold Glove Award. He&#8217;s also a plus baserunner who has gone 16 of 17 as a base-stealer. The Braves cemented Harris as a key piece of the core by signing him to an eight-year extension last month.\nGreat as Harris has been, he may be trending towards a runner-up finish in the ROY race. That&#8217;s a testament to how dominant his teammate has been on the mound. Unlike Harris, Strider got his feet wet in the big leagues last season. Atlanta called him up in October, and he came out of the bullpen twice during the final week of the regular season. The call-up was seemingly geared towards gauging whether Strider would be a playoff option, but the Braves left him off the postseason roster. After winning the World Series, they&#8217;re certainly not quibbling about that decision, but there&#8217;s no question he&#8217;ll be a major factor in the playoffs this time around.\n\nStrider didn&#8217;t open the season in the rotation. Atlanta initially turned to a primary five of Max Fried, Charlie Morton, Ian Anderson, Kyle Wright and Huascar Ynoa, with Strider on hand as a multi-inning relief option. The 23-year-old thrived in that capacity, pitching to a 2.22 ERA while holding opponents to a pitiful .167/.263/.214 line through 24 1/3 frames. It may have been tempting to keep him in that role, particularly since many scouting reports on Strider had suggested a bullpen future may be his best fit.\nThrough two months, however, the Braves weren&#8217;t getting great results from the bulk of the rotation. Fried was excellent, as was Wright. Yet Morton and Anderson had some early-season struggles, and the fifth spot proved a revolving door between Ynoa, Bryce Elder and Tucker Davidson. On May 30, the Braves turned to Strider to make the first start of his big league career. He struggled, allowing five runs in 4 1/3 innings in a loss to the Diamondbacks. The Braves stuck with him, and he reeled off three solid starts in a row. Strider then took a six-run drubbing at the hands of the Giants on June 21, but he&#8217;s been arguably the best pitcher in the game since that point.\nStrider twirled six scoreless innings against the Dodgers his next time out, kicking off an ongoing stretch of 10 of 12 starts in which he&#8217;s allowed two or fewer runs. Over that time, Strider has a 2.15 ERA and surrendered only a .176/.233/.258 slash line. He&#8217;s struck out nearly 40% of batters faced while only walking 6.1% of opponents. The righty has eclipsed double digit punchouts on four occasions, including a masterful 16-strikeout gem against the Rockies last week.\nWhile Strider&#8217;s late entrance to the rotation has kept him from accruing as many innings as the game&#8217;s top arms, he&#8217;s been among the league&#8217;s best hurlers on a rate basis. No other starting pitcher with 90+ innings has a strikeout rate anywhere near his 37.8% mark since he moved to the rotation. The next closest pitcher, Shohei Ohtani, checks at 33%. Strider&#8217;s among the top 20 starters in ERA (2.79), has allowed the fourth-lowest opponents&#8217; on-base percentage (.249) and the lowest slugging percentage allowed (.276). Only Shane McClanahan, Dylan Cease, Kevin Gausman and Ohtani are generating swinging strikes at a better clip than Strider, who&#8217;s gotten a whiff on 15.2% of his total pitches out of the rotation.\nStrider&#8217;s approach is a bit atypical for a starting pitcher, a big reason evaluators questioned whether he could stick in a rotation. He leans extremely heavily on his fastball, turning to the four-seam more than two-thirds of the time. Strider pairs that with a slider and barely turns to a third offering, rarely deploying his changeup. It can be tough to navigate big league lineups with only two pitches, but the fastball-slider pairing has been dominant. Strider is averaging an absurd 98.2 MPH on his heater, while hitters have come up empty more than half the time they&#8217;ve swung at his mid-80&#8217;s slider. The shallower repertoire has neither inhibited Strider from handling left-handed opponents (who have a .200/.256/.284 line against him this season), nor from maintaining his effectiveness multiple times through a lineup.\nIt&#8217;s probably too soon to call Strider a true ace. A 2020 draftee, he&#8217;s still only in his second full professional season. This year&#8217;s 114 2/3 innings are already a personal-high, and it remains to be seen whether he can maintain this kind of form through a 162-game schedule and into the postseason. On an inning-for-inning basis, though, Strider has performed right alongside the game&#8217;s best. He&#8217;s already been far better than the Braves could&#8217;ve reasonably anticipated, and he has certainly secured a spot in the playoff rotation alongside Fried and at least one of Morton or Wright.\nThe addition of Harris and Strider to a core that is coming off a championship gives them one of the league&#8217;s more complete rosters. Atlanta is playing at a 101-win pace, and they&#8217;ve pulled within half a game of the much improved Mets for first place in a top-heavy NL East. Which team will secure the division title and accompanying first-round bye will be one of the most intriguing storylines of the season&#8217;s final couple weeks. Strider will play a big role in those efforts and in whatever postseason run the Braves can mount to follow.\nNote: All stats through play Tuesday.\nImage courtesy of USA Today Sports.",

        "link": "https://www.denverpost.com/2022/09/07/rockies-manager-bud-black-quit-fire-dick-monfort-world-series-mark-kiszla/",
        "description": "Stuck up to his elbows in the Rockies’ pile of stink, nobody would blame manager Bud Black if he took this job and shoved it.\nSo I felt compelled to ask: Doomed to a losing record for a fourth consecutive season, what keeps Black shoveling all the stuff associated with managing a last-place team, when it would be easier to take his ball and go home?\n“I want to be part of the solution to help us win,” Black told me Wednesday.\nQuit as manager of the Rockies? No way.\nWhile this franchise might be in the business of pushing Nolan Arenado out the door for the sin of hating defeat, history has also taught us team owner Dick Monfort hates to fire anyone who makes baseball decisions on the field or in the front office at 20th and Blake.\nSurrender is not in the DNA of Black, although friends sometimes ask: Why does a 65-year-old man chase the quixotic dream of winning a championship with the Rockies?\n“That’s a good question,” said Black, sitting in the same Colorado dugout that eventually broke the spirit of his predecessors, causing baseball lifers Jim Tracy and Walt Weiss to throw up their hands and walk away from this madness. “I get asked by other people my age: ‘How long are you going to do this?’”\nAfter an 8-4 victory against Milwaukee on a sweltering September afternoon, Black’s managerial record in Colorado now stands at 408-438 over the course of six years. While his 48.2 winning percentage is far from gaudy, his success rate is only a tick below Tracy and Don Baylor as the best in the club’s 30-season history.\nWhat has become evident through the decades of Major League Baseball in Denver? Rocks in your head might be required to enjoy the thankless task of managing all the day-in, day-out aggravations of a game not designed to be played at 5,280 feet above sea level. Then there’s the even bigger exasperation of working for ownership that knows it can sell nothing but the promise of sunshine to folks who buy tickets to Coors Field, where there’s a party on the Rooftop in right field, win or lose.\n“Nothing beats winning. We’re here to win,” said Black, who won the World Series as a pitcher with the Royals in 1985 and as a coach for the Angels in 2002. “I know what winning feels like. So that’s what drives me. I want my coaches and players to experience that same feeling.”\nWith the current Colorado roster a mishmash of retread veterans such as first baseman C.J. Cron and starting pitchers that, like German Marquez, seem to constantly struggle to find their mojo, does Black honestly believe the Rockies have a shot to be contenders anytime soon?\nRelated Articles\n\nSports Columnists | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Michael Toglia, Kyle Freeland help knock off Brewers, 8-4\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nSports Columnists | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tDramatic rally leads Rockies over Brewers in 10 innings\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nSports Columnists | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tJose Iglesias&#8217; solid season with Rockies interrupted by trip to IL\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nSports Columnists | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKeeler: Todd Helton&#8217;s second coming?

The people upstairs care,” said Black, whose contract with the Rockies runs through 2023.\nThis summer, as the wheels have fallen off the Rockies’ bandwagon once again, fingers of blame have been pointed at the driver of the bus. Black, whose area of expertise is the physical mechanics and psychological challenges of throwing strikes, has guided a Colorado pitching staff to a 5.05 earned run average that ranks dead last in the National League.\nDoes Black know how much his decisions in the dugout are second-guessed? You bet. He hears criticism on the regular. In fact, it starts at home.\n“My wife second-guesses me all the time,” Black said. “She asks: ‘Why did you bring in so-and-so to pitch the seventh inning?’ My wife has been doing that forever.”\nSo why doesn’t he leave all this frustration behind and retire to the beach?\nIn Black’s mind, he has filed away four major reasons why he keeps showing up in the dugout with a smile on his face.\nNo. 1: “I love this game, and have loved this game since I was a Little Leaguer. I love putting the uniform on.”\nNo. 2: “I take a lot of joy in the teacher, leader and mentor part of this job. Talking baseball, whether it’s about players, strategy or mechanics.”\nNo. 3: “I love the fraternity of baseball, and the people in this game.”\nNo. 4: “My family loves that I still do this. That helps. My family likes baseball and they like that I’m involved.”\nHis list complete, Black asked me: “Are you a country music guy?”\nHe wanted to know if I remember a classic song by George Strait. “Troubadour” reached No. 7 on the country charts in 2008. All these years later, the lyrics speak to Black:\nI still feel 25,\nMost of the time.\nI still raise a little cain with the boys.\nHonky tonk and pretty woman.\nSinging above the crowd and the noise.\nNobody sings the game’s praises louder than Black. He loves this stuff, even when the baseball stinks.\n“I still feel 25,” Black said, “most of the time.”\nHe was a young baseball troubadour when he took the mound in Little League. And my guess is somebody will have to pry the ball from the hand of an old troubadour before Black rides off into the sunset.\n“I think I’ll know when it’s time to move on,” Black told me. “I will probably get to that point one day. But maybe not. I still like it.”",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Twins Legends IKF and Aaron Hicks power the Yankees On March 12, 2022 the Twins traded Mitch Garver to the Texas Rangers for shortstop Isiah Kiner-Falefa and a minor leaguer.\nOn March 13, 2022 the Twins traded Isiah Kiner-Falefa, Josh Donaldson, and Ben Rortvedt to the New York Yankees for Gio Urshela and Gary Sanchez.\nAnd Isiah Kiner-Falefa took that personally. \nIn this series, IKF has 2 home runs- out of his 5 total this year. Today, he hit a grand slam to catapult the Yankees from a 1-0 deficit to a 4-1 lead, and the Twins never recovered. Oh, and there’s also this tweet:\n\n\nThis season with runners in scoring position, Isiah Kiner-Falefa has now hit more homers against the Twins than Carlos Correa has hit for the Twins.— Aaron Gleeman (@AaronGleeman) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\nMaximum pain. \nThe Twins did get their one run on a dinger to left by their off-season prize (which was the ultimate result of trading IKF), but the Yankees got the last laugh. Joe Ryan was not sharp today, but had avoided giving up any runs until the aforementioned grand salami. \nA hamstrung Twins bullpen did perform admirably, with only the newly-claimed Austin Davis giving up 3 runs, but it wouldn’t have mattered anyway as the offense only put up that 1 measly run.\nOh, and let’s not forget the other Ex-Twin, Aaron Hicks. The oft-injured centerfielder who never fails to put together great performances against the Minnesota club was responsible for knocking in New York’s other three runs on a bases-clearing double. \nThe Twins never put together any real threat other than in the third inning, after Correa’s home run. They had two on with two out, and that’s the best scoring opportunity they had besides Correa’s one-out double in the first inning. Gerrit Cole did not get knocked around this time out against the Twins, but rather owned them, posting an absurd 14 strikeouts over 6.2 innings pitched. Correa and Gio Urshela were the only two Twins who looked moderately competent against the perennial Cy Young contender.\nToday was a deflating day for Twins fans, following a deflating run of games only made palatable due to the incompetence of the other AL Central contenders (Cleveland lost in a walk-off to Kansas City tonight). The performance (or lack thereof) of the Twins against the Yankees over the course of the last 18 years is frankly ridiculous. Managers, players, and front office figures have come and gone, but the Twins remain the punching bag of New York forever.\n\nSTUDS\nCarlos Correa: 2-4, 1 R, 1 RBI, 2 K, 1 2B, 1 HR\nGio Urshela: 2-4, 1 K, 1 2B\nJovani Moran: 2.0 IP, 1 H, 1 BB, 0 ER, 2 K\nDUDS\nEveryone else\nEspecially Kyle Garlick, who was 0-7 with 5 strikeouts on the day.\nCOTG\nBrandon Brooks: “This is generational comedy”\nWell said.",

        "description": "Education Secretary Miguel Cardona on Wednesday said lowering standards and changing pathways to qualify educators is disrespectful to the profession.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Look, I'm all for veterans becoming teachers… but let's remember, when the nation's report card is showing that our students have dropped drastically, to provide educators who are not qualified or trained in the pedagogy of teaching is a slap in the face to the profession,” Cardona told reporters at \"The Monitor Breakfast,” hosted by the Christian Science Monitor.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCardona acknowledged that many educators are leaving the field, forcing standards to change to make up for teacher shortages, and suggested other ways to work around the issue.\n\n\n\n“We have to be creative. We have to create pipeline programs,” Cardona said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe secretary advocated for better working conditions and more competitive salaries to attract and retain teachers in the profession — and suggested different uses of American Rescue Plan funding to compel new teachers to the field.\n\n\n\n“We have to look at our current students as future teachers and give them a pathway in high school. We have to take our paraeducators, who work extremely hard meeting the needs of our students, making $12 an hour, and say ‘Listen, I'm going to provide some [American Rescue Plan] funding now because we're in a crisis for you to go on and get your degree and then you’re gonna come back and you're gonna get a job here.’”\n\n\n\nCardona also suggested ARP funding could be used to bring retired teachers back to the profession without risking the loss of their retirement benefits.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There are solutions out there lowering standards is not one of them. We need to raise the bar,” Cardona said.",

        "description": "Photo by Ed Zurga/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Credit to the Royals for forcing me to re-write a lot of this It’s long felt like the Royals struggle with rookie and/or random journeyman pitchers for some inexplicable reason, and tonight was no exception. Cody Morris made his big league debut last Friday and got smacked around by Seattle, allowing three runs and seven baserunners in just two innings. He was nails tonight, but it was all for naught as Kansas City rallied in the ninth to walk off the Guardians 2-1.\nBoth teams managed three baserunners in their first inning, yet neither scored. The Guardians loaded the bases with two outs off Zack Greinke, but he got an easy lineout to Kyle Isbel in left to strand the runners. Bobby Witt Jr. walked with one out in the bottom of the frame, but was gunned down trying to swipe second on an excellent throw from Luke Maile. That caught stealing hurt badly as Salvador Perez and Nick Pratto followed with consecutive singles. No runs scored as Michael Massey grounded out to end the frame.\nEach pitcher settled in after that, racking up outs on balls in play. Cleveland drew first blood in the fourth when Oscar Gonzalez led off the inning with a rocket of a double to the right-center field gap, Andrés Giménez advanced him to third with a groundout, and Owen Miller brought him home with a very shallow pop-up that dropped in front of Drew Waters in center. The infield was playing in, so it’s possible Massey or Nicky Lopez would have had a play on it if they were positioned straight up.\nMorris was dealing through four innings, but he’s not exactly stretched out given he’d thrown only 23.1 total innings this season prior to tonight. He was pulled after four, having thrown 61 pitches. Time for the parade of relievers. Sam Hentges tossed a 1-2-3 fifth. Enyel De Los Santos got the first two outs of the sixth before allowing a single to Perez. James Karinchak was brought in to face Pratto. Party P drew a walk, but Massey followed with a pop-up to end the inning. Tin foil hat time: Karinchak was awesome in 2020 and the beginning of 2021. Then the sticky stuff crackdown happened, and he was terrible the rest of the year. He’s been back to dominating this year. When you watch him pitch, you may notice he is incredibly fidgety on the mound. He also touches his hair. A lot. As in, between every pitch he touches his hair and then touches the rosin bag. Maybe it’s a routine thing, or maybe he’s found a sneaky way to get sticky.\nAnyway, Greinke once again put together a very solid start at Kauffman Stadium and gave way to the bullpen in the seventh. Collin Snider threw a scoreless seventh. He’s been on a nice run of late, having thrown six scoreless innings in seven appearances since his two month stint in the minors. The Royals got their best scoring opportunity yet in the seventh. Facing Karinchack to lead off the inning, Nate Eaton battled back from 1-2 (which included some ugly swings on curveballs in the dirt) to draw a walk, then stole second with Isbel batting. He went down on strikes, but Karinchack then walked Waters on four pitches. Enter Trevor Stephan, who has had a sneakily excellent season. He snuffed the rally, coaxing an easy flyout from Lopez and punching out MJ Melendez on a nasty splitter down and away.\nAfter an eventful but scoreless top of the eighth, Kansas City once again got the leadoff man on when Witt hit a grounder that clanked off the third base bag. José Ramírez was somehow able to glove it, but he had no chance to make the play at first. After a Perez flyout, Witt stole second and Pratto walked anyway to give the Royals runners on first and second with one out. Just like the last inning. \nBryan Shaw was brought in to relieve Stephan. Shaw entered the game with a 5.22 ERA and 5.05 FIP. Yet here he was, coming in to pitch a high-leverage situation. The gambit paid off. Shaw struck out Massey. Ryan O’Hearn came in to pinch-hit for Eaton and I have no comment on whether or not this was a good strategic decision. I’ll let you guess what happened next.\nKansas City had their chance against lesser relievers. In the ninth, they had to face the American League’s best, Emmanuel Clase, with the bottom of the order coming up. But baseball is a funny game. Clase just didn’t have it tonight. Ten of his first eleven pitches were balls as he walked Isbel to lead off the inning, followed by a four-pitch walk to Waters and a 2-0 count to Lopez. After a bunt attempt foul, Lopez successfully put one down. Ramírez got Waters at second, but the tying run moved to third. Melendez finally got the Royals on the board with a grounder up the middle that scored Isbel and moved the winning run to third. Cleveland chose to intentionally walk Witt to face Perez. Salvy made them pay, sending a flyball to center field that allowed Lopez to tag up and slide into home for the walk-off 2-1 win.\nThe win improves the Royals to 56-82, while Cleveland blows a chance to gain additional ground in the AL Central. This was Clase’s first blown save since May 9th. Kansas City will have the day off tomorrow before welcoming the Detroit Tigers to town for a three-game weekend set.\nZack Greinke - 6 IP, 6 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 2 K, 0 HR\nCody Morris - 4 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 2 K, 0 HR\nSalvador Perez - 2-4, RBI\nOscar Gonzalez - 2-3, 2 2B, BB, R",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Isiah Kiner-Falefa’s first career grand slam, Cole’s dominant revenge outing power Bombers over Twins. You know what’s fun? Grand slams. You know what’s also fun? Winning both games of a doubleheader. You know what’s the most fun? The Yankees sweeping the doubleheader over the Twins on Isiah Kiner-Falefa’s first career grand slam (after winning the wild opener, 5-4). Yup, you read that right: IKF. Grand slam. All part of a dominant 7-1 win.\nThe Yankees came in with a clear plan to run up Joe Ryan’s pitch count early, with Aaron Hicks working a 13-pitch AB to set the tone for the rest of the night. Aaron Judge and Gleyber Torres followed with back-to-back walks and a successful two-out double steal. However, working Ryan’s pitch count to 34 was all they’d accomplish in the inning.\nGerrit Cole was dealing through the 2.2 innings, striking out five with overpowering fastballs and vicious sliders. However, with two outs in the third, he grooved a hanging slider to Carlos Correa, and looking back to the five-homer game in June, we know what happens when you do that. Correa launched a solo shot to left to open the scoring. The inning came a bit unraveled after that, Cole surrendering a walk and a single, but he dialed it in to strike out Gio Urshela looking. \nThat final out of the third got him back in the groove, and he struck out the side in the fourth. Unfortunately, the Yankees offense couldn’t follow suit. They had to wait until the fourth for their first hit of the contest, but sometimes one is all it takes for the floodgates to open.\nTorres led off the frame with a walk, and Oswaldo Cabrera singled right after him. Marwin Gonzalez walked to load the bases for Kiner-Falefa, who lasered the first pitch he saw into the seats in left for his first career grand slam. \n\nAside from that offensive outburst, this game was all about Cole. Seemingly on a mission to punish the Twins for subjecting him to the humiliation of that aforementioned five-homer game back in June, the Yankees’ ace seemingly got better with each successive inning. The slider and cutter got crushed in that earlier game, with Cole himself admitting that his failure to establish the fastball (in addition to his breaking balls backing up all night) were the culprits for his troubles.\nIt should surprise no one then that Cole made a point of throwing his fastball a lot, and boy was it a good one tonight. He was able to throw it by the Twins hitters all night long as it was operating with a half-tick more velocity and inch more rise than his season averages. The slider also continued to be the dominant weapon it’s been over the last two months, inducing a 53-percent whiff rate tonight. All told, Cole induced 23 whiffs, going 6.2 innings while allowing a run on 5 hits and 2 walks against a season-high 14 strikeouts on a season-high 118 pitches.\n\n\nFilthy 14. @GerritCole45   pic.twitter.com/fMy5wEMq0S— New York Yankees (@Yankees) September 8, 2022\n\n\n\n  \n        \n  \nNeither side could manage much offensively after those fourth inning fireworks until Twins reliever Austin Davis lost the ability to throw strikes with two outs in the eighth. He issued three straight walks to load the bases again, this time for Hicks to be the unlikely provider. Provide he did, lacing a line-drive double down the left field line to clear the bases and give the Yankees a 7-1 lead. \n\nLucas Luetge came in to relieve Cole in the seventh and gave the Yankees 2.1 innings of indispensable relief, especially in the second game of a doubleheader. He held the Twins scoreless to finish out the game, racking up three strikeouts with the cutter, slider, and curveball all looking as sharp as they have all season.\nThe doubleheader sweep gives the Yankees a four-game winning streak to go along with their five-game winning streak a week ago. They’re 5 games up on the Rays with 25 games to go. Perhaps these are signs that the club is turning things around in time to finish the regular season strong?\nThe Yankees go for the four-game sweep of the series tomorrow, with Nestor Cortes set to come off the IL to face former Yankee Sonny Gray. First pitch is scheduled for 7:05 pm ET, so be sure to join us in the game thread. \nBox Score",
