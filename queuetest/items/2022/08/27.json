        "description": "A man who beat a Washington, D.C., police officer with a Trump flag during the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol attack was sentenced to 46 months in prison on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) announced that Howard Richardson received the sentence after pleading guilty earlier in the year to assaulting, resisting or impeding officers.\n\n\n\nRichardson waved his flagpole after entering a restricted area of Capitol grounds, according to the Department of Justice, before later hitting a police officer multiple times with the pole.\n\n\n\n“He raised it and forcefully swung it downward to strike an officer with the Metropolitan Police Department who was standing behind a metal barricade,” the DOJ wrote of Richardson and the flagpole.\n\n\n\n“Richardson then struck the officer two more times, using enough force to break the flagpole.”\n\n\n\nRichardson then pushed a “large metal sign into a line of law enforcement officers” along with other rioters, according to the department.\n\n\n\nThe Pennsylvania native, 72, was arrested in November 2021 before pleading guilty in April.\n\n\n\nRichardson will be subject to three years of supervised release after completing his almost four-year in prison sentence, and is required to pay $2,000 in restitution.\n\n\n\nMore than 860 people have been arrested since Jan. 6 in connection with the attack on the Capitol, according to the DOJ.\n\n\n\nMore than 260 of them have been charged with assaulting or impeding law enforcement.\n\n\n\nRichardson’s sentencing follows the DOJ’s announcement earlier Friday that it would seek an over 17-year sentence for an ex-police officer who was found guilty in May of five felonies and a misdemeanor for his participation in the Jan. 6 attack, including assaulting, resisting or impeding an officer using a deadly or dangerous weapon and engaging in an act of physical violence on Capitol grounds.\n\n\n\nThat sentence is by far the longest yet received by a Jan. 6 defendant.",

        "description": "Students at Howard University were forced to evacuate their dormitories for the second time in 48 hours early Friday morning following news of a bomb threat on the institution.\n\n\n\nHoward University President Wayne Frederick announced to the public in a letter on Friday that the school had received two bomb threats within 48 hours on the east and west towers of the university. \n\n\n\nThe president decried the bomb threats as \"terrorism,\" adding that this was the eighth bomb threat the school has endured this year alone. The university head also commended the students for their \"understanding\" during the time of difficulty. \n\n\n\n“For the second time in 48 hours, students have had to evacuate residence halls during the late hours of a school night,” he wrote. “This is terrorism, and it must stop.”\n\n\n\nThese threats are the latest in a pattern of threats students, faculty and staff have endured at HBCUs throughout the country. \n\n\n\nRepresentatives from Howard, Xavier University and Jackson State University testified concerning the bomb threats in front of the House Oversight and Reform Committee in March.\n\n\n\n“Racially charged acts like the bomb threats are not only an attack to our campus, but they are an attack on the ideals and values of HBCUs [historically Black colleges and universities] and their collective mission,” said Xavier Student Association President Emmanuel Ukot at the hearing.\n\n\n\nFrederick called for further law enforcement support of HBCUs in his letter on Friday, saying that he would speak with “as many law enforcement agencies and elected federal officials” as possible to “ensure that the gravity of this situation is elevated and prioritized.”\n\n\n\n“This isn’t about resilience and grit,” he wrote. “We require extra resources from all law enforcement agencies directed towards solving this ongoing threat and bringing those who perpetrate its negative effects to full justice under the law.”",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/rangers-to-select-dallas-keuchel.html",
        "description": "TODAY: The Rangers have officially announced the selection of Keuchel&#8217;s contract from Triple-A\nAUGUST 26: The Rangers announced that Dallas Keuchel is slated to start tomorrow evening&#8217;s game against the Tigers. Texas placed southpaw Cole Ragans on the 15-day injured list, retroactive to August 23, due to a left calf strain. The Rangers already have a vacancy on the 40-man roster, so no additional transaction will be necessary to formally select Keuchel&#8217;s contract.\nIt&#8217;s a return to the big leagues for the 2015 AL Cy Young award winner, who will be on his third team of the 2022 season. Keuchel opened the year with the White Sox but was released in May after posting a 7.88 ERA over eight starts. The veteran southpaw signed a minor league deal with the Diamondbacks and made it back to the majors. He was tagged for 22 runs (20 earned) in 18 2/3 frames, however, and Arizona also let him go.\nTexas rolled the dice on Keuchel last month, signing him to a minor league pact. He&#8217;s spent the past few weeks at Triple-A Round Rock, going 23 1/3 innings over four outings (just under six frames per start) with an excellent 2.31 ERA. Keuchel has walked an elevated 12.1% of batters faced there, but he&#8217;s induced ground-balls at a huge 64.9% clip. That&#8217;s more in line with the grounder numbers he racked up at his peak with the division-rival Astros than the even 50% rate (a strong but not elite mark) he&#8217;s posted with Chicago and Arizona this year.\nKeuchel adds a veteran option with a lengthy track record of career success to the Texas rotation for the stretch run. The Rangers will only pay him the prorated portion of the $700K league minimum for any time he spends in the majors, with the White Sox otherwise on the hook for his $18MM salary this year (plus a $1.5MM buyout on a 2023 option in his original contract with Chicago). The 34-year-old will return to the free agent market this offseason, and a strong showing over the season&#8217;s final month could aid his efforts to find a big league deal over the winter.\nRagans was called up for his major league debut earlier this month. The former first-rounder has made four starts, allowing ten runs (nine earned) in 18 1/3 frames. Texas hasn&#8217;t provided any indication whether he&#8217;s expected to return before the end of the season. The 24-year-old is looking to carve out a back-end role in next year&#8217;s rotation.",

        "description": "Brad Moss: &#8220;I believe Trump will actually be indicted for a criminal offense. Even with all its redactions, the probable cause affidavit published today by the magistrate judge in Florida makes clear to me three essential points:\n\nTrump was in unauthorized possession of national defense information, namely properly marked classified documents.\nHe was put on notice by the U.S. Government that he was not permitted to retain those documents at Mar-a-Lago.\nHe continued to maintain possession of the documents (and allegedly undertook efforts to conceal them in different places throughout the property) up until the FBI finally executed a search warrant earlier this month.\n\n&#8220;That is the ball game, folks. Absent some unforeseen change in factual or legal circumstances, I believe there is little left for the Justice Department to do but decide whether to wait until after the midterms to formally seek the indictment from the grand jury.&#8221;",

Ron DeSantis (R) suspended four members of the Broward County School Board on Friday after reviewing a grand jury investigation into the 2018 mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla.\n\n\n\nDeSantis filed an executive order suspending Patricia Good, Donna Korn, Ann Murray and Laurie Rich Levinson from office based on recommendations by the 20th Statewide Grand Jury. \n\n\n\nThe jury recommended that the board be suspended due to incompetence, neglect of duty and misuse of authority related to the shooting.\n\n\n\nThe governor referenced findings by the grand jury that a safety alarm that would have saved lives during the mass shooting at the high school was not installed and still remains uninstalled at many schools in the area.\n\n\n\n“Students continue to be educated in unsafe, aging, decrepit, moldy buildings that were supposed to have been renovated years ago,” the grand jury found.\n\n\n\nIn February of 2018, an expelled student opened fire at the Parkland school, killing a total of 17 students and staff. The shooting prompted some of the survivors to found the March for Our Lives movement, a prominent group that works to prevent gun violence. \n\n\n\nDeSantis’s press release described the alleged neglect of duty on the part of Good, Korn, Murray and Rich Levinson as “inexcusable,” saying that the four school board members “have shown a pattern of emboldening unacceptable behavior, including fraud and mismanagement, across the district.”\n\n\n\n“It is my duty to suspend people from office when there is clear evidence of incompetence, neglect of duty, misfeasance or malfeasance,” DeSantis said.\n\n\n\nHe continued: “We hope this suspension brings the Parkland community another step towards justice.”\n\n\n\nDeSantis appointed Torey Alston, Manual “Nandy” Serrano, Ryan Reiter and Kevin Tynan to the Broward County School Board in place of the four who were suspended.\n\n\n\nThe governor, who is rumored to be planning a run for president in 2024, also suspended a state attorney this month for “neglect of duty” after he refused to enforce laws prohibiting abortion and gender-affirming surgery for transgender minors.\n\n\n\nThe prosecutor, Andrew Warren, later sued the governor, calling the firing a violation of his First Amendment rights.",

Even with all its redactions, the probable cause affidavit published today by the magistrate judge in Florida makes clear to me three essential points:\n\nTrump was in unauthorized possession of national defense information, namely properly marked classified documents.\nHe was put on notice by the U.S. Government that he was not permitted to retain those documents at Mar-a-Lago.\nHe continued to maintain possession of the documents (and allegedly undertook efforts to conceal them in different places throughout the property) up until the FBI finally executed a search warrant earlier this month.\n\n&#8220;That is the ball game, folks. Absent some unforeseen change in factual or legal circumstances, I believe there is little left for the Justice Department to do but decide whether to wait until after the midterms to formally seek the indictment from the grand jury.&#8221;",

The night before I'd seen the new remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and a sequence of fast scenes lodged in my mind. The invaders, who looked just like everyone else, were finding each other in public places such as parks and shopping centers. They'd shake hands and quickly pass over a package containing one of the pods that allowed them to take over the bodily likeness of yet another human. These body snatchers were accumulating across the city, replacing good people with grim, conspiring replicas.\nAt the end of my nap, I stirred there in the chair and found myself wanting to type a few words about the movie, or maybe something that had grown out of a dream based on the movie. I wrote the first draft of this little poem:\nA Private ClubAfter I learnedthe secret handshakeof the Partners in Misery,I saw it everywhere.\nI probably tinkered with the little poem for a day, then handed it in for my graduate poetry writing class, where my classmates thought it was too short--surely more could be done with this promising setup, they said. The professor seemed to think that the little poem did what it needed to do.\nThat was in 1978 or 1979. Since then, for me, the poem's point remains true. Once you learn what cruel or selfish or power-hungry things people are capable of, you spot these things happening around you on a regular basis.\nAnother way of thinking about Thank You For Your Servitude by @MarkLeibovich is to say that the book teaches a reader how to spot the secret handshake of today's GOP. It teaches (figuratively speaking) that today's GOP national party leadership is made up nearly entirely of grim, joyless, conspiring body-snatchers.",

        "description": "“They risk imprisonment or death stealing the secrets of their own governments. Their identities are among the most closely protected information inside American intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Losing even one of them can set back American foreign intelligence operations for years,” the New York Times reports.\n\n\n\n“Clandestine human sources are the lifeblood of any espionage service. This helps explain the grave concern within American agencies that information from undercover sources was included in some of the classified documents recently removed from Mar-a-Lago, the Florida home of former President Donald Trump — raising the prospect that the sources could be identified if the documents got into the wrong hands.”",

        "description": "The Mets have released outfielder Johneshwy Fargas and infielder Tzu-Wei Lin from their Triple-A affiliate in Syracuse, per Baseball America&#8217;s Chris Hilburn-Trenkle. They&#8217;ve also assigned lefty Nate Fisher to Syracuse after he passed through outright waivers unclaimed, Mike Puma of the New York Post tweets.\nFargas, 27, made his big league debut with the 2021 Mets after their outfield was hit with a barrage of injuries last summer. Fargas himself fell victim to that injury deluge after just seven games, suffering a sprained AC joint when colliding with the outfield wall on a leaping catch. He went 6-for-21 with a few highlight-reel moments in the outfield that, paired the effusive energy he displayed on both sides of the ball, made him a quick fan favorite in Queens. Fargas was designated for assignment, claimed by the Cubs, and eventually returned to the Mets on a minor league deal over the winter.\nIt&#8217;s been a tough season in the minors for Fargas, who carries a combined .212/.305/.340 batting line in 301 plate appearances between the Double-A and Triple-A levels. He&#8217;s still gone 28-for-30 in stolen base attempts, underscoring speed that allows him to provide value both on the bases and in the outfield. He&#8217;s played all three outfield positions in the minors this season, though the bulk of his time has been spent in center.\nFisher, meanwhile, just received his first major league call over the weekend. The 26-year-old tossed three scoreless innings of mop-up work and was promptly designated for assignment. After going unclaimed on waivers, he&#8217;ll head back to Syracuse, where he has a 3.12 ERA across 43 1/3 frames in 12 appearances (ten starts). The Nebraska product remains in the organization but no longer occupies a spot on the 40-man roster.",

        "description": "Wendell Cruz-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Mark Canha gave the Mets two key RBI doubles and Pete Alonso walked it off for the Mets in the ninth. The Mets beat the Rockies 7-6 in walk-off fashion to win their second straight against Colorado at Citi Field. After the Mets took an early lead, the Rockies clawed back to tie it, the Mets took another tenuous lead, which was blown by Mychal Givens, and then Mark Canha tied it in the eighth and Pete Alonso won it in the ninth. \nBrett Baty snapped a scoreless tie in the bottom of the third inning with his first Citi Field home run, but other than that, Chris Bassitt and Chad Kuhl were locked in a bit of a pitcher’s duel in the early innings—both benefitting from double play balls to erase baserunners. \nChris Bassitt did not have his strikeout stuff in this outing; he only struck out one batter all evening. But, he efficiently induced soft contact to make it pretty easily through the first five frames. The Mets extended their lead to 3-0 in the fifth when Starling Marte drove in Mark Canha (who was hit by a pitch) and James McCann (who singled) with an RBI triple. \nHowever, things unraveled for Bassitt rather quickly in the sixth and the Rockies tied up the game at three runs apiece. Wynton Bernard led off the inning with a bloop single perfectly placed behind first base. Ryan McMahon then walked and Brendan Rodgers missed a home run by inches by rifling a ball off the orange line in right center to score Bernard and McMahon to bring the Rockies within a run. Then with two outs, C.J. Cron singled to even the score at 3-3.\nThe Mets, having chased Kuhl from the game, immediately answered off Lucas Gilbreath in the bottom of the sixth. Now facing the lefty, Darin Ruf pinch hit for Tyler Naquin and drew a one-out walk. Jeff McNeil then singled and Mark Canha doubled off the wall in left center to give the Mets a 4-3 lead. It was an RBI knock that should have netted two runs, but the Rockies executed a perfect throw to the cutoff man and another perfect throw home to nab McNeil at the plate to assist in limiting the rally to just the one run. \nAfter his rough sixth inning, Bassitt bounced back nicely in the seventh and retired the Rockies in order, which allowed him to come back out to the mound to start the eighth inning. However, his leash was short. Charlie Blackmon led off the inning by reaching on an infield hit and that was enough for Buck Showalter to pull the plug in favor of Mychal Givens. That decision played out poorly, as a C.J. Cron broken-bat single snuck through to advance the pinch runner Garrett Hampson to third and then Givens hit José Iglesias to load the bases. It looked like Givens might escape the jam, as he bounced back to strike out Randal Grichuk, but then he gave up a bases-clearing double to Elias Díaz to give the Rockies a 6-4 lead.\nFireballer Carlos Estévez came in the game for the eighth and promptly struck out the first two batters he faced and it seemed like this would be a back-breaker for the Mets. But with two outs, the Mets caught a break: Darin Ruf grounded a ball sharply to Ryan McMahon, who missed it with his glove and allowed the ball to clank off his heel and into right field for an error that allowed Ruf to reach first safely. Jeff McNeil then singled to put the tying run on base and Mark Canha came through yet again with a double down the left field line to score both Ruf and McNeil to tie the game. \nConnor Grey then sat down and Edwin Díaz got up. Sometimes when it comes to balls ricocheting off body parts, Lady Luck giveth and Lady Luck taketh away; with one out, Ryan McMahon grounded a ball sharply back toward the mound that caromed off Díaz’s leg and dribbled far enough away from Pete Alonso that McMahon made it all the way to second to put the go-ahead run in scoring position. Unfazed, Díaz struck out Brendan Rodgers and got Garrett Hampson to fly out to right to give the Mets a chance to walk it off against Daniel Bard.\nAnd walk it off they did. With one out, Brandon Nimmo drew a four-pitch walk. Bard then hit Starling Marte with a pitch to advance the winning run into scoring position. It looked like Francisco Lindor might be the hero today, as he lined a pitch hard to right field, but Sam Hilliard made a fantastic game-saving grab on the ball, which left things to the team leader in RBIs. Pete Alonso pulled an 0-2 pitch to find the hole between third and short to win the game for the Mets. \nSB Nation GameThreads\nAmazin’ AvenuePurple Row\nBox scores\nMLB.comESPN\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs.com\n  \nWhat’s WPA?\nBig Mets winner: Mark Canha, +57.8% WPABig Mets loser: Mychal Givens, -61.9% WPAMets pitchers: -45.7% WPAMets hitters: +95.7% WPATeh aw3s0mest play: Mark Canha’s game-tying double in the bottom of the eighth inning, +43.7% WPATeh sux0rest play: Elias Díaz’s bases-clearing, go-ahead double in the top of the eighth inning, -58.2% WPA",

        "description": "The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on Wednesday upheld a Mississippi law restricting voting rights for certain convicted felons that was first crafted during the Jim Crow era.\n\n\n\nIn a 10-7 decision, the court ruled that though Section 241 of the Mississippi state constitution was originally written for racist reasons in 1890, it is no longer racist in effect.\n\n\n\n“It is uncontroverted that the state constitutional convention was steeped in racism and that ‘the state was motivated by a desire to discriminate against blacks’ when the 1890 constitution was adopted,” reads the majority opinion.\n\n\n\nHowever, it adds, the “plaintiffs failed to meet their burden of showing that the current version of Section 241 was motivated by discriminatory intent. In addition, Mississippi has conclusively shown that any taint associated with Section 241 has been cured.\"\n\n\n\nThe provision in question in Mississippi's state constitution prevents people convicted of certain felonies, including forgery, rape and murder, among others, from voting. It has been amended multiple times since the constitution was first adopted in 1890.\n\n\n\nThe court made its decision in response to a lawsuit filed by the Mississippi Center for Justice on behalf of two Black men in Mississippi who lost their right to vote after they were convicted of felonies included in Section 241. \n\n\n\nThe lawsuit argued that the law violates the 14th Amendment's equal protection clause and that because it was originally crafted with racist intent, restricting people's voting rights under the provision based on convictions for the eight felonies included in the 1890 version should be ruled to be unconstitutional. \n\n\n\nRape and murder, the other two felonies included in the current version of the law, were added to Section 241 in a 1968 amendment.\n\n\n\n“This provision was a part of the 1890 plan to take the vote away from Black people who had attained it in the wake of the civil war,” said Rob McDuff, Impact Litigation Project director at the Mississippi Center for Justice, in a statement responding to the ruling.\n\n\n\n“Unfortunately, the Court of Appeals is allowing it to remain in place despite its racist origins.”\n\n\n\nMcDuff claimed that the organization will challenge the decision at the level of the U.S. Supreme Court.",

        "description": "Rays left-hander Brendan McKay suffered an injury to the UCL in his throwing elbow, reports Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times (Twitter link). McKay, who suffered the injury on the first pitch of yesterday&#8217;s appearance with Triple-A Durham, will go for a second opinion. Topkin notes that the team isn&#8217;t yet sure whether he&#8217;ll require surgery.\nWhether or not McKay goes under the knife, one has to feel awful for the 26-year-old. A former #4 overall pick and top prospect, McKay progressed up the minor league ladder rather quickly and reached the majors in 2019. He tossed 49 innings over 13 appearances (including 11 starts), only managing a 5.14 ERA but posting an above-average 25.9% strikeout rate. In spite of some home run troubles, the former Louisville two-way star looked like a potential rotation building block for Tampa Bay.\nIn the three years since then, McKay hasn&#8217;t thrown a single major league pitch. That&#8217;s on account of an almost unfathomable stretch of poor injury luck. He missed the shortened 2020 season on account of a shoulder problem that eventually required surgery. The rehab from that procedure kept him out of action until late June 2021. Just a few outings into a minor league rehab stint, McKay suffered a flexor strain in his forearm that again proved to be season-ending. He was then diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome and underwent surgery to correct that issue last November.\nMcKay had been on the injured list for all of 2022 as he recovered from the TOS procedure. He set out on a rehab assignment in mid-July and spent his allotted 30-day window pitching back to Triple-A. The Rays just formally reinstated McKay from the IL on Tuesday but kept him in Durham on an optional assignment. How the club proceeds from here will be determined by the results of the upcoming evaluation, but the revelation of ligament damage certainly means another trip to the IL and would appear likely to end his 2022 season.",

        "description": "Tap to view the purple deliciousness at full size.\nIf you’re looking for a different kind of dessert, check out the ube ice cream sandwiches at Mata’s Philippine Cuisine in Tampa (on West Waters, a quick drive west of Dale Mabry)!\nUbe (pronounced “OOO-beh”) is a sweet purple yam from the Philippines. It has a flavor that I describe as a mild mix of vanilla, white chocolate, and hazelnuts. It’s been a Filipino sweets staple for centuries, but only in the past decade has it become popular in North America. That’s a shame, because you’ve been missing out on some amazing, colorful dishes as a result!\nThey put the ice cream between “krispy treats” made out of sticky puffed rice (which often gets called pinipig in the Philippines, but that isn’t accurate). Just think of it as ube ice cream between Filipino rice krispies treats and enjoy the flavor.\n\nIt was great, and I’m coming back for more!\nWe also left with dinuguan, chicken adobo, pinakbet, and ginataang bilo-bilo.\n\nMata’s Philippine Cuisine is in Tampa at 4350 West Waters Avenue — east of the Veterans Expressway, west of Dale Mabry.\nThe post Amazing ube ice cream sandwiches at Mata’s Philippine Cuisine appeared first on The Adventures of Accordion Guy in the 21st Century.",

Losing even one of them can set back American foreign intelligence operations for years,” the New York Times reports.\n\n\n\n“Clandestine human sources are the lifeblood of any espionage service. This helps explain the grave concern within American agencies that information from undercover sources was included in some of the classified documents recently removed from Mar-a-Lago, the Florida home of former President Donald Trump — raising the prospect that the sources could be identified if the documents got into the wrong hands.”",

        "description": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) today released the redacted affidavit that persuaded a judge to agree to issue a search warrant for FBI agents to look for classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, the property owned by the Trump Organization in Florida.&nbsp;It was bad.&nbsp;The affidavit explained to the judge the history behind the FBI&#8217;s request.&nbsp;On February 9, 2022, the National Archives and Records Administration (what did I say about archivists?) told the DOJ that after seven months of negotiations, on January 18 it had received 15 boxes of material that former president Trump had held at Mar-a-Lago. Those boxes contained &#8220;highly classified documents,&#8221; including some at the very most secret level of our intelligence: those involving our spies and informants.&nbsp;In those initial 15 boxes, FBI personnel found 184 classified documents. Sixty-seven were labeled CONFIDENTIAL, 92 were SECRET, 25 were TOP SECRET. Some were marked SCS, FISA, ORCON, NOFORN, and SI, the very highest levels of security, involving human intelligence, foreign surveillance, intelligence that cannot be shared with foreign governments, and intelligence that is compartmented to make sure no one has full knowledge of what is in it. The former president had made notes on &#8220;several&#8221; of the documents.On June 8, 2022, a DOJ lawyer wrote to Trump&#8217;s lawyer to reiterate that Mar-a-Lago was not authorized to store classified information, and warned that the documents were not being handled properly. The DOJ lawyer asked that the material be secured in a single room at Mar-a-Lago &#8220;in their current condition until further notice.&#8221;&nbsp;Trump&#8217;s lawyers told the DOJ that presidents have the absolute authority to declassify documents&#8212;this is not true, by the way&#8212;but did not assert he had done so.&nbsp;The FBI opened a criminal investigation &#8220;to, among other things,&#8221; figure out how the classified records were taken from the White House and ended up at Mar-a-Lago, and to determine if other classified records might have been improperly taken and stored, and to figure out who might have taken and mishandled them.&nbsp;They concluded that there was good reason to think that more classified records remained at Mar-a-Lago and that investigators would find evidence that Trump and his allies were obstructing the government&#8217;s effort to recover the material. The person who made the affidavit said they were a special agent with the FBI, &#8220;familiar with efforts used to unlawfully collect, retain, and disseminate sensitive government information, including classified N[ational] D[efense] I[nformation].&#8221; They swore that &#8220;there is probable cause to believe&#8221; that locations at Mar-a-Lago &#8220;contain evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed.&#8221;&nbsp;The affidavit confirmed that the Department of Justice is &#8220;conducting a criminal investigation concerning the improper removal and storage of classified information in unauthorized spaces, as well as the unlawful concealment or removal of government records,&#8221; and asked for the affidavit to be sealed because &#8220;the items and information to be seized are relevant to an ongoing investigation and the FBI has not yet identified all potential criminal confederates nor located all evidence related to its investigation.&#8221;Sidestepping Trump&#8217;s insistence that he could declassify whatever he wished when president, the affidavit specifies that the documents could cause damage even if they are not classified, and it notes that retaining &#8220;information related to the national defense&#8221; is illegal.&nbsp;The information that Trump stole classified documents itself was eye-popping, and then that he refused to return them was astonishing. Now, the knowledge of the extent of it, and that it included information from our human sources, is stunning.&nbsp;AND THIS WAS JUST THE AFFIDAVIT TO GET A SEARCH WARRANT TO GET MORE RETAINED DOCUMENTS&#8230; which the FBI did on August 8.&nbsp;We still don&#8217;t know what was in those more recently recovered boxes.Trump is in serious trouble&#8230;and so are the rest of us. This stolen and mishandled classified intelligence compromises our security. The best-case scenario is that it was never seen by anyone who knew what they were looking at. Even that would mean that our allies have every reason to be leery about sharing information with us again.&nbsp;But that&#8217;s the best-case scenario. We have to wonder, who else now knows the secrets designed to keep Americans safe? Multiple news stories during Trump&#8217;s presidency noted that even then, Mar-a-Lago was notoriously insecure. And, unthinkable though it should be but sadly is not, what if secret documents have already been given or sold into the hands of foreign actors whose interests conflict with ours?&nbsp;I have been writing today about Trump&#8217;s first impeachment and the hearings where Marie Yovanovitch, Fiona Hill, and Alexander Vindman, immigrants all, who served our nation faithfully and fully, risked&#8212;and ultimately lost&#8212;their jobs to warn us that Trump was willing to compromise our national security for his own interests.&nbsp;&#8220;He has betrayed our national security, and he will do so again,&#8221; House impeachment manager Adam Schiff warned the Senate. &#8220;You can&#8217;t trust [Trump] to do the right thing. Not for one minute, not for one election, not for the sake of our country. You just can&#8217;t. He will not change and you know it.&#8221; Schiff begged them to say &#8220;enough.&#8221;&nbsp;But they would not, and they did not, and here we are.&#8212;Notes:Tracy Walder @tracy_walder&#129525; An explainer on the classification of docs trump had per the affidavitAugust 26th 20221,541 Retweets5,010 Likeshttps://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/mar-a-lago-documents-intelligence-us-national-security/671140/https://www.propublica.org/article/any-half-decent-hacker-could-break-into-mar-a-lagohttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/26/us/trump-search-affidavit-release.htmlAdam Schiff @RepAdamSchiffHe has betrayed our national security, and he will do so again.\n\nHe has compromised our elections, and he will do so again.\n\nYou will not change him.

        "description": "Donald Trump’s attorneys late Friday made a new pitch for an independent review of the materials seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate. In a 12-page filing, they urged a federal judge to appoint a “special master” to prevent the Justice Department from continuing to comb through dozens of boxes taken by FBI agents earlier this month. The filing, which was billed as a “supplement” to Trump’s meandering initial bid on Monday, was notable, however, for what it didn’t include. It makes no mention of the hundreds of pages of classified documents recovered during the Aug. 8 search and in previous visits by investigators. It also makes no mention of Trump’s claims to have declassified the material. It also eschews the heated criticism Trump has leveled at Bruce Reinhart, the magistrate judge who authorized the search. Instead, Trump lawyers suggest in the filing that the search may have been improper or even illegal because of indications that investigators were concerned that records covered by the Presidential Records Act were at his Palm Beach home.   “This provides the deeply troubling prospect that President Trump’s home was raided under a pretense of a suspicion that Presidential records were on his property — even though the Presidential Records Act is not a criminally-enforceable statute,” Trump’s filing said. Trump’s lawyers favorably cited a D.C. appeals court’s 1991 ruling in a dispute over electronic messages exchanged during the end of President Ronald Reagan’s second term, which held that while a sitting president has “virtually complete control” over his records, he must notify the Archivist before disposing of records. The ruling notes that “neither the Archivist nor the Congress has the authority to veto the President's disposal decision.\" But there are complications with the Trump team’s argument. The 1991 ruling did not discuss criminal enforcement of the Presidential Records Act or address the actions of former presidents. Moreover, that law was not cited as one of the criminal statutes used to justify the Mar-a-Lago search warrant. The three-decade-old D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals decision also offered no view on whether retaining White House records without authority might violate one of the laws the FBI and prosecutors did cite as the basis for the warrant: a broad prohibition on stealing, misusing or concealing government records. In addition to that law, investigators cited two other potential crimes at issue: willful retention of national defense information and obstruction of justice The late-night Friday filing was a coda to a frantic week for the former president’s legal team, which found itself struggling with basic administrative requirements and facing pointed questions from a Fort Pierce, Fla.-based federal judge, Aileen Cannon, about what precisely they were asking her to do. Among the questions Cannon has asked Trump’s lawyers is whether her court even has the jurisdiction to consider his demands. Trump’s team argued that she did, focusing narrowly on the authority of district court judges to appoint special masters. Left unaddressed is a provision of the Presidential Records Act requiring any legal disputes by a former president under that statute to be filed in the federal district court in Washington D.C. Trump’s renewed bid reiterates his call for the appointment of a special master and also asks for an immediate halt to the Justice Department’s review of the materials seized from his home. That review has been led by a DOJ “filter team,” which is looking for attorney-client privileged materials, according to court filings. Trump and his allies have suggested that some of the seized materials are covered by executive privilege or attorney client privilege. But the new filing Friday doesn’t say how the records are privileged. Some legal experts have questioned the notion of executive privilege applying in this context, since the Presidential Records Act requires many such records to be turned over to the National Archives at the conclusion of a presidency. And Trump, in the filing, also referred back to the government’s acknowledgment that it had initially seized three of his passports, returning them upon the discovery. His attorneys claimed that “the Government’s continued custody of similar materials is both unnecessary and likely to cause significant harm.” But they offered no evidence to support the claim, declining to specify items they believed the government had improperly taken. The Friday-night filing was submitted by Lindsey Halligan, a Fort Lauderdale-based attorney serving as local counsel for Trump, as well as Washington-based James Trusty and Baltimore-based Evan Corcoran.",

        "description": "Good teams &#8212; the New York Mets, as a prime example &#8212; find ways to win close games.\nBad teams &#8212; the Colorado Rockies, as a prime example &#8212; find ways to lose close games.\nExhibit A:  The Mets&#8217; 7-6, walk-off victory on Friday night at Citi Field in front of a raucous crowd that saw the Mets improve to 42-19 at home. Pete Alonso snuck a two-out single through the left side off closer Daniel Bard to score Brando Nimmo with the winning.\nBard, one of baseball&#8217;s best relievers this season, was his own worst enemy. He gave up a one-out walk to Nimmo and then plunked Starling Marte, moving Nimmo into scoring position.\n&#8220;You can look at it a couple of different ways,&#8221; manager Bud Black told AT&amp;T SportsNet. &#8220;We executed some things and so did they, right? That&#8217;s the crux of it.\n&#8220;That was an emotional roller coaster for both sides. We were in a good position with a couple of our best pitchers out there, but the Mets got some good at-bats. I like the way our guys fought all game.&#8221;\nThe Rockies fell to 18-41 on the road in what ranks as one of their most soul-crushing losses of the season. The Rockies have the worst road record in the majors.\nThe Rockies really blew this game in the eighth when New York knotted the game at six.\nRockies&#8217; set-up man Carlos Estevez struck out dangerous hitters Francisco Lindor and Pete Alonso to quickly record two outs, but third baseman Ryan McMahon&#8217;s error on a groundball by Darin Ruf opened the door to disaster. Given life, Jeff McNeil roped a single to center and Mark Canha ripped a two-run double past McMahon and into left field.\nMcMahon, a Gold Glove finalist last season, has now committed 15 errors, the most in the National League.\nColorado seemed to have notched a rare road win against a quality opponent on a three-run double by catcher Elias Diaz in the top of the eighth.\nDiaz hit a 2-2 fastball off reliever Mychal Givens, who had a short stint with the Rockies last season. The Mets faithful in Flushing Meadows let Givens have an earful.\nIn a topsy-turvy affair, the Mets took a 4-3 lead in the sixth against struggling lefty reliever Lucas Gilbreath. Ruf, inserted as a pinch hitter, drew a one-out walk and McNeil followed with a single up the middle. Canha ripped a double to score Ruf, but center fielder Wynton Bernard made an excellent throw to second baseman Brendan Rodgers, who threw a strike to Diaz, who tagged out McNeil at the plate.\nRockies right-hander Chad Kuhl, making his first start since coming off the injured list, showed glimpses of the pitcher he was earlier in the season when he was the Rockies&#8217; most effective pitcher.\n&#8220;Overall, I thought he had good action on his pitches,&#8221;  Black said. &#8220;He was a little erratic at times, but his stuff was there. I liked his stuff.&#8221;\nWith his slider biting, Kuhl struck out four and allowed just five hits over his five innings. But the Mets roughed him up in two frames. Mets rookie third baseman Brett Baty led off the third with a homer to right-center, the second of his career and his first at Citi Field.\nKuhl lost his edge in a two-run fifth that gave New York a 3-0 lead. Kuhl plunked Canha to lead off the inning, surrendered a one-out single to James McCann and then served up a two-out, two-run triple to Marte.\nKuhl was coming off the worst outing of his Rockies career in the start just prior to being placed on the IL. He allowed a season-high nine runs in just five innings on Aug. 3 at San Diego.\nNew York&#8217;s Chris Bassitt threw five scoreless innings, but the Rockies figured him and tied the game with a three-run sixth. Colorado displayed the kind of team offense that it&#8217;s so often lacked on the road.\nBernard led off with a bloop single and McMahon drew a walk, setting up Rodgers&#8217; two-run double off the top of the right-field wall. Rodgers&#8217; blast missed being a home run by just a few inches. C.J. Cron drove in Rodgers with an opposite-field single to right.\nBassitt certainly wasn&#8217;t dominant like teammate Jacob deGrom was on Thursday night in the Mets&#8217; 3-1 victory, but he was effective in his own way, inducing a career-high 13 groundball outs over 7 1/3 innings.\nThe Rockies, who have lost seven of their last eight games at Citi Field, will try again on Saturday night in Game 3 of the four-game series.\n\nOn Deck\nRockies LHP Kyle Freeland (7-8, 4.93 ERA) at Mets LHP David Peterson (6-3, 3.44)\n5:30 p.m. Saturday, Citi Field\nTV: ATTRM\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM\nFreeland has pitched very well in Queens, going 1-0 with a 1.93 ERA in three games (two starts) at Citi Field. The lefty could use a boost. He did not pitch well in his last start, allowing five earned runs over 6 1/3 innings, including giving up a grand slam to San Francisco&#8217;s Evan Longoria. Overall against the Mets, Freeland is 2-0 with a 2.25 ERA in five games (four starts). He last faced New York on May 25 of last season, allowing one run over four innings in Colorado&#8217;s 3-1 loss.\nPeterson is coming off a loss at Philadelphia where he allowed three runs on eight hits and two walks with six strikeouts across 4 2/3 innings. He surrendered a career-high-tying eight hits, his most allowed this season. That was an aberration because the lefty has allowed four hits or fewer in 14 of his 19 games this season and in 32 of 44 career games. He&#8217;s faced the Rockies just once, on May 24, 2021, at Citi Field. He allowed three runs on five hits over six innings and took the loss.\nTrending: The Mets entered Friday night&#8217;s game with an 80-46 record and their .635 winning percentage ranked third in the majors and second in the National League. Only the 1986 Mets team (84-42) posted a better record through the first 126 games of a season. Those Mets won the World Series.\nAt issue: You might have heard this before. The Rockies entered Friday night having hit .206 with 21 doubles, one triple, six home runs and 131 RBIs with runners in scoring position. Since 1995, the Rockies have hit .305 with RISP at Coors Field while hitting .242 away from home.\nPitching probables:\nSunday: Rockies RHP Germán Márquez (6-10, 5.22) at Mets RHP Max Scherzer (9-3, 2.33), 11:40 a.m., ATTRM\nMonday: Off Day",

        "description": "From her window before it happened. Photograph by Lydia Argote.\nBy Talia Winiarsky\nAbout 40 years ago, Lydia Argote and her daughter, Liza, were taller than the newly planted trees behind their apartment building on West 108th Street between Broadway and Amsterdam Avenue. Eventually, two of the trees reached four stories high, providing shade for many residents of the building. When Liza grew older and visited from California, her children played in their shade, too.\nNow, Argote and her daughter are once again taller than the trees. On a quiet Saturday morning, July 30, with no advance warning to the neighborhood, the trees became mere stumps after the city ordered them cut down.\nPhotograph by Matt.\n“We would have strapped ourselves to the trees to find out why,” said Argote, who only learned of the city’s plans as she saw the workers putting the finishing touches on the job. “That would have at least kept them alive for a little bit, but it was too late. They had already started to cut them down.”\nOne by one, they cut them down. Photograph by Matt.\nThe tree removal is part of a Department of Education (DOE) renovation project on the playground at PS 165, an elementary school on West 109th Street, where the trees were planted, according to a department spokesperson. Three trees lined the back borders of the playground, and a fourth grew in its center.\nCutting down the trees will create room for “state-of-the-art blacktop asphalt flooring, tables and a comfortable seating area, play equipment, a full basketball court, and a track,” DOE explained, following an inquiry from the Rag a few weeks after the trees were cut down. The trees also needed to be removed because rodents burrowed in them, and their roots presented a tripping hazard, according to the department.\nNearby residents – some of whom said they had cherished the trees for decades – told the Rag that DOE did not inform the neighborhood of its plans or justifications in advance. Nor did they make it easy for residents to get answers once the trees were gone.\nThey carried them away. Photograph by Matt.\nJohn Graham, a resident of one of the buildings that received shade from the trees, was on a Zoom call in his apartment that morning when he heard a sudden loud sound. He said he excused himself from the call to see what was happening and was devastated when he looked out his window to see the cut trees.\n“We thought that the city valued trees for all of our lives, and the notion that it&#8217;d be cutting down healthy trees was just beyond belief,” Graham told the Rag.\nPhotograph by Matt.\nTree canopies cover about 22 percent of the city, according to The New York Times, and various programs have sought to increase that number. In 2007, the city launched a MillionTreesNYC initiative with a goal to plant a million trees, which they achieved in 2015. Earlier this year, Manhattan Borough President Mark Levine proposed planting a million more trees by 2050. \nThe city’s Department of Parks &amp; Recreation maintains a map that calculates the environmental benefits of each tree on city streets, including intercepting stormwater, removing carbon dioxide and other pollutants from the air, and conserving energy by shading buildings.\nNo work may be performed on or within 50 feet of a street tree without a permit from Parks &amp; Recreation, their website says. However, the trees in the playground were not street trees, and were under the jurisdiction of DOE. It’s unclear whether that department needs permits from other city agencies to work on trees within a DOE-regulated area.\nSchool administrators at PS 165 &#8220;were on-board after notification from project management,” a DOE spokesperson told the Rag. Neither the school’s principal nor its PTA responded to inquiries from the Rag.\nPhotograph by Matt.\nRegardless of who was responsible, the neighborhood should have been informed, said Graham. “Even though they may be on one property, like a schoolyard property, they&#8217;re valued by everybody in the neighborhood,” he said.\nNearby resident Chelsea Bassman said the action contradicted the city’s values. “We can&#8217;t seem to find the purpose, especially when the city wants to become greener,” she said, adding that the two largest trees — a maple and a locust — were native species particularly well suited to the local environment. These two trees were located at the border of the play area, and it was unclear to Bassman why they had to be removed to install a new playground, she said. \nSome local residents said the trees were a home to many birds. Hearing them sing in an urban environment was a rare treat, and the trees may have sheltered some high-vulnerability species that live in the area, according to Audubon Society.\nBirds sang in them. Photograph by Lydia Argote.\nAfter the trees were cut down, Bassman said she and her husband pored over Community Board minutes, called the company that cut down the trees (which said only that it was doing a job for the city), and reached out to Shaun Abreu, the City Council representative for the neighborhood.\nA spokesperson for Abreu, Emmitt Sklar, said Abreu’s office didn’t know about the plan in advance but will work to ensure that the city keeps the neighborhood informed going forward about the playground renovation plan, including how new trees might be incorporated into it. \n“Making sure that our community has the trees and the foliage it needs to keep our landscape cool is really critical for the community, but also for our city as a whole as we&#8217;re trying to tackle the climate crisis,” Sklar said. \nPlanting new trees would be a good step forward, but no substitute for those that were cut down, said Bassman, who added that the loss of shade has made her apartment hotter this summer. “For the first time, my husband and I looked at each other like, ‘Wow, it&#8217;s hot in our apartment now.’ So we turned on our AC when we normally wouldn&#8217;t have,” she said.\nFrom her window now. Photograph by Lydia Argote.\nThe city did eventually provide answers a few weeks later to those who doggedly pursued them. “The design decision was made to remove the trees due to existing root-patterns,” one local resident was told. “The trees were damaging and lifting up the original asphalt playground surface, causing a tripping/safety hazard. Allowing the trees to remain would have negatively impacted the new playground surface in the same manner, eventually becoming another safety-issue.”\nThe city also said the resurfacing of the playground will eliminate its current rodent problem. The school is in zip code 10025, which had the city’s largest number of 311 rat complaint calls at the end of last year. \nFor Argote, however, the removal is still devastating despite the explanation. If the tree roots truly posed a risk, she said, they would’ve been pulling up the asphalt years ago, as these trees had been around for several decades. “I felt they didn&#8217;t remove these trees — they killed them,” Argote said. \nHowever, the incident and the neighbors’ collective advocacy illustrated their strong bond, Argote said. “I&#8217;m happy that I&#8217;m in a community that cares.”",

This much I can say for sure: I first visited the German island in 1987 as a four-year-old, when my hair was as white as that of many of the local children, including the family friends who were hosting us. Beyond this, I recall being placed in the handle-basket of my uncle’s bike; visiting a long-forgotten Viking fort; and watching steam sashay from fresh bread that had been delivered to the windowsill of our thatched cottage. Returning this spring, I wanted to believe that Föhr had remained largely unchanged, but as the Dreyers – still friends after decades – drove us to their village, Borgsum, we had a shock in store. The fairytale house I’d so long held in my mind had been replaced with something much newer. Continue reading...",

Alikhanov, the governor of Russia’s Kaliningrad region, said journalists from his city would come to Kherson to “help” the new channel find the right message.

        "description": "Fearlessly frank and endearingly geeky reflections on life and death by a neurosurgeon diagnosed with cancerA reader faced with the third instalment of a famous neurosurgeon’s memoirs is entitled to a sinking feeling. They might be forgiven for the suspicion that such a book was conceived at a boozy party celebrating the sales of the previous two. Not only that, but memoirs by medics can feel anticlimactic. The daily proximity of life-and-death decisions makes them akin to war stories, but they lack the sweep of history, and there is the feeling that the work of one doctor, in contrast to that of war heroes, is much like that of any other.All of this is to say that I was prepared to be bored by the subject and irritated by the author. I was wrong: given its subject – broadly, death and disease – the book is unexpectedly fun, and the author pretty much irresistibly likable. This is a very British book: in the US such a compendium of self-deprecation would doom any literary and elder-statesman ambitions. Ben Carson, also a neurosurgeon, wrote memoirs that are relentlessly edifying and self-congratulatory but he was, after all, running for president. Marsh is running for exercise, and in one of the many melancholy references to advancing age scattered through the book, mentions being overtaken by a gazelle-like female runner with whom he exchanges a wry smile of incongruous fellowship. But lamenting incipient old age is only one of the threads in the book. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Alex Garland’s rural chiller joins classics of the genre from The Wicker Man to Cry of the BansheeThe Gloucestershire village at which our heroine (Jessie Buckley) arrives near the beginning of Men is far too pretty to be harmless: you just know something rotten has to lie at the heart of it, inches below all that lush greenery. Alex Garland’s creepy, daffy, already somewhat underrated film – now streamable on Amazon – may probe male toxicity and female endangerment with a distinctly #MeToo-era lens, but it’s also rooted in a sturdy, shivery tradition of British folk horror, where the myths and traditions of the land become their own kind of threat.They’re embodied in the shape-shifting form of Rory Kinnear, playing the multiple men of this village, but also a single, villainous spirit of masculinity. Riffing obliquely on the mythos of the Green Man, Garland’s script depicts gendered violence as something ancient and ritualised at the heart of our culture, a curse to somehow be broken.

        "description": "Justice Department lawyers are in the early stages of drafting a potential antitrust complaint against Apple, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter — a sign that a long-running investigation may be nearing a decision point and a suit could be coming soon.\n\n\n\nVarious groups of prosecutors inside DOJ are assembling the pieces for a potential lawsuit, the individual said, adding that the department’s antitrust division hopes to file suit by the end of the year.\n\n\n\nStill, the Justice Department has made no decisions whether or when to sue Apple, the world’s most valuable public company, cautioned that person and one other familiar with the probe — and it’s still possible no case will be filed. Both were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential investigation.\n\n\n\nThe suit would be the latest major legal problem besetting the country’s biggest tech companies two years after federal regulators and multiple states filed antitrust cases against Google and Facebook. And it would be the DOJ’s first antitrust suit against one of the tech titans during President Joe Biden’s administration.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department has been&nbsp;investigating Apple since 2019&nbsp;over allegations that it abused its market power to stifle smaller tech companies, including app developers and competing hardware makers. As the investigation has progressed, a suit&nbsp;has become increasingly likely, but the move to drafting sections of the suit is a significant step forward in the process.\n\n\n\nDOJ declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nThe Apple investigation is one of a series of efforts by Congress, DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission to rein in the mammoth tech companies that have come to dominate the global internet, social media and online advertising. The FTC is also pursuing an antitrust investigation of Amazon involving both its retail and cloud computing businesses.\n\n\n\nThe Apple case is particularly significant because it would open a second, massive battle with the tech industry at DOJ. The Justice Department is&nbsp;already litigating a case against Google&nbsp;over its search business and is preparing a secondlawsuit over its advertising operations. While DOJ could still decide not to sue, the deliberations about how to frame a complaint make a case more likely.\n\n\n\nAny case is going to be a hard fight for DOJ, and with a market cap of $2.73 trillion, Apple has near endless resources to defend itself. It has already shown a willingness to litigate to protect its lucrative App Store, going to trial against Fortnite maker Epic Games last year.\n\n\n\nTo date, much of the attention on a potential Justice Department case against Apple has focused on its App Store, the only way for users to download applications on iPhones and iPads. But the case DOJ is now considering extends well beyond the Apple-controlled payment system and the high commissions that have drawn the ire of software developers for years, according to the individuals.\n\n\n\nProsecutors are also homing in on whether and how Apple’s control over its physical devices harms competitors beyond app developers. DOJ is focused heavily on public complaints leveled by Tile, a maker of devices and technology used to find lost items, according to three people with knowledge of the government’s work. All were granted anonymity to discuss confidential meetings.\n\n\n\nTile’s tracking devices compete against Apple’s AirTags.\n\n\n\nTile has been public about its complaints,&nbsp;testifying in congressional hearings&nbsp;that Apple has made it&nbsp;more difficult for the company’s devices to access needed location data, and restricted access to key hardware components in its phones.\n\n\n\nDOJ lawyers in San Francisco are leading the probe, and have been reaching out in recent weeks to companies that partner with Tile to enable the company’s location tracking technology in their devices, according to the three people. In those meetings, the three people said, department officials have made clear that both Apple’s App Store and mobile phone operating systems at large are under scrutiny. Tile declined to comment.\n\n\n\nComplaints around Apple’s App Store have been percolating for years, and are focused on the company’s policies prohibiting outside payments for in-app purchases and rules barring iPhone users from circumventing the store to download software on the devices. That’s in contrast to devices running Google’s Android operating system, which generally allow users to install apps from rival sources. Google, however, is also facing antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe over its app store.\n\n\n\nEpic Games went to trial against Apple last year over the App Store restrictions on its Fortnite video game,&nbsp;largely losing its case&nbsp;but attracting the interest of DOJ prosecutors who&nbsp;attended every day of the three-week legal showdown.\n\n\n\nThe federal judge in the Epic case ruled that Apple is not a monopolist but said the company has unfairly restricted access to its phones and must allow third-party payment systems. Both sides are appealing, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled a hearing for late October.\n\n\n\nThe timing of a potential DOJ case against the company is almost certain to be dictated at least in part by the Epic case. Justice Department officials will likely want to wait for the outcome of the appeal to help decide how to frame a possible lawsuit. In her ruling, the trial judge expressly said that while Epic did not prove its case, it&#8217;s possible that another plaintiff could.",

        "description": "What I think about when I think about walking: Mark Hooper finds divine inspiration on the Quantocks in Somerset.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe danger with writing about walking is the tendency to make it sound more profound than it is. You’re only going for a walk. Which is exactly why I headed to the Quantock Hills in Somerset: to trudge cheerfully though a steady drizzle, to take in the view when it revealed itself; to clear my head.\n\n\n\nThe Quantocks loom large over Taunton (the county town where I spent most of my childhood) — and over my memories. I’ve been here countless times, sometimes on school trips, camping in the woods, learning to map read or searching cluelessly for signs of glaciation. But mainly I came here on family walks, killing a few hours while the Sunday lunch was in the oven, or trying to wear our springer spaniel out, laughing at her as she bounced excitedly through the heather, picking up the scent of rabbits and birds that had long since fled the scene. We’d chat, catch up, mess around: the sort of walking you don’t really think about. \n\n\n\nThe Quantocks are a pretty barren place, made up of heathland and dense, dark, slightly sinister woods, with liberal splashes of purple gorse interrupting the ruddy greens and browns of the land. But the views here can be stunning. Looking north towards the Bristol Channel, or southwards over Taunton to the Blackdown Hills beyond, the light constantly plays across the fields as the clouds shift. Occasionally, if you’re lucky, they will seep rays of sunshine in great beams over the valley, as if sent direct from the heavens (or ET’s mothership). Not for nothing was this named England’s first official Area of Outstanding National Beauty (in 1956). \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInevitably, a walk here usually involves sheltering against the odd brick wall or under a canopy of trees as those same clouds deposit their load as they form and rise over the terrain. But that’s part of the charm. Somerset is a mild place in every sense: soft and green and ripe and verdant. The summers can be long-shadowed and hazy, but you don’t get all that greenness and ripeness without a heavy dose of rain, too.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWatching the showers sweep in from the Quantocks, first blurring and then obscuring them, is a sight that has captured the imagination of everyone from cricket commentators to poets over the years. John Le Carré mentions it on the second page of Tinker, Tailer, Soldier, Spy, writing:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe rain rolled like gun-smoke down the brown combes of the Quantocks…\n\n\n\nThat’s a brilliant description of Somerset rain: it often appears as a mist against the backdrop of the hills, getting denser until it envelops them. It’s also a deliberate nod to William Wordsworth who, in Book 14 of his The Prelude (1850), wrote:\n\n\n\nUpon smooth Quantock’s airy ridge we roved, unchecked, or loitered ’mid her sylvan combes\n\n\n\nThe word ‘combe’ (meaning a steep, narrow valley or hollow in a hillside) isn’t unique to Somerset — it appears in the names of towns and villages across the country, from Sussex to Cumbria — but it seems particularly apt when describing the Quantocks, which is all dips and rises, ridges and recesses. It’s a feature that Wordsworth knew well, having moved from Cumbria to Somerset in 1797 with his sister Dorothy, spending a year walking on the Quantocks and composing poems with his friend, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, who lived in nearby Nether Stowey. It was here, in Coleridge Cottage — now owned by the National Trust — that he wrote many of his most famous works, including &#8216;The Nightingale&#8217; and &#8216;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&#8217;, both of which appear in Lyrical Ballads, the collection he and Wordsworth released in collaboration, which is generally thought to mark the birth of the English Romantic movement. While the poems (19 by Wordsworth, four by Coleridge), draw on a variety of influences, the shadow of the Quantocks can be felt in the sense of spirituality in nature. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the same year, Coleridge also wrote &#8216;This Lime-tree Bower my Prison&#8217;, written under a lime tree in the garden of a friend and Nether Stowey neighbour, the philanthropist Thomas Poole, while his friends went walking on the Quantocks: \n\n\n\nFriends, whom I never more may meet again,On springy heath, along the hill-top edge,Wander in gladness, and wind down, perchance,To that still roaring dell, of which I told……Now, my friends emergeBeneath the wide wide Heaven—and view againThe many-steepled tract magnificentOf hilly fields and meadows, and the sea\n\n\n\nToday, you can walk the 51-mile Coleridge Way, a planned route that leads you from Nether Stowey across the Quantocks and Exmoor. But that’s not the sort of walking I like to do. I prefer to get lost, jump though heather, laugh at dogs, shelter from showers and gasp at beams of sunlight. That way, you tend to stumble across the profound in the least expected of places.",

        "description": "In 1926 the world’s bestselling author vanished for 11 days. Did she really go into hiding to frame her husband for murder? Historian Lucy Worsley reopens a case still shrouded in mysteryAgatha Christie was sitting quietly on a train when she overheard a stranger saying her name. In the carriage, she said, were “two women discussing me, both with copies of my paperback editions on their knees”. They had no idea of the identity of their fellow passenger, and proceeded to discuss the most famous author in the world. “I hear,” said one of the ladies, “she drinks like a fish.”I love this story because it sums up so much about Agatha Christie’s life. They both had her paperbacks. Of course they did. Christie wrote more than 80 books, outsold only by Shakespeare and the Bible, so the cliche runs. And she wasn’t just a novelist, either: she remains history’s most performed female playwright. She was so successful people think of her as an institution, not as a breaker of new ground. But she was both. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Exuberant over a string of recent legislative victories, and launching his midterm campaigning in earnest, President Joe Biden swaggered into Maryland on Thursday and excoriated his predecessor’s philosophy as “semi-fascism,” in what constituted an unusually pointed and highly charged denunciation of Republicans.\n\n\n\n“What we’re seeing now is either the beginning or the death knell of extreme MAGA philosophy,” Biden told Democratic donors in the Washington suburb of Rockville. Calling out those he labeled as “extreme” Republicans, Biden said: “It’s not just Trump, it’s the entire philosophy that underpins the — I’m going to say something, it’s like semi-fascism.”\n\n\n\nLater, at a national Democratic Party event before a few thousand people packed into a nearby high school gym, Biden added: “I respect conservative Republicans. I don’t respect these MAGA Republicans.”\n\n\n\n“There are not many real Republicans anymore,” Biden added.\n\n\n\nNo president in recent memory has had a better month of August, lifting the mood inside the White House and injecting fresh hope across the party ahead of what long looked like a bleak midterm election. In recent weeks, Democrats have passed a slew of marquee bills filled with deliverables that Biden ticked through in his speeches. The president painted the last year-plus as something of an American comeback — and a recovery from the depths of the pandemic and economic turmoil: “We’ve come a long way,” he said.\n\n\n\nAnd after a recent stretch of self-isolation as he recovered from Covid, Biden appeared to relish the opportunity to close out the night by wading into the audience and spending several minutes grinning for selfies.\n\n\n\nRepublicans called the president’s comment about fascism “despicable,” with a spokesperson for the GOP saying Americans are still “suffering” from high inflation.\n\n\n\nFor Biden, spending the evening in a blue state with few competitive elections pointed to the careful calculation the White House faces in deploying him over the next 75 days. While the president’s approval numbers have ticked up of late, he still hovers around the low- to mid-40s, and many Democrats remain reluctant to appear with him.\n\n\n\nOnstage in Rockville, Biden highlighted his administration’s recent cancellation of student loan debt, as well as Democrats’ ongoing fight for abortion rights. He listed other campaign promises yet unfulfilled, including universal pre-K. At one point, he presided over a slideshow presentation that highlighted the plan of Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), the head of the Republican Party’s Senate campaign arm, to sunset federal programs every five years. Biden said that includes Medicare and Social Security.\n\n\n\n“The MAGA Republicans don’t just threaten our personal rights and economic security,” the president said. “They’re a threat to our very democracy. They refuse to accept the will of the people. They embrace political violence. They don’t believe in democracy.”\n\n\n\nWading into the impact of his climate and health care legislation, Biden said that “the survival of our planet is on the ballot.” If Republicans win control of Congress, he noted, “it won’t matter where you live: Women won’t have the right to choose anywhere. Anywhere.”\n\n\n\nEarlier, he criticized the impact the Trump administration had on the United States’ stature in global politics, referring to Russian President Vladmir Putin’s recent aggression in Ukraine.\n\n\n\n“I underestimated how much damage the previous four years had done in terms of America’s reputation in the world,” Biden said.\n\n\n\nBiden’s rally brought in more than 3,600 people in a gym and two overflow rooms. The Democratic National Committee has reported record midterm fundraising for this point in the year, at $255 million for this cycle and $92 million for the year.",

        "description": "The Iranian photojournalist on a woman he spotted in northern AfghanistanIn 2015, Ako Salemi was on a photography trip to northern Afghanistan with fellow Iranian photojournalist Majid Saeedi. One day, the pair were exploring near the tomb of Hazrat Ali ibn Abi Talib, known locally as the Blue Mosque for its intricately detailed blue tiled domes and exterior. People feed the many doves – a symbol of peace – that gather around the tomb, and Salemi photographed this woman as she carved a path through the flock.“I didn’t notice it at the time, but afterwards I found the flash of red by her ankles amazing – almost reminiscent of defiance,” Salemi says. Unfortunately, he couldn’t interact with the passerby, or show her his photo. “A man can’t talk with a woman in the streets of Afghanistan. In the radical interpretation of Islam, women are believed to belong to their men, and nobody else should see or talk to them. If you speak with a woman who you don’t know, her father or brother or husband may get very angry.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "Durham has become the focus of anger from both sides of the political spectrum. Students and academics try to explain why its campus skirmishes keep spilling out into the tabloidsIt was 3 December 2021, and South College, Durham University, was having its Christmas formal. “Formals happen every week here,” says Miatta Pemberton (not her real name), who is in her second year at the college. “It’s a longstanding Durham thing. You put on a gown that cost £60, or, if you’re like me, you buy it off eBay for £20.” For a special occasion, it would be normal to have a speaker and announce them in advance. By 5pm, the speaker hadn’t been announced, and Pemberton found out who it was by chance from the college’s vice-principal, Lee Worden. She couldn’t immediately place the person; she just knew she’d heard the name “for all the wrong reasons”.About 15 to 20 students more familiar with Rod Liddle’s work in the Spectator and the Sunday Times (sample headline on one of his columns from 2018: “I’m identifying as a young, black, trans chihuahua”), walked out before he’d started speaking. As they did so, Tim Luckhurst, the college principal who had invited Liddle, shouted: “At South College, we value freedom of speech,” and “Pathetic!”. So the mood wasn’t great, but there were still upwards of 180 students in the hall as Liddle stood up to speak. He began by saying he was disappointed not to see any sex workers there, a reference to a controversy from the previous month, when the students’ union was attacked for offering safety training to students involved in sex work. The story was picked up by the tabloid press, which mobilised the opinion wing of the Daily Mail, which then brought in the then further education minister, Michelle Donelan, who accused the union of “legitimising a dangerous industry which thrives on the exploitation of women”. If you were a culture-war correspondent looking for the frontline, you’d go to Durham: it is where things kick off. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Hungary has issued a permit allowing the construction of two new nuclear reactors by the Russian state-owned company Rosatom, Hungary&#8217;s Foreign Minister Péter Szijjártó announced on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe reactors are part of a 2014 deal between Moscow and Budapest aimed at expanding the existing Paks nuclear plant, Hungary&#8217;s only operating nuclear power station. \n\n\n\n&#8220;This is a big step, an important milestone,&#8221; Szijjártó said on Facebook. &#8220;We can now move from planning stage to construction. You&#8217;ll see that at the Paks site in the coming weeks.&#8221;\n\n\n\nRussia&#8217;s nuclear industry has not been included in EU sanctions over Russian President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has called for the Russian atomic industry and uranium exports to be included, but the European Commission has not put them in any of the sanctions packages so far. \n\n\n\nThe Hungary Nuclear Energy Authority said that the permit issued this week will pave the way to add two new reactors to the four-reactor nuclear plant.\n\n\n\nLocated in central Hungary, the plant currently generates 40 percent of the country&#8217;s electricity supply. The project is expected to cost $12.4 billion. According to reports, Russia will finance most of the project with a $10 billion loan, while Hungary will pay for the rest. \n\n\n\nThe foreign minister expects the two new units to be operational by 2030.\n\n\n\n“This will ensure the long-term security of Hungary’s energy supply, protect the Hungarian people from extreme price fluctuations on the international energy market, and maintain our efforts to reduce the cost of electricity,” Szijjarto said.\n\n\n\nDespite the war in Ukraine, Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán has irked other European leaders by maintaining a close relationship with the Kremlin. Most recently, he sought to&nbsp;water down&nbsp;some sanctions against Russia.",

        "description": "The primaries in Florida and New York this week marked the final major nominating contests of 2022, and the country’s attention is now poised to shift to the general elections that will determine control of Congress for the next two years.\n\n\n\nPrimaries for both parties stretching from March through this week offered up some key hints about the two main parties and their voters, as well as what the coming fall campaign season could look like.\n\n\n\nHere are five takeaways from the 2022 primaries:\n\n\n\nThe GOP is still Trump’s party — and 2020 is still top of mind\n\n\n\nFormer President Trump may have left the White House more than a year and a half ago, but this year’s GOP primaries proved that he remains the most influential Republican in the country.\n\n\n\nThe impact of Trump’s endorsements was clear: he shaped Republican messaging, scrambled primary contests and elevated to victory candidates that even some top GOP officials had concerns about.\n\n\n\nPerhaps no issue was more important in obtaining Trump’s endorsement than the 2020 presidential election and his false claim that it was rigged against him. Republican candidates frequently echoed that talking point on the campaign trail — with some centering their races around it — hoping to win the former president’s favor.\n\n\n\nThe end result: In most of the nation’s high-profile Republican primaries, voters sided with Trump.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAll of the GOP nominees in the most competitive Senate races were backed by the former president ahead of their primaries. Of the six House Republicans who ran for reelection after voting last year to impeach Trump for his role in the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, only two won renomination.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd candidates who have questioned or flat-out denied the results of the 2020 election will be on ballots across the country in November, having secured nominations for governor, Senate, House and secretary of state.\n\n\n\nOf course, there are a few exceptions. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, for instance, won in a landslide against his Trump-backed primary opponent, former Sen. David Perdue (R-Ga.). And in South Carolina, Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) made it through her primary against Trump-endorsed Katie Arrington.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, if the 2022 Republican primaries made one thing clear, it’s that GOP voters are still overwhelmingly aligned with Trump.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats largely played it safe, but progressives scored some key wins\n\n\n\nDespite ongoing debates over the direction of the Democratic Party, voters across the country largely sided with more moderate or establishment-backed candidates in their primaries, apparently seeing them as their best bets for winning in an otherwise punishing political environment for Democrats.\n\n\n\nIn Ohio, for example, former state Sen. Nina Turner, a progressive former co-chair of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) presidential campaign, lost for a second time to Rep. Shontel Brown (D-Ohio), who had the support of the party establishment. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nLikewise, Rep. Henry Cuellar (Texas), a conservative South Texas Democrat, narrowly defeated progressive Jessica Cisneros in a race that drew intense national attention.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, it wasn’t all bad for the party’s left flank.\n\n\n\nProgressives won Senate nominations in two key swing states. In Pennsylvania, Lt. Gov. John Fetterman beat out Rep. Conor Lamb (D-Pa.), a moderate who cast himself as the candidate better able to court suburban and rural voters, while Wisconsin Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes won the chance to challenge Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.). And just this week, Central Florida Democrats tapped Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a Sanders-backed gun control activist, to succeed Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) in the House.\n\n\n\nStill, this year’s primaries were far from the ideological turning point that progressives were hoping for.\n\n\n\nIt was a tough season for a lot of House incumbents\n\n\n\nThere are still a few primaries left, but 2022 is already on track to see the most U.S. House incumbents lose renomination in more than two decades.\n\n\n\nSo far this year, 15 House members — nine Republicans and six Democrats — have lost their bids to return to Capitol Hill,&nbsp;according to Ballotpedia, which has been tracking the losses.\n\n\n\nIn some cases, the circumstances were simply out of members’ control, mostly because of the decennial redistricting process.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis week, for example, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), a 30-year veteran of the House, lost her primary to fellow longtime incumbent Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) after redistricting combined their Manhattan congressional districts. From the get-go, one of them was bound to lose.\n\n\n\nBut in other races, incumbents suffered from their political choices, most notably, their votes to impeach Trump. That decision spelled the end for Reps. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), Tom Rice (R-S.C.), Peter Meijer (R-Mich.) and Jaime Herrera Beutler (R-Wash.), all of whom were defeated by Trump-backed primary challengers who hammered them for their impeachment votes.\n\n\n\nOthers, like Rep. Madison Cawthorn (R-N.C.), found themselves on the losing end of their primaries after becoming the subject of various controversies.\n\n\n\nDemocrats found their footing\n\n\n\nFor the first half of the year, Democrats were staring down some daunting problems. Their legislative agenda in Congress had largely stalled out, inflation was reaching its highest levels in decades and their main political foil was no longer in the Oval Office.\n\n\n\nTo make matters worse for Democrats, they were also contending with the reality that the party in power almost always loses ground in Congress in midterm elections.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat fact may still hold true. But things have notably shifted for Democrats in the months since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. That decision gave the party a powerful message with which to rally voters fearing an erosion of protections for reproductive rights and helped reenergize Democrats amid concerns over complacency.\n\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest turning point for Democrats came in Kansas, when voters rejected by a wide margin a proposed amendment that would have stripped abortion rights from the state constitution.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince then, Democrats have homed in on a clearer messaging strategy: they’ve warned what GOP congressional majorities would mean for reproductive rights, touted the passage of a massive tax and climate bill and sought to cast themselves as a steady hand in government.\n\n\n\nOf course, while Democrats' midterm prospects appear to have brightened somewhat, they’re still facing a brutal political landscape and strong historical headwinds that could give an edge to Republicans.\n\n\n\nBut Republican voters are still energized\n\n\n\nThe outlook may be brightening for Democrats. But this year’s primaries have still given credence to what Republican leaders have been claiming for over a year: GOP voters are motivated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn top-of-the-ticket races across key battleground states, Republican primary turnout repeatedly outpaced Democratic turnout, a sign that GOP voters are eager to cast their ballots this year.\n\n\n\nIn Georgia, nearly a half million more Republicans voted in the Senate primary than Democrats. In Arizona, more than 200,000 more voters cast ballots in the top Republican primaries. The turnout advantage also holds true in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, North Carolina, Nevada and Florida.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, the higher Republican turnout may not have been due to voter enthusiasm alone. In Georgia, for example, Republicans saw a hotly contested gubernatorial primary, while the Democratic candidate, Stacey Abrams, went unchallenged for the nomination.\n\n\n\nThe same is true is North Carolina, where Republicans were faced with a choice between Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.) and former Gov. Pat McCrory in the primary to succeed retiring Sen. Richard Burr (R-N.C.). Democrats, meanwhile, had already largely coalesced behind Cheri Beasley as their nominee.\n\n\n\nBut Florida’s most competitive race was on the Democratic side, and Pennsylvania and Wisconsin had hotly contested contests on both sides of the aisle.\n\n\n\nAnd for much of the year, public polling has shown that Republicans are more enthusiastic to vote in November than Democrats are. But as Democrats’ prospects have improved, they’ve also begun to close that enthusiasm gap.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Morning Consult poll&nbsp;released last week showed that 65 percent of Republican voters are either “extremely” or “very\" enthusiastic to cast their ballots in the midterm elections. Meanwhile, 62 percent of Democrats said the same.",

        "description": "One of former President Trump’s main claims about the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago is being undermined by Friday’s release of a key affidavit.\n\n\n\nTrump has pushed the narrative that he and his lawyers were cooperating with the Department of Justice’s (DOJ) inquiries about documents from his time in the White House. This, he claims, means that the Aug. 8 raid on his Florida estate was gratuitous.\n\n\n\nBut the affidavit that persuaded a judge to grant the search warrant tells a different story.\n\n\n\nEven in heavily redacted form, the affidavit points out that there was a prolonged process lasting around seven months in 2021 before Trump’s team coughed up any documents at all.\n\n\n\nIt gives a far less friendly account than Team Trump has done of events in June of this year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe former president and his allies have, for instance, described an affable visit to Mar-a-Lago by a senior DOJ official, Jay Bratt, and three FBI agents on June 3. According to a Trump legal filing earlier this week, one of the FBI agents, having been shown the storage room in which some documents were held, purportedly said, “Now it all makes sense.”\n\n\n\nThe same Trump filing refers to a June 8 letter in which the DOJ \"requested, in pertinent part, that the storage room be secured\" — a request that is implied to have been met when Trump told staff to put a second lock on the door.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, the DOJ's affidavit quotes a letter on the same date — presumably the same letter — reiterating to a Trump lawyer that there was no “secure location authorized for the storage of classified information” anywhere at the resort.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe letter makes clear that the DOJ’s request was not some generalized security check-up but a demand for the “preservation” of the storage room in its “current condition until further notice” — phrasing that is far more redolent of an investigation of a possible crime scene than a friendly chat about padlocks.\n\n\n\nThe filing also includes, as an exhibit, a May 2022 letter from Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran to Bratt, the head of the counterintelligence section of the DOJ’s national security division.\n\n\n\nIn the letter, Corcoran argues that presidents have “absolute authority to declassify documents” and that, in any event, no president can be prosecuted for “actions involving classified documents.”\n\n\n\nThose claims are contentious and, again, strike a different tone than the one Trump and his allies have sought to portray.\n\n\n\nPut it all together and the effect on Trump’s preferred narrative of the investigation seems stark.\n\n\n\n“It blows it to smithereens,” Harry Litman told this column.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLitman, a former U.S. attorney and deputy assistant attorney general, focused on the various delays by the Trump side as the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) and then the DOJ sought missing documents.\n\n\n\nThe affidavit seeking the search warrant, Litman said, “is at the end of an exasperating, very prolonged dallying by them that would never be put up with from any other citizen.”\n\n\n\nThe argument that Trump may simply have declassified all the relevant documents also drew the sharpest comment yet from President Biden, who had previously sought to keep his distance from the investigation.\n\n\n\n“I’ve declassified everything in the world. I’m president, I can do it all!” Biden sarcastically told reporters at the White House Friday soon after the affidavit became public. “C’mon!”\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, a footnote in the affidavit made clear that the classification status of the documents in question would not have a make-or-break bearing on at least one of the possible crimes being investigated.\n\n\n\nTrump, characteristically, is pressing on full-bore with his allegations that he is being mistreated for political reasons over the raid.\n\n\n\nHe argued in a Truth Social post Friday that the judge in the case, Bruce Reinhart, “should NEVER have allowed the Break-In of my home.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe further alleged that Reinhart bore “animosity and hatred” toward him.\n\n\n\nYet even while deploying his usual combative rhetoric, Trump still insisted that his side had enjoyed “a close working relationship regarding document turnover.”\n\n\n\nIt’s impossible to square that claim with the FBI’s assertion in the affidavit that investigators had “probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found” in a Mar-a-Lago search.\n\n\n\nThe bureau’s reasons for this assertion remain mysterious, however, given the extensive redactions to the 32-page affidavit.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a related document also released on Friday, the DOJ contended that the redactions were necessary because of the imperative to “protect the safety of multiple civilian witnesses” in the burgeoning case.\n\n\n\nThe department further argued that “the government has well-founded concerns that steps may be taken to frustrate or otherwise interfere with this investigation if facts in the affidavit were prematurely disclosed.”\n\n\n\nStill, information that was disclosed brought a new level of granular detail into the public domain.\n\n\n\nIn particular, it revealed that of the 15 boxes that had been retrieved from Mar-a-Lago roughly one year after Trump left office, 14 contained information that had classified markings.\n\n\n\nIn total, the affidavit said, there were 184 such documents, 67 of which were marked as confidential, 92 of which were marked as secret and 25 of which were marked as top secret.\n\n\n\nThose details alone disconcert experts in the field.\n\n\n\n“While we don’t know what that information pertains to, by its very definition it could conceivably threaten individuals’ lives,” said Mark Zaid, an attorney who specializes in national security matters.\n\n\n\nZaid emphasized that it is not yet clear that Trump himself is the target of the criminal investigation, only that investigators believe evidence of a crime could be found at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nEven so, he warned, “I do think, based on the affidavit, that the jeopardy faced by one or more people continues to rise.\" \n\n\n\n“I don’t know who the one or more people are,” he added. “It could be Mar-a-Lago staff, it could be the president, it could be his lawyers.”\n\n\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage.&nbsp;",

Perhaps, though it would be as much from their members’ activities outside the parent band as because of their own music. Bryce and Aaron Dessner, the twin brothers who play guitar and write the music, have become central collaborators and curators to a whole swathe of American music, running festivals and writing and producing with everyone from Kronos Quartet to Taylor Swift. Evidently, their creative needs cannot be contained within a rock band.It’s not hard to hear why they are so sought after. For all that at one level, the National are an absolutely conventional alt-rock band – a bit broody, a bit euphoric, a bit anxious, a bit triumphant, a bit quiet, a bit loud – there’s something gauzy and unpindownable about them. It is not meant as a slight to say they are Coldplay for those who fancy themselves cool – they, too, communicate emotion as much through sound as words, building moods and offering moments of release when lowering verses erupt into soaring choruses.

        "description": "The Entrepreneur and Social Media Star Plan Aggressive Franchise Growth\n\n\n\nNew York entrepreneur Neil Hershman (top, left) and YouTube star Danny Duncan (top, right) have teamed up on a sweet deal. They are the new owners of 16 Handles, a leading soft-serve frozen yogurt franchise brand that started in New York City’s East Village. While specific details of the deal haven’t been disclosed, Hershman will lead the franchise as CEO, and Duncan will serve as Chief Creative Officer. According to a press release from 16 Handles, the YouTube phenom has more than 1.5 billion views and over $50 million in merchandise sales, which was attractive to 16 Handles founder Solomon Choi.\n\n\n\nChoi started 16 Handles in 2008 to achieve his dream of creating and building a brand. He sees that same passion in Hershman, a multi-unit franchisee with locations in New York City’s Chelsea, Tribeca, Times Square, Murray Hill, and the East Village. In addition to his 16 Handles locations, Hershman opened Captain Cookie &amp; the Milkman, a cookie and ice cream company near New York University’s campus.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChoi believes that Hershman’s passion is what 16 Handles needs to grow as it expands nationally. In a statement, Choi said, “I want to see 16 Handles grow and evolve, and Neil has the right mindset to set lofty goals and put the right plan together, which is exactly the type of leadership the brand needs.”\n\n\n\n16 Handles’ Growth&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to a strong leadership team, Hershman believes that the 30-plus unit franchise can continue to grow and attract franchise partners due to its high-profit margins and low labor costs. He adds that 16 Handles’ key demographic isn’t just children; people of all ages love the brand’s frozen treats. To increase visibility to a wider audience, 16 Handles has also partnered with food and beverage companies like Junior’s Cheesecake and Oatly, as well as the popular Broadway show, Dear Evan Hanson.\n\n\n\nHershman is excited to see new leadership for the brand. “With the new ownership, 16 Handles has both the benefits of an established business, having decade-old stores with continued revenue increases year over year, and a startup, with the ability to test and launch innovative ideas and partnerships quickly and efficiently,” Hershman said in a statement.\n\n\n\nIt’s important for me to invest in a company that has a great product, but also a company that brings people happiness.Danny Duncan\n\n\n\nDuncan looks forward to growing 16 Handles to the U.S. In a statement, Duncan said, “It’s important for me to invest in a company that has a great product, but also a company that brings people happiness.” He adds that he is excited to open a 16 Handles location in his hometown of&nbsp;Englewood, Fla., and assist with the franchise’s expansion across the country.\n\n\n\nMore Behind 16 Handles\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe original 16 Handles location was the first self-serve frozen yogurt shop in New York City when it opened in the East Village in 2008. The frozen yogurt brand, which has 16 different frozen desserts and more, has expanded to over 30 locations. To give back to the community, 16 Handles partners with charitable organizations.&nbsp;",

        "description": "I returned to work this week on Thursday, after three weeks away. \n\n\n\nAt the start of the year I agreed with my wife Hannah that in 2022 I&#8217;d take most of April, August, and December off work. That cadence is working well so far: three months of work followed by (at least) three weeks away. In addition, I do most of my WAO work Monday-Thursday, followed by side projects and finishing stuff up on Fridays, and take both Bank Holidays and the occasional day off in half-terms. All told, I reckon I&#8217;ll do around 200 days&#8217; work this year. This is absolutely a reason why co-owning your own business is amazing. \n\n\n\nA few new bits of work came in while I was away, so I&#8217;ve been following up about those. We should also hear back about the NLnet grant the week after next, but in the meantime David&#8217;s been working away on badge.supply. Things are looking good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs I mentioned last week, I accidentally ran a stop-start half-marathon distance (21km) after getting lost in France. A week later, I thought I&#8217;d have a go at a purposeful, continuous effort and see if I could manage it. I nearly did, managing 18.22km (and all of the uphill sections!) before my hip flexors just couldn&#8217;t take any more. For some reason, I planned a route that included a killer descent and hill climb half-way through. I also set off too fast, at my 10k pace.\n\n\n\nI might try again next week. Oh, and I&#8217;m back on Strava if you want to connect with me there.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTalking of social networks, I switched from fosstodon.org back to social.coop for reasons outlined in the post below. It was one of four I&#8217;ve published here since my last weeknote:\n\n\n\nReturning to social.coopContext collection, not context collapseChronological social interactionFull Internet People\n\n\n\nOver at Thought Shrapnel I published:\n\n\n\nPopulation ethicsConversational affordancesLessin’s five steps and the coming AI apocalypseDealing with mental painThe UK is in crisisDevelopment without critique\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI&#8217;m currently reading Invisible Women: exposing data bias in a world designed for men which Laura bought for me after we discussed it on a recent podcast episode. It&#8217;s incredible, and contains both data and insights that I wish I&#8217;d known when I was younger. Highly recommended.\n\n\n\nTwo of the blog posts listed above are my reflections and favourite quotes from books I&#8217;ve read as well. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur kids don&#8217;t go back to school until a week on Wednesday, so I&#8217;ll be ramping up work next week after the Bank Holiday. We&#8217;re entering into what I&#8217;ve only in recent years realised is one of my favourite months: September. I&#8217;m hoping to do some more microadventuring, like last year!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage created by DALL-E 2 using prompt &#8216;sitting at desk with laptop and coffee digital art&#8217;The post Weeknote 34/2022 first appeared on Open Thinkering.",

She blew away the elders’ alternative and, in a close general election loss, established herself as de facto party boss in a newfound battleground,” the AP reports.\n\n\n\n“That previewed 2020, when Joe Biden put Georgia in Democrats’ presidential column for the first time in 28 years, while Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff captured two Senate seats in early 2021 to give Democrats control on Capitol Hill.”\n\n\n\n“Now Abrams and Warnock top the Democratic ticket together for the first time as the party tries to replicate its success in a tough midterm election landscape. The outcome will again help determine Senate control in Washington and whether Republicans continue to dominate state government in Georgia.”",

The celery is braised to velvet-soft submission, releasing an immense flavour (somewhere between celery, softened shallots and fennel) that no one (and certainly not I) ever thought celery capable of. Traditionally, this stew is made with meat, but I have it on good authority that many Persians now make it using white beans or potatoes. Continue reading...",

Then a chance encounter with one of his former pupils opened my eyes to his dark pastOn a summer evening in the first decade of the new millennium, I had arranged to meet a friend at a gastropub in London. I walked into the large, open-plan room, a crowd already at the counter. There was no sign of my friend, so I went to the bar to get a drink while I waited.“You next?” asked the man beside me. He had traces of silver in his hair, somewhere in his 50s. “No, after you,” I said, before we started to chat. I told him my name. I wasn’t expecting what came next. Continue reading...",

Training at a leading dance school in Bologna, he specialised in Latin dance and went on to become a much-decorated performer, most notably winning the Italian Open Championship in 2012. Three years later he joined the team of professional dancers on Strictly Come Dancing. A five-time finalist, he took home Strictly’s top prize in 2021 – along with a subsequent Bafta win – while dancing with EastEnders actor Rose Ayling-Ellis, the first deaf contestant to perform on the show. After the success of his solo tour This Is Me, he takes his new show, Made in Italy, across the UK in 2023.This photograph was taken by my mother, Rosalba. I was seven and it was a typical summer’s day – I had been to the beach with my family, a fun and simple thing to do when you’re Sicilian. And the bum bag. You have to have a man bag! It was mostly a fashion statement, so I don’t think I was carrying much inside. Probably sweets which, as you can see from my body in the picture, I very much enjoyed, along with lasagne and pizza.

A polo shirt was £15,” she says. “This isn’t a fancy school; this is the comprehensive down the road.”She started thinking about how others managed: “If it was this expensive for us, how on Earth must families with three or four children cope? And that’s not taking into account the cost of living. Food, fuel and energy prices are going up for everyone.” Land, a 53-year-old teacher turned private tutor from Hereford, is not on the breadline. “My husband is a teacher as well,” she says. “We are professionals.

Discussion has largely focused on the spectacle of the F.B.I. finding documents marked as highly classified and Mr. Trump’s questionable claims that he had declassified everything held at his residence.”\n\n\n\n“But by some measures, the crime of obstruction is a threat to Mr. Trump or his close associates that is as much or even more serious.”",

        "description": "In most sweeping histories of the 20th century, Ronald Reagan’s election in 1980 marks the dawning of a new era of American politics, the moment when conservatives finally completed their take-over of the Republican Party and began to remake the country in their own image. According to this narrative, the 30-year period that followed Reagan’s election — often dubbed the “Reagan era” — was defined first and foremost by the Gipper’s relatively sunny brand of conservatism grounded in anticommunism, social conservatism and small-government libertarianism. But there’s another story to be told about the Reagan Revolution — one in which Reagan’s election, rather than marking the start of a new chapter in the history of American conservatism, marks the end of a previous one. In this story, the Reagan era was not a placid period of conservative domination, but rather a time of intensifying ideological conflict over the future of the Republican Party. This is the story that Nicole Hemmer, an associate professor of history at Vanderbilt University, tells in her new book Partisans: The Conservative Revolutionaries Who Remade American Politics in the 1990s&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-da36-dcde-afcf-fbb663a10000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Partisans: The Conservative Revolutionaries Who Remade American Politics in the 1990s, which hits the shelves on Aug. 30. Hemmer, who has written extensively about the rise of right-wing media, begins her story by noting an apparent contradiction at the heart of the Reagan era: “Nearly as soon as Reagan left office, the conservative movement he represented began to rapidly evolve, skittering away from the policies, rhetoric and even ideology that Reagan had brought into office.” As Hemmer writes in the introduction to Partisans, “With each passing year, conservatives looked less and less like Reagan, even as they invoked his name more and more.” What replaced Reaganism, Hemmer argues, was a “more pessimistic, angrier and even more revolutionary conservatism” that shared none of Reagan’s optimism about the future of the country. This new style of reactionary politics found its mouthpiece in the “partisans” of Hemmer’s book: figures like Pat Buchanan, Rush Limbaugh, Ross Perot, Newt Gingrich, Laura Ingraham and Dinesh D’Souza. Although they tapped into older strains of reactionary politics, their project was essentially forward-looking, more ideologically radical and politically ruthless than the Party of Reagan.  Figures like Buchanan have received more attention in recent years as historians and journalists have riffled the pages of conservative history for antecedents to Donald Trump. In Partisans, Hemmer casts aside this Trump-centric analysis: “This book is not a prehistory of Trumpism,” she writes in the introduction. Instead, she explores the rise of the GOP’s radical partisans by looking backward at what they rejected — namely, Reaganism — rather than ahead to what they anticipated. But this more scholarly approach doesn’t mean that her argument is totally devoid of contemporary significance, Hemmer told me when we spoke last week. “Even if Donald Trump hadn’t won the presidency in 2016 — even if he hadn’t won the Republican nomination in 2016 — the changes in the Republican Party had still taken place,” said Hemmer. “Something was in the air, something had been changing, something was visible, even without Donald Trump to shine a light on it.” The following transcript has been edited for clarity and length. Ian Ward: You open the book with the line, “This book began with a puzzle.” What was that puzzle? Nicole Hemmer: The puzzle at the heart of the book has to do with President Reagan and his legacy. He looms so large in the Republican Party and in the conservative movement, and yet it seemed to me as I was studying the conservative movement that he was really the capstone of a movement that had been in motion since the 1950s, and that he really had started to lose his hold over the party pretty quickly [after being elected]. So even as he became more mythologically grand within the conservative movement, the tenets of Reaganism — the idea of American engagement in the world and the idea of an optimistic, upbeat conservatism and big tent Republican Party — all seem to be on the wane. Ward: What were the early signs that Reaganism was being challenged from the right? Hemmer: Even while Reagan was in office, there were some real trigger points. Social conservatism was a really big one. There was a group called the New Right, which was a group of social conservatives who tapped into the [Republican] grassroots and into an essentially fear-based style of politics. They just did not gel with Reagan. They attacked him relentlessly for his appointments, for nominating Sandra Day O’Connor to the Supreme Court, for not going hard enough on abortion or guns. And then ultimately, U.S foreign policy was a trigger point as well. You will not see more brutal attacks on Ronald Reagan from any part of the political spectrum than the attacks from the New Right over his negotiations with the Soviet Union in 1987 and 1988. Ward: Despite their name, the figures from New Right were drawing on older reactionary traditions in the United States, too. What were those traditions? Hemmer: The biggest antecedent is segregation and anti-Black politics. A lot of the energy and the political style of the New Right comes out of the opposition not just to Lyndon Johnson and the Great Society, but specifically to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and ultimately to affirmative action. There’s a real sharpness and meanness to the politics that come up through that. They’re also very tapped into conservative Christian traditions. This is the group that is behind the rise of the Moral Majority and ultimately behind the Christian Coalition, and they are drawing from the older model of prescriptive anti-politics of conservative religious figures in the United States. That tradition goes all the way back to Father Coughlin, but also to Protestants in the 1920s who were trying to prevent people from being able to drink alcohol. Ward: There’s a real sense of Confederate nostalgia within this movement as well — and that’s a point where the New Right comes into contact with Reagan, too. In the book, you cite Reagan calling the Civil Rights Act of 1964 “humiliating for the South.” Hemmer: Confederate nostalgia is core to this politics, and it often gets coded as states’ rights. I think that's the way that most people who follow modern politics think about it now — that you have the Civil War and this Lost Cause nostalgia, but that gets cleaned up into the language of states’ rights. But that really overlooks how close to the surface it was. That Reagan quote is a great line, but also think of the candidacy of George Wallace [in 1968] and how much he was calling on that Lost Cause ideology and blending it into a sense of decline among white Americans across the board. It had as much appeal in places like Wisconsin as it did in places like Mississippi. And then, of course, there’s Pat Buchanan, who is not just going to someplace like Philadelphia, Mississippi, where Ronald Reagan went to start his presidential campaign and which was near the site where three civil rights workers were killed [in 1964]. But Pat Buchanan goes to Stone Mountain, Georgia, which is the Mount Rushmore of the Confederacy. He talks about his Confederate ancestors, and it’s not just the Lost Cause — it’s [the sense] that these are our people, and our work is to defend and protect their memory and to advance their causes. Ward: In historical terms, how do you explain the dissolution of the Reagan consensus and the rise of this even more radical style of conservatism? Hemmer: One of the biggest factors contributing to the fragility of Reaganism was the end of the Cold War. I think in some ways we’ve forgotten how much Reagan was a Cold War president and that the conditions of the Cold War shaped his rhetoric, shaped the policies that he preferred, and really were necessary for the kind of conservatism that he championed. When the Cold War ends, it loosens not just the motivation for conservatives to get involved internationally, but also the motivation for them to champion democracy, which they hold on to a little more lightly after Reagan leaves office. There’s also a massive shift in terms of domestic politics. It had been a goal of conservatives for so long to capture the presidency, and then they had captured it [in 1980], and they didn’t get everything they wanted. They knew that was partly because they hadn’t won control of Congress at that point for something like 40 years. So there is a real refocusing on congressional politics, not just in opposition to Bill Clinton but in opposition to George H.W. Bush as well. And then, importantly, the media environment is changing so rapidly in the 1990s. You have the rise of cable news, you have the rise of new forms of political entertainment in shows like Bill Maher’s “Politically Incorrect,” and you even have the nascent internet. At the start of the ’90s, it wasn’t really possible to have a web browser and to just hop online, but by the mid- to late-1990s, the internet is a huge political player, and it leads to a very different type of politics. Ward: The moment when divisions within the Republican Party become really apparent is the 1992 presidential election, which was pretty unbelievable, even by today’s standards. In the Republican Primary, you had an incumbent Republican in George H.W. Bush facing a serious primary challenge not only from Buchanan but from David Duke, the former Grand Wizard of the Ku Klux Klan. And then in the general election, there was Ross Perot, who won a larger share of the third-party vote than any candidate since Teddy Roosevelt in 1912. What was going on in 1992? Hemmer: I think it speaks to how fractured everything was in the context of massive global and economic change. We think of the end of the Cold War as reshaping the geopolitical landscape, but it also really changed economics and politics in the United States. There is a major recession in the U.S. at the time of the ’92 election, and parts of California that have been propped up by government spending and the aerospace industry had collapsed almost overnight. There was this sense of uncertainty about what the world is going to look like going forward and who is going to prosper and who is going to fail. It’s also at a pivot point in decades of deindustrialization and shifting toward a knowledge economy and a service economy. So things really were in flux, and I think the politics of the day reflect that. Ward: The intensity of the Buchanan challenge and the success of the Perot campaign underscored the political importance of a demographic that social scientists had begun calling “Middle American Radicals.” Who are these Middle American Radicals, and what did the 1990s reveal about their place in the Republican coalition? Hemmer: “Middle American radicals” is a term that was popularized by Sam Francis, who — spoiler alert — becomes a pretty out-and-out white nationalist by the 1990s, and who was an adviser to the Buchanan campaign. The idea was that there were these people in middle America — today, we often call it “the flyover states” — who were generally white, generally Christian of some stripe, and who had been radicalized by the politics of the second half of the 20th century. There was a sense that they were under threat, that they were no longer the dominant demographic, that they were losing power and losing control of politics. But now they were finally rearing up and fighting back. It’s a lot like the Silent Majority that Richard Nixon talks about, but Richard Nixon’s Silent Majority was supposed to be the opposite of radical. They were supposed to be the reactionaries who were holding the center during a period of change and upheaval in the United States. The idea behind these Middle American Radicals was that no, actually, these are the people who want to radically remake American politics. Sam Francis, and later Pat Buchanan, really tapped into those folks. Ward: One of the starkest transformations within the Republican Party that you trace in the book is the GOP’s evolving position on immigration. Reagan, for instance, had fairly liberal, Cold War-era ideas about the free movement of people, but then by the mid-1990s, the GOP has become an avowedly anti-immigrant party. Why did immigration become such a lightning rod for the tensions that were swirling on the right? Hemmer: It was one of those issues that had to be activated. The United States is not a place where there has never been anti-immigrant sentiment, but in the 1980s and early 1990s, it just didn’t register for most people as a primary concern. So we have to think about why politicians were able to put it at the top of the agenda, and a big part of it was linking immigration to criminality and linking it to economic threats and economic competition. Pat Buchanan himself in the mid-1980s was talking about immigration as something that’s amazing for the United States and saying that immigrants were hard workers who pay their taxes, so who cares that they’re not necessarily documented? But that all changed by 1992, when he was connecting immigration to all kinds of lawlessness — including the riots in Los Angeles in 1992, which then-Attorney General Bill Barr was also doing — and suggesting that basically anything wrong with your life is being caused by undocumented immigration, particularly if you’re in Arizona or California. For Buchanan, he increasingly leaned on the non-whiteness of these immigrants as a particular threat. They’re not just a threat to your pocketbook, they're a threat to the continued majority status of white people in the United States. That really becomes the big driver of anti-immigrant sentiment in California and then in the rest of the U.S. Ward: And this was all taking place at the same time that conservative intellectuals like Charles Murray and D’Souza were embracing new pseudo-scholarly varieties of race science. Hemmer: That’s exactly right. These more fixed and pseudo-scientific ideas about race — and in particular about the inferiority of Black people in the United States — became really important to conservatives in the mid-1990s. It sometimes overlapped with immigration, as in the case of Peter Brimelow, who wrote a pretty shockingly racist anti-immigrant tract called Alien Nation in 1995. But when you look at somebody like D’Souza or Murray, what they were adding to their arguments is an older idea about race, which is that Black Americans can’t pull themselves up by their bootstraps [because] they’re in a fixed inferior position — and policy needs to recognize that. That’s different from Ronald Reagan, who wanted to roll back Great Society policies and affirmative action and all those kinds of things, but who didn’t profess this idea of a fixed, innate Black inferiority. Ward: In addition to changes in the substance of Republican politics, the style of Republican politics changed quite a bit during the ’90s as well. You quote D’Souza, for instance, arguing that conservatives needed to be “philosophically conservative, but temperamentally radical.” What drove these stylistic changes? Hemmer: The stylistic changes were driven a lot by particular figures. They were spearheaded by people like Newt Gingrich, who really believed that Republicans needed a rhetorical style that made it clear that Republicans were the good guys and Democrats were the bad guys. And it’s not just “good” versus “bad.” It is “moral” versus “degenerate.” Gingrich would pick the worst possible words — “treason,” “degeneracy” — to attach to Democrats, and he felt like that was important. It also has to do with things like the rise of talk radio. It was in the early 1990s that Rush Limbaugh became not just a national radio host, but a national political leader. That medium of talk radio did drive a lot of that provocative language, [because] it showed that you wouldn't necessarily pay the price for saying something really over the top and offensive. Ward: That darker style of politics was sometimes described in the 1990s as “angry white men politics,” but you point out that these new conservative partisans weren’t exclusively men. What role did women play in pushing the Republican Party to the right? Hemmer: Women do play a leading role, in part because they are members of a new class of pundits that was coming up in the world of cable news and who were learning this more pugilistic style of politics. [Figures like Ingraham and Ann Coulter] were very prominent, thanks in part to an organization called the Independent Women’s Forum, which did a lot to take professional women and move them into a political class and a punditry class where they could become the face of the new American right. People like Helen Chenoweth, on the other hand, represented a different kind of threat. She was a representative from Idaho who was grandmotherly and soft-spoken, but her real extremism was in her ties to militia groups. Part of her district in Idaho was Ruby Ridge, where there was a strong militia presence, and she helped spread all sorts of conspiracy theories about government officials, the Bureau of Land Management, black helicopters, the United Nations and the like. And it was important that she was a woman and that she looked like a grandmother, because she was much less threatening than 30-year-old white male militia members surrounding a government building or yelling at a government official. Ward: How does George W. Bush fit into the story of conservative radicalization that you’re telling? In many ways, he represented the heir to orthodox Reaganism, and it would be easy to point to his presidency and say, “Oh, look, those radical partisans of the ’90s were just a blip on the radar, and the saner, more mainstream conservatism ultimately prevailed.” Why is that the wrong way to think about it? Hemmer: If history had stopped in 2004, that would be a very credible thesis, because Bush really was put forward as the second coming of Reagan. He had that same kind of sunny-sighted conservatism, he was interested in more open immigration, and he was very interested, certainly by the end of his first year in office, in America becoming more involved in the world and promoting democracy. But so much of the Reaganism that he embraced failed so miserably during his second term. The aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and the failure to commit to environmental plans were some of the first signs of this failure. But then, by the end of his presidency, the failures in Iraq and Afghanistan and U.S. adventurism abroad were also becoming clear. And then, of course, the financial crisis, financial deregulation and the giant tax cuts — all of that [added to this impression of failure]. By the end of his two terms in office, he had kind of disproven Reaganism and put the final nail in Reaganism’s coffin. He was the testing ground to see if Reaganism was still viable, and by the end of his presidency, he had shown that it was not. Ward: How did the Democratic Party respond to these changes within the Republican Party? Hemmer: Certainly, liberals during the 1990s were pretty open to the ideas of this new Republican right. One of the things that you see over the course of the 1990s is that the Democratic Party moved steadily to the right. Democratic politicians didn’t back something like Proposition 187 in California, which would have stripped all government services from people in the country without documentation, but they did move pretty far right on immigration, on border security and on the language of demonization around immigration. That’s one of the reasons why I think of the 1990s not as a time of polarization but as a time of right-wing radicalization, because the Democratic Party isn't running away from the Republican Party. Liberals are finding common cause in a lot of ways. In 1995, Bill Clinton and Newt Gingrich are sitting down and starting to talk about overhauling Social Security. So yes, liberals at least are on board with a lot of what's happening. Ward: They certainly weren’t erecting the barricades. Hemmer: No, they were not. Ward: A drawback to other, more Trump-centric approaches to conservative history is that they lend a sense of inevitability to Trump’s rise, and in the process, then they overlook the moments when Republicans consciously chose to invite the more radical members of the conservative coalition into the fold. For instance, you mention the episode in 1992 when George H.W. Bush invited Rush Limbaugh to the White House for dinner, and Bush even ended up carrying Limbaugh’s luggage for him. Hemmer: I think that particular moment where Bush sides with Rush Limbaugh is an important one, as is the omnipresence of Roger Ailes in Republican politics in the 1980s and 1990s. There were alternatives. Colin Powell is such a fascinating case study, because he comes out of a lineage that included people like Jack Kemp, the representative from New York who was often seen as the heir to Reagan. There were moments where Kemp was like, “What are you doing, Republicans? Stop paddling around with radicals and look at this other legacy that we could be following.” Imagine if in 1996, Colin Powell had won the Republican nomination and the presidency, not just as a Black man, but as somebody who was pro-abortion rights. It is a very different party in that case. Today, that seems so impossible. But this is why the Perot campaign was so important. It seems like in the early 1990s, American voters were open to a lot of different possibilities. The country may have ended the decade as being an increasingly partisan and polarized country, but it didn’t start the decade that way, and that sense of possibility is important for making sense of the ’90s. Ward: Trading your historian’s hat for your pundit’s hat for a minute, there’s an analogy to be drawn here with Trumpism. In some senses, Trump has captured the Republican Party today in a similar way to how Reagan captured it back in the ’80s. But as you point out, historians have a tendency to exaggerate the extent of the ideological homogeneity that follows these watershed elections. Are there any fault lines in the Republican Party today that are akin to the fault lines that emerged between Reagan and these partisans in the ’80s and ’90s? Hemmer: There is this “national conservatism” that’s arisen today that occasionally has advocates of a stronger social safety net. [But] at the moment, it’s hard to talk about in terms of fault lines, because it’s such an ideologically unsettled moment. It really does seem like on the policy front, a lot of things are up for grabs. You could imagine a heterodox Republican candidate getting away with quite a lot [in the same way that] Donald Trump got away with quite a lot. The thing that makes it hard to see the fault lines right now is this over-arching loyalty to Donald Trump. We’re talking the day after Liz Cheney lost her primary campaign, and that has nothing to do with her politics outside of her relationship to Trump. I do think we're going to continue to see a kind of moderate-radical divide in the party, but it’s just that the center of that divide keeps shifting over further and further and further to the right. I think that in general, most Republicans really do agree on the direction of policy, but the question is, how hardline and how attached to democracy are they going to be. More than anything, that question of “Are we pro-democratic governance or anti-democratic governance” is the real fault line.",

        "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/08/26/dean-columbia-journalism-school-wrestles-with-place-in-industry-00053522",
        "description": "Everyone is in their back-to-school finest. For the incoming Columbia Journalism School class, this means: a lot of Fjällräven backpacks; some of those little reporters’ notebooks that journalists use in the movies; at least one LA Times-branded mask (is it from a subscription deal or a coveted internship?). Doc Martens abound, so do first-day jitters. A little under 250 new students are masked up and packed into the Joseph D. Jamail lecture hall to hear Dean Jelani Cobb talk about a 118-year-old article that he plucked from the archives. His goal: to get these newly minted J-schoolers to think more clearly about a journalism school’s place in America. The title of the piece, written by founder of the Columbia Journalism School Joseph Pulitzer is “The College of Journalism,” which Pulitzer describes as “a review of criticisms and objections.” And while some of the complaints about the concept of a journalism school feel slightly anachronistic (whether a journalist must be “born” or whether he can be taught) many remain relevant: whether journalism has to be taught in newsrooms, what can’t be taught in a classroom — and whether a “college of journalism” is superfluous. These are a ballooning list of questions that are very much on Cobb’s mind these days as he takes on a job as the public face of the country’s premier J-school. He’s stepping in at a particularly fraught time: Local newsrooms have been hollowed out; the ones remaining are regularly accused of relentlessly chasing clicks and eyeballs, rather than delivering reporting that seeks to educate or hold power to account. Politicians and their fans regularly attack the credibility of the press. (As do some journalists.) Then there’s a worldwide rise in the killing of journalists.     “What is Columbia Journalism School’s role when there are news deserts everywhere?” a new student asks Cobb. “Are we part of the problem?” That's a question he’s still thinking through, Cobb says, but he likes the idea of providing the occasional workshop for underserved journalists. “I know it may be an unsatisfactory answer, but we’ll see how that can be done,” he says. Inherent within his measured answer is Cobb’s growing understanding — officially one month into the job — of what it means to be dean. He’s spent six years teaching at the J-school while also contributing to The New Yorker&nbsp;(a job he will continue), but dean-hood comes with a distinct set of challenges. It’s easy to arrive starry-eyed, imagining the ways you and your students can–and will–change the world. Then comes the fundraising.    An M.S. in journalism from Columbia — all told a nine and a half month program — costs an estimated $121,290. Depending on where you’re looking, a journalist with a master's degree makes on average between $36,000 and $58,000 after graduating. Columbia can offer generous aid packages (73 percent of those who applied for scholarship aid received funding and the median award is approximately $40,000), but its students are also regularly drowning in debt. For many young people with journalistic aspirations, the training that Columbia provides is a luxury they literally cannot afford. Cobb is all too aware of the problem. He told me that he regularly hears from students who have always dreamed of becoming journalists but now worry about how they’ll pay for school or how much of a burden their debt will be. “It’s not a novel idea that we need to find some other way for this to exist,” he says. “We just don’t know what that is right now.”  Jelani Cobb did not attend journalism school himself, an irony of which he’s very cognizant. Born William Anthony Cobb in Queens, New York, he learned to write from his father, an electrician named Willie Lee Cobb who had a third-grade education, but made his children's education a top priority. Jelani says he remembers his father’s large hand engulfing his tiny one in their home as he learned the alphabet.  Cobb was the youngest of four in his family, though the only child his parents had together. He went to Howard University, where it took him seven years to complete his undergrad because he didn't have the money to consistenly pay tuition — he spent much of that time freelance writing and protesting in on-campus demonstrations. (He occupied administrative buildings to protest apartheid and the appointment of Lee Atwater as a trustee of the University.) When he was 19, he changed his middle name to Jelani, a Swahili word that means “full of strength” or “powerful,” for, he says, “a very serious and a less serious reason.” For starters, he wanted to reconnect with his African heritage, a connection that “has been taken away from many Black people in the United States forcibly.” And then there was the problem of his initials: W-A-C. He didn’t want to be “wac(k)” anymore. If his seven years at Howard weren’t enough, Cobb then embarked on a Ph.D. program in history at Rutgers. He credits mentors in undergrad and his love of the physical spaces of college campuses for his continued interest in academia — the high school he attended, Jamaica High School, was designed by the same architects who designed Columbia. Preparing for his new job, Cobb recently stumbled upon his old personal statement about why he wanted to go get a history Ph.D; he wrote that he thought it would make him a better journalist.    Cobb has been ensconced in the world of academia for years, all the while occasionally leaving the classroom to report as well. And his reporting has borne fruit: In 2018, he was a Pulitzer Prize finalist in commentary for “combining masterful writing with a deep knowledge of history and a deft reporter’s touch to bring context and clarity to the issue of race.” Meanwhile, a gas mask Cobb wore while covering the Ferguson protests and the birth of the Black Lives Matter movement is in the Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture. His office is still a work in progress (“a painting issue,” he tells me). His books are boxed up and still in his old faculty office downstairs. The essentials that have made their way up to the dean’s office (which was already replete with a table, desk and some couches) are his elegant road bike — he’s got a clunkier electric one as well, he says — and a photo he took of his daughter Christine, now five, playing in water sprinklers. “My daughter keeps referring to me as ‘the dean,’” he says, laughing. “She thinks that comes with a cape.”  Reporting on the ground and working in academia are not always a natural fit. Hang around certain academic circles long enough and it’s easy to get afflicted with a certain kind of circular thinking. Comparatively small problems all become the result of structural factors out of your control. Example: Journalism school is too expensive. This is especially true given that journalists can’t hope to make much money after they graduate. And it gets worse when you think about where graduates end up right out of school. They either don’t want to or can’t afford to take a low-paying local news job in a smaller city or town — if those even exist anymore. So they stay in New York or Washington. This contributes to the professional networks that drive job opportunities and elite bias in the media. These biases lead to worse reporting, fewer people interested in journalism and fewer checks on the crooks that steal from the poor and give to the rich, who are the ones setting the market on how expensive graduate programs are. Journalism school’s big price tag is actually a crisis of capitalism. For someone proudly on the political left like Cobb, there’s probably little wrong with that logic. He knows these arguments from his decades in academia. But, they can also be paralyzing: If everything requires a total teardown of our broader systems, what do we do while we’re waiting for the revolution? Cobb is eschewing that logic to examine the problem in a way that befits the trade school that he’s been tasked to lead. Journalism school is too expensive. Which means he needs to fundraise to make it cheaper.  Beyond the issue of cost, there is the question of what nine months in this highly intensive place can teach students. Certainly, it can help them build a certain skill set: how to report and interview; how to write clearly; how to file a FOIA request. And it certainly links students into professional networks — and to coveted internships and jobs. Cobb is also laser-focused on historical context, something he says young journalists can easily lack. He wants them to have at least “50 years of working knowledge” in major areas of interest from U.S. foreign policy to Capitol Hill to criminal justice. And though he’s a liberal columnist, he says that students are often “surprised” by his commitment to not imposing personal views on readers. “One of the clichés of Dr. Cobb’s class is, ‘the information you have is not as important as the information you don’t have,’” Cobb says.    I didn’t go to J-school myself, so I decided to take the day I had on campus to soak up what I could from one of America’s preeminent teachers of the craft. “If you had a student who was writing a profile of the new dean of Columbia Journalism School, what kind of advice would you give them?” I ask. “This conversation just became very meta,” Cobb says. He stands at an imposing 6’3”, but in his reporting, he takes a cue from the famously diminutive Joan Didion: “Be small.” “You should not take up space in a room until you want to take up space in a room … [and] ask something the person wasn’t expecting,” he says. “So I think that’s probably a question that would qualify.” It’s not so easy for Cobb to be small these days, and not just because of his large stature. Walking around Morningside Heights with Cobb — where he lives and works — he’s recognized on the street by someone who’s seen him on MSNBC. That happens a lot. At a neighborhood bookstore, Cobb grabs two volumes that he’s preordered: Salman Rushdie’s essay collection, “Languages of Truth” and Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff’s “Midnight in Washington.” Cobb is a man of varied interests, though the California representative’s Republican critics might say both books include magical realism. Returning to Cobb’s office, which boasts views of Columbia’s stately campus, we walk by displays of numerous high-profile awards his school awards, from the National Magazine Awards to the DuPont-Columbia Awards to the Pulitzer Prizes. There are carved busts and painted and photographed portraits of some of Columbia Journalism School’s luminaries, including its previous deans. It’s a whole lot of white guys; Cobb is Black. “The arc of my career has been being a Black person in rooms where there were fewer and fewer Black people,” Cobb says. “That is what it is. But also, why critique it if you’re not interested in actually trying to change it?”  The late journalist David Carr, who gave both Cobb and Ta-Nehisi Coates their first real reporting gigs at the Washington City Paper, once described Columbia Journalism School as “Hogwarts for wizards who type.” Serving as its newest Dumbledore, Cobb hopes to expand the place to be welcoming to more than just the \"pure-blood\" (Columbia already gets much better marks than Hogwarts on the diversity front, to be fair).    Cobb wraps up his welcome address, turning the microphone over to Winnie O’Kelley, Columbia’s dean of academic affairs. It’s almost his birthday, and O’Kelley is armed with a surprise: red velvet cake. (There are cupcakes in the back, too, to accommodate 250 some-odd students and staff). She walks up to the microphone and leads the room in an awkward, off-key rendition of “Happy Birthday.” “I’m totally putting that on my [Instagram] story,” a new student says. Cobb cracks a big smile. He already looks at home in this environment. It helps that he can ply his new students with some free food. Still, he’s resisting the urge to get too comfortable. “I want us to be a pipeline that helps make the [journalism] field itself more democratic. I don’t have any illusions about how complicated that undertaking will be,” Cobb says. But he’s here because he wants to try. Because, after having conversations about inequity in the field for years, now he’s got the chance to mold the school to fit his vision. “You have a conception of what this place is,” he says, “and also what this place could be.”",

        "description": "ALBANY, N.Y. — If you or a loved one have a pot conviction, you could have a new employment opportunity. New York will give you first dibs to sell marijuana, legally. While 19 states have legalized recreational weed, New York is the first to offer its initial dispensary licenses solely to entrepreneurs with marijuana convictions. It’s a move aimed at offering an advantage to people, disproportionately in Black and brown communities, harmed by the war on drugs. “We think that leaning into folks who are not only justice-involved, but have that business experience means that we’re going to find a bunch of applicants who have gone through some significant challenges to still open and operate successful businesses,” Office of Cannabis Management executive director Chris Alexander said in an interview. “We just took a different approach.” Most states have let medical dispensaries be the first to roll out recreational products, which has largely let big fish get bigger. And places like Illinois and Detroit created lotteries or restrictions to promote diverse ownership in their adult-use weed sectors only to see them mired in legal challenges and legislative fixes for years. So, New York — one of the nation’s largest cannabis markets — went further. New Yorkers with past cannabis-related convictions and business experience will get the first chance at Conditional Adult-Use Retail Dispensary licenses. If selected, the state will set up the applicants with a retail location and financing to help develop their storefronts — with shops openings potentially as early as the end of the year. That “social equity” framework, as set forth in in the 2021 law as part of the state Marijuana Regulation and Taxation Act which legalized the drug for adult use, underpins the state’s efforts to ensure those most harmed by the decades-long prohibition of marijuana — and not large multi-state operators — are at the center of New York’s recreational program. The Democratic-led Legislature pushed for the measure as part of the law. But it remains to be seen whether these steps will lead to a truly “equitable” cannabis market in New York, or if it runs into issues that have befallen other states before it.  Efforts across the country to ensure that people disproportionately impacted by the war on drugs are able to reap the financial benefits of legalization have struggled to achieve results due to legal fights, shoddy implementation and a lack of funding for fledgling entrepreneurs. “I think it’s naive to think that everything is going to go exactly as planned,” said attorney Robert DiPisa, chair of the cannabis law group at Cole Schotz, a New Jersey-based firm. “If you look at any other jurisdiction that has attempted to create a social equity-type program, there are plenty of bumps in the road.”  How New York's program will work    The online application portal for New York’s dispensary licenses, which opened Thursday, runs&nbsp;through Sept. 26. (Application periods for other recreational license types are expected in the coming months.) New Yorkers who were convicted of marijuana-related offenses in the state prior to the drug’s legalization — or whose parent, guardian, child, spouse or dependent was — and who have experience owning and operating a qualifying business will be eligible to apply for the licenses. They must also have a “significant presence,” including residency, assets or some other connection in the state. Applicants will be asked to submit information on “true parties of interest,” including partners; documents to prove the justice-involved individual’s eligibility; proof of presence in New York; and tax documents showing they owned and controlled a profitable business for two years, among other things. They will also be asked to select up to five out of more than a dozen regional preferences for their dispensary location in New York. Successful applicants will receive aid from a $200 million Social Equity Cannabis Investment Fund, which was created to help finance the leasing and equipping of up to 150 dispensaries across the state. Social Equity Impact Ventures, LLC, a minority-led investment team that includes former NBA star Chris Webber, was selected to sponsor and manage the public-private fund. Office of Cannabis Management officials said the online application process was designed to not be “overly burdensome” or require the hiring of consultants or attorneys to be completed. They’ve also noted that the $2,000 nonrefundable application and licensing fee is far below the $10,000 fee for New York’s medical program. “All of the things that we’ve identified over the years as barriers to entry, we’re trying to remove,” Alexander said. Kaliko Castille, board president of the Minority Cannabis Business Association, said New York is “one of the best as written legalization efforts out there” because it gives social equity businesses a leg up.  But social equity efforts, even like states like Colorado and California where recreational marijuana has been legal for years, have faced challenges despite grants and training programs. “So many of these states essentially have unfunded mandates where they, well-intentioned in writing the policies, but then didn’t put down the money to actually make sure the entrepreneurs can get access to capital without having to go to a ‘vulture capitalist’ — what I call it [when] people are having predatory deals that are ultimately undermining the entire sort of purpose of having social equity licenses in the first place,” Castille said. Castille pointed to the social equity fund as a unique and “innovative approach” New York is taking to helping marijuana businesses access real estate, which can be both costly and challenging from a zoning perspective. The decision to set aside the first licenses in such a large market for justice-involved individuals also sets New York apart in its effort to achieve equity in the cannabis industry. “Too often those folks are paid lip service but not actually given the opportunity,” he said. Kristina Lopez Adduci, founder and CEO of New York City-based House of Puff, which sells cannabis accessories, lauded the steps New York has taken to remove barriers and prioritize those affected by the drug laws in its initial licensing. But, like Castille, she said it’s too early to say whether those efforts are enough. Adduci, for example, said the $200 million social equity fund “is fantastic, but it won’t move the needle entirely” given the costs of opening and operating a marijuana dispensary. The state, she argued, should ensure these businesses also have access to incubator programs and workforce education. If selected, dispensary applicants are subject to a four-year conditional period in which they cannot sell or transfer their licenses, according to program rules finalized in July. After that, they will transition into full retail licenses. DiPisa, who has worked with clients looking to apply for the licenses, noted that although applicants get to select their preferred regions, they ultimately don’t get to choose the location of their dispensary that they’ll be locked into for four years — even if it’s in the region of their choice. “How much control is the (license) holder going to have on the look and feel of their space?” he said. Trying to create an equitable program    Alexander said the Office of Cannabis Management expects that because New York will provide ongoing support, operators will hold on to their licenses and continue to grow their businesses after the four years. Some, however, have raised concerns that large multi-state marijuana companies could then buy up the initial licenses. Adduci said she hopes New York takes “note from other states who have made those mistakes,” adding that she’s already started to see “predatory deals” emerge. “Predatory deals come across my desk and say, ‘Hey, if you win a license I’ll give you $10 million for it,’” she said. DiPisa argued that a takeover by large cannabis industry operators would “usurp the entire reason for the program” — wanting New York to own its cannabis market. He, however, argued that preventing social equity owners from selling their licenses would also go against the intentions of the program. “The whole point of this is to put them on a pedestal, give them the opportunity to be profitable,” he said. “Why shouldn’t they be able to build a business, realize the ‘American dream’ and sell their business off? It’s honestly something that I don’t know how to make heads or tails of. It’s a hard thing to reconcile because you want both, but you can’t have it all.” That is the line the Office of Cannabis Management is trying to straddle with its regulations. Alexander said New York can’t stop sales from occurring after the four-year period. Although New York is the latest state to move toward dispensary sales, industry observers say the size of its market — and position at the center of world finance — raise the stakes of getting a sustainable cannabis “social equity” program. Alexander said he expects New York to make “new mistakes\" as it rolls out its own equity approach to a state-level legal marijuana marketplace. He also acknowledged that New York’s program will not “solve all the problems” that exist in the cannabis space, like banking challenges. But Castille said that if New York's program can be successful, it “would send a big signal to people.” “New York is a great first stab at the sort of new era of what legalization could look like when fully wrapping social equity into that,” he said, adding that “no matter what comes out of New York, it’s likely to set a new foundation.”",

        "description": "President Joe Biden looked to strike a tricky balance on Iran this week, as he attempts to restore the Iran nuclear deal while reassuring allies that Washington can still push back on Tehran’s malign activities. The two countries have resolved some of the thorniest stumbling blocks in negotiations on reviving the 2015 deal in recent days, and appear headed toward an agreement. But simultaneously, U.S. and Iran-backed forces clashed in Syria this week in several skirmishes that left four militants dead and three U.S. service members wounded. U.S. officials say the attacks in Syria are not related to negotiations over the Iran deal. But the split screen highlights the challenge the administration faces in making progress on one of its top Middle East priorities — bringing Iran back into compliance with the nuclear deal — while Tehran’s proxies continue to foment violence against the U.S. and its allies in the region. “Whenever the U.S. and Iran are close to successful negotiations, actors on both sides try to disrupt them,” said Joe Cirincione, a national security expert and author who formerly served as president of the nuclear nonproliferation-focused Ploughshares Fund. He noted that Israel and elements of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps are opposed to the deal. “The goal is the same: to create a crisis that would make diplomacy impossible, a deal unobtainable.”   In this case, experts said the Biden administration’s strategy — prove it can walk and chew gum at the same time — was effective. “We defended ourselves immediately and we are still in negotiations,” said Mick Mulroy, a former Pentagon official in the Trump administration. Even as officials made progress in nuclear negotiations in recent weeks, Iranian proxies have been increasingly active in the region. In Syria, IRGC-directed militants have intensified low-level attacks against U.S. and coalition positions in Syria, Defense Department officials said. Iran may be trying to use the activity in Syria to gain some leverage in nuclear talks, said Seth Jones, an expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But more important for Tehran is getting U.S. troops out of the Middle East, where Iran has expanded its influence in recent years, he said. “This fighting, the violence right now in Syria is broadly symptomatic of the tensions right now that the U.S. is having with the Iranians,” Jones said. “Some of them are military, some of them are at the diplomatic table.” On Aug. 15, two incidents in Syria caught the administration’s attention: one unsuccessful drone strike in the vicinity of al-Tanf Garrison and one rocket attack on Green Village. The U.S. did not respond immediately but spent several days ensuring that retaliatory strikes sent the right message and didn’t kill anyone. “DoD worked to select a target that would send the message we wanted without further escalating the situation,” a senior administration official said. “They conducted hundreds of hours of intelligence collection to help ensure the strike did not cause casualties while also preparing the ground to respond should the Iranian-backed groups choose to attack again after our strike. It takes time to do this right.” But one senior DoD official — who, like others in this article, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic — said that one reason the response took a few days was for officials to debate the impact on nuclear negotiations. On Tuesday, on Biden’s order, U.S. fighter jets struck Deir ez-Zor, Syria, against bunkers used by groups affiliated with the IRGC. The U.S. military had initially identified 11 targets at the site, but ultimately struck only nine due to evidence of movement near two of the bunkers shortly before the strike, said the Pentagon’s top policy official, Colin Kahl.  The retaliatory strike was designed to signal that the U.S. will defend itself regardless of where negotiations stand on the nuclear deal, Kahl said. “The administration has been pretty clear that in the event that Iran moves back into compliance with the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action], that's in our interest, because it pushes Iran further away from a nuclear weapons capability. But whether the JCPOA is reborn or not, it actually has nothing to do with our willingness and resolve to defend ourselves,” Kahl said. “The strike last night was a pretty clear communication to the Iranians that these things are on different tracks. The response was likely designed to reassure U.S. allies that Washington can still push back on Iran’s nefarious action in the region while negotiating a nuclear agreement, Cirincione said. In fact, top Israeli officials visited Washington this week, as the government ramped up pressure on Biden to walk away from the nuclear deal. Israeli national security adviser Eyal Hulata met with counterpart Jake Sullivan at the White House on Tuesday — the same day the strikes occurred in Syria.   “The U.S. will deny that there is any connection but I’m a superstitious man, I’ve seen this pattern all too often,” he said. “They want to conclude the deal, they have to reassure the allies — this is their way of doing that, and I think it worked.” But the skirmishes did not end there. In retaliation, IRGC-backed militants launched rocket attacks on two separate sites in northeastern Syria, Green Village and Conoco, which wounded three U.S. service members. One U.S. service member was treated for a minor injury and returned to duty, while two others are under evaluation for minor injuries, a statement from U.S. Central Command said at the time. In their initial response, U.S. attack helicopters destroyed three vehicles and equipment used to launch some of the rockets. The militants then attempted to launch additional rockets, but American forces pummeled the position with attack helicopters, gunships and artillery. Altogether, the U.S. military killed four enemy fighters and destroyed seven enemy rocket launchers in the fighting. After the strike, the Pentagon assessed that the latest salvo was over and deterrence had been reestablished, said a third U.S. official. So far, the back-and-forth has not appeared to hold up progress on the nuclear discussions. For one thing, the two sides appear to have moved past the Biden administration’s refusal to remove the IRGC from the Foreign Terrorist Organization list. The U.S. relayed to the EU on Wednesday its response to Iran’s latest comments on the draft proposal. This stage of talks is expected to focus on the final sticking points, related to Iranian demands for economic guarantees and sanctions relief. “We are closer now than we were even just a couple of weeks ago because Iran made the decision to make some concessions,” said John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council. But he cautioned that “a lot of gaps remain. We’re not there yet.” Alexander Ward and Nahal Toosi contributed to this report.",

        "description": "The springtime massacre at Robb Elementary School has set off a renewed scramble to lock down America's classrooms. Texas is distributing tens of millions of dollars to equip schoolhouse cops with bullet-resistant shields and for campus panic alarms. A $50 million Arkansas grant program, approved by the legislature this month, could help schools hire more armed guards. Ohio teachers can now carry weapons in classrooms after a few days’ training under a law Republican Gov. Mike DeWine signed in June. These patchwork efforts to sharpen school security after the killing of 19 students and two teachers in Uvalde, Texas, are overlapping with new federal legislation to create a sweeping effort to tamp down gun violence. The Bipartisan Safer Communities Act promises to send schools billions of dollars to hire mental health care workers and spot troubled students — and build more of the fortifications deployed after attacks in Columbine, Jonesboro, Newtown, Oxford, Parkland and Santa Fe, Texas. But lawmakers, superintendents, educators and parents are confronting a difficult and all-too-familiar challenge as classes resume: How to protect schools without turning buildings into de facto fortresses. \"The rigor and the academics, all of that is important” to parents, New York Commissioner of Education Betty Rosa said in an interview. “But they want to send their kids to school and make sure that they come home. We are looking at safety, not just from the health perspective, but safety for the classroom.” Growing numbers of public schools have brought more security guards, video surveillance and controlled entryways into their buildings during the past decade. Yet federal data show fatal or injury-causing gun attacks occurring on public and private K-12 school property reached their highest level in 20 years during the 2020-21 academic term.   President Joe Biden’s Education Department is at the center of implementing a new school safety response, as communities retread security strategies and civil rights groups join members of Congress to warn of the consequences surrounding the nation’s latest march to secure schools. “I believe we need a new approach,” Assistant Education Secretary Roberto Rodríguez said in an interview. “We know that the best measures that support safety and well-being for our students are not just plans that address safety issues within the school, or that address so-called ‘hardening’ of our schools.” Hardened security is still the defining feature of this year’s back-to-school season. Schools in North Carolina’s rural Madison County have stored assault rifles and door breaching equipment on campuses for school-based police to use in the event of a mass shooting, and staged a large emergency training exercise at the local high school days before classes reopened Aug. 22. Florida’s top school safety voices are meanwhile pushing local school leaders to add to the ranks of armed guards protecting their campuses. About two-thirds of schools use some facet of Florida’s “Guardian” program that allowed campus staffers to carry firearms after 2018’s shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. But Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. and Pinellas County Sheriff Bob Gualtieri want every school district to buy in. “You can do all the things you want to do with curriculum and advance everything that goes on with teaching and learning,” Diaz said in an interview. “But if parents don’t have the feeling that they can drop off their kids and pick them up safely in the afternoon — we haven’t done anything.” Ohio is in the process of distributing $100 million for schools to pay for equipment such as security cameras and automatic door locks with help from federal Covid-19 relief funds. Democratic-led states are also hammering down on reporting for students who could be seen as threats, raising concerns from school security and civil rights experts. Some districts are struggling to find the right balance amid changing political winds. Police-student interactions, for example, are sure to increase in the Fresno Unified School District this fall. The California system removed armed officers from its middle schools in 2020 during the aftermath of George Floyd’s killing at the hands of Minneapolis police. After Uvalde, it's bringing police back to school.    Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom also signed a fast-tracked bill from California’s liberal state Legislature that, starting next year, will require schools to report shooting threats to police. ACLU California’s lobbying arm opposed the effort, forming a rare left-right coalition with the conservative Christian group Real Impact. In New Jersey, Gov. Phil Murphy this month signed a new law requiring school districts and charter schools to set up threat assessment teams by the 2023-2024 school year to help identify “students of concern,” assess those students' risk for engaging in school violence and intervene to manage the risk. New Jersey’s legislature is also considering a bill that would allow county sheriffs to hire and place armed retired police officers in schools to assist with security. New York lawmakers in June passed a law that orders schools to consider using panic alarms as part of their safety plans; similar laws have also been considered in Nebraska, Texas and Virginia. Americans broadly supported having armed police, metal detectors and student mental health screening in the wake of the Uvalde massacre, but not armed teachers, according to a June poll commissioned by the Phi Delta Kappa International education group. Public school parents were also more likely to support the presence of armed officers in schools compared to adults overall. But while nearly 80 percent of school leaders described their schools as extremely or very safe in a recent survey commissioned by the National Association of Secondary School Principals, only 53 percent of students said they felt the same way. Frank DeAngelis, the principal of Columbine High School in Littleton, Colo., when two gunmen killed 12 students and one teacher in 1999, ranks among the educators acknowledging the need for security while pushing for an updated approach. “We continue to hear about these school shootings that happen around our country,” DeAngelis said this month during an appearance at the Columbine memorial. “But how many have been stopped because of things we have in place now that we didn't have back in place prior to Columbine? I think that’s the important thing.” Yet hardware only addresses part of the problem, he said.    “When you have cameras in buildings or metal detectors in buildings, it creates this false security,” DeAngelis said. “Kids have to feel that they have an adult that they can turn to … Because that one adult can make the difference.” Marc Zimmerman, co-principal investigator of the National Center for School Safety, said metal detectors, single points of entry and school officers should be combined with resources that properly flag students in crisis to help them before violent acts occur. \"It makes us feel good, it makes us look like we are doing it, we check the box [and say] this is a safe school because kids have to go through a metal detector, but you might ask the kids in the school who say, 'I feel safe from a gun but I get bullied all the time,'\" Zimmerman said of hardening measures. \"It's a learning environment, so how do we create an environment where kids can learn and not be afraid?\" In places like Fresno and Brooklyn, activists warn Black and Latino students will suffer from something beyond Covid-19’s basic learning disruptions — that more interactions with police and beefed-up classroom security will criminalize groups that are already overrepresented in the country’s prisons. Now members of Congress and civil rights groups are pushing the federal Education Department to set the tone for using resources from the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act. Signed into law in June by Biden after it won swift congressional approval following the Uvalde attack, the law includes $1 billion for grant programs intended to train and boost the number of mental health professionals, counselors and social workers in schools. The Education Department will also oversee the distribution of $1 billion in funding for improving school conditions greenlit by the law. But the law “did not do enough to ensure federal investments are made to promote student care over school hardening,” a group of prominent organizations including the National Education Association teachers’ union, NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and The Education Trust wrote in an Aug. 3 letter to top federal officials.  “School policing and other school hardening practices not only create a negative and fearful learning environment but can also lead to the physical harm of children,” the groups said. Rep. Suzanne Bonamici (D-Ore.) led 13 lawmakers to separately press Education Secretary Miguel Cardona this month for guidance to ensure the law’s funds don’t increase discipline of marginalized student populations, citing research about the drawbacks of “restrictive, hardened and overly-policed learning environments.” Lawmakers also noted the law’s $300 million in funding for a Justice Department school security grant program that can pay for police training, metal detectors and locks. Rodríguez, the department’s assistant secretary, said the agency has met with roughly 20 groups about their concerns as the agency plans new guidance to begin setting out the law’s implementation. “We've heard from some of those groups about the importance of inclusive and nondiscriminatory practices,” Rodríguez said. “We've heard that they're looking for greater clarification around research-based approaches around how to use these dollars, and that they're looking, and very attentive to, the benefit for broader communities — not just school-based violence, but broader community violence that we know impact students.” The federal government’s latest emphasis on school climate and student mental health, he said, haven’t historically been part of the school safety response to tragic events. After nearly a quarter-century of American school shootings, that could change. “That is a different element in the moment that we’re in,” Rodríguez said. “Congress has affirmed that. They’ve made it really clear that [the law] is not just about providing dollars for additional ‘hardening,’ so to speak, but really to support the safety, the health and the well-being of students.” Andrew Atterbury, Blake Jones and Carly Sitrin contributed to this report",

        "description": "Istanbul giants face a febrile test of their new manager’s efforts to restore glory amid a furore over their neighbours’ shirtsAfter their worst Super Lig finish of 13th, Turkey’s most successful club are trying to reignite the flame. The season could not have gone much worse for Galatasaray, and they have returned to their tried and tested method of hiring a club legend as head coach and bringing in ageing foreign players.Such was the failing in the league that they sacked Fatih Terim after a disastrous start to the season. His replacement, Domènec Torrent, lasted six unpopular months in Istanbul. The Spaniard halted the slide, secured a draw in Camp Nou against Barcelona and the players enjoyed his methods but that was not enough to keep his job. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Esfahani and harpsichord take wing in the Italian Concerto while violinist Lisa Batiashvili taps into private passions in Franck, Szymanowski and more• Some musicians go further than others in shaping their own recitals or albums; studying autograph manuscripts; writing programme notes; restlessly questioning the way a familiar work is played. As a solo harpsichordist, aiming to bring the instrument back into the mainstream, the Iranian-American Mahan Esfahani has commissioned new works and revisited old in myriad ways. On his latest album, Bach: Italian Concerto &amp; French Overture (Hyperion), he examines the task of Bach’s engravers and copyists, possible errors that arise, and how the performer should interpret them. The double question of what is authentic and what is musical is at the heart of Esfahani’s always lively and inexhaustible interrogations.Playing a 2018 instrument made in Prague, where he now lives, Esfahani gives grandeur and clarity to Bach’s familiar Italian Concerto. The short opening movement sounds pliant and majestic, the slow movement a sensuous dialogue between fluid, exploratory right hand and the steadying, lute-like left. In the last-movement presto, Esfahani takes wing at top speed and with glittering virtuosity. The colours he brings to all the works here – including the capriccio in B flat “on the departure of his beloved brother” – make us revel anew in the sonic capabilities of the harpsichord.

The outcome will again help determine Senate control in Washington and whether Republicans continue to dominate state government in Georgia.”",

        "description": "Belgium wants London to give explanations over raw sewage dumped in the English Channel and North Sea, joining France in raising concerns over the potential threat to health and marine life. \n\n\n\n&#8220;Under no circumstances should the discharge have an impact on the waters or marine environment of [EU] member states,&#8221; Vincent Van Quickenborne, Belgium&#8217;s minister in charge of the North Sea, told POLITICO on Saturday. \n\n\n\n&#8220;I have asked my services to look into this further and to contact the relevant U.K. administrations about this.&#8221;\n\n\n\nVan Quickenborne added that although the U.K. is no longer bound by EU environmental regulations as a consequence of Brexit, it has to take the necessary measures to limit the impact of sewage leaks on the marine environment. \n\n\n\nThe Belgian minister&#8217;s reaction echoes calls to the European Commission for legal and political action from MEPs of French President Emmanuel Macron&#8217;s party. They&nbsp;warn that in the short term, the leaks could damage bathing waters on the French coast and harm marine biodiversity. \n\n\n\nBelgium&#8217;s North Sea minister said that the dumping so far hasn&#8217;t had an impact on Belgian waters. \n\n\n\n&#8220;For the moment, there is indeed no reason to worry,&#8221; Van Quickenborne said, before emphasizing that the competent Belgian services will contact U.K. services in order to get further details. \n\n\n\nThe complaints come after pollution warnings were issued over the summer for 50 beaches in England and Wales after heavy rain caused sewage overflow to be diverted from overloaded drains into rivers and the sea.",

        "description": "Royal Albert Hall, London; Plush, DorsetA lifetime’s experience tells as Zubin Mehta graces the Proms along with Australia’s finest, while a stellar tag team of friends and colleagues pay tribute to Harrison BirtwistleGliding slowly through the orchestra and across the stage of the Royal Albert Hall to the conductor’s podium, Zubin Mehta, in white tie, tails and high-gloss patent leather shoes, had the dignity and bearing of an ocean liner from a golden age. Of course this 86-year-old, Mumbai-born Indian did not glide at all. He walked with difficulty, with the aid of a stick, but with a graceful determination that inspired welcome cheers from the Proms audience, who were there to hear the Australian World Orchestra make their debut as part of a UK tour.This diaspora orchestra, founded in 2010 and consisting of Australian players from many world-class orchestras, has the energy of a festival ensemble. That they will only have come together to rehearse last week added to the sense of adventure. The first part of their Prom, Webern’s Passacaglia, Op 1 and Six Pieces for Orchestra, Op 6 (revised version, 1928), hardly yielded to the acoustic of the Albert Hall, though listening again on BBC Sounds it came across with subtlety and colour. Debussy’s Ariettes oubliées was sung by the soprano Siobhan Stagg in a delicate arrangement by Brett Dean, the Australian composer and violist who, on this novel occasion, was playing in the orchestra and rose from there to take his bow.

        "description": "Bookmarked What Adults Don't Get About Teens and Digital Life (WIRED)\nWell-meaning messages meant to keep teens safe can backfire. The key is to focus on judgment and agency, not rigid rules for screen time.\n\nIn an excerpt from Behind Their Screens: What Teens Are Facing (and Adults Are Missing), Emily Weinstein and Carrie James talk about teaching teens to build personal agency, anticipating and discussing different dilemmas before they arise, and encouraging collective agency where groups respond to challenges together. \nAlthough I agree with all this, I still think the challenge is how to actually encorporate some of these practices into the day-to-day classroom. I once wondered of a school social space, but fear that such a space probably carries with it too much risk.The post 📑 What Adults Don’t Get About Teens and Digital Life first appeared on Read Write Collect.",

        "description": "CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.—The south pole of the moon is a stunning place. Towering mountains are bathed in perpetual sunshine, and the lunar dust, fine as powder, gleams in unfiltered light. Plunging craters exist in permanent shadow and hide pockets of ice in their gray rock, the water frozen and undisturbed for as long as 3 billion years.It is here, somewhere along this silent terrain, that NASA wants to land a new crew of astronauts. Like those who came before, these visitors will suit up and go for a walk, their bodies bouncing in the low gravity. That lunar stroll won’t happen for a few more years, likely longer. Before people can walk on the moon again, NASA needs to make a reliable transportation system that can hurl them away from Earth and bring them to their destination safe and sound. And the first big test of that effort is happening soon.Next week, NASA is scheduled to conduct the first test launch of the rocket that will someday propel astronauts toward the moon. The rocket, known as the Space Launch System, is the most powerful ever built, and will loft a gumdrop-shaped astronaut capsule into orbit. No people will be on board this first time, only a trio of mannequins covered in sensors. The capsule, named Orion, will go on a journey around the moon and then back to Earth, where it must survive a fiery reentry through the planet’s atmosphere for a splashdown at sea.The test run is the first in a series of moon missions, each one more complex and riskier than the last, that is meant to foster a sustained lunar program unlike any before. NASA plans to make the first landing attempt of America’s modern moon effort in 2025, and has made it a point that the crew will include—unlike the all-male, all-white Apollo groups—a woman and a person of color.You could be forgiven for not knowing that any of this is happening. Most Americans are probably unaware that NASA has such ambitious moon plans, let alone that the rocket developed for the job has a name. (The Space Launch System is not exactly the snazziest brand; the “Mega Moon Rocket,” which NASA officials occasionally use instead, might be catchier.) Even the program’s more evocative designation—Artemis, for the sister of Apollo in Greek mythology—is not yet a household term. You might be thinking, NASA already went to the moon over 50 years ago. What is it going to do there this time?The agency has big dreams for this next chapter of America’s lunar life, bigger than Apollo. It doesn’t just want to re-create Neil Armstrong’s famous first step with a new cast of characters—though it will certainly do that—but also reach for new firsts, including a space station in orbit around the moon and perhaps even a base on the surface. The Artemis program is a difficult, complicated endeavor, with risks and uncertainties at every turn. As NASA tries to outshine its own past, it must also carve out a new place for itself in a changed spaceflight landscape, with commercial rockets in the skies. But the United States has committed to this new moon future, and the inaugural launch of the Space Launch System could capture the public’s imagination and convince Americans to care about it—or at least to tune in.The first Apollo missions landed near the moon’s equator, where the lighting was better, and flatter plains served NASA’s objective at the time: putting human beings safely on the surface. Later missions remained near the equator, but touched down on more mountainous landscape, with different terrain to explore. By Apollo 17, the sixth and final lunar landing, the American public’s interest in the program, measured in TV viewership, had waned. The networks cut in for the big L moments—launch, liftoff, and landing—but “pictures, no matter how incredibly good their technical quality, of barren moonscapes and floating astronauts become ordinary and even tedious rather quickly,” The New York Times’ TV critic wrote in 1972.By then, the space race was over. The first triumphant landing had created enough momentum—and equipment—for several more, “but there was no reason to keep going once the race was won,” John Logsdon, a longtime space historian and the founder of the Space Policy Institute, at George Washington University, told me. President Richard Nixon directed NASA to focus the human-spaceflight program on building a fleet of space shuttles for Earth orbit; no president made a real push for a lunar comeback until George W. Bush in 2004.By then, the plump budgets that fueled the Apollo program had vanished, and space programs were unlikely to survive presidential transitions. Barack Obama canceled Bush’s moon project, but left in place the plans for the heavy-lift rocket capable of carrying people to deep space that would use leftover space-shuttle engines and boosters. The Space Launch System has received bipartisan support since, even while falling years behind schedule and billions of dollars over budget; the program involves thousands of jobs in every U.S. state. The Artemis label is a recent addition; Donald Trump’s administration came up with it, and the Biden administration has since embraced the branding.Per NASA’s current plans, the next decade of spaceflight would unfold like this: The Space Launch System takes off this month, and then the Orion capsule performs well. Next year, astronauts will make the same trip, looping around the moon as the Apollo 8 astronauts once did in 1968. In 2025, another mission would actually land. The Space Launch would launch about once a year. Construction would begin for a small space station in orbit around the moon. More landings would follow, with stops on the floating outpost on the way down. Then, by 2030, NASA aims to have built a habitat on the surface—the first in human history—with rovers and cozy-enough infrastructure to support missions for a week or longer. Every step of the way, astronauts, many of whom will be scientists, will learn more about Earth’s celestial companion.Of course, there’s the plan, and then there’s reality. Most government space projects miss their self-imposed deadlines, so don’t schedule your 2025 moon-landing party yet. And the architecture of the Artemis program is extremely complicated, with many moving parts. Unlike the Apollo command module, for instance, the Orion capsule doesn’t come with a lander. The Artemis lander will have to travel separately to the moon, rendezvous with Orion, and then take astronauts to the surface. SpaceX is already developing that technology for NASA, but a report by the space agency’s inspector general has described the timelines on the effort as “unrealistic.” NASA is also behind schedule on pressurized spacesuits for moonwalks; after 15 years of struggling to develop the garments in-house, the agency just this summer contracted two aerospace companies to do the work.Since the Apollo era, NASA has always relied on relationships with private companies to get its work done, but in the Artemis era, it doesn’t just have collaborators, but competition too. In many discussions of the Space Launch System’s long-term future, there’s a rocket-shaped elephant in the room: Elon Musk’s Starship. SpaceX is constructing a powerful rocket that, like the Space Launch System, is designed to launch people toward the moon and Mars. If there’s a new kind of space race in the 2020s, SpaceX is winning. The Space Launch System is an expendable vehicle, which means that next week, after a successful launch, the system’s main core and side boosters, depleted of propellant, will end up in the ocean. The SpaceX rocket will be reusable, and Musk has said that a prototype could reach orbit for the first time later this year. And NASA needs Starship to prove itself for the Artemis architecture to succeed; SpaceX’s moon lander will need help from Starship rockets to reach lunar orbit and check in with the Orion capsule.A scenario in which NASA’s moon rocket stumbles through its first tests while SpaceX’s version soars is not entirely outlandish. And even if both succeed, “if you’re having a Starship flying, you’re probably not going to be able to continue spending billions of taxpayer dollars to compete,” Lori Garver, a former deputy NASA administrator and author of the memoir Escaping Gravity: My Quest to Transform NASA and Launch a New Space Age, told me.At the moment, though, the Space Launch System is on the launchpad, the only available rocket that can pull off what NASA wants to do right now. The flawless launch of a brand-new moon rocket would vindicate NASA’s approach to spaceflight, and it would send a compelling signal of American power. A failure, in contrast, would be an embarrassing setback to an over-budget, behind-schedule government program. “We’re counting on a lot of things to come together, and I think in a test flight where, if it’s not 100 percent successful, NASA has to regroup and have another test flight,” Garver said. “And that has the potential to dislodge the whole program.”But it won’t necessarily doom the entire endeavor. “Once large human-spaceflight programs hit a tipping point of expenditures and political buy-in, they have serious inertia that carries them forward—assuming no catastrophes,” Casey Dreier, a senior space-policy adviser at the Planetary Society who has written extensively on Artemis’s political backdrop, told me. If Starship succeeds, it could, in theory, carry the program’s dreamier goals to realization; even if the Space Launch System begins to flounder, members of Congress could remain keen to protect the project (and its associated jobs). The public might remain skeptical, or simply uninterested, but one way or another, America is heading back to the moon.The last time NASA tested a brand-new moon rocket was in November 1967. The first flight of the Saturn V, named Apollo 4, “marked the culmination of more than seven years of developmental activity in design, fabrication, testing and launch-site preparation by tens of thousands of workers in government, industry and universities,” a NASA report from the 1970s said. The Space Launch System took a few more years than that to reach the launchpad, but it will depart from the same spaceport next week: the Kennedy Space Center, along the coast of Florida. In many ways, the atmosphere there hasn’t changed much since Apollo 4; astronauts are still flying T-38s over Cape Canaveral, whizzing past the launchpads.In other ways, it is unrecognizable. Facilities for SpaceX and Blue Origin, Jeff Bezos’s space company, are sprinkled along the coast. Bezos has plans for a heavy-lift rocket too, a vehicle named New Glenn, named after the first American to orbit Earth, but that project is at least a year behind Musk’s. (Blue Origin had also competed for the coveted lunar-lander contract, but lost to SpaceX.) The space entrepreneurs have brought their billionaire-size baggage into space exploration, prompting questions about whom space is for—and why we bother to go at all, let alone dream of building space stations or temporary homes in stark places, hostile to human life. “I think the most compelling argument is that we’re human, and that’s what at least some humans do,” said Logsdon, who attended the Apollo 11 launch in 1969. “There is, I think, a desire to see what’s out there and, in a sense, expand the human experience.”NASA will, no doubt, capture some attention when the rocket takes off on Monday, and certainly a few years from now, when astronauts may be sitting on top of it. Perhaps this time, after a few moon landings, the program won’t disappear as Apollo did. Maybe future generations will tire of the constant dispatches from the lunar surface as that TV critic said they had back in 1972. We are still far from that future, and further still from the future that, based on recent Earth-based research, suggests “astronauts may one day drink water from ancient moon volcanoes.” And the idea of astronauts sipping anything on Mars, which NASA wants to explore, too, is even more distant. But the hope of any off-world future starts on a launchpad, like the one at least some of us will be watching next week.",

        "description": "Kyle Ross-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  A couple of long balls made the score respectable, but the game still ended in a loss.  The Pittsburgh Pirates are losing, losing, and losing down the stretch, as three home runs couldn’t save them in Friday night’s game against the Philadelphia Phillies on their way to a 7-4 defeat.\nThe Phillies got off to a fast start, getting four runs in the first inning off of starter Bryse Wilson, who was completely ineffective. He quickly loaded the bases and gave up a two run single to Bryce Harper to get the scoring going and only lasted a single inning, giving up four runs on five hits with no walks and a strikeout. \nThe Phillies would extend it to 6-0 in the second inning with two runs off of Zach Thompson, including one due to a Kevin Newman throwing error, putting the Bucs in a huge early hole.\nThen the long balls started for Pittsburgh. First, they got a two-run shot from Bryan Reynolds in the fourth, his 21st homer of the year.\n\n\nBryan Reynolds 21st Homerun of the Season #LetsGoBucs pic.twitter.com/BIoOKA3agu— Homeruns MLB (@homers_mlb) August 27, 2022\n\n\n\nRodolfo Castro then followed that up with a solo shot in the fifth. \n\n\nRodolfo Castro 4th Homerun of the Season #LetsGoBucs pic.twitter.com/Ujna7N7JBW— Homeruns MLB (@homers_mlb) August 27, 2022\n\n\n\nAnd the Ben Gamel also had a solo shot, this one in the seventh, to bring the Bucs to within two runs. \n\n\nBen Gamel 6th Homerun of the Season #LetsGoBucs #Pirates pic.twitter.com/kIzLNLOc2G— Homeruns MLB (@homers_mlb) August 27, 2022\n\n\n\nThe Bucs would get no closer, however, as Jason Delay grounded into a double play later that same inning to end another scoring threat, and the Phillies would add another run in the eighth off of Yohan Ramirez to get to your final tally. \nCastro and Newman were your multi-hit Buccos, both going 2-for-4, while Zach Thompson wasn’t awful out of the bullpen, going five innings, giving up two runs (one earned) on four hits after Wilson was chased. \nThe Bucs have now lost five games in a row, but will look to get back into the win column again tonight in Philadelphia.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3617275-why-is-it-so-difficult-to-achieve-a-soft-economic-landing/",
        "description": "Larry Summers is worried that the economy faces a hard landing as the Federal Reserve attempts to bring inflation under control. The former Treasury secretary&nbsp;recently said, “My worst fear would be that the Fed will continue to be suggesting that it can have it all in terms of low inflation, low unemployment and a healthy economy.” Many other pundits also warn that the economy is on the edge of recession. While a recession is not inevitable, history shows that soft landings are difficult to achieve.\n\n\n\nLet’s look at some background before getting into the specifics of our situation. During an economic recovery, the unemployment rate gradually declines. A useful definition of a soft landing would be a period of at least three years of economic growth with low inflation even after the labor market has full recovered from recession. Surprisingly, there is no evidence that the United States has&nbsp;ever&nbsp;achieved a soft landing, at least as far back as we have economic data.\n\n\n\nIn the United States, a recession almost always occurs within two years of the unemployment rate recovering from the previous recession. Instead of leveling off at “full employment,”&nbsp;unemployment&nbsp;almost always begins rising sharply soon after reaching its&nbsp;natural rate.\n\n\n\nThe closest that the United States has come to a soft landing was 1966-69, when unemployment leveled off in the 3.5 percent to 4 percent range for almost four years. Unfortunately, inflation took off during that period. An extended period of both low unemployment and stable prices seems as elusive as a unicorn.\n\n\n\nOddly, this is not the case in other countries, where soft landings are not particularly unusual. Japan has had extended periods of very low unemployment and low inflation. A notable example of a soft landing occurred in&nbsp;Britain&nbsp;during 2001-08, when unemployment stayed in the 4.7 percent to 5.5 percent range for seven years and inflation remained relatively low.&nbsp;Australia&nbsp;had no official recessions between 1991 and 2020.\n\n\n\nIn some respects, the challenge facing the Fed is even greater than during the past few business cycles, as for the first time since the 1980s it allowed nominal spending growth for the overall economy to dramatically exceed the rate consistent with its 2 percent inflation target.\n\n\n\nOver the past two years,&nbsp;nominal GDP&nbsp;has grown at roughly 13 percent per year. During the first year of recovery from the COVID-19 shutdown, fast growth in nominal spending was justified by the need to recover from a deep slump. But in late 2021, spending began overshooting the previous trend line, causing inflation to rise dramatically.\n\n\n\nTo get inflation back to the &nbsp;2 percent target, nominal spending growth must slow to less than 4 percent per year, which would account for the economy’s trend rate of real GDP growth, which has fallen below 2 percent. But if the Fed were to immediately slow spending growth to such a rate, the economy would almost certainly fall into recession. Nominal wages are still rising rapidly, and if business cannot pass along those wage increases in the form of higher prices, then businesses would sharply reduce employment.\n\n\n\nThe best way to avoid this dilemma would have been to keep the economy from overheating in the first place. That might have been done if the Fed had interpreted its “flexible average inflation target” (FAIT) of 2 percent in a symmetrical way — promising to make up for both inflation undershoots and overshoots. Unfortunately, it ended up with an asymmetric FAIT policy, only committing to make up for inflation undershoots.\n\n\n\nThus, it is now too late to avoid the need to attempt a highly difficult soft landing. If the economy were an airplane, it is coming in much too fast, leaving little margin for error.\n\n\n\nThe Fed’s best hope is to gradually slow nominal GDP growth, perhaps to a 5 percent rate over the next 12 months, and a 4 percent rate over the subsequent year. If we were to escape with a mini-recession (roughly 5 percent unemployment) and 2 percent inflation by 2024, it might not count as a soft landing, but by historical standards we will have escaped high inflation with relatively little damage.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, not only has the United States never had a true soft landing; we’ve never had a mini-recession. When unemployment begins rising during an economic slowdown, it always increases by at least 2 full percentage points. In contrast, mini-recessions often occur in foreign countries. The Fed needs to do a better job of steering a course between too much stimulus and too little.\n\n\n\nScott&nbsp;Sumner&nbsp;is the Ralph G.

        "description": "Comedian and HBO host Bill Maher discussed the subject of college affordability on his show, \"Real Time With Bill Maher,\" arguing that attending a higher education institution was “a giant scam.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe comments came as part of a larger discussion with Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and filmmaker Rob Reiner about President Biden's plan to forgive some student loan debt, which was announced this week. \n\n\n\nMaher argued that college is a “consumer product that they’re selling you as a golden ticket” to reach the upper middle class, but it is unnecessary for most people. He said pushing American students to go to college for most jobs that do not require an undergraduate degree is a scam.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said he has spoken to nurses, administrators and teachers about their complaints that they need to attain another degree once they reach a certain point in their careers. \n\n\n\n“They all have this complaint that at a certain point they need more ‘education’ to advance in their career, when really, they know exactly what they’re doing,” Maher said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden announced on Wednesday that the federal government will forgive up to $10,000 in federal student loans for borrowers making less than $125,000 annually. It will also forgive up to $20,000 for those making less than $125,000 and who received a Pell Grant. \n\n\n\nMaher said Democrats believe education is the solution to “everything,” as Republicans do with tax cuts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMaher stated that a \"vast majority of Americans\" didn't go to college, and therefore, do not have student loan debt. He mentioned to Klobuchar that some Democrats are divided on the issue of student loan debt forgiveness.  \n\n\n\n\"Where are you on that one?\" he asked the senator. \n\n\n\nKlobuchar said Biden’s plan is targeted to people who are making less per year, and most of the money goes to people making less than $75,000 annually.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe said the plan will help nurses, teachers and electricians, and many people have community college loans. But, she added, she would have tied the debt forgiveness specifically to the hard-to-fill jobs, like those in health care and assisted living.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If people will go into those jobs instead of being hedge fund managers, then we could actually put the loan repayment help and have it connect to people going into the jobs that we need to fill,” Klobuchar said. “I think that would be a way to do it, but I do think it’s important for people to understand, this is a targeted program that he put out.”",

        "description": "Last year I began a side-line as a radio presenter for Teacher Hug Radio, a new internet radio station for teachers created by Paul *When the Adults Change* Dix.\n\n\n\nI loved doing my show and there is more information about it here: https://lenabellina.wordpress.com/2021/08/07/the-i-factor-in-your-wellbeing/\n\n\n\nThis summer and after over a year on air,  I made the difficult decision to take a pause from the show in order to follow my own wellbeing advice and give myself a reasonable chance of having enough time and energy to devote to my new role as a head teacher of two primary schools. \n\n\n\nYou can still listen to my back catalogue via the Teacher Hug listen again facility if you are keen to get the I Factor back into YOUR wellbeing. Time may have passed but the key message doesn’t: YOU matter and YOU need to do what works for you so that you can give those around you and yourself the health and happiness that we all deserve. \n\n\n\nThere is one story that I didn’t get to amplify on the show from a very dear friend and colleague who has been a tireless advocate for promoting well-being and mental health, Head Teacher Caroline Fothergill. \n\n\n\nI was absolutely shocked to get a response to a tweet last week that alerted me to the fact that she recently suffered a stoke and is now off work from her role as head teacher. When I contacted her to ask more, she requested that I share her story and reflections so that others might learn from what she has been through.\n\n\n\nThis blog post is therefore written so that you can hear Caroline’s voice and the words below are hers. Get well soon, my lovely friend and I look forward to more antics and laughs with you very soon… whether it’s telling inspectors why learning about rainforests in a Scottish schools is not an infringement of any rules….or tracking down car keys between school and Tesco!!!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1. Those closest to you love you &#8211; and they love you deeply and unconditionally . They want you not just be in the world but be in their world. You have a responsibility to them to look after yourself. They need you as part of their landscape. \n\n\n\n2. Taking yourself to the limits , irrespective of the altruistic reasons that motivate you , is misguided and counterproductive. Every extra hour, day, week spent in your school beyond what is needed or required will lead you to an exhaustion where your body will turn against you and shout “ enough!” \n\n\n\n3. You can give of yourself to the children and young people you work with, but you must not give up yourself. \n\n\n\n4. Kindness is the salve to your soul. I am humbled and somewhat overwhelmed by those who have reached out to me. Vulnerability is ok- it’s the understudy to your leading role and yet equally as important. \n\n\n\n5. Relationships are all. I had a difficult experience with a hospital physician who dismissed me and told me I had a psychogenic headache. Walk that road with people- and never ever forget how you make people feel. Compassion as well as competence. \n\n\n\n6. Stop and notice the beauty of this world and those in it. Be full of hope because nothing and no one is guaranteed. \n\n\n\n7.Keep on laughing . I have laughed so much this past month with my family and friends &#8211; usually at my expense! Laughter is good for the soul. \n\n\n\n8. The wee small hours when thoughts become worries, can be lonely but rest assured they pass and every day is a new dawn and a new opportunity. \n\n\n\n9. Other people can step into your role. They might not do things your way but they deserve the opportunity to try out their own shoes. Your shoes are not there to fill &#8211; you will need them for your own journey, wherever that may take you. \n\n\n\n10. Forgive yourself when you have made the wrong choice, said the wrong word, responded in the wrong way. Afford others that same forgiveness",

        "description": "This story first appeared at ProPublica. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.\n\n\n\nThe western United States is, famously, in the grips of its worst megadrought in a millennium. The Colorado River, which supplies water to more than 40 million Americans and supports food production for the rest of the country, is in imminent peril. The levels in the nation’s largest freshwater reservoir, Lake Mead, behind the Hoover Dam and a fulcrum of the Colorado River basin, have dropped to around 25% of capacity. The Bureau of Reclamation, which governs lakes Mead and Powell and water distribution for the southern end of the river, has issued an ultimatum: The seven states that draw from the Colorado must find ways to cut their consumption — by as much as 40% — or the federal government will do it for them. Last week those states failed to agree on new conservation measures by deadline. Meanwhile, next door, California, which draws from the Colorado, faces its own additional crises, with snowpack and water levels in both its reservoirs and aquifers all experiencing a steady, historic and climate-driven decline. It’s a national emergency, but not a surprise, as scientists and leaders have been warning for a generation that warming plus overuse of water in a fast-growing West would lead those states to run out.\n\n\n\nI recently sat down with Jay Famiglietti, the executive director of the Global Institute for Water Security at the University of Saskatchewan, to talk about what comes next and what the public still doesn’t understand about water scarcity in the United States. Before moving to Canada, Famiglietti was a lead researcher at NASA’s water science program at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, and a member of the faculty at the University of California, Irvine. He pioneered the use of the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment satellites to peer into the earth’s mass and measure changes in its underground water supplies. The Colorado River crisis is urgent, Famiglietti said, but the hidden, underground water crisis is even worse. We talked about what U.S. leaders either won’t acknowledge or don’t understand and about how bad things are about to get.\n\n\n\nOur conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\n\n\nLet’s start with the Colorado River because it’s in the news. The federal government has put some extraordinary numbers out there, suggesting water users cut between 2 and 4 million acre-feet of water usage starting this year — roughly 40% of the entire river’s recent flow. How could that possibly happen?\n\n\n\nIt’s going to be really hard. We’re looking at drastically reduced food production and the migration of agriculture to other parts of the country and real limits on growth, especially in desert cities like Phoenix. My fear is that groundwater will, as usual, be left out of the discussion — groundwater is mostly unprotected, and it’s going to be a real shit show.\n\n\n\nRemind us how that happens. States and farmers cut back on the Colorado River, and California and Arizona just start pumping all the water out of their aquifers?\n\n\n\nYeah. This started with the drought contingency plan [the 2018 legal agreement among the states on the Colorado River]. Arizona had to cut nearly 20% of its Colorado River water. To placate the farmers, the deal was that they would have free access to the groundwater. In fact, something like $20 million was allocated to help them dig more wells. So, it was just a direct transfer from surface water to groundwater. Right away, you could see that the groundwater depletion was accelerating. With this latest round, I’m afraid we’re just going to see more of that.\n\n\n\nSome of that groundwater actually gets used to grow feed for cattle in the Middle East or China, right? There’s Saudi-owned agriculture firms planting alfalfa, which uses more water than just about anything, and it’s not for American food supply. Do I have that right?\n\n\n\nThere’s been other buyers from other countries coming in, buying up that land, land grabbing and grabbing the water rights. That’s happening in Arizona.\n\n\n\nWhat about in California? Groundwater depletion has caused the earth to sink in on itself. Parts of the Central Valley are 28 feet lower today than they were a century ago.\n\n\n\nCalifornia passed the Sustainable Groundwater Management Act in 2014, which mandated an extraordinarily long time horizon: two years to form the Groundwater Sustainability Agencies and then five years for each GSA to come up with its sustainability plan. So that’s now: 2022. And then 20 years to come into sustainability. My fear is that the slow implementation will allow for too much groundwater depletion to happen. It’s sort of the same old, same old.\n\n\n\nBut could it work?\n\n\n\nI don’t think we’re talking about sustainability. I think we’re talking about managed depletion. Because it’s impossible to keep growing the food that we grow in California. It’s agriculture that uses most of the groundwater. The math just isn’t there to have sustainable groundwater management. If you think of sustainability as input equals output — don’t withdraw more than is being replenished on an annual basis — that’s impossible in most of California.\n\n\n\nWill we run out of water? Are we talking about 10 years or 100 years?\n\n\n\nYes. We are on target to. Parts of the Central Valley have already run out of water. Before SGMA, there were places in the southern part of the valley where I would say within 40 to 50 years we would run out or the water is so saline or so deep that it’s just too expensive to extract. SGMA may slow that down — or it may not. I don’t think the outlook is really good. Our own research is showing that groundwater depletion there has accelerated in the last three years.\n\n\n\nThen what happens? What does California or Arizona look like after that?\n\n\n\nIt looks pretty dry. Even among water users, there’s an element that doesn’t understand that this is going to be the end for a lot of farming. Farmers are trying to be really efficient but also magically want the supply of water to be sustained.\n\n\n\nWe focus on the big cities like Phoenix and Las Vegas, but it’s farms that use 80% of water. They grow crops that provide huge amounts of the winter fruits and vegetables and nuts for the entire country. Is there any way that farming in California and Arizona can continue even remotely close to how it is today?\n\n\n\nI don’t think so. It has to drastically change. We’ll need wholesale conversion to efficient irrigation and different pricing structures so that water is better valued. We’ll need different crops that are bred to be more drought tolerant and more saline-water tolerant. And we’ll probably have a lot less production.\n\n\n\nWhat does that mean for the country’s food supply?\n\n\n\nThis is the big question. I don’t want to be flippant, but people don’t understand the food-water nexus. Do we try to bring more water to the southern high plains, to Arizona, to California, because if the food system’s optimized, maybe that’s the cheapest thing to do? Or does agriculture move to where the water is? Does it migrate north and east? It’s not just food production. What about the workers? Transportation? If we were to move all of our agriculture to northern California, into Idaho, into North Dakota over the next decade, that’s a major upheaval for millions and millions of people who work in the ag industry.\n\n\n\nIt’s really interconnected, isn’t it? The nation essentially expanded West beginning in the 19th century in order to build a food system that could support East Coast growth. The Homestead Act, the expansion of the railroads, was partially to put a system in place to bring stock back to the meat houses in Chicago and to expand farming to supply the urban growth in the East.\n\n\n\nI don’t think a lot of people really realize that, right? When I go to the grocery store in Saskatoon, my berries are coming from Watsonville, California. The lettuce is coming from Salinas, California.\n\n\n\nFarmers in the West are fiercely independent. So, in California, Arizona, do they lose the ability to choose what to plant?\n\n\n\nRight now, there’s freedom to plant whatever you want. But when we look out a few decades, if the water cannot be managed sustainably, I don’t actually know. At some point we will need discussions and interventions about what are the needs of the country? What kind of food? What do we need for our food security?\n\n\n\nLet’s discuss California. Its governor, Gavin Newsom, has advanced a lot of progressive climate policies, but he replaced the water board leader, who pushed for groundwater management across the state, and last month the agency’s long-serving climate change manager resigned in protest of the state’s lax water conservation efforts. What does it mean if a liberal, climate-active governor can’t make the hard decisions? What does that say about the bigger picture?\n\n\n\nThere has been a drop off from the Jerry Brown administration to the Newsom administration. Water has taken a step lower in priority.\n\n\n\nIs that a sign that these problems are intractable?\n\n\n\nNo. It’s a sign that it’s just not as high a priority. There are tough decisions to be made in California, and some of them won’t be popular. You can see the difference between someone like Brown, who was sort of end-of-career and just like, “Screw it, man, I’m just going to do this because it needs to be done,” and someone like Newsom, who clearly has aspirations for higher office and is making more of a political play. We’re not going to solve California’s water problem, but we could make it a lot more manageable for decades and decades and decades. (Newsom’s office has rejected the criticism and has said the governor is doing more than any other state to adapt to climate change. On Aug. 11 his administration announced new water recycling, storage and conservation measures.)\n\n\n\nWater wars. It’s an idea that gets batted around a whole bunch. Once, negotiating water use more than a century ago, California and Arizona amassed armed state guard troops on opposite banks of the Colorado River. Is this hyperbole or reality for the future?\n\n\n\nWell, it’s already happening. Florida and Georgia were in court as was Tennessee. There’s the dispute between Texas and New Mexico. Even within California they’re still arguing environment versus agriculture, farmers versus fish, north versus south. Sadly, we’re at a point in our history where people are not afraid to express their extreme points of view in ways that are violent. That’s the trajectory that we’re on. When you put those things together, especially in the southern half or the southwestern United States, I think it’s more of a tinderbox than it ever has been.\n\n\n\nThat’s hopeful.\n\n\n\nYou’re not going to get any hope out of me. The best you’re going to get out of me is we can manage our way through. I don’t think we’re going to really slow global change. We have to do what we’re doing because we’re talking about the future. But a certain number of degrees warming and a certain amount of sea level rise is already locked in, and all that’s happening in our lifetimes. The best you’re going to hear from me is that we need to do the best we can now to slow down the rates of warming that directly impacts the availability of water. We’re talking about the future of humanity. I think people don’t realize that we’re making those decisions now by our water policies and by our climate change policy.\n\n\n\nWhen people think about water, they think of it as a Western problem, but there’s water shortages across the High Plains and into the South, too.\n\n\n\nI don’t think most people understand that scarcity in many places is getting more pronounced. Nationally, let’s look at the positives: It’s a big country, and within its boundaries, we have enough water to be water secure and to be food secure and to do it in an environmentally sustainable way. A lot of countries don’t have that. That’s a positive, though we still have the same problems that everyone else has with increasing flooding and drought. What I really think we need is more attention to a national water policy and more attention to the food, water and energy nexus. Because those are things that are going to define how well we do as a country.\n\n\n\nWhat would a national water policy look like?\n\n\n\nIt recognizes where people live, and it recognizes where we have water, and then it decides how we want to deal with that. Maybe it’s more like a national water/food policy. Moving water over long distances is not really feasible right now — it’s incredibly expensive. Does the government want to subsidize that? These are the kind of things that need to be discussed, because we’re on a collision course with reality — and the reality is those places where we grow food, where a lot of people live, are running out of water, and there are other parts of the country that have a lot of water. So that’s a national-level discussion that has to happen, because when you think about it, the food problem is a national problem. It’s not a California problem. It’s not a Southern, High Plains, Ogallala, Texas Panhandle problem. It’s a national problem. It needs a national solution.\n\n\n\nIs this a climate czar? A new agency?\n\n\n\nSomething like that. We’re failing right now. We’re failing to have any vision for how that would happen. In Canada, we’re talking about a Canadian water agency and a national water policy. That could be something that we need in the United States — a national water agency to deal with these problems.\n\n\n\nIn the Inflation Reduction Act we finally have some legislation that will help cut emissions. There’s plenty of other talk about infrastructure and adaptation — seawalls and strengthening housing and building codes and all of those sorts of things. Where would you rank the priority of a national water policy?\n\n\n\nIt’s an absolute top priority. I like to say that water’s next, right after carbon. Water is the messenger that’s delivering the bad news about climate change to your city, to your front door.\n\n\n\nWe don’t usually mix concern over drought with concern over contamination, but there was a recent study about the presence of “forever” chemicals in rainfall and salt washing off the roads in Washington, D.C., and contaminating drinking water. Can these remain separate challenges in a hotter future?\n\n\n\nIt doesn’t get discussed much, but we’re seeing more and more the links between water quality and climate change. We’ve got water treatment facilities and sewers close to coasts. During drought, discharge of contaminants is less diluted. The water quality community and the water climate communities don’t really overlap. We’ve done a terrible job as stewards where water is concerned.\n\n\n\nGlobally, what do you want Americans to think about when they read this?\n\n\n\nThe United States is kind of a snapshot of what’s happening in the rest of the world. There’s no place we can run to. Things are happening really, really fast and in a very large scale. We as a society, as a country or as a global society are not responding with the urgency, with the pace and the scale that’s required. I am specifically talking about rapid changes that are happening with freshwater availability that most people don’t know about. The problems are often larger than one country. A lot of it is transboundary. And we’re just not moving fast enough.\n\n\n\nNews flash.\n\n\n\nAround the world the water levels have just continued to drop. In the Middle East or India. In fact, they’re getting faster. It’s actually a steeper slope.\n\n\n\nSo, the Colorado River is the least of our worries.\n\n\n\nGlobally? It’s not even as bad as the others. Arizona doesn’t really show up as much compared to some of these places.",

        "description": "President Joe Biden looked to strike a tricky balance on Iran this week, as he attempts to restore the Iran nuclear deal while reassuring allies that Washington can still push back on Tehran’s malign activities.\n\n\n\nThe two countries have resolved some of the thorniest stumbling blocks in negotiations on reviving the 2015 deal in recent days, and appear headed toward an agreement. But simultaneously, U.S. and Iran-backed forces clashed in Syria this week in several skirmishes that left four militants dead and three U.S. service members wounded.\n\n\n\nU.S. officials say the attacks in Syria are not related to negotiations over the Iran deal. But the split screen highlights the challenge the administration faces in making progress on one of its top Middle East priorities — bringing Iran back into compliance with the nuclear deal — while Tehran’s proxies continue to foment violence against the U.S. and its allies in the region.\n\n\n\n“Whenever the U.S. and Iran are close to successful negotiations, actors on both sides try to disrupt them,” said Joe Cirincione, a national security expert and author who formerly served as president of the nuclear nonproliferation-focused Ploughshares Fund. He noted that Israel and elements of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps are opposed to the deal. “The goal is the same: to create a crisis that would make diplomacy impossible, a deal unobtainable.”\n\n\n\nIn this case, experts said the Biden administration’s strategy — prove it can walk and chew gum at the same time — was effective.\n\n\n\n“We defended ourselves immediately and we are still in negotiations,” said Mick Mulroy, a former Pentagon official in the Trump administration.\n\n\n\nEven as officials made progress in nuclear negotiations in recent weeks, Iranian proxies have been increasingly active in the region. In Syria, IRGC-directed militants have intensified low-level attacks against U.S. and coalition positions in Syria, Defense Department officials said.\n\n\n\nIran may be trying to use the activity in Syria to gain some leverage in nuclear talks, said Seth Jones, an expert with the Center for Strategic and International Studies. But more important for Tehran is getting U.S. troops out of the Middle East, where Iran has expanded its influence in recent years, he said.\n\n\n\n“This fighting, the violence right now in Syria is broadly symptomatic of the tensions right now that the U.S. is having with the Iranians,” Jones said. “Some of them are military, some of them are at the diplomatic table.”\n\n\n\nOn Aug. 15, two incidents in Syria caught the administration’s attention: one unsuccessful drone strike in the vicinity of al-Tanf Garrison and one rocket attack on Green Village. The U.S. did not respond immediately but spent several days ensuring that retaliatory strikes sent the right message and didn’t kill anyone.\n\n\n\n“DoD worked to select a target that would send the message we wanted without further escalating the situation,” a senior administration official said. “They conducted hundreds of hours of intelligence collection to help ensure the strike did not cause casualties while also preparing the ground to respond should the Iranian-backed groups choose to attack again after our strike. It takes time to do this right.”\n\n\n\nBut one senior DoD official — who, like others in this article, spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss a sensitive topic — said that one reason the response took a few days was for officials to debate the impact on nuclear negotiations.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, on Biden’s order, U.S. fighter jets struck Deir ez-Zor, Syria, against bunkers used by groups affiliated with the IRGC. The U.S. military had initially identified 11 targets at the site, but ultimately struck only nine due to evidence of movement near two of the bunkers shortly before the strike, said the Pentagon’s top policy official, Colin Kahl.\n\n\n\nThe retaliatory strike was designed to signal that the U.S. will defend itself regardless of where negotiations stand on the nuclear deal, Kahl said.\n\n\n\n“The administration has been pretty clear that in the event that Iran moves back into compliance with the JCPOA [Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action], that’s in our interest, because it pushes Iran further away from a nuclear weapons capability. But whether the JCPOA is reborn or not, it actually has nothing to do with our willingness and resolve to defend ourselves,” Kahl said. “The strike last night was a pretty clear communication to the Iranians that these things are on different tracks.\n\n\n\nThe response was likely designed to reassure U.S. allies that Washington can still push back on Iran’s nefarious action in the region while negotiating a nuclear agreement, Cirincione said. In fact, top Israeli officials visited Washington this week, as the government ramped up pressure on Biden to walk away from the nuclear deal. Israeli national security adviser Eyal Hulata met with counterpart Jake Sullivan at the White House on Tuesday — the same day the strikes occurred in Syria.\n\n\n\n“The U.S. will deny that there is any connection but I’m a superstitious man, I’ve seen this pattern all too often,” he said. “They want to conclude the deal, they have to reassure the allies — this is their way of doing that, and I think it worked.”\n\n\n\nBut the skirmishes did not end there. In retaliation, IRGC-backed militants launched rocket attacks on two separate sites in northeastern Syria, Green Village and Conoco, which wounded three U.S. service members. One U.S. service member was treated for a minor injury and returned to duty, while two others are under evaluation for minor injuries, a statement from U.S. Central Command said at the time.\n\n\n\nIn their initial response, U.S. attack helicopters destroyed three vehicles and equipment used to launch some of the rockets. The militants then attempted to launch additional rockets, but American forces pummeled the position with attack helicopters, gunships and artillery. Altogether, the U.S. military killed four enemy fighters and destroyed seven enemy rocket launchers in the fighting.\n\n\n\nAfter the strike, the Pentagon assessed that the latest salvo was over and deterrence had been reestablished, said a third U.S. official.\n\n\n\nSo far, the back-and-forth has not appeared to hold up progress on the nuclear discussions. For one thing, the two sides appear to have moved past the Biden administration’s refusal to remove the IRGC from the Foreign Terrorist Organization list.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. relayed to the EU on Wednesday its response to Iran’s latest comments on the draft proposal. This stage of talks is expected to focus on the final sticking points, related to Iranian demands for economic guarantees and sanctions relief.\n\n\n\n“We are closer now than we were even just a couple of weeks ago because Iran made the decision to make some concessions,” said John Kirby, a spokesperson for the National Security Council.\n\n\n\nBut he cautioned that “a lot of gaps remain. We’re not there yet.”\n\n\n\nAlexander Ward and Nahal Toosi contributed to this report.",

        "description": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended four Broward County School Board members Friday in the wake of an explosive grand jury report that called for their ouster over a “neglect of duty and incompetence” in managing a multimillion dollar bond for campus security. The move — the latest fallout for Broward school leaders since the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School — coincided with DeSantis appointing four new board members, giving Florida’s Republican governor new allies in a Democrat-leaning area. In a statement, DeSantis said that he hopes the action “brings the Parkland community another step towards justice.” “It is my duty to suspend people from office when there is clear evidence of incompetence, neglect of duty, misfeasance or malfeasance,” DeSantis said in a statement. “This action is in the best interest of the residents and students of Broward County and all citizens of Florida.” The Parkland grand jury, in a 2021 report released just last week, said that five board members — Patricia Good, Donna Korn, Ann Murray, Laurie Rich Levinson and Rosalind Osgood — along with the district’s top leadership “need to go” after examining their performance on a massive school bonding program aiming to bolster school safety and other areas. Commissioned by DeSantis, the grand jury was called to probe school safety in Florida after a lone gunman in 2018 shot 34 people, killing 17 at Stoneman Douglas. “What Governor DeSantis did is un-American and undemocratic. He doesn’t care about democracy and overturned the will of the voters,” Levinson said in a statement. “This action is authoritarian-like and has no place in the United States of America where the voters decide who represents them.” The Broward bond project, approved by voters about four years before the Parkland shooting, was promised to be completed by the end of 2021 for $987 million yet is now estimated to wrap up in 2025 for nearly $1.5 billion, according to the grand jury, which questioned if the district would even make that deadline. The grand jury claimed the board members failed to hold school officials accountable and were slammed for “deceit, malfeasance, misfeasance, neglect of duty and incompetence.” “We applaud the Governor’s action to follow the recommendation from Florida’s 20th Statewide Grand Jury and remove the Broward School Board members — citing their gross-negligence, misfeasance, malfeasance, and shear incompetence caused the mishandling of many of the aspects of the tragic date that took the lives so many at Marjory Stoneman Douglas,” said Stand with Parkland president Tony Montalto in a statement. Out of the four sitting school board members scrutinized in the report, the terms of Levinson and Murray are set to expire in November with neither seeking reelection. Korn is pursuing another term and is now engaged in a runoff election for the seat; Good’s term is set to expire in 2024. Osgood, meanwhile, is now a state senator and “therefore not subject to the Governor’s executive suspension authority,” according to the DeSantis administration. To replace the board members, DeSantis appointed Torey Alston, Manual “Nandy” A. Serrano, Ryan Reiter and Kevin Tynan. It’s unclear which appointment is associated with each separate board term. Alston previously served as the chief of staff at the Florida Department of Transportation under the DeSantis administration. And DeSantis previously appointed him to the Broward County Commission. Serrano is member of the Florida Sports Foundation Board of Directors and CEO and founder of Clubhouse Private Wealth, a financial consulting firm. Reiter is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran and director of government relations for Kaufman Lynn Construction in Delray Beach. Tynan, an attorney with Richardson and Tynan, previously served on the Broward County School Board.",

Some have brought the analogue fold-out type. Others use whatever is to hand: baseball caps, concertinaed bits of A4, homemade signs, the larger mobile phone models. The American rapper Megan Thee Stallion (the second “e” is silent) acknowledges the sauna-like temperatures in this packed venue and is quick to take the credit. “It’s hot in this motherfucker,” she laughs. “That’s ’cos we’re doing real hot-girl shit!”She’s not wrong. Megan Thee Stallion surged out of hip-hop’s online battlegrounds and into the collective consciousness in 2019 with the song Hot Girl Summer, a co-production with the trailblazing female rapper Nicki Minaj that coined a new, Instagram meme-derived spin on female empowerment – assertiveness with a twerk and a wink. Thee Stallion had a sassy signature move to go with it too: sticking her tongue out and “bleh”-ing, managing to convey lasciviousness, disdain and a sense of humour all at the same time.

        "description": "Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, in my practice caring for persons living with dementia, I witnessed awful sufferings. The necessity of social distancing isolated my patients from vital services and supports such as adult day activity programs and, for those in hospital or residential facilities, nurturing visits from family and friends. Their disabilities worsened. Many died. Their family caregivers were overwhelmed with the added work of care and grief.\n\n\n\nI confess, though, I’m reluctantly grateful for one consequence of social distancing. Before March 2020, some of my patients couldn’t see me at my office. And then, abruptly, I began seeing them. The visits were at my virtual office. Video or audio telemedicine gave them access to care, made possible when, in response to the public health emergency, Medicare waived limitations on its practice.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, as the public health emergency fades, this waiver will expire. This shouldn’t happen. Telemedicine has the potential to revolutionize the care of the 8.8 percent of adults age 65 and older, or approximately 3.8 million Americans, living with dementia. It will also accelerate America’s goal of early diagnosis and treatment of the diseases that cause dementia, such as Alzheimer’s disease, Lewy Body disease, vascular disease and frontotemporal lobar disease.\n\n\n\nAmong my patients who benefitted from telemedicine were those whose caregivers, typically adult children, lived far from my Philadelphia office. Others were persons living with advanced stages of dementia, requiring caregivers to provide life’s basic needs, such as dressing, eating and moving about. Some, despite the best efforts to stimulate and calm their mind, develop anger and aggressiveness, making even short-distance travel intensely traumatic.\n\n\n\nBefore telemedicine, these patients simply stopped coming to see me, or their caregivers would resort to telephoning me. I managed, but I did so with notable limitations. Medicare didn’t recognize a call with a patient as a “physician visit.” True, I prescribed care and wrote a chart note, but this work was unbillable. For most clinicians, this structure was an understandably frustrating exercise in delivering care with limited, if any, compensation.\n\n\n\nThe pandemic abruptly changed this. The COVID-19 public health emergency allowed Medicare to recognize a telemedicine visit as a billable office visit. The health care system where I practice installed a user-friendly digital “dashboard.” It organizes visits, addresses concern of privacy and security, and allows me to text the patient and family if I’m running late. Multiple family members in different locations can participate. On one screen, I see them, and on another, I have the chart opened. I’m able to screen share images and other information.\n\n\n\nAs the pandemic wanes, however, my colleagues and I fear we’ll return to the old system. Fortunately, Congress is considering the “Advancing Telehealth Beyond COVID–19 Act of 2022.” This bill would authorize Medicare to continue telemedicine until Dec. 31, 2024. The bill passed the House by a lopsided 416-to-12 vote. It now awaits a vote in the Senate. It ought to become law.\n\n\n\nThe bill has several valuable provisions. It allows for audio-only (telephone) visits. This is of tremendous advantage for persons who lack access to internet services and other technologies necessary for video and also for visits that really don’t need video, particularly for behavioral health.\n\n\n\nAnother benefit of the bill’s provisions is increased access to care. Telemedicine has been shown to be a notable benefit to persons living in rural areas and other regions with limited access to medical care. In dementia diagnosis and care, access is an enormous problem. There simply aren’t enough of the essential professionals, such as physicians, speech-language pathologists, psychologists and social workers, to meet the need. The bill begins to address this. It covers the services of several of these specialists.\n\n\n\nAs the COVID-19 public health emergency winds down, America still faces another public health emergency: the slow burning problem of dementia. A system of telemedicine – coverage for visits with health care professionals – is just a start. America needs to integrate this practice into an internet of care. Or, in short, a system of telehealth care.\n\n\n\nOne of the most common and important question my patients and families ask me is what to expect in the future. Implicit is really several questions: What’s wrong now, how will it change, and what should I do moving forward? Unfortunately, most persons don’t have access to the multi-disciplinary team needed to answer these questions. Telehealth care promises access to this team and to enhance the data it needs to deliver early and accurate diagnosis and quality care.\n\n\n\nOne promising opportunity is monitoring a person’s day-to-day function. Taking longer to complete or making errors in activities such as preparing a meal or paying bills often reveals emerging cognitive problems caused by diseases such as Alzheimer’s. Ordinary household appliances can monitor daily function, which is key to early diagnosis, and then tracking and managing function.\n\n\n\nA “smart refrigerator” can track the comings and goings of food and, therefore, declines or other changes in shopping and eating. Among the earliest predictors of worsening cognitive abilities is a decrease in “life space,” the frequency and distance a person travels outside the home. A smartphone that counts steps or a device in a car can easily track these data. Computers, smart phones and watches and tablets can of course directly assess cognition, but even more intriguing is interrogating these devices’ day-to-day use to predict decline.\n\n\n\nThese are just examples. Truly, the list is growing. Combining these real-world data into a person’s medical record with telemedicine access to experts will revolutionize care.\n\n\n\nTelehealth care faces numerous structural challenges related to data integration, privacy, scope of practice and reimbursement. An immediate one is reforming state licensure laws. During the pandemic, these were waived. I could care for patients wherever they resided. Now, as a physician licensed in Pennsylvania, I can no longer practice telemedicine with a patient who lives just across the Delaware River in New Jersey. This makes no sense. A national problem like dementia needs a national solution.\n\n\n\nThis vision of telehealth is a great experiment whose costs, quality and equity must be evaluated. But if it succeeds, it will launch a revolution in health care that could benefit all Americans.\n\n\n\nJason Karlawish is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perlman School of Medicine and author of “The Problem of Alzheimer’s: How Science, Culture and Politics Turned a Rare Disease into a Crisis and What We Can Do About It.” Follow him on Twitter @jasonkarlawish.",

        "description": "The Cardinals are hopeful that Steven Matz will return from his stint on the injured list soon, but when he does, it will be as a reliever, per MLB.com&#8217;s John Denton (via Twitter). There simply isn&#8217;t time remaining in the season to build him back up as a starter. The switch is partly because of Matz, but also due to the expectation that Jack Flaherty will return to the rotation potentially next Wednesday or the following weekend, writes Rick Hummel of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Not to mention, deadline acquisitions Jose Quintana and Jordan Montgomery have excelled in the rotation since their arrival. In the bullpen, Matz can provide manager Oliver Marmol with another weapon from the left side to augment current southpaws Genesis Cabrera and JoJo Romero. Elsewhere in the NL Central&#8230;\n\nDeadline acquisition Trevor Rosenthal left his latest appearance in Triple-A with lat soreness, per MLB.com&#8217;s Adam McCalvy (via Twitter). Picking up Rosenthal was certainly a bit of a lottery ticket for the Brewers, given that Rosenthal hasn&#8217;t pitched since 2020. Rosenthal had begun to show shades of his former self, posting a 1.90 ERA over 23 2/3 innings with the Royals and Padres. The hits keep coming for Rosenthal, who suffered a hamstring strain before the lat injury, which all came while recovering from thoracic outlet surgery.\nThe Cubs will be looking to add power this offseason, writes Paul Sullivan of the Chicago Tribune. That certainly tracks for a team with a middle infield consisting of Nico Hoerner and Nick Madrigal, both of whom boast contact-first profiles at the dish. Hoerner has stepped up this season, both on the field and from a leadership perspective, making himself a key part of the Cubs&#8217; future. Madrigal has had a less memorable campaign, but he may yet establish himself as the second baseman of the future. The power will have to come from somewhere, however, especially with Willson Contreras slated for free agency. Contreras&#8217; 20 home runs rank second on the team behind Patrick Wisdom&#8217;s 22, and the long-time catcher is the team leader in isolated power with a .222 ISO.",

        "description": "The New York Times editorial board called on Attorney General Merrick Garland to seek an indictment of former President Trump if “sufficient evidence” exists to establish his guilt \"on a serious charge.\"\n\n\n\nThe board argued in a piece published Friday that, \"Mr. Trump’s unprecedented assault on the integrity of American democracy requires a criminal investigation\" following the Jan. 6 select committee hearings and news of the Justice Department's search of Trump's Palm Beach, Fla., home for classified documents. \n\n\n\n\"This board is aware that in deciding how Mr. Trump should be held accountable under the law it is necessary to consider not just whether criminal prosecution would be warranted but whether it would be wise.\"\n\n\n\nThe board mentioned former President Ford’s pardon of former President Nixon for any crimes he may have committed during the Watergate scandal, with Ford justifying the decision as avoiding the “rousing” of “ugly passions” and polarization. \n\n\n\nThe board stated that prosecuting Trump could entrench support for him and \"play into the conspiracy theories he has sought to stoke.\" They argued it could also allow future presidents to misuse the precedent set to go after their political rivals.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut, the paper warned that doing nothing poses a much more significant risk and not holding him accountable for his actions related to the Jan. 6 insurrection would could set an “irresistible” precedent for future presidents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Why not attempt to stay in power by any means necessary or use the power of the office to enrich oneself or punish one’s enemies, knowing that the law does not apply to presidents in or out of office?” the board wrote. \n\n\n\nThe Times editorial was published the same day the FBI released a redacted affidavit to convince a Florida judge to grant a search warrant for Trump's Mar-a-Lago. The document stated authorities found 184 documents — some highly classified — in boxes that were initially returned to the National Archives from Mar-a-Lago earlier in the year. \n\n\n\nThe affidavit showed that the FBI believed there were additional classified documents related to national security housed at Trump's Palm Beach residence. \n\n\n\nThe FBI conducted a search of the Palm Beach property earlier this month to search for documents. \n\n\n\nThe House select committee is investigating Trump’s role in the Jan. 6 insurrection. It is currently taking a pause from its public hearings, but they are expected to resume in the fall.\n\n\n\nThe Times editorial board claimed the Jan. 6 hearings make clear that Trump must have known he was at the “center” of a fraudulent effort that led to the Capitol being attacked, and he refused to call off the mob that stormed the building for hours.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Well-meaning intentions did not shield them from the consequences of their actions,” it states. “It would be unjust if Mr. Trump, the man who inspired them, faced no consequences.”",

        "description": "The CHIPS Act of 2022 was signed into law on Aug. 9. It provides tens of billions of dollars in public support for revitalization of domestic semiconductor manufacturing, workforce training, and “leap ahead” wireless technology. Because we outsource most of our device fabrication — including the chips that go into the Navy’s submarines and ships, the Army’s jeeps and tanks, military drones and satellites — our industrial base has become weak and shallow. The first order of business for the CHIPS Act is to address a serious deficit in our domestic production capacity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNotoriously absent from the language of the bill is any mention of chip security. Consequently, the U.S. is about to make the same mistake with microelectronics that we made with digital networks and software applications: Unless and until the government demands in-device security, our competitors will have an easy time of manipulating how chips function and behave. Nowhere is this more dangerous than our national security infrastructure.\n\n\n\nFor the first quarter-century of ubiquitous internet access, policy makers and industry leaders did not imagine — literally could not conceive — a deliberate electronic intrusion from an ideological adversary.\n\n\n\nNow they hit us almost at will.\n\n\n\nDeterrence has proven to be an obviously insufficient policy alternative. Western civil societies — our power stations, waste processing facilities, and hospitals — are paying a heavy price for their porous defenses and cyber naivete.\n\n\n\nEvery chip starts life as a software program before it is fabricated, mostly in Asia, and mostly in Taiwan, into a chip. The process that transforms design code into “sand in the hand” silicon is just as vulnerable today as consumer applications were in the early 2010s, and for all the same reasons. The impact is deeper and more penetrating because once a chip is compromised, it is nearly impossible to patch. It might be in space or under an ocean. Our enemies know this too.\n\n\n\nUndetected vulnerabilities, called “zero-days,” are endemic to and ubiquitous in all digital systems. They remain dormant until activated by someone who is trying to ransom data, steal data, or insert false instructions into a computer. They target electric grids, water supplies, financial clearinghouses, supply chains, and transportation fleets. The people who operate critical infrastructure have no time — literally zero days — to fix them. They exist because it is impossible for designers and manufacturers to test every possible combination of paths in or out of a device. Zero-days enable destructive cyberattacks on physical systems.\n\n\n\nNon-technical people may assume that cybersecurity is just “secret stuff that is getting handled behind the scenes.” It is not, or at least not-nearly well enough. And if our experience with consumer applications and industrial control systems is any indication, we urgently need to bolster our cyber defenses on semiconductor chips. Policymakers and industry leaders in the U.S. have not yet connected digital theft and intrusion to kinetic danger and violence in a way that the general public can understand.\n\n\n\nLeading manufacturers will soon be mass-producing devices whose internal geometric features are measured by angstroms, 20 to be exact, the orbit of an electron around a hydrogen nucleus. Our ability to build chips so compact, so small, and so potent means we could dramatically improve surveillance for deviant behavior and respond proactively when it occurs.\n\n\n\nChips, of course, rarely live in isolation. There are communication chips, graphics chips, sensory chips, memory chips, pacemaker chips and the iconic microprocessor. They are the workhorses of our networked health, energy, water, financial, agricultural, supply chain, retail, transportation and national security infrastructure, and they are connected to each other. An infection in one can easily spread to another, like a biological virus.\n\n\n\nSemiconductor industry icon Joe Costello and Levin recently argued that chips are the next frontier of exploitation and will have zero-day problems that cannot be patched because they are literally baked into the hardware; this is why we need much better defense there, too.\n\n\n\nIn 2017 Russia used an NSA-created zero-day, in their hands called “NotPetya,” in what Nicole Perlroth characterized as “the most destructive and costly cyberattack in world history.” She reported that after an earlier disruption of a Ukrainian electric grid, operators “[recognized] that things could have been a lot worse,” because “the attack had stopped short of the kind of deadly calamity that could derail passenger jets and planes or ignite a deadly explosion of some kind.” They were a premonition of bad things to come.\n\n\n\n“You know,” one of Pelroth’s sources told her, “if they switch off the lights here, we might be without power for a few hours. But if they do the same to you …”\n\n\n\nIt is difficult to read these words in the summer of 2022. They are already doing the same to us. Will we stop them with tit-for-tat cyber offense and threats of escalation, or will we build a breakwater against the surges we know are coming? Unless and until we unravel this queer policy imbalance — near defenselessness against hardware zero-days, reliance on offensive capabilities as defensive deterrence, and the incessant intrusions we already endure because we know less about our exposure than our enemies do — we could find ourselves in a hot war we could have avoided with better imagination and real alternatives for our leaders.\n\n\n\nThe CHIPS Act begins to solve the problems of geography and geometry. Unless and until we systematically address on-chip cybersecurity, as the NSA recently highlighted, we will build devices that are vulnerable by design, deploy them to the field, and be helpless if an adversary takes control. Chips are on the vanguard of our digital defenses. They need to be protected with thoughtful policy and common-sense requirements of how they are secured and what happens if they are breached.\n\n\n\nMichael D.

An ultralight build puts it a desirable class of convertibles with a frosted finish and flashy accents. A 3:2 screen stands taller than most and includes an OLED option that's vivid yet natural looking. There are also clever design choices, like a chamfered edge with a charging port, light-up volume/mic mute/camera shutter keys, plus decent port selection.\nThe Spectre x360 13.5-inch gets an A+ in looks and scores high (but not perfectly) in design details. But it has some room to grow when it comes to productivity, especially when compared against other highly capable ultralights in its price range.\nFor those who insist on squeezing every ounce of performance out of a sub-1-inch-thick convertible, there are stronger competitors. But for the rest, the 2022 Spectre is near the top of its class.\nRead 38 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "The&nbsp;Inflation Reduction Act&nbsp;(IRA) does many valuable things: It reduces prescription drug prices, combats climate change and makes corporations pay a minimum tax. One of the more consequential and lasting impacts of the new law, however, could be that it highlights how Congress can move forward with pro-worker legislation. Until the Senate filibuster is reformed, the most likely path for Congress to support workers and their labor unions lies with&nbsp;budget reconciliation&nbsp;— the process used to pass the IRA with a simple majority in the Senate.\n\n\n\nCreating good jobs — those that pay well and offer decent benefits — is central to the purpose of the IRA. As President&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;remarked earlier this month, the new law will “create thousands of good-paying jobs, apprenticeship opportunities and manufacturing jobs for clean energy construction projects, solar projects, wind projects, clean hydrogen projects, carbon capture projects and so much more.”\n\n\n\nThe bill does this through&nbsp;policies&nbsp;such as prevailing wage, buy-American and apprenticeship utilization requirements attached to various tax credits.&nbsp;Prevailing wage laws&nbsp;ensure that government spending does not drive down market standards that workers — particularly unionized workers — have been able to maintain. Buy-American&nbsp;preferences&nbsp;will support and create jobs for domestically produced clean technology and materials.&nbsp;Apprenticeship utilization requirements&nbsp;create high-skilled, educated workers who receive on-the-job training and decent pay, often because of a union contract.\n\n\n\nWith the filibuster increasingly used to block popular legislation, budget reconciliation has become a&nbsp;standard way&nbsp;for Congress to consider major policy, from the Inflation Reduction Act to former President Donald Trump’s 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) to repeated failed attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile a number of previous budget reconciliation bills have included provisions helpful to workers, such as a&nbsp; 1990 wage requirement for&nbsp;dialysis&nbsp;treatments under Medicare and a paid&nbsp;family and medical leave&nbsp;tax credit in the TCJA, these pro-worker elements were relatively small and ancillary to the goals of the broader legislation. The&nbsp;American Rescue Plan&nbsp;Act (ARPA), a key COVID-19 recovery package that passed in March 2021 through the budget reconciliation process, began to change this dynamic by including a host of pro-worker policies.\n\n\n\nThe IRA goes even further to completely flip the traditional script — and makes clear that pro-worker policy can be front and center in reconciliation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, some of the most important and popular pro-worker bills may not fit with the arcane rules of the budget reconciliation process. For example, an increase in the federal minimum wage was&nbsp;scrapped&nbsp;from the ARPA due to the so-called “Byrd” rule.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, there are&nbsp;many policies&nbsp;that can walk the reconciliation&nbsp;tightrope.&nbsp; Some, such as increased funding for the National Labor Relations Board, higher fines for labor law violations and a tax deduction for union dues were included in&nbsp;versions&nbsp;of budget&nbsp;reconciliation&nbsp;bills in 2021 and 2022.\n\n\n\nMany more policies could likely comply. Corporate&nbsp;union-busting&nbsp;activities should no longer be tax-deductible business expenses. When the government subsidizes firms with&nbsp;tax credits&nbsp;or other incentives, job-quality standards should always be included. Companies that misclassify employees as independent contractors should&nbsp;stop&nbsp;receiving favorable tax treatment. The possibilities&nbsp;could go&nbsp;on and on.\n\n\n\nThe IRA is not just a win for workers today, but importantly, also highlights the possibilities for more pro-worker policymaking under existing congressional rules. Workers are clamoring for action — from their extremely strong&nbsp;support for unions&nbsp;to the&nbsp;growing number&nbsp;of strikes and organizing campaigns. Policymakers should seize the opportunity in future reconciliation bills to help workers out.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDavid Madland is the author of “Re-Union: How Bold Labor Reforms Can Repair, Revitalize, and Reunite the United States” and is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress.",

        "description": "Anyone who&#8217;s already acquainted themselves with Chrome&#8217;s awesome, new &#8220;Share&#8221; menu will know that it houses a myriad of useful tools. Bringing the modern, desktop browser up to par with the flexibility and versatility of mobile phone browsers, the ability to send web pages to your phone or Chromebook, sharing them on social media without having to copy and paste the URL, and more are invaluable today.\n\n\n\nHonestly, I thought Google was quite done adding things to this menu, and today&#8217;s news had blindsided me. Any time I get excited about a feature, the company quickly axes it, and though I&#8217;ve been a primary advocate for its browser &#8220;Collections&#8221; feature for a long time, I&#8217;ve tempered my expectations of it along the way.\n\n\n\nFor some reason that I certainly won&#8217;t be complaining about, Google is testing out a share menu feature that lets you send things directly to your Google Collections or &#8220;Google Save&#8221; page! As you can see below, enabling the aptly named &#8220;Share to Google Collections&#8221; flag in Chrome while keeping the sharing hub flag enabled will reveal a new &#8220;Collections&#8221; share to option marked with a standard Google logo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShare to Google CollectionsAdds an item to the sharing hub to allow sharing to Google Collections. &#8211; Mac, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, Fuchsia, Lacros#sharing-desktop-share-to-google-collections\n\n\n\nAt this time, nothing occurs upon clicking it, but you are sent to &#8216;https://www.google.com/save/add-link?itemUrl=&#8216; followed by the URL of the page you attempted to share. It&#8217;s cool to see Google Collections getting this much love this long after release. I hope that the Search app for Android&#8217;s Collections screen becomes available on the web in the future, as it features more diverse collection types and integrations with Shopping, Continue searching, your Google TV Watchlist, Play Books wishlist, and more.\n\n\n\nI&#8217;ll give more context to whether or not you can share to specific collections on your account or just to the overall Collections container once the feature starts working properly. My guess is that it&#8217;s still in the works and that it will require a few more OS or browser updates before it&#8217;s ready for prime time. Do you use Google Collections, or have you avoided them up until this point? Let me know below!\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

Instead of ink blots, pundits and politicians stared at pages of solid black lines and offered strikingly different \"ah-ha\" observations.\n\n\n\nFor former Mueller top aide Andrew Weissmann,&nbsp;the affidavit meant one thing — that \"the former president is going to be prosecuted.\"&nbsp;(Of course, Weissmann once expressed certainty that&nbsp;Donald Trump would pardon himself&nbsp;by his last day in office.)\n\n\n\nThere already are a plethora of news and opinion columns focusing on five things we learned from the redacted affidavit.\n\n\n\nEqually telling, I think, is what did not happen with the affidavit’s release.\n\n\n\nDue to a&nbsp;series of advance leaks from the government, we already knew some of the affidavit’s contents and the results of the search. The redacted affidavit had important details on past communications and the documents that were previously retrieved from Mar-a-Lago, including the discovery of a large amount of classified documents, from the relatively mundane \"confidential\" to the highly classified “Top Secret/Sensitive Compartmented Information” (TS/SCI).\n\n\n\nIt also was clear that a criminal case could be brought on such allegations, though there is considerable factual and legal uncertainty about any conviction or appeal.\n\n\n\nNot clear is whether the Justice Department intends to prosecute the former president. It is entirely possible that beneath the affidavit’s blacked-out lines lurks evidence that the government is building a case for prosecution. However, if one were to go by the unredacted portions, it is also possible this was just a heavy-handed effort to retrieve government material from Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nMore striking are three things that did not happen.\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;most remarkable thing&nbsp;that occurred on Friday is that nothing occurred on Friday. Only a week before, the Justice Department insisted that the court should not release a single line of the affidavit and that any substantive disclosure would unleash of parade of horribles, from damaging national security to sacrificing witnesses.\n\n\n\nFor those of us who have litigated cases against the Justice Department, it was an all-too-familiar claim by a department notorious for over-classification and over-redaction arguments.\n\n\n\nFor a week, media pundits mouthed the same exaggerated claims and challenged those of us who&nbsp;argued that it was clearly possible to release a redacted affidavit; liberals suddenly shuddered at the thought of doubting the Justice Department. Sites like&nbsp;Above the Law&nbsp;claimed that calls for greater transparency and a redacted affidavit were akin to \"publishing the nuclear codes on the back of every milk carton.\" Even after the judge agreed that a redacted affidavit could be released in the public interest,&nbsp;experts balked&nbsp;at the notion as dangerous in light of Justice's earlier warnings.\n\n\n\nAs I&nbsp;noted earlier, affidavits contain background legal and factual sections that ordinarily can be unsealed without disclosing sensitive information. That is precisely what happened here. Pages of the affidavit were released that confirmed the legal claims as well as some of the factual allegations. As in other cases, the Justice Department had falsely claimed that no disclosures could be made without redacting so much as to make the document unintelligible. Yet, no one seemed to notice.\n\n\n\nSomething else did not happen. In rejecting Justice’s claims that nothing in the affidavit should be released, U.S. Magistrate Bruce Reinhart set out an appellate process by which he could overrule Justice in ordering disclosures beyond those proposed by the department. Given Justice’s well-documented history of over-redacting, it was a promising start.\n\n\n\nThen, over the course of the week, media reported a series of leaks of information that clearly was part of the affidavit. At the same time that the government was demanding total secrecy, it was selectively leaking details seemingly designed to put Trump on the defensive.\n\n\n\nGiven that history, there was every reason for the court to be skeptical of the first cut of the redactions. Yet the court appears to have accepted the government's redactions without question. It effectively found that the Justice Department hit the Goldilocks spot on the first try in getting the redactions just right to maximize disclosures.\n\n\n\nThis is where those black lines actually may tell us something. While there were key points disclosed, the redactions of the timeline of events notably ended exactly where the leaked information ended. Many of us had stated that the critical period of interest was between June 8 and after the raid on August 8.&nbsp;The June date involved a demand for greater security on the storage room at Mar-a-Lago, with which the Trump team complied. The redacted affidavit only added one day of new information in noting that on June 9, Trump’s counsel acknowledged the receipt of their letter. Then the black-out followed. That information could explain why a raid was needed, as opposed to a second subpoena or a more tailored warrant.\n\n\n\nThere is every reason to believe that what followed contained some facts that could be released on the FBI’s communications with the Trump team or the breakdown of such communications. After all, the Trump team already knows about that. Yet the government is saying that everything which occurred in that critical month cannot be disclosed in even the smallest detail.\n\n\n\nThe court could have pushed for additional disclosures but chose to call it a day, based on government representations that more would cause harm. Yet this is the same department that maintained all of the pages released this week could not be released without causing harm.\n\n\n\nThere is still more that can be done by the court. One option is the special master requested, belatedly, by Trump’s team. I&nbsp;previously argued&nbsp;that Attorney General Merrick Garland should have proposed such an appointment to assure the public that this was not a pretextual search using sensitive documents as an excuse for a massive seizure. The scope of the warrant was ridiculously broad, allowing the seizure of virtually every document in the storage room and every document generated during Trump’s presidency.&nbsp;A special master could have sorted through this mass of material and separated privileged or immaterial documents. That would add to the legitimacy of an otherwise unlimited search.\n\n\n\nThat also did not happen.&nbsp;However, a&nbsp;special master could still serve the same interests of transparency and legitimacy. By dividing these documents into classified material, unclassified but defense-related information, and unclassified material we would have a better understanding of the scope and seriousness of any alleged crimes.\n\n\n\nThat is why the most curious thing about the redacted affidavit is what did not happen. In Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s “Silver Blaze,” a police inspector asks Sherlock Holmes if anything about a crime scene bothered him. The brilliant detective responds, “To the curious incident of the dog in the nighttime.” When the confused inspector objects that “the dog did nothing in the night-time,” Holmes replies: “That was the curious incident.”\n\n\n\nJonathan Turley is the Shapiro Professor of Public Interest Law at George Washington University.&nbsp;Follow him on Twitter&nbsp;@JonathanTurley.",

Meet the Mets\n\nThe Mets went back and forth with the Rockies last night, ultimately falling behind 6-4 in the  top of the 8th before tying the game in the bottom of the frame and winning it in the ninth on an RBI single off the bat of Pete Alonso to put the team up 2-0 in the series over Colorado.\nChoose your recap: Amazin’ Avenue, NY Post, Daily News, Newsday, North Jersey, MLB.com\nToday is Old-Timers Day, and it will represent the culmination of a remarkable shift in how the Mets embrace their franchise history.\nBuck Showalter is one person who is very excited about the return of this tradition.\nDwight Gooden offered a sneak peak at the shoes he will be rocking for the Old-Timers game.\nAlonso continues to be the heart and soul of this Mets team.\nTommy Hunter made his return from the injured list to add an extra arm to the Mets bullpen, which meant that Michael Pérez was sent down to Syracuse.\nBrett Baty hit his second homer last night, helping to make the case for him to remain on the Mets with Eduardo Escobar’s impending return.\nEscobar could be back from the injured list as soon as tonight.\nA small adjustment has helped Mark Canha rediscover his power.\nMax Scherzer has enjoyed the opportunity to learn more about Jacob deGrom from watching him up-close.\nThe Mets are continuing to be very cautious with deGrom’s pitch count.\nA Queens school is being named after former Mets hero Tommie Agee.\nAround the National League East\nThe Braves put up double-digit runs against the Cardinals pitching staff and Spencer Strider had another solid outing as Atlanta kept pace with the Mets with an 11-4 victory.\nThe Phillies got themselves a much-needed boost to their lineup in time for the September push for the postseason, activating Bryce Harper from the injured list after two months on the sideline with a hand injury.\nPhiladelphia scored four in the first inning—with Harper contributing an RBI single in his first at-bat back—en route to a 7-4 victory over the Pirates.\nThe Marlins and Dodgers went back and forth in an extra inning affair, but Los Angeles scored five runs in the 10th inning to put the game away, and Miami fell 10-6.\nThe Marlins said goodbye to Jesús Aguilar, designating the former All-Star for assignment in the midst of a disappointing season.\nThe Nationals made a number of roster moves, including releasing veteran third baseman Maikel Franco and calling up top prospect Cade Cavalli.\nCavalli made his debut against the Reds and gave up an unseemly seven runs in 4.1 innings, and the Nationals suffered a 7-3 defeat.\nAround Major League Baseball\nJulio Rodríguez has been rewarded for his impressive rookie season with a sizable contract extension which will keep him in Seattle for years to come.\nThe Mariners were not the only team getting in on the extension game yesterday, as the Rays inked Tyler Glasnow to a deal which will keep him in Tampa Bay through the 2024 season.\nThere is both anecdotal and statistical evidence to suggest that players contracting COVID can have impacts on their performance in the aftermath of their returns.\nTim Anderson is the latest MLB star to signal that he is preparing to suit up for Team USA in next year’s World Baseball Classic.\nHall of Famer Rod Carew gave Rob Manfred a piece of his mind about the state of the game at a recent dinner.\nAlbert Pujols has looked a lot like his old self recently.\nMLB.com looked at nine prospects who could potentially make a difference in the pennant race.\nYesterday at Amazin’ Avenue\nRobert Wolff talked about former All-Star catcher John Stearns on the latest episode of UnforMETable.\nThis Date in Mets History\nOn this date two years ago, the Mets and Marlins walked off the field and elected not to play to protest racial injustice.",

        "description": "(High Note)Harrell’s sometimes complex compositions exude leisurely warmthAt an age when trumpet players can often sound a little frayed at the edges, Tom Harrell, 76, is in fine form. His tone is soft, but with a bright edge to it, and he seems to have all the time in the world, even when playing the fastest tempo. These 11 tracks are all Harrell’s compositions, played with his own quartet. The music itself is sometimes quite complex, but it’s done with such warmth and apparent ease that even the intricacies have their charm.That is certainly the case with the opening piece, Evoorg (read it backwards). On the surface it’s a breezy little number, but just trying to follow Harrell’s solo had me tied up in knots. That’s when I realised how brilliant the other three are. Pianist Luis Perdomo, bassist Ugonna Okegwo and drummer Adam Cruz keep it all together and take their own excellent and apposite solos. As if that weren’t enough, Harrell occasionally overdubs a second trumpet part, typically brief and to the point. The basis of his style is latter-day bebop, but there are touches here of jazz-rock, Brazilian, Cuban and even Japanese music.  Continue reading...",

The news outlet reported that the photo is of the 2013-2014 faculty in the Department of Military Strategy, Plans, and Operations, where Mastriano worked at that time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMastriano is seen wearing a gray uniform and cap and holding a long Civil War-era gun.\n\n\n\nReuters reported that people familiar with the photo said faculty were allowed to dress as historical figures for the picture at the time. One person in the photo is holding an aviator’s helmet, and at least one other person in the photo is clearly dressed up, but Mastriano is the only one wearing a Confederate soldier’s uniform.\n\n\n\nMastriano’s campaign and the War College did not immediately return requests from The Hill for comment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConfederate statues and symbols around the U.S. have received national scrutiny in recent years, especially since the 2015 shooting at a Black church in Charleston, S.C. The shooter promoted white supremacist views and posted Confederate battle flags online ahead of the shooting.\n\n\n\nReuters reported that the photo showing Mastriano in the uniform was removed from the wall where it hung with other annual faculty photos after the outlet requested the picture.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Pentagon effectively banned the displaying of the Confederate flag in July 2020 by not including it in an updated list of flags that are allowed. This decision came in the aftermath of the murder of George Floyd, an unarmed Black man who was killed in police custody in Minneapolis. \n\n\n\nThe military has also sought to remove other segregationist symbols since rolling out the policy, Reuters reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe War College told Reuters that school officials reviewed all art, texts and images shown at the college in 2020 but missed the photo with Mastriano.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe college told Reuters that the photo was removed because it did not meet its values.\n\n\n\nPennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, the Democratic nominee for governor, tweeted that Mastriano wore the \"uniform of traitors\" who fought to defend slavery. He said it is \"deeply offensive\" and shows that he is unfit to be governor.",

As for many other parents, it’s a difficult time. We have got used to living together during lockdown, and now this unity is being dismantled as a new cohort of young adults heads off to study away from home.I am aware that I am finding the idea of Jerry leaving pretty difficult. This is not just because I have lived with him and looked after him for nearly two decades, but also because it is a fracture in the stability of my family, a small nick out of the papier-mache model I have created, a little break in the carefully constructed family unit. For I have lived with my children – Raymond, 25, Leonard, 19, Jerry, 18 and Ottoline, 15 – for over a quarter of a century. Continue reading...",

        "description": "France will maintain a cap on electricity prices until the end of the year in an effort to protect households, French Economy Minister Bruno Le Maire said on Saturday. \n\n\n\nThe cap will be discontinued at the end of 2022, but electricity and gas prices will be &#8220;contained&#8221; next year, Le Maire said in the margins of a meeting in the eastern French city of Metz. \n\n\n\n&#8220;French households will not be affected by this increase in electricity prices,&#8221; the economy minister pledged. \n\n\n\nThe government has limited the price increase at 4 percent, and this &#8220;will be maintained until the end of 2022,&#8221; he said. \n\n\n\nLe Maire also said that energy vouchers will also be introduced to help the poorest households. \n\n\n\nLe Maire warned that the energy-price surge cannot be absorbed forever by public finances. &#8220;It does not mean that we can block everything ad vitam aeternam,&#8221; he said.  \n\n\n\nLe Maire&#8217;s remarks come as electricity prices have hit all-time highs this week, driven in large part by Russia&#8217;s war on Ukraine. Prices in Germany and France have broken records, while British households are bracing for price increases of more than 80 percent. \n\n\n\nSpiraling prices in Europe have prompted the Czech EU presidency to convene an extraordinary energy council to discuss emergency measures to address the situation.",

        "description": "Getty Images\n\n\n\nFatima says the Taliban have been hunting her since the U.S. withdrew from the country a year ago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpeaking from an undisclosed location in the northern Afghan city of Mazar-i-Sharif, the former translator who worked with a U.S-headquartered relief organization said she is now in hiding, fearful of being found out by the new regime.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The Taliban came to my father and told him they knew his daughter was working with U.S. ‘spies’. [They] don’t like women working with U.S. projects,” Fatima, whose name has been changed at her request, told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I don’t go out. My children don’t go out. My parents live with other family members because they are scared.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFatima, 36, is one of many Afghan women who say that they’ve been let down by the U.S. and Western allies after two decades fighting in Afghanistan. Now at the mercy of the Taliban, they say they have not only lost all freedoms, but are struggling to feed their families amid tightening restrictions and a nosediving economy.\n\n\n\n“Before, all girls and women were free to go to school, to work, go out for fun, or wear whatever clothes they wanted,” said Shaista Safi, 34, a former Afghan government employee and member of Afghanistan Women's Solidarity Team, which still protests against the Taliban government despite the threat of reprisals.\n\n\n\nAfghan girls read the Quran in the Noor Mosque outside the city of Kabul, Afghanistan. Associated Press-Ebrahim Noroozi\n\n\n\n“But now we don’t have any of these freedoms. We don’t go to school. We don’t have jobs. We don’t have the freedom to go out, or to travel without a man. We don’t even have our basic rights. No work. No food. No education,” she said through an Islamabad-based Afghan translator who managed to flee last year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring 20 years in Afghanistan, the U.S. made empowerment of girls and women a top priority of its mission in the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2001, at the start of the war, then first lady Laura Bush kicked off “a worldwide effort to focus on the brutality against women and children by the Al Qaeda terrorist network and the regime it supports in Afghanistan, the Taliban.”\n\n\n\nA decade later, during the Obama administration in 2010, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton pledged to Afghan women that \"we will not abandon you\" and vowed to “stand” with them “always.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn July, however, Secretary of State Antony Blinken conceded that “women and girls have largely been erased from public life” under the Taliban.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"It's a terrible waste. It's especially difficult to accept because we all remember how different it was not so very long ago.”Secretary of State Antony Blinken\n\n\n\nThere were indeed slow but steady signs of progress for Afghan women over the last two decades.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA 20-year review by UNESCO, for example, found that the number of girls in secondary school rose from around 5,000 in 2001 — the year of the 9/11 attacks and the US invasion — to around 90,000 in 2018.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdditionally, by 2020, about 27 percent of the Afghan parliament was composed of women — giving them an important voice in their own government.\n\n\n\nSoon after the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan, the Biden administration appointed Rina Amiri, a former U.S. government adviser, as special envoy for Afghan women, girls and human rights. It also launched a “consultative platform” for Afghan women and civil society in May this year to deepen the U.S. government’s engagement in the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmnesty International says, women and girls face a bleak future in which these rights have been largely rescinded. Associated Press-Ebrahim Noroozi\n\n\n\nHowever, that has done little to curb the sense of betrayal felt by Afghan women like Fatima, who at least want U.S. help in escaping the militants now in control of the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I don't think the U.S. has completed the promises it made,” says Fatima, who remains in hiding along with her husband, a former defense lawyer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Both my husband and I had made a beautiful life for ourselves, but now we both are jobless. We are living at home. Sometimes we cannot even find food for my children. We [get] the money to feed our children, rent or clothes from a shelter.”\n\n\n\nFereshta Abbasi, a London-based researcher with Human Rights Watch’s Asia division, said girls are banned from attending secondary school, making any attempt to attend university an impossible dream.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd while some women are technically allowed to attend university, harsh conditions imposed by the Taliban — including a gender segregation policy — make it almost impossible for them to go.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s been exactly one year that girls haven’t gone to school,” Abbasi adds. “In the next couple of years, we won’t have any girls who are eligible or qualified to go to university.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVirtually all aspects of life have been dramatically altered for Afghan women. Before the fall of Kabul, women were allowed to travel without a man, and — at least in urban centers — were able to go to work and to parks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow, Amnesty International says, women and girls face a bleak future in which these rights have been largely rescinded.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The Taliban are deliberately depriving millions of women and girls of their human rights, and subjecting them to systematic discrimination,” said Agnès Callamard, the group secretary general, in July.\n\n\n\n“If the international community fails to act, it will be abandoning women and girls in Afghanistan, and undermining human rights everywhere.”\n\n\n\nThe Taliban will not allow girls back to secondary school. Some girls and parents are trying to find ways to keep education from stalling for a generation of young women. Associated Press-Ebrahim Noroozi\n\n\n\nWomen are also less likely to qualify for U.S. visas that might allow them to leave the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I weep. … Every day I see posts from other people who have money ready and are waiting for a flight or for their visas or an interview but can’t get out,” said Fatima. “Like me, I’m a woman and I worked for the U.S. government and for women’s rights, but unfortunately I remain in Afghanistan.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to statistics from Association of Wartime Allies (AWA), a member-based organization focused on saving the lives of Afghan and Iraqi applicants for Special Immigrant Visas (SIV), women make up less than 10 percent of the at-risk Afghan community who are able to apply for an SIV, due to men holding most of the military-related jobs making them eligible for the program.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, the State Department told The Hill that it does not track statistics for visas broken down by gender.\n\n\n\nIt added that it continues to receive and process submissions for Afghans who may be eligible for referral to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. \n\n\n\n\"We also continue to identify ways to support other Afghans at risk,\" a State Department spokesperson added.\n\n\n\nNow activists are demanding that the U.S. and the West open more avenues for women looking to seek asylum.\n\n\n\nAccording to Laura Deitz and Sara Gilliam, the co-founders of Task Force Nyx, an NGO that provides emergency humanitarian support to the most at-risk women activists, a significant portion of Afghan women employed by foreign organizations were tasked with sensitive jobs, such as running safehouses for victims of domestic violence or serving as legal advisers for victims of gender-based violence.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite the fact that these roles were often extremely risky, Dietz said women who did the work haven’t been given any sort of visa or referral pathways. Since the fall of Kabul, many of these women have been detained — and some tortured — by Taliban authorities, she said.\n\n\n\n“We’ve given them absolutely nowhere to go, and that isn’t just ‘we’, as in the United States, to be quite honest. That’s we, the West,” Gillam adds. “That’s where the global community should really be standing up for these women.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd while the international community struggles to find solutions, Afghan women are struggling to see a future that looks anything like what the U.S. promised over the past two decades.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I’ve had an ache in my heart for months from worrying too much. I know I cannot have a future in Afghanistan and I don’t have an avenue to leave,” Fatima says. “My daughters are seven and five. They must go to school at this age. I get depressed when I think of their future.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe State Department in an emailed response to The Hill’s request for comment for this article said, \"Our commitment to the people of Afghanistan is enduring. We will support Afghans in as many ways as we can by providing humanitarian assistance in partnership with the international community.\"\n\n\n\n\"We recognize it is currently extremely difficult for Afghans to depart Afghanistan or find a way to enter a third country, and they may face significant challenges fleeing to safety. The United States continues to call for safe passage for all those who wish to leave Afghanistan. We call on the Taliban to allow freedom of movement for all Afghans and strongly encourage Afghanistan’s neighbors and other countries to allow entry for Afghans seeking protection.\"  -State Department spokesperson in an email to The Hill.\n\n\n\nEven amid worsening conditions, some Afghan women in the country have resisted the Taliban.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the world marked the one year anniversary of the Taliban’s takeover of Afghanistan this month, around 40 women in Kabul took to the streets — despite the threat to their own safety — to protest their government's hard line, fundamentalist policies.\n\n\n\nThis resistance began mostly as an online campaign and has been most notable in Kabul, where on Aug. 13 Taliban fighters were forced to use guns to disperse a protest by women demanding “bread, work and freedom”. Women at the protest told the BBC that previous protests had been swiftly stamped out, often resulting in participants being beaten.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResistance has also spread to social media, where Afghan women and their supporters abroad have taken to sites including Twitter and Instagram to call on the international community to take action, using the hashtag \"BanTalibanTravel,\" which calls on the UN to re-apply a travel ban on the Taliban’s senior leadership.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn open letter from 15 organizations to the UN Security Council was careful to note that allowing a travel ban exemption for Taliban officials to expire would be a targeted gesture — applying to fewer than 15 people — but would send a strong message.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This action would not hurt ordinary Afghans, yet would effectively send a message that there is international accountability for the Taliban,” the letter said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Taliban government itself is far from the only challenge facing Afghan women today.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearch released by Women for Women International in March also highlighted deteriorating access to health care and water as a result of deteriorating infrastructure and a lack of services.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs an example, Abbasi notes that her 40-year-old aunt in the country’s Ghazni province died a “totally preventable death” as a result of a health care system unable to provide even basic services.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The lack of a health care system and health care services definitely impacts everyone but the effects are stronger on women, especially pregnant women and those who are breastfeeding,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to Abbasi, while some aid has been dispatched to the country in the past 12 months, the West’s refusal to recognize the Taliban government continues to stifle the banking system and wider economy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfghan women and their supporters abroad have taken to sites including Twitter and Instagram to call on the international community to take action, using the hashtag \"BanTalibanTravel\". Associated Press-Ebrahim Noroozi\n\n\n\nActivists are advocating for the U.S. to release $3.5 billion in frozen Afghan central bank funds in order to help the Afghan people. However, U.S. officials said last week that they had no immediate plans to do so, citing abiding terrorism concerns related to the Taliban.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“By withholding them, we are responsible for the continuing and deepening humanitarian crisis,” said Marie Clarke, chief programs officer for Women for Women International.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHeather Barr, the co-director of the Women’s Rights Division at Human Rights Watch, said the U.S. and its allies must take concrete steps that go beyond condemnation of the Taliban.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It's quite clear at this point who the Taliban are and what vision they have for Afghanistan, but what we keep asking is what will the world do about this in 2022,” she said. “There's been very little resembling actual concern where you do something as opposed to a level of concern where you just write a statement.”\n\n\n\nA Taliban spokesperson did not respond to The Hill’s request for comment. \n\n\n\nPrior to the fall of Kabul, Barr recalls, the international community was quick to “pat themselves” on the back for their work with Afghan women, such as through the State Department’s yearly Women of Courage Awards.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I would have felt like there was some kind of feeling for them. Maybe not an obligation, but that it would be embarrassing to one day just say ‘good luck ladies, take care’,” she said. “'You can’t go to school anymore, girls. That’s tough.’”",

        "title": "Religion in the public square",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/3617973-religion-in-the-public-square/",
        "description": "Conservative defenders of religious liberty are pushing a new version of an old argument: Liberals and secularists, they contend, will not protect religious liberty in the public square. What this means, conservatives argue, is that the secular left is only willing to tolerate religious practice in private locations, such as one’s home or house of worship. But If religious believers leave those cloistered environments, they will find that the special protection religious liberty receives does not follow them. It only remains in force behind closed doors. Thus, as Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito suggested in his recent speech in Rome, the liberty of religious individuals will not be respected by secularists “when you step outside into the public square in the light of day.”\n\n\n\nThere are two fundamental flaws with this argument, leaving aside the obvious rejoinder that it doesn’t seem to comport with the reality many of us experience. When Jehovah’s Witnesses or Mormons follow the dictates of their beliefs and (unsolicited) knock on my door to discuss their religion with me, that doesn’t seem like the proselytizing faithful are being restricted to their homes or temples.\n\n\n\nThe first flaw with the “religion is only protected in private outside of the public square” argument is that it confuses two understandings of what private and public mean. Private can connote something which is confidential and out of the hearing or sight of others. Public, in contrast, means out in the open and exposed to third parties. Under this understanding, religion is not and should not be excluded from the public square. It is a strawman argument to insist that secular people want religion to be hidden from view.\n\n\n\nThere is another understanding of private and public, however, and here there are legitimate and important concerns about religion in the public square. Private is understood as something owned and controlled by individuals and institutions that are not affiliated with or part of the government. A private sector business enterprise such as a Walmart store is an obvious example. But private here has nothing to do with the idea that private means out of sight or hidden. Walmart stores, like most private sector institutions, are fully visible and open to third parties.\n\n\n\nThe understanding of public is different here as well. When we speak of the public sector in comparison to the private sector, we are talking about government. Similarly, in discussing religious participation in the public square in this sense, we are referring to religious participation in government operations and activities. Both secular and many religious people recognize that when religion is involved in government — in the public square — religious liberty issues implicate distinctive concerns which need to be addressed.\n\n\n\nSignificant problems arise when religion is mixed into government activities and programs. For example, government officials often exercise discretionary authority in determining whether individuals will receive benefits or be subject to sanction. Given that reality, government officials or employees praying and proselytizing raises serious risks of religious coercion. This is true when public school teachers invite students to join them in prayer, when judges ask litigants and their attorneys to pray with them before a proceeding begins, or when welfare administrators proselytize potential beneficiaries.\n\n\n\nThere is no implicit coercion when a Jehovah’s Witness knocks on your door. They have no authority over your well being, and you can close the door as you see fit. Protecting their religious liberty does not undermine your freedom. A different dilemma confronts individuals addressed by government proselytizers.\n\n\n\nConsider another example. Government often funds non-governmental actors to provide public services. When religious institutions receive such contracts or grants, often for social welfare programs, once again we confront special problems. Often religious institutions insist on religious liberty grounds on the right to discriminate in hiring only the members of their own faith to staff these programs. It is one thing to recognize that privately funded religious institutions may use the donations they receive to promote their religious beliefs. It is a very different issue when religious institutions operating taxpayer funded programs claim the right to reserve the jobs created to staff these programs solely for members of their faith.\n\n\n\nA similar problem arises with regard to the beneficiaries of publicly funded programs. Most government funded programs are intended to serve the general public without regard to the religious beliefs of potential beneficiaries. Yet religious institutions may claim under the banner of religious liberty the authority to deny benefits to otherwise eligible beneficiaries who do not abide by the institution’s beliefs.\n\n\n\nWhen the public square is understood to be government, religion entering the square and receiving special religious liberty protection raises far more legitimate concerns than spurious claims about religious individuals surrendering their faith when they walk out the front door.\n\n\n\nThe second flaw involves the failure to recognize the overlap and tension between the free exercise of religion and freedom of speech. Religion is a powerful voice in American society. Religious exercise is often expressive in nature. Prayer, sermons, hymns, proselytizing are speech. They communicate messages. Often, the same activity can be accurately characterized as both religious exercise and speech.\n\n\n\nGiven this overlap, how are we to understand the argument that in the public square — that is, in public places like sidewalks or the lobby of a government office building — religious exercise should receive “special” protection beyond that provided to secular activities? Does this argument maintain that in these public places religious speech should receive more protection than secular speech?\n\n\n\nThis contention would violate the most basic and rigorously enforced principle of free speech doctrine: Viewpoint discrimination is prohibited unless it can be justified under the strictest scrutiny courts apply. The Supreme Court has held in numerous cases, such as Good News Club v. Milford Central School (2001), that religion is a viewpoint of speech. Accordingly, free speech doctrine prohibits government from engaging in viewpoint discrimination by providing religious expression and speakers lesser or greater protection than secular expression and speakers receive in the same marketplace of ideas. If the government prohibits leafletting or soliciting in the lobby of government office buildings, the standard of review for that regulation of speech should be applied with equal rigor, without regard to whether those distributing leaflets or soliciting funds consider their activities to be required by their faith.\n\n\n\nThus, even if we are discussing access to the open public places in our society, the public or town square, while religion cannot be denied access to such locations, when the religious exercise at issue is expression, it is not at all clear that it can be provided special protection beyond that provided to secular speech.\n\n\n\nAlan Brownstein is a professor of law emeritus at the University of California, Davis School of Law.

        "description": "Roland Mesnier, who served as White House pastry chef for five presidents, died on Friday at an assisted living home in Burke, Va., at the age of 78.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHis son, George Mesnier, told The Washington Post that he died due to complications from cancer. \n\n\n\nRoland Mesnier was first hired at the White House in 1979 by then-first lady Rosalynn Carter, according to the biography on his website. He became the longest-tenured chef to ever work there, making desserts for the sitting president and his family for more than a quarter of a century. \n\n\n\nHe retired from the White House in 2004 but returned on several occasions in the next two years to work on “special projects” for former President George W. Bush’s family.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe has also written multiple books, including a memoir of his time in the White House, entitled “All the Presidents' Pastries: Twenty-Five Years in the White House, a Memoir.” \n\n\n\nThe Post reported that Mesnier made large gingerbread houses while working as pastry chef as part of the White House’s Christmas tradition. He started planning for the holiday season in June. \n\n\n\nHe has said that his goal was to provide comfort to the president’s family, who are constantly under intense scrutiny, and to understand their tastes and preferences.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe followed a motto that “perfection is no accident,” and tasted every dessert that left his kitchen to ensure they were perfect.",

        "description": "The Reds have placed Mike Moustakas on the 10-day injured list with a left calf strain and selected the contract of Colin Moran, per Bobby Nightengale of the Cincinnati Enquirer (via Twitter).\nMoustakas never really got going this season, contributing -1.0 bWAR and a .214/.295/.345 triple-slash across 285 plate appearances. The soon-to-be 34-year-old, in his third season with the Reds, has one year (at $18MM) remaining on the four-year, $64MM deal he signed in December 2019 as the Reds geared up to compete in the (ultimately pandemic-shortened) 2020 season.\nThe Reds have since traded away several of their most valuable assets, of course (including Luis Castillo, Tyler Mahle, and Brandon Drury at the deadline and Sonny Gray, Jesse Winker, Eugenio Suarez, and Tucker Barnhart in the offseason), with Moustakas one of only a few veterans remaining from the 2020 club that secured a wild-card berth in the shortened season. Beyond the financial commitment, Moustakas&#8217; declining production and struggles with injury have made moving him difficult. Since arriving in Cincinnati, he&#8217;s compiled a .216/.300/.383 batting line &#8212; a substantial drop from his career .247/.308/.434 line &#8212; and he&#8217;s missed more than a third of 2022 already after appearing in only 62 games in 2021.\nMoran, taken by the Marlins as the sixth overall pick in the 2013 amateur draft, will get his third taste of the bigs this season as Moustakas&#8217; replacement. The corner infielder broke in with the Astros for short stints in both 2016 and 2017 before heading to Pittsburgh in 2018 as part of the package that netted Gerrit Cole. Moran had some success with the Pirates, compiling a .269/.333/.419 line across four seasons, but he was ultimately designated for assignment shortly before the lockout to clear a 40-man spot for Yoshi Tsutsugo.\nIn his prior two stints with the Reds this year, Moran has logged a comparatively meager .210/.299/.360 triple-slash in 117 plate appearances, well below his career .263/.327/.414 mark in a relatively small sample. He may well get a chance to build on those numbers for a rebuilding Reds squad, though. Moustakas and Donovan Solano had been sharing time at first since Joey Votto&#8217;s season ended in rotator cuff surgery, and Moran may well simply take over Moustakas&#8217; share of the playing time there. The club may also opt to take a more extended look at him, as he&#8217;ll remain eligible for arbitration in 2023.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/orioles-face-september-call-up-decisions-for-multiple-top-prospects.html",
        "description": "The Orioles &#8211; the surprise of the 2022 season &#8211; have some decisions to make about their September roster. The biggest decisions center on top prospects Grayson Rodriguez, DL Hall, and Gunnar Henderson, the 56th, 4th, and top-ranked prospects in the game, per Baseball America.\nHall and Henderson are under consideration to join the big league club when the rosters expand, and perhaps sooner, so says General Manager Mike Elias, tweets Nathan Ruiz of the Baltimore Sun. The plan has been for Hall to win the right to join the bullpen in September when rosters expand, but the evaluation process is dynamic, and nothing is guaranteed for the southpaw, who made his debut earlier this season. (It&#8217;s worth noting that, regardless of what happens this year, the plan remains for Hall to join the rotation next year.)\nFans are certainly eager to see this cluster of high-ceiling prospects in action, but they can put at least a modicum of trust in the process, as compared to seasons past. With the new CBA, the Orioles are freed from some of the service time concerns that have hampered clubs&#8217; decision-making under the prior collective bargaining agreement. With less than 45 service days remaining in the season, Baltimore has no service reasons to keep Henderson or Hall in the minors any longer, notes The Athletic&#8217;s Ken Rosenthal. If they feel the pair can help the big league club as they make a push for the playoffs, we should see them soon.\nFor Rodriguez, the issue is more a question of health than MLB readiness. He has yet to begin a rehab assignment as he recovers from a lat injury. Per Rich Dubroff of BaltimoreBaseball.com, Elias said, “I’m almost positive that we’re going to see him in real game action before the season’s over. As with any rehab assignment, we’ll start him in the lower minors and then we’ll get him back, hopefully, to the level in which he got injured, and we’ll take it from there.”\nOf course, Elias has more to think about than just the individual development of each of these high flyers. With the team unexpectantly pushing for a playoff spot, the Orioles should prioritize fielding the best team possible. Thrusting a young player into a playoff chase for a team that&#8217;s been so far from contention for so long is no small decision, however. Suddenly, the lights are bright in Baltimore. Elias must weigh the current needs of the team against the developmental hurdles in front of Henderson, Hall, and Rodriguez. Given the process and plan that Elias has instilled in this organization, he&#8217;s likely to want to maintain the long view, even amidst a playoff race.\nFor now, Orioles fans will have to content themselves with watching new face-of-the-franchise Adley Rutschman lead this team. Thus far, Rutschman has done everything promised to keep this Cinderella squad in the hunt. The 24-year-old backstop has slashed .253/.363/.442 with eight home runs across 320 plate appearances. Those numbers are 34 percent better than average, as evidenced by a 134 wRC+, which isn&#8217;t just remarkable for a catcher, or for a rookie, but for anyone in spikes.\nMaybe this will be the new normal for Baltimore, but especially in the AL East, where the competition will be top-shelf year after year, each opportunity for postseason play is precious. If nothing else, August/September baseball should matter in a way that Baltimore fans haven&#8217;t seen since the days of Buck Showalter, Manny Machado, and Zack Britton. If the kids come to play, all the better.",

Students gave USD high marks for its weather, beach-adjacent location, and a “campus so beautiful [that] most students spend time outside,” according to the Princeton Review.\n\n\n\nRounding out the top five were Bryn Mawr College, in Pennsylvania; the University of Richmond, in Virginia; Loyola Marymount University, in Los Angeles; and Vanderbilt University, in Nashville.\n\n\n\nA complete list of the top 25 \"most beautiful\" campuses can be found at PrincetonReview.com.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tWhite House calls out Greene, other GOP critics on how their own loans were forgiven\t\n\n\n\n\nAll of the Princeton Review's rankings are based on the survey results from more than 160,000 current students at 388 colleges throughout the country. Each student is instructed to answer 85 questions about their school’s academics, campus life and student body, and final rankings in any given category are based on students indicating “a very high consensus of opinion” in one of 50 different categories.\n\n\n\nThe Princeton Review itself also selects which colleges are chosen to participate — 388 in total for the 2023 edition — based on data its staff has collected (on the school’s offerings, faculty, etc.), recommendations from its advisory board, and student evaluations, according to Franek.\n\n\n\nAdditional information on the review’s methods, as well as its ranked lists in 49 other categories, can be found at the publication’s website.",

Our nation was envisioned and created — at great risk to their personal safety, as well as to that of their families — by Thomas Jefferson, James Madison, George Washington, John Hancock, John Adams and other Founding Fathers.\n\n\n\nYet, many on the political left want to “cancel” those founders.\n\n\n\nIn one of the latest examples of this cancel culture movement, following a year-long campaign, an elementary school in New Jersey has changed its name from honoring Thomas Jefferson to honoring Delia Bolden, the first Black woman to graduate from high school locally.\n\n\n\nAnother example involves an “inadvertent” proposal from the Virginia Department of Education, seeking to delete references to George Washington as the “Father of our Country” and to James Madison as the “Father of the Constitution.” It was a proposal that Virginia’s Republican governor, Glenn Youngkin, instantly condemned, making clear that his administration would “reinforce” the fact that the Founding Fathers did create our nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSaid the governor, “I believe we should tell our history accurately, the good and the bad. And part of the history we’re going to tell is that our Founding Fathers, including George Washington and James Madison, and let’s not forget about Thomas Jefferson and Patrick Henry and the others, played an extraordinary role in the founding of our nation.”\n\n\n\nThis comes on the heels of a recent protest in Boston to remove the name of Founding Father Peter Faneuil from historic Faneuil Hall in downtown Boston. Why? Because, according to one of the protestors, “We should not have the name of a white supremacist attached to a publicly-owned building. That’s who he was: a white supremacist, a human trafficker.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrior to that were recent articles in the New York Post and elsewhere, reporting that the homes of Jefferson and Madison, Monticello and Montpelier, respectively, are going “woke” and being turned against their legacies.\n\n\n\nJust before the July 4 weekend, a California school board member called for that holiday to be “boycotted,” rather than celebrated; some Arizona Democrats advertised a “F*** the Fourth” event; and city officials in Orlando, Fla., later apologized for a July 4 statement which said, in part, that “A lot of people probably don’t want to celebrate our nation right now, and we can’t blame them … .”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn May, an opinion column in The Washington Post called for the renaming of George Washington University. Why? You guessed it: Because the school, according to the columnist, is “rooted in systemic racism, institutional inequality and white supremacy.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd before that … well, you get the idea.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlarmingly — at least to me, since I spent the past year writing a book celebrating these Founding Fathers, the Fourth of July, and our seemingly disappearing rights and liberties — the desire to cancel our Founders, to sandblast their names from buildings, remove their statues and belittle their genius, courage and sacrifice, appears to be a growing, potentially unstoppable trend.\n\n\n\nIt should not be.\n\n\n\nIf our history is bad, let’s condemn it and learn from it. If our history is good, let’s praise it and build upon it. But let’s not cancel our shared history, which is what totalitarian regimes do.\n\n\n\nMany of these attacks and the canceling of the Founding Fathers comes down to the subject of slavery. The practice of slavery was — and in some places, remains — obscene, a crime against humanity. On this subject, President Biden recently declared: “Great nations don’t hide from their slavery.”\n\n\n\nHe is absolutely correct — but I would add this: “Great and free nations also don’t cancel their history.”\n\n\n\nTo view the actions and what might have been in the minds, hearts and souls of those men born some 300 years ago via the increasingly biased prism of 2022 is not only problematic; it can be irresponsible, too. Yet that is precisely what is occurring in some quarters.\n\n\n\nThis growing list of Founding Fathers labeled as “white supremacist” means we are defining, diminishing and dismissing them over one issue. And any of the significant, valuable contributions they made to the creation of our republic are being deemed irrelevant.\n\n\n\nInstead of focusing on centuries-dead men, those who condemn a single dimension of our Founders should consider using their time, energy and resources to tackle the slavery and human trafficking going on in today’s world. Look no further than China for modern-day slavery and labor-camp abuses, or any city in the world where you happen to be at the moment for human-trafficking abuses.\n\n\n\nAs for the rest of us, rather than standing idly by while some try to twist, rewrite or cancel our shared history, can’t we discuss or debate the subject of our Founders and their pasts?\n\n\n\nHistory is history. It should never be “written by the victors,” nor canceled by those unwilling to learn from it.\n\n\n\nDouglas MacKinnon, a political and communications consultant, was a writer in the White House for Presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W.

        "description": "The federal government is set to suspend its offer of free at-home COVID-19 tests by Friday, Sept. 2, without congressional authorization for an extension. \n\n\n\nThe U.S. Postal Service’s page for ordering the tests states that orders will pause by next Friday “or sooner if supplies run out.” \n\n\n\n“Ordering through this program will be suspended on Friday, September 2 because Congress hasn’t provided additional funding to replenish the nation’s stockpile of tests,” a message on the federal government’s COVID-19 website reads. \n\n\n\nThe Biden administration originally announced that it would offer 1 billion free at-home COVID-19 tests in January. The federal government used COVID-19 funding from the American Rescue Plan, President Biden’s $1.9 trillion economic stimulus and COVID-19 recovery package that he signed into law last year. \n\n\n\nBiden has since offered additional rounds of tests for Americans to order, most recently in May. Households could order an additional eight tests in the most recent round. \n\n\n\nThe seven-day rolling average of COVID-19 cases has declined slightly in recent weeks following an increase fueled by the highly contagious BA.5 omicron subvariant. But a senior administration official told USA Today that the government needs to hold on to tests for a possible rise in the fall. \n\n\n\nThe official said that the administration will use its existing “limited” resources to obtain as many tests as it can, but distribution could resume on a large scale if Congress provides the funding for it.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/rays-option-ryan-yarbrough-recall-garrett-cleavinger.html",
        "description": "The Rays have optioned left-hander Ryan Yarbrough to Triple-A Durham today and recalled fellow lefty Garrett Cleavinger to take his place, the team announced today. Yarbrough had started last night&#8217;s game against the Red Sox, and as the Rays have two days off next week, his next turn in rotation may have been skipped regardless.\nIndeed, with rosters set to expand to 28 on the first of September, the move could well be a temporary measure to give manager Kevin Cash an extra arm in the bullpen. The move marks the first trip to the Rays&#8217; active roster for Cleavinger, who was acquired from the Dodgers in an under-the-radar deadline move that sent minor league outfielder German Tapia to Los Angeles. In 4 1/3 innings across four games with the Dodgers this season, the 28-year-old southpaw posted an unsightly 10.38 ERA (and 2.08 WHIP), though he&#8217;s compiled a 2.37 ERA across 31 Triple-A innings between Oklahoma City and Durham. In the majors, he&#8217;s thus far posted a 4.70 ERA (6.25 FIP) across 23 innings in parts of three seasons with the Phillies and Dodgers.\nThe move marks the latest setback in what&#8217;s been an up-and-down year for the 30-year-old Yarbrough. After opening the season on the IL with groin tightness, the lefty has struggled to find consistent success, posting a 4.87 ERA (4.49 FIP) across 68 1/3 innings in the same sort of hybrid role he&#8217;s occupied since his 2018 debut.\nWhile these numbers bear a striking resemblance to his 2021 output (5.11 ERA, 4.45 FIP), they still fall well short of his career marks (4.37 ERA, 4.10 FIP). Yarbrough&#8217;s advanced stats don&#8217;t offer a clear reason for the decline. His strikeout rate has dropped a bit, from 20.3% across his first three seasons to 17.9 % in the last two, but he&#8217;s continued to limit hard contact, allowing a hard-hit rate (the percent of balls in play with an exit velocity of 95 mph or more) of only 29.6%, nearly 10% below the league-wide average while his walk rate has inched downwards.\nRegardless of the cause of the dip, it will be interesting to see how the Tampa front office handles Yarbrough in the offseason. He&#8217;s making $3.85MM this season in his second season of arbitration eligibility and could be a non-tender candidate for the financially constrained Rays.",

        "description": "Raheem Sterling has always known how to make a big impression. His first two goals since joining Chelsea from Manchester City set up a much-needed victory for Thomas Tuchel’s side despite a spirited late comeback from Leicester after Conor Gallagher was shown a red card in the first half.Sitting in the stands as he served a one-match touchline ban following his spat with his Tottenham counterpart, Antonio Conte, a fortnight ago, Tuchel could only watch in horror at the England midfielder’s meltdown as he was sent off in only his second senior appearance for the club he joined at the age of eight.

        "description": "Brighton stretched their unbeaten Premier League streak to a club-record nine games after Pascal Gross’s second-half strike earned a deserved win over Leeds. The hosts squandered a host of chances at the Amex Stadium before Gross coolly claimed his third goal of the season.Leeds were second best for much of a frustrating afternoon in which manager Jesse Marsch was shown a second-half yellow card following persistent petulant touchline behaviour. He slammed the ball into the turf after his side were awarded a free-kick and then sarcastically applauded the referee, Michael Salisbury. Continue reading...",

Protesters blocked roads in northern Kosovo over new rules requiring Kosovo Serbs to use Kosovo-issued car license plates and for people entering the country to receive special entry documents from September 1. \n\n\n\nThe increasing tensions prompted NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg to say last week that peacekeeping forces were “ready to do more” in Kosovo if needed.",

        "description": "The US author on trying to add a note of optimism to her work, getting advice from Jeanette Winterson, and her prescient new novel about a coup in WashingtonAM Homes, 60, is the author of 12 books, including 1996’s The End of Alice, narrated by a jailed paedophile, Music for Torching (1999), about the build-up to a school shooting, and May We Be Forgiven, which won the 2013 Women’s prize for fiction, leaving the judges “laughing out loud [in] fear or horror as much as anything else”. Her new novel, The Unfolding, follows a Republican donor plotting a coup in the wake of Barack Obama’s election. Homes, raised in Washington DC, spoke from New York, where she teaches at Columbia University.What led you to write The Unfolding?I was trying to illustrate how we got to where we are now by looking at 2008, but I’d started it well before Donald Trump was even seeming to be a candidate. It’s not the first time I’ve been writing about something that then comes into being in some way: Music for Torching came out three weeks before the Columbine shooting. I started experimenting with the ideas in the story A Prize for Every Player [collected in Days of Awe, 2018], where a guy at a store is nominated to run for president by other shoppers because they feel no one in the political establishment understands them. That sense isn’t new, but what was on my mind was the way that the problem has been intensified by the influx of dark money, which incentivises American politicians to care for corporations rather than people.The novel’s title refers to a family drama as well as a political one…You can go down a rabbit hole with politics, because it’s the stuff of nonfiction. I was talking to Jeanette Winterson about how hard it was and she said: “Stay with the characters!” It made me pay more attention to the women in the book: the [protagonist’s] mother and daughter feel paralysed by the power of the men in their life and the secrets they’ve been asked to keep. Meghan is up against that horrible moment young women come to – these days especially – when they’re led to believe they can do anything and then see, as they become teenagers, that it’s somehow harder to claim space that’s not sort of sexualised or playing some sort of role. We want to believe that opportunity exists for women now; it does and it doesn’t.Did you feel overtaken by events when you saw the Capitol riots?This novel took a long time to write – 10 years – and I had wanted it to be out before the last election: I was so upset, like: “Oh man, the timing’s all messed up now.” But after 6 January my friend said: “It’s really good it didn’t come out; you’d be in big trouble.” When I was first talking to my editors about my idea, they listened carefully and literally said: “I dunno, it sounds kinda out there… you don’t write science fiction.” That diverted me to other things – I teach full-time, I write TV [Homes has written for The L Word, among other series] and have a family – but I couldn’t let it go, and the horrifying thing was it started not to be science fiction at all.Was it hard to inhabit a political mindset you don’t share?Telling things from the point of view of the least likely character [for me to write about] is something I’ve often done. There’s going to have to be some kind of reconciliation, or confrontation, with this incredible divide in the country. It’s terrifying that so many people would not recognise the delusion of Trump’s refusal to acknowledge he lost the election. We have this heavily armed society of people who don’t trust each other: talk about scary. At one point, my English editor called and said: “I don’t know if I’m not getting something, but these guys keep talking about wanting to preserve democracy – is that right?” I’m like: “Yes, because that word now means different things to different people; their democracy is one thing, our democracy is another.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "President Joe Biden’s historic Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022 has been&nbsp;hailed&nbsp;as “the most significant U.S. climate law ever enacted.” To earn this title, it supplanted a climate law signed by former President Donald Trump. History shows that while the IRA was a Democratic initiative, it builds on Republican-backed laws that have brought economic development to all 50 states. We will need bipartisan leadership going forward to advance effective solutions to climate change.\n\n\n\nOn Dec. 27, 2020, Trump lent his signature to a bipartisan appropriations&nbsp;law&nbsp;that extended tax credits for solar, wind and carbon capture technologies. It also initiated a major reduction in hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), which are highly potent greenhouse gases. Leading environmentalists&nbsp;celebrated&nbsp;the act as the most&nbsp;significant&nbsp;federal climate law to that point.\n\n\n\nDemocrats were able to pass the IRA, which also includes health and tax provisions, along party lines through the budget reconciliation process because they control the House, Senate and White House. Had the climate provisions been considered as part of a bipartisan package, there may have been some Republican support for pieces of the bill. Clean energy incentives in the IRA and the December 2020 appropriations bill evolved from laws with bipartisan roots.\n\n\n\nIowa’s Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley is the original&nbsp;author&nbsp;of the wind energy production tax credit (PTC), which was established in 1992. The solar investment tax credit (ITC) was established in 2005 through an energy law signed by Republican President George W. Bush. These marquee policies, which were extended in the IRA, helped wind and solar energy&nbsp;grow&nbsp;to produce 12 percent of U.S. electricity in 2021, and become the&nbsp;leading&nbsp;sources of new generating capacity in recent years.&nbsp;Half&nbsp;of the top 10 states for wind and&nbsp;four&nbsp;of the top 10 states for solar are represented by Republican U.S. senators.\n\n\n\nRenewable energy is not alone in benefiting from tax breaks. Among other policies, fossil fuels continue to benefit from the percentage depletion allowance, which has been in the tax code for oil and gas&nbsp;since&nbsp;1926 and coal since 1932. While the first scientific paper linking greenhouse gases with climate warming was published by&nbsp;Eunice Newton Foote&nbsp;in 1856, it was over a century before carbon management for fossil resources was widely discussed. The tax credit for carbon capture, use and storage (CCUS) was first&nbsp;signed&nbsp;into law by Bush in 2008. Projects that capture carbon dioxide from smokestacks or directly from the air are already helping reduce emissions and will play a greater role going forward.\n\n\n\nThe IRA builds on the tradition of incentivizing energy production and provides a decade-long window of policy certainty for renewable energy, energy storage, carbon capture, hydrogen, nuclear, clean energy manufacturing, clean cars and clean fuels. Over the next decade, this “all of the above” approach to clean energy will lead to investment throughout the country, create more than 9 million&nbsp;jobs, and&nbsp;save&nbsp;up to $220 per year for the average American electric consumer.&nbsp;Realizing these investments will bolster America’s leadership in addressing climate change with benefits to both red states and blue states.\n\n\n\nWyoming Republican Sen. John Barrasso recently&nbsp;said, “We all believe climate change is real. We believe mankind is certainly contributing to that. And we also believe that if China and India don't do things, even if we were to go to zero emissions in the United States, the global emissions continue to go up.”\n\n\n\nHe is right that we need to work with other countries on climate. American leadership has helped solve global environmental problems before. The Montreal Protocol, a treaty signed by President Ronald Reagan,&nbsp;successfully&nbsp;addressed ozone-depleting gases. While we have a&nbsp;long&nbsp;way to go on carbon, other nations, including&nbsp;China&nbsp;and&nbsp;India, are investing in clean energy, too. North Dakota Republican Sen. Kevin Cramer made a strong&nbsp;case&nbsp;for the U.S. to use its leadership position within the Paris climate agreement “to latch onto what unifies us and promulgate it to the world.” He suggested we do this by marketing our carbon capture and nuclear technologies abroad.\n\n\n\nThis month’s historic climate bill will help the United States do just that. The Paris Agreement sets up a framework for international cooperation that will only be successful if nations act. With the IRA incentives in place, the United States can&nbsp;cut&nbsp;greenhouse gas emissions 40 percent below 2005 levels. This puts us in a better position to market our homegrown technologies worldwide and help other countries meet their commitments. We will need to continue progress to achieve President Biden’s&nbsp;goal&nbsp;of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\n\n\n\nWhile climate change is a global issue, the investments unlocked by the IRA will be&nbsp;implemented&nbsp;at the state and local level through permitting decisions for electric generating projects, transmissions lines and carbon capture proposals. At its best, the law could encourage large-scale expansion of U.S. manufacturing, new clean energy jobs and economic diversification for communities, with&nbsp;targeted&nbsp;investments in oil, gas and coal producing areas. Americans will need leaders from both sides of the aisle to foster this economic opportunity. Initiatives from Democrats and Republicans have gotten us where we are today, and bipartisan cooperation will be needed to maximize the deployment of climate solutions going forward.\n\n\n\nTom Carlson is board president for the Mid-Atlantic Renewable Energy Coalition. He is also director of regulatory and legislative affairs for EDF Renewables as well as the government affairs co-lead for the company's joint venture Atlantic Shores Offshore Wind.",

        "description": "Police in Texas have arrested a woman on charges of assault bodily injury and making terroristic threats after a video appeared to show her verbally and physically attacking a group of Indian American women. \n\n\n\nThe Plano Police Department, located in northern Texas near Dallas, said in a Facebook post that officers responded to a disturbance in a parking lot of a business at around 8:15 p.m. local time on Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA release from the department states that several women told officers upon arrival that another woman assaulted them in the parking lot. An officer completed a report for the two charges against the woman based on witness statements. \n\n\n\nPolice detectives arrested Esmeralda Upton, a resident of Plano, on Thursday afternoon on the charges, and her bail was set at $10,000. \n\n\n\nPolice are investigating the incident as a hate crime, and they may bring additional charges against Upton, the release states.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne of the women present recorded a video of the incident. The video shows a woman yelling at them to “go back to India,” adding, “we don’t want you here.” \n\n\n\nThe video shows the woman hitting the person recording, and later on, one woman at the scene calls the police. The woman walks away on a few occasions but then returns and attempts to strike the other women at times. \n\n\n\nThe woman said that she is Mexican American and was born in this country and has “paid her way here.” She repeatedly uses expletives while yelling at the women, according to the footage.  \n\n\n\nThe police department said in a post on Friday that it had received questions about why Upton was not arrested at the scene. The department said an arrest was not made immediately because the criminal offenses did not occur in officers’ presence, and they needed an arrest warrant to take her into custody. \n\n\n\n“The Texas Code of Criminal Procedure (CCP) outlines the arrest authority of Texas peace officers. The offenses committed by Ms. Upton were misdemeanor crimes,” the post states. \"Based on the CCP, Texas peace officers, generally, can arrest for misdemeanors when the offenses occur in their presence.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe department said it is working with the FBI and Justice Department’s civil rights division, and the incident may also be a hate crime under federal law.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/braves-place-jackson-stephens-on-7-day-il-recall-jay-jackson.html",
        "description": "The Braves placed right-hander Jackson Stephens on the 7-day concussion IL and recalled fellow righty Jay Jackson, the team announced today. Per Justin Toscano of the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Stephens has been diagnosed with a mild concussion. He suffered the injury when a Brendan Donovan liner ricocheted off his forehead in the ninth inning of the Braves&#8217; blowout win over the Cardinals last night.\nShould Jackson find his way into a game, it&#8217;ll be his first action with the Braves, though his recall marks his second stint with the big-league club this year. He had previously been called up when Max Fried went on the concussion IL earlier this month but did not enter a game.\nIn 56 1/3 innings in the majors across parts of three seasons with the Padres, Brewers, and Giants, the 34-year-old &#8212; who also spent three years pitching in Japan for the Hiroshima Carp &#8212; owns a 4.31 ERA (4.22 FIP) as well as a stellar 32.6% strikeout rate and a not-so-stellar 12.8% walk rate. He&#8217;s performed admirably in limited action for Triple-A Gwinnett this year, posting a 1.72 ERA in 15 2/3 innings with a 29.5% strikeout rate and a much more palatable 4.9% walk rate.\nStephens, who hadn&#8217;t appeared in a major league game since a 2018 stint with the Reds heading into the season, had been something of a revelation at the back end of a top-notch Braves bullpen. While bad luck against the Cardinals last night marred his season numbers somewhat, he still owns a 3.89 ERA (3.56 FIP) in 44 innings across 32 appearances. In a bullpen that also includes Kenley Jansen, A.J. Minter, Tyler Matzek, Colin McHugh, and Raisel Iglesias (who essentially took the place of Will Smith), Stephens has mostly pitched in low-leverage situations, though not exclusively.\nIt isn&#8217;t yet clear how long Stephens will be out, but he&#8217;s probably a safe bet for the Braves&#8217; postseason roster, presuming he&#8217;s back and ready to pitch by then. Jackson may benefit from the forthcoming expansion of rosters on the first of September, though the Braves have a pair of pitchers nearing return (Darren O&#8217;Day and Mike Soroka, who&#8217;s slated to make his third rehab start today as he works his way back from a pair of achilles tears) that could well create a roster crunch sooner than later, even with an extra spot available in the bullpen.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/red-sox-option-jarren-duran-to-triple-a-worcester.html",
        "description": "The Red Sox have optioned outfielder Jarren Duran to Triple-A Worcester, reports Chris Cottilo of MassLive (Julian McWilliams of the Boston Globe had earlier reported that Duran&#8217;s locker was empty, suggesting such a move had occurred). The move opens a roster spot for the return of Trevor Story, who&#8217;s been activated from the 10-day IL and is in the starting lineup for today&#8217;s game against the Rays.\nWhile the move may be short-lived with rosters set to expand to 28 in a few days, it will represent a disappointment for Duran, a consensus top-100 prospect entering the season. Though by no means entirely overmatched in the big leagues, Duran&#8217;s batting line &#8212; .220/.283/.365 in 219 plate appearances &#8212; fell well short of the stellar .305/.379/.531 line he posted in Triple-A in roughly the same sample.\nMeanwhile, the combination of Duran&#8217;s demotion and Story&#8217;s return could have something of a cascading effect on the Red Sox lineup, likely pushing Enrique Hernandez to more regular duty in center field and Christian Arroyo to first base, at least until Eric Hosmer returns from injury (per Ian Browne of MLB.com). In addition to offering a bit more defensive stability, Story&#8217;s return adds some much-needed power potential to Alex Cora&#8217;s lineup card, even as Story has limped to a career-worst .221/.289/.423 batting line in his first year in Boston.\nEven if Story returns to form, though, the Red Sox would need a minor miracle to salvage what&#8217;s been a disappointing season in Beantown. Despite high expectations and a hot start, the club has been beset by injuries to the pitching staff (including to would-be ace Chris Sale, who suffered a broken wrist in a cycling accident just as he&#8217;d returned from a series of baseball-related injuries) and currently sits in last place in the AL East and 8 games behind the Mariners for the American League&#8217;s final wild card spot.\nThe Sox also face a rather uncertain future, with J.D. Martinez, Nathan Eovaldi, Michael Wacha, Rich Hill, and Hernandez all set to enter free agency at season&#8217;s end, with Xander Bogaerts an effective lock to exercise his opt-out clause and join them after pre-season extension talks broke down. Third baseman Rafael Devers remains under team control through next season but will be a free agent thereafter, also a likelihood given the similar impasse reached between player and club in pre-season discussions.",

        "description": "The U.S. intelligence community will evaluate the potential national security risks stemming from former President Donald Trump’s possession of top-secret documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told top lawmakers. In a letter obtained by POLITICO and dated Friday, Haines told House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) that her office will lead an “assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents.” “The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) are working together to facilitate a classification review of relevant materials, including those recovered during the search,” Haines wrote, adding that the review will be conducted in a way that “does not unduly interfere with DOJ’s ongoing criminal investigation.” The correspondence represents the Biden administration’s first known engagement with Congress on the issue of the ongoing investigation ensnaring the former president. Court documents unsealed in recent days have revealed that the Justice Department is investigating potential violations of the Presidential Records Act, the Espionage Act, and obstruction of justice. It’s also the first known acknowledgment by the intelligence community of the potential harm caused by the missing documents, which prosecutors said Friday included human-source intelligence and information gathered from foreign intercepts. Top lawmakers have been clamoring for details about the substance of the documents since the Aug. 8 search of Mar-a-Lago, but so far neither the intelligence committees nor congressional leaders part of the so-called Gang of Eight have been briefed. Haines’ response came on the same day that a federal judge unsealed a redacted version of the affidavit that laid out the Justice Department’s justification for obtaining a search warrant for Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit revealed that prosecutors believed Trump was holding a range of top-secret documents at his private residence, including some of the former president’s handwritten notes. “We are pleased that in response to our inquiry, Director Haines has confirmed that the Intelligence Community and Department of Justice are assessing the damage caused by the improper storage of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago,” Schiff and Maloney said in a joint statement to POLITICO. “The DOJ affidavit, partially unsealed yesterday, affirms our grave concern that among the documents stored at Mar-a-Lago were those that could endanger human sources. It is critical that the IC move swiftly to assess and, if necessary, to mitigate the damage done — a process that should proceed in parallel with DOJ’s criminal investigation.” The intelligence community’s review is likely to encompass whether any unauthorized individuals had access to the highly sensitive documents. The Justice Department previously raised alarms about the lax security of the records within Trump’s estate. That question could also bear on the criminal probe, as Justice Department counterintelligence investigators determine whether the highly classified records were compromised in any way. The Senate Intelligence Committee has also asked the intelligence community to conduct a damage assessment related to Trump’s handling of the documents, but the inquiry was bipartisan. The panel’s chair, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), and vice chair, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), both signed onto the request. In addition to informing Maloney and Schiff of her office’s intent to conduct a damage assessment, Haines sent a similar response to Warner and Rubio on Friday. The Senate duo also asked the Justice Department to give the committee access to the specific documents that were seized from Mar-a-Lago. A wider group of congressional leaders asked to see the documents, too. In a statement earlier Saturday, Rubio noted that the Justice Department hasn’t yet responded to the committee’s letter, but made no reference to Haines’ response. “The Senate Intelligence Committee is still waiting for information from the Department of Justice about the specific intelligence documents seized from Mar-a-Lago and what necessitated an unprecedented search warrant on President Trump’s residence,” Rubio said. Kyle Cheney contributed to this report.",

        "description": "A New Mexico man was arrested on Friday after he allegedly tried to create an ISIS training center in the state, according to the Department of Justice (DOJ).\n\n\n\nA DOJ release states that a federal grand jury indicted 45-year-old Herman Wilson, also known as Bilal Mu’Min Abdullah, on Tuesday on charges that he attempted to provide material support to a designated foreign terrorist organization and attempted to obstruct, influence and impede at least one official proceeding. \n\n\n\nCourt records state that Wilson allegedly attempted to provide material support to ISIS between January 2020 and November 2021 by trying to establish an “Islamic State Center” in New Mexico to teach ISIS ideology, provide training in martial arts and tactical maneuvers and serve as a “safe haven” for people planning to travel and fight for ISIS.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe release also states that Wilson allegedly helped run an online platform from May 2019 to September 2020 to promote ISIS teachings, recruit others and discuss terrorist attacks in the United States and around the world.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWilson allegedly attempted to obstruct, influence and impede at least one official proceeding by ordering and inducing the destruction of records in shutting the platform down, per the DOJ.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo individuals who were arrested in September 2020 and later pleaded guilty to&nbsp;providing material support to ISIS said Wilson radicalized them to support ISIS, according to the release. After they were arrested, Wilson allegedly ordered platform members to destroy evidence that they used the online group.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWilson could face up to 20 years in prison for each count if convicted.",

        "description": "As a new academic year for medical students begins, I’m excited for the next generation of physicians to start their careers in medicine. However, like many of these students, I’m also nervous: The increase in student debt has created significant roadblocks to physicians who want to enter the primary care profession and practice in underserved communities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile the administration’s&nbsp;recent actions&nbsp;to cancel some debt for eligible borrowers and extend the student loan pause through the end of the year are welcomed as positive steps forward, Congress must enact permanent solutions to address medical student debt and our shrinking primary care workforce.\n\n\n\nAccording to a&nbsp;2021 report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, “primary care is the only health care component where an increased supply is associated with better population health and more equitable outcomes.” Yet, the U.S. will need as many as&nbsp;48,000&nbsp;more primary care physicians in the next decade, and according to the Association of American Medical Colleges, the average medical school debt among the class of 2021 was&nbsp;$200,000. Physicians will incur the same cost for their medical education whether they enter primary care or sub-specialist fields, but once they complete their training, primary care physicians may face more challenges managing their debt compared to higher-paid surgical and procedure-focused specialty physicians.\n\n\n\nWith the above in mind, the health care community faces a workforce and an equity problem: We need more doctors to practice in underserved communities, yet that is where salaries may be lower. While the administration has made efforts to alleviate the burden of student debt and address our health care workforce shortage, we need to focus on programs that will encourage more medical students to choose primary care, as well as break down real and perceived barriers to practicing medicine in underserved communities.\n\n\n\nStudent debt is a major source of stress for medical students, residents and new physicians. Loan forgiveness programs, such as the&nbsp;Public Service Loan Forgiveness&nbsp;program, have become a potential lifeline for those struggling with student debt. These programs, and others like it, must be expanded at the federal level to improve access to health care in underserved communities, diversify the health care workforce, advance health equity and address the physician shortage. Legislation like the&nbsp;REDI Act&nbsp;allows medical students to qualify for interest-free deferment on their student loans while in a residency training program, creating more financial viability for physicians to specialize in family medicine and primary care.\n\n\n\nThere’s also an urgent need for increased investment in federal programs that incentivize physicians to practice in rural and medically underserved areas. One example is the&nbsp;National Health Service Corps&nbsp;(NHSC) program, which offers scholarships, loan repayments or coverage of the full cost of medical school tuition as incentives for physicians to enter primary care and deliver care for Americans in rural and underserved areas. By addressing student debt burdens, the NHSC program helps to expand health care access to our most vulnerable communities and ensures medical education opportunities for people who may not have thought it was within reach.\n\n\n\nAs a practicing family physician in a rural community, I know that if the government doesn’t incentivize students to pursue family medicine and primary care, we are going to continue to see a severe shortage of physicians in rural and underserved areas — something we as a society cannot afford. Recent data from the Health Resources and Services Administration shows that the number of people who live in a health professional shortage area has increased to over&nbsp;95 million people&nbsp;— reaffirming the need for increased and targeted federal investment in primary care. More is at stake: For individuals living in many underserved areas, care by a family physician or primary care doctor is often the only option for meeting their health care needs.\n\n\n\nAs our future doctors start medical school, we hope our nation’s leaders will enact policy solutions that address the crippling burden of student debt and invest in high-quality primary care, which will improve health outcomes and equity. We need solutions that encourage medical students and early career physicians to follow their hearts and career goals versus only following the money. We need solutions that promote the health of each of our communities by making it easier for doctors to practice in underserved areas, and solutions that ensure our health care system is equitable for all.\n\n\n\nSterling N. Ransone Jr. is a family physician and president of the American Academy of Family Physicians.&nbsp;The AAFP represents 127,600 physicians and medical students nationwide.&nbsp;",

        "description": "The White Sox announced a series of roster moves today, including placing right-hander Lance Lynn on the bereavement list and third baseman Yoan Moncada on the 10-day injured list with a left hamstring strain. To take their places on the active roster, the club reinstated utilityman Leury Garcia from the 10-day IL and recalled right-hander Davis Martin from Triple-A Charlotte.\nThis is the second hamstring-related IL stint of the season for Moncada, who missed 10 days due to a strain in his right hamstring back in June. That absence followed a longer IL stint at the start of the season due to an oblique strain, which delayed Moncada&#8217;s 2022 debut until May. All of these injuries have contributed to a miserable season for the third baseman, who has only a .197/.269/.313 slash line over 324 plate appearances.\nThe White Sox in general have been hampered by injury absences all year long, and Moncada joins other regulars in Tim Anderson and Yasmani Grandal as current members of the IL. Garcia&#8217;s return will help make up some of that depth in the infield, though Garcia is himself struggling through a mediocre year at the plate. Garcia, Josh Harrison, and rookie Romy Gonzalez now figure to split duties between third and second base.",

        "description": "The Phillies have activated outfielder Brandon Marsh from the 10-day IL, the team announced today. Outfielder Bradley Zimmer was designated for assignment, opening a spot for Marsh on the active roster.\nThe 24-year-old second-year outfielder, who arrived in Philadelphia in a deadline deal that sent catching prospect Logan O&#8217;Hoppe to the Angels, had hardly had a chanced to get his feet wet in Philly before a sprained left ankle sent him to the IL. The injury was evidently fairly minor, however, as Marsh&#8217;s activation comes on his first day of eligibility.\nMarsh will likely take over center field duties for the Phils, though he may also share time with the versatile Matt Vierling, who had split time in center with Zimmer in Marsh&#8217;s absence. Given yesterday&#8217;s return of Bryce Harper to the DH slot, which forces both Kyle Schwarber and Nick Castellanos to play the field to keep their bats in the lineup, center field takes on added importance in Philadelphia.\nFortunately for the Philly faithful, Marsh has rated out as a bit above-average defensively by most metrics, though his offensive production has lagged a bit. For his short career, he owns a .239/.299/.352 batting line (good for an 81 wRC+), including a .228/.285/.349 mark (78 wRC+) in 2022, though playing his home games in Philadelphia&#8217;s hitter-friendly Citizen&#8217;s Bank Park should help those numbers.\nThe 29-year-old Zimmer, who also rates out as above-average with the glove but owns a .215/.300/.337 career triple-slash, may opt to stick it out with the Phillies if he goes unclaimed, though he could be picked up by a contender in need of a glove-first reserve outfielder. Still, he&#8217;ll likely be looking for his fourth (or fifth) major league team in the offseason. After appearing in parts of five season with Cleveland, he began 2022 with the Blue Jays before he was claimed by the Phillies the same day Marsh hit the IL.",

        "description": "Google announced back in March of this year that its Google Play Games service would be coming to Windows PCs, breaking mobile gaming free of, well, mobile devices and expanding it to more players, more devices, and more possibilities. In particular, mouse and keyboard support as well as support for game controllers make these titles previously bound to your handset capable of being played on larger screens with more inputs.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the desktop app was only launched in select Eastern countries at first, primarily because mobile gaming is much larger there than it is in Western countries due to the perception and culture surrounding micro-transactions.\n\n\n\nNow, the previously closed beta has launched as an open beta and Google has invited South Korea, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Thailand, and Australia in to test it and provide feedback. Everyone else will have to add themselves to the waitlist to be notified when it becomes available for download and installation in their regions.\n\n\n\nOn top of that, Google Play Games will now require lower hardware specs to play. In fact, the company has cut the demand in half, asking gamers to have a 4-core CPU and 10GB of free storage space on their PC as opposed to the 8-core and 20GB requirement it used to hold.\n\n\n\nLastly, Google is hoping to ensure there is plenty for users to play when they finally fire up the full-fledged piece of software and has added more than twice as many games to its desktop catalog over the past few months. I can&#8217;t wait to get my hands on Play Games for Windows, and will be fully reviewing it in the future. I hope the desktop UI hits Chromebooks and replaces the Android-style layout of the app, but I&#8217;m not holding my breath at this time.\n\n\n\n&#x201C;In the last few months, we have more than doubled our Google Play Games catalog to 50+ titles, which can be played on Windows PCs via a standalone application built by Google. Our catalog includes many of the most popular mobile games in the world including Summoners War, Cookie Run: Kingdom, Last Fortress: Underground, and Top War. Together, these games are played by hundreds of millions of players globally,&#x201D;Google Play Games\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "To celebrate the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11 the Smithsonian projected the image of a Saturn V taking off on the Washington Monument. It was a stunning display that half a million spectators, including myself, went to see on the National Mall. Afterward, I was walking home when I overheard a young girl ask her mother, “Why haven’t we gone back to the moon?” This was an innocent yet vital question.\n\n\n\nSince the termination of NASA’s Apollo program, America has failed to successfully sustain a beyond low-Earth orbit (LEO) human spaceflight program. When it came to going beyond LEO, failure wasn’t just an option, it was a near certainty. Past presidential administrations have initiated numerous programs, none of which came to fruition. I watched NASA’s credibility in the international space community deteriorate with each consecutive failure. Every time there was a change in White House leadership, prior plans were abandoned, and new strategies introduced that later suffered the same fate.\n\n\n\nNASA’s 13th Administrator Jim Bridenstine was determined to break this pernicious cycle of failure and ensure the success of the newly established Artemis program, dedicated to sending humanity to the moon and Mars. Bridenstine recognized that creating a sustainable program required two key ingredients, the first of which was bipartisanship. From its conception, the Artemis program has not been a Republican program or a Democratic program, it is an American program — one that represents the best that this country has to offer. Visionary Democratic leaders such as Sens. Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), and John Hickenlooper (D-Colo,), as well as Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.), all joined with Bridenstine to establish unprecedented bipartisan support for Artemis. Bipartisan statements in favor of the Artemis program helped reassure trepidatious international partner nations, some of which were on the verge of aligning with China which has been viewed as a more reliable partner for beyond LEO space exploration.\n\n\n\nThese international partners represent the other key to Artemis’s success. While the U.S. has failed to implement a sustainable human lunar mission, the opposite has been true in Earth orbit. Specifically, the International Space Station has been and remains the crown jewel of global human spaceflight. For over 20 years a group of international astronauts have lived and worked in this singular research facility, an extraordinary accomplishment that deserves a Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\n\nA key difference between the Space Station’s success and the failure of past NASA lunar programs is international participation. International participation brings not only additional resources, but vital sustainability. Therefore, international participation was built into the very fabric of the Artemis program and manifested via the Artemis Accords.\n\n\n\nThe accords provide international partners the opportunity to explicitly join the Artemis program while also committing to principles reinforcing and implementing UN treaties. In less than two years, 21 countries have signed the Artemis Accords, nine under the previous administration and now an additional 12 under the existing White House leadership. Vice President Kamala Harris deserves a great deal of personal credit for her strong support of the Artemis Accords, which she has been an ambassador for while meeting with heads of state around the world. The accords will ensure that the Artemis program is the broadest and most diverse human spaceflight initiative in history, making Artemis a truly global effort and one that will secure a peaceful and prosperous future in space for all of humanity to enjoy.\n\n\n\nWhile technical issues can be challenging, I’ve always believed that politics have an equal if not greater impact on a space program’s likelihood of success. There is no rocket equation for Congress, which is why sustaining a program to return humanity to the moon has remained so elusive. After decades of failure, leaders from across multiple administrations have overcome the odds to do what hasn’t been accomplished in decades. People like former Vice President Mike Pence, who set the course back to the moon with Space Policy Directive One, and Scott Pace, who led a newly reformed National Space Council, and then Biden administration officials from Bhavya Lal who defended Artemis during a dangerous transitory period as senior White House appointee at NASA, Deputy Administrator Pam Melroy, who has supported Artemis in a variety of roles long before the program was named, and of course Bill Nelson, who has boldly led the way for a return to the moon with alacrity both as a Senator and now as the 14th NASA administrator.\n\n\n\nWhen a diverse group of astronauts from America and the Accords family of nations set foot on the moon, it will be because government and industry leaders put aside their differences to embrace the unifying vision of Artemis. This is a singular accomplishment that will help build a better future for all of us here on Earth. The Space Launch System, the most powerful rocket in the history of humanity, along with numerous commercial rockets, will soon transform Artemis from concept to reality. The flame of these rockets will serve as a light pushing back the darkness of disease, disunity and despair.\n\n\n\nI don’t know where the young girl is now who asked the question about why we haven’t returned to the moon. However, I hope that in the coming months and years, she will look up into the sky, see the answer, and be inspired to join the Artemis journey.\n\n\n\nMike Gold is executive vice president of civil space and external affairs at aerospace company Redwire, and previously served as NASA associate administrator for Space Policy and Partnerships, and as acting administrator for the Office of International and Interagency Relations.",

        "description": "A Department of Transportation agency declared a regional energy emergency for four Midwestern states on Saturday after a fire at an oil refinery in Indiana forced the facility to shut down.\n\n\n\nThe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration made the declaration to address the need for the immediate transportation of gasoline, diesel and jet fuel for Illinois, Indiana, Michigan and Wisconsin.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe declaration allows the states to be exempt from certain federal regulations to manage the emergency.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt will permit motor carriers and drivers providing direct, related assistance to the impacted states not to abide by regulations setting a maximum driving time.\n\n\n\nThe declaration states that drivers are required to take a 10-hour break when moving from emergency relief efforts to normal operations if the total amount of time they engage in emergency relief efforts exceeds 14 hours. This regulation also applies if the total amount of time combined from emergency relief and normal operations exceeds 14 hours.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nReuters reported on Wednesday that BP shut down some of its units at its Whiting, Ind., refinery due to an electrical fire. The fire was extinguished, and the company said it was deciding when the affected units would restart.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere were no injuries. The refinery handles more than 430,000 barrels per day, according to Reuters. \n\n\n\nIt provides about 20 to 25 percent of the refined gas, diesel and jet fuel that the four states collectively use.\n\n\n\nWhiting is located on Lake Michigan, near the state’s border with Illinois.\n\n\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) issued an executive order on Saturday to exempt motor carriers and drivers transporting gas and diesel fuel from the maximum weekly driving and on-duty limits. The order also accelerates the transition to the fall fuel supply and takes advantage of existing stocks of fuel.\n\n\n\n\"The impacts of the outage at the Whiting facility will be widespread across our region, and I am taking proactive steps to help Michiganders get the fuel they need to drive their cars and help businesses keep their products moving,\" she said in a release. \"With today’s action, I am freeing up more gas supply and removing any impediments to gas delivery to cut down wait times at stations.\"\n\n\n\nThe release states the order will take effect immediately and last as long as the emergency continues or the end of the day on Sept. 15, whichever is first",

        "description": "This computer-generated image shows the formation of a zygote after fertilization. Some Republican-led states, including Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Oklahoma, have passed laws declaring that life begins at fertilization, a contention that opens the door to a host of pregnancy-related litigation.Anatomical Travelogue/Science SourceAs life-preserving medical technology advanced in the second half of the 20th century, doctors and families were faced with a thorny decision, one with weighty legal and moral implications: How should we define when life ends? Cardiopulmonary bypass machines could keep the blood pumping and ventilators could maintain breathing long after a patient&#x27;s natural ability to perform those vital functions had ceased.After decades of deliberations involving physicians, bioethicists, attorneys, and theologians, a U.S. presidential commission in 1981 settled on a scientifically derived dividing line between life and death that has endured, more or less, ever since: A person was considered dead when the entire brain — including the brainstem, its most primitive portion — was no longer functioning, even if other vital functions could be maintained indefinitely through artificial life support.In the decades since, the committee&#x27;s criteria have served as a foundation for laws in most states adopting brain death as a standard for legal death.Now, with the overturning of Roe v. Wade and dozens of states rushing to impose abortion restrictions, American society is engaged in a chaotic race to define the other pole of human existence: When exactly does human life begin? At conception, the hint of a heartbeat, a first breath, the ability to survive outside the womb with the help of the latest technology?A legal and political maelstromThat we&#x27;ve been able to devise and apply uniform clinical standards for when life ends, but not when it begins, is due largely to the legal and political maelstrom around abortion. And in the two months since the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion in Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization, eliminating a long-standing federal right to abortion, state legislators are eagerly bounding into that void, looking to codify into law assorted definitions of life that carry profound repercussions for abortion rights, birth control, and assisted reproduction, as well as civil and criminal law.&quot;The court said that when life begins is up to whoever is running your state — whether they are wrong or not, or you agree with them or not,&quot; said Mary Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California-Davis who has written several books on the history of abortion.Unlike the debate over death, which delved into exquisite medical and scientific detail, the legislative scramble to determine when life&#x27;s building blocks reach a threshold that warrants government protection as human life has generally ignored the input of mainstream medical professionals.Instead, red states across much of the South and portions of the Midwest are adopting language drafted by elected officials that is informed by conservative Christian doctrine, often with little scientific underpinning.A handful of Republican-led states, including Arkansas, Kentucky, Missouri, and Oklahoma, have passed laws declaring that life begins at fertilization, a contention that opens the door to a host of pregnancy-related litigation. This includes wrongful death lawsuits brought on behalf of the estate of an embryo by disgruntled ex-partners against physicians and women who end a pregnancy or even miscarry. (One such lawsuit is underway in Arizona. Another reached the Alabama Supreme Court.)In Kentucky, the law outlawing abortion uses morally explosive terms to define pregnancy as &quot;the human female reproductive condition of having a living unborn human being within her body throughout the entire embryonic and fetal stages of the unborn child from fertilization to full gestation and childbirth.&quot;Several other states, including Georgia, have adopted measures equating life with the point at which an embryo&#x27;s nascent cardiac activity can be detected by an ultrasound, at around six weeks of gestation. Many such laws mischaracterize the flickering electrical impulses detectible at that stage as a heartbeat, including in Georgia, whose Department of Revenue recently announced that &quot;any unborn child with a detectable human heartbeat&quot; can be claimed as a dependent.Defining the role of government in life and deathThe Supreme Court&#x27;s 1973 decision in Roe v. Wade that established a constitutional right to abortion did not define a moment when life begins. The opinion, written by Justice Harry Blackmun, observed that the Constitution does not provide a definition of &quot;person,&quot; though it extends protections to those born or naturalized in the U.S. The court majority made note of the many disparate views among religions and scientists on when life begins, and concluded it was not up to the states to adopt one theory of life.Instead, Roe created a framework intended to balance a pregnant woman&#x27;s right to make decisions about her body with a public interest in protecting potential human life. That decision and a key ruling that followed generally recognized a woman&#x27;s right to abortion up to the point medical professionals judge a fetus viable to survive outside the uterus, at about 24 weeks of gestation.In decisively overturning Roe in June, the Supreme Court&#x27;s conservative majority drew on legal arguments that have shaped another contentious end-of-life issue. The legal standard employed in Dobbs — that there is no right to abortion in the federal Constitution and that states can decide on their own — is the same rationale used in 1997 when the Supreme Court said terminally ill people did not have a constitutional right to medically assisted death. That decision, Washington v. Glucksberg, is mentioned 15 times in the majority opinion for Dobbs and a concurrence by Justice Clarence Thomas.Often, the same groups that have led the fight to outlaw abortion have also challenged medical aid-in-dying laws. Even after Dobbs, so-called right-to-die laws remain far less common than those codifying state abortion rights. Ten states allow physicians to prescribe lethal doses of medicine for terminally ill patients. Doctors are still prohibited from administering the drugs.James Bopp, general counsel for the National Right to Life Committee who has been central to the efforts to outlaw abortion, said that both abortion and medically assisted death, which he refers to as physician-assisted suicide, endanger society.&quot;Every individual human life has inherent value and is sacred,&quot; said Bopp. &quot;The government has the duty to protect that life.&quot;Both issues raise profound societal questions: Can the government keep a patient on life support against his wishes, or force a woman to give birth? Can states bar their own residents from going to other states to end a pregnancy, or prohibit out-of-state patients from coming in to seek medically assisted death? And who gets to decide, particularly if the answer imposes a singular religious viewpoint?A philosophical quandaryJust as there are legal implications that flow from determining a person&#x27;s death, from organ donation to inheritance, the implied rights held by a legally recognized zygote are potentially vast. Will death certificates be issued for every lost pregnancy? Will miscarriages be investigated? When will Social Security numbers be issued? How will census counts be tallied and congressional districts drawn?Medical professionals and bioethicists caution that both the beginning and end of life are complicated biological processes that are not defined by a single identifiable moment — and are ill suited to the political arena.&quot;Unfortunately, biological occurrences are not events, they are processes,&quot; said David Magnus, director of the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics.Moreover, asking doctors &quot;What is life?&quot; or &quot;What is death?&quot; may miss the point, said Magnus: &quot;Medicine can answer the question &#x27;When does a biological organism cease to exist?&#x27; But they can&#x27;t answer the question &#x27;When does a person begin or end?&#x27; because those are metaphysical issues.&quot;Ben Sarbey, a doctoral candidate in Duke University&#x27;s department of philosophy who studies medical ethics, echoed that perspective, recounting the Paradox of the Heap, a thought experiment that involves placing grains of sand one on top of the next. The philosophical quandary is this: At what point do those grains of sand become something more — a heap?&quot;We&#x27;re going to have a rough time placing a dividing line that this counts as a person and this does not count as a person,&quot; he said. &quot;Many things count as life — a sperm counts as life, a person in a persistent vegetative state counts as life — but does that constitute a person that we should be protecting?&quot;Even as debate over the court&#x27;s abortion decision percolates, the 1981 federal statute that grew out of the presidential committee&#x27;s findings, the Uniform Determination of Death Act, is also under review. This year, the Uniform Law Commission, a nonpartisan group of legal experts that drafts laws intended for adoption in multiple states, has taken up the work to revisit the definition of death.The group will consider sharpening the medical standards for brain death in light of advances in the understanding of brain function. And they will look to address lingering questions raised in recent years as families and religious groups have waged heated legal battles over terminating artificial life support for patients with no brain wave activity.Bopp, with the National Right to Life Committee, is among those serving on advisory panels for the effort, along with an array of doctors, philosophers, and medical ethicists. The concept of &quot;personhood&quot; that infuses the anti-abortion movement&#x27;s broader push for fetal rights is expected to be an underlying topic, albeit in mirror image: When does a life form cease being a person?Magnus, who is also serving on an advisory panel, has no doubt the commission will reach a consensus, a sober resolution rooted in science. What&#x27;s less clear, he said, is whether in today&#x27;s political environment that updated definition will hold the same sway, an enduring legal standard embraced across states.KHN (Kaiser Health News) is a national newsroom that produces in-depth journalism about health issues.

        "description": "Ukraine’s state energy operator warned there is a risk of a radioactive leak at the country’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant amid shelling by Russian forces.\n\n\n\nRussia has “repeatedly shelled” the site, Europe’s biggest nuclear facility, over recent days, the operator, Energoatom, said in a statement on Saturday.\n\n\n\n“As a result of periodic shelling, the infrastructure of the station has been damaged, there are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is high,” Energoatom said.\n\n\n\n“Due to the presence of the Russian military, their weapons, equipment and explosives at the power plant, there are serious risks for the safe operation” of the nuclear facility, it said.\n\n\n\nThe Russian Defense Ministry countered that Ukraine had fired shells at the plant.\n\n\n\nEnergoatom said the Russian military at the power plant are preparing for the arrival of a team of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\n\n\nThe team from the United Nation’s nuclear watchdog could arrive at the site as early as next week, the New York Times reported. A list of the team’s members seen by newspaper includes the IAEA’s chief, Rafael Mariano Grossi, and 13 other experts from mostly neutral countries, according to the report. Neither the U.S. nor Britain is represented on the team, it said.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Russia blocked an agreement at the UN that was aimed at bolstering the nuclear non-proliferation treaty (NPT), reportedly over the wording of a reference to the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant in the text.",

        "description": "Anyone running ChromeOS on the beta or developer channels will no doubt be familiar with the fact that Google has been testing a brand spanking new &#8220;Personalization Hub&#8221; that has become a powerhouse for well, personalizing the operating system to one&#8217;s liking. In the past, we&#8217;ve covered how Google Photos, a slide show, light and dark mode, and other features have been housed in this revamped &#8220;Wallpaper&#8221; app, making it so much more.\n\n\n\nToday, I launched my &#8220;Personalization Hub&#8221; only to find that it had new iconography to go with the slew of new features mentioned above. Instead of the image below featuring a paintbrush in a circle, the standard image icon of a mountain and a cloud came up. Underneath it are four colored dots, no doubt meant to indicate personalization. You can see the new icon in the feature image for this article!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough we reported on the previous logo, we always knew it was meant to be a temporary placeholder until the hub was fully rolled out and feature complete. However, I never really expected the finalized logo to be so gorgeous and fitting with the rest of the recently released icon set reworks. It&#8217;s obvious that the same person designed the lot of them, and whoever it is truly deserves a raise. As a UX and web designer myself, I can appreciate how gorgeous these new images are making ChromeOS as a whole, and I hope we see more in the future.\n\n\n\nI&#8217;m not sure when this new icon for the &#8220;Personalization Hub&#8221; &#8211; now known as the &#8220;Wallpaper &amp; Style&#8221; app &#8211; will be rolled out to everyone on the stable version of the OS, but it shouldn&#8217;t be long if you don&#8217;t already have it. I&#8217;m running ChromeOS beta, but I&#8217;m fairly certain you&#8217;ll also have the refresh either now or very soon. Let me know in the comments what you think about it, and if you prefer the paintbrush instead!\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

They were extremely unfortunate to lose at Nottingham Forest, there’s little shame in losing to Manchester City, and Brighton can be awkward opponents for any side, but especially West Ham, who now haven’t beaten them in 11 attempts. All together, though, these three defeats with no goals scored have West Ham bottom of the table. Sunday’s meeting with a struggling Aston Villa comes with a distinct sense of pressure.There were boos at full time at the London Stadium last Sunday. They were probably born of frustration at that day’s performance rather than at anything more general, but West Ham have now lost eight of their last 10 games, the only win coming against a doomed Norwich.

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Ars Technica)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's the weekend, which means it's time for another Dealmaster. Our latest roundup of the best tech deals from around the web includes the lowest price we've tracked for Apple's 10.2-inch iPad, which is currently down to $280 at various retailers. That's about $50 off Apple's MSRP and roughly $25 off the average street price we've seen online in recent months.\nYou can read our review from last September for more details, but in short, we consider the 10.2-inch iPad to be the best option for most people in the market for an Apple tablet. Yes, its A13 Bionic chip isn't as powerful as the M1 SoC found in the iPad Air and iPad Pro, and the device's older design language means it lacks the USB-C ports, laminated touchscreens, upgraded cameras, and wider accessory support of those higher-end models. The 64GB of storage in this entry-level variant isn't a ton, either. But as a pleasant-to-use screen for reading, streaming, web browsing, and playing the occasional game, the base iPad is still plenty competent. It's fast enough for the essentials, it's still usable for lighter work when paired with a good keyboard case, and it supports all the same apps as any other iPad. It's a boring device, but it works, and it remains a significant step-up from cheaper Android tablets. Most importantly, it's far and away the most affordable iPad, particularly at this deal price.\nThe caveat here is that Apple is expected to introduce a new entry-level iPad by the end of the year. We don't expect a refreshed model to arrive during the company's just-announced September 7 event, but if history holds, we could very well see it announced in October. Recent rumors suggest this new model could feature a major redesign that brings the device more in line with the look and feel of the iPad Air, iPad Pro, and iPad Mini. (This could also result in a removal of the 3.5mm headphone jack, though it's hard to say that for sure just yet.) Either way, if you don't need a new tablet right now, it's probably worth waiting. But if you do, this is a new low for a tablet that was already a decent value.Read 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Wade, Patty Pansing Brooks almost became the first Democrat to represent Nebraska’s 1st Congressional District in more than half a century.\n\n\n\nShe lost to Rep. Mike Flood (R), a fellow state senator, by 6,234 votes in a special election on June 28 spurred by the resignation of nine-term Republican Rep. Jeff Fortenberry (R).\n\n\n\nNow Pansing Brooks and Flood are set for a rematch in November’s general election. And the Democrat is hoping to use her opponent’s brief voting record in Congress against him, highlighting Flood’s opposition to federal protections for contraceptives, abortion and same-sex and interracial marriage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We know a lot,” Pansing Brooks told The Hill. “I mean that special election was almost a gift because it’s given us the path to victory and helps us to understand what we have to do, where we have to be.”\n\n\n\nA number of the House votes came in response to a concurring opinion from Justice Clarence Thomas in the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the constitutional right to abortion, in which he suggested revisiting a number of other rights related to privacy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPansing Brooks said the votes are also personal to her, as the mother of a 25-year-old daughter and two sons, one of whom is gay. She said her son told her that if marriage protections look to be in jeopardy, he and his partner could do a wedding quickly.\n\n\n\n“But that’s not fair, I don’t want that to be quick,” Pansing Brooks said. “I want to be there; I want to be part of it. So it just, to me, this is heartrending times we’re in. It’s like a gut-kick on thing after thing.”\n\n\n\nFlood, through his campaign, declined multiple requests for an interview.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTodd Watson, who is leading the team helping the Nebraska GOP transition to new leadership, said the special election was significant because Flood won despite the national headwinds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWatson said Democrats were “highly motivated, highly charged” following mass shootings in Buffalo, N.Y., and Uvalde, Texas, as well the Supreme Court ruling on abortion, and yet Pansing Brooks still lost.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I don’t think there’s any external forces that were really in our favor at that time, and we still kind of carried that day,” Watson told The Hill. “We’re looking forward to doing our part for the red wave and seeing significant change.”\n\n\n\nPansing Brooks said if she had another week after the court’s ruling on abortion, things might have turned out differently.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They hadn’t had a moment to take a breath and say, ‘Oh my gosh, our first vote. Our first ability to say not just no but heck no,’ ” she said.\n\n\n\nBut on Aug. 2, with more time to prepare, Kansans across the border rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed the state legislature the authority to restrict abortion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat momentum has continued for Democrats in Minnesota and New York who have outperformed President Biden’s 2020 results. This has fueled hopes Democrats will fend off an expected “red wave” of Republican victories. \n\n\n\nDavid Wasserman, the senior editor of U.S. House and redistricting for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report, told The Hill “it’s clear that Democrats' energy level is up,” but he expects Republicans to have a larger advantage in the fall.\n\n\n\nHe also noted the Nebraska race is still rated “solid Republican,” though continued momentum in Democrats’ direction could cause reconsideration, which would take improvements in Biden’s approval rating and a further focus on abortion.\n\n\n\nWasserman tweeted Tuesday that Cook Political Report’s House outlook in May was a GOP gain of 20-35 seats, but “recent developments” have revised this to a 10-20 GOP gain with a Democratic hold in the House “not out of the question.”\n\n\n\nPansing Brooks ran a “robust campaign” where Democrats hadn’t run one in a long time, Wasserman said, tapping into anger in the four days after the Supreme Court’s ruling\n\n\n\n“It was a good performance for Democrats, and it’s possible to win by losing sometimes,” he added. “This was a moral victory for Democrats.”\n\n\n\nOther Democratic candidates in Nebraska also see cause for optimism from the closer-than-expected special election, including state Sen. Tony Vargas (D), who is looking to unseat three-term Rep. Don Bacon (R) in Nebraska’s 2nd District.\n\n\n\nLike Pansing Brooks, Vargas said his strategy is emphasizing “pain points” for voters, including access to abortion and struggles to pay for rent, gas, health care and prescription drugs amid high inflation.\n\n\n\n“That is what’s on the ballot here this November,” Vargas said. “That is going to be what turns the tide here in Nebraska’s 2nd District.”\n\n\n\nDerek Oden, Bacon’s campaign manager, said his candidate was spotlighting similar “pocketbook” issues, as well as immigration and the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago. And he shrugged off the notion that abortion rights would be a decisive issue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This idea that Roe v. Wade is just going to sort of totally drive up turnout and squash Republican energy, I don’t think that’s necessarily the case,” Oden said. “I think voters are still waiting to decide.”\n\n\n\nBacon beat Rep. Brad Ashford (D) in 2016 on the same ticket as former President Trump, and he went on to win in 2018 — a “blue wave” year — and again in 2020.\n\n\n\nAfter the Nebraska special election and Kansans rejected the abortion amendment, Cook Political Report moved the second district from “likely Republican” to “toss-up.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJohn Hibbing, a political science professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, said the June outcome was a “good sign” for Democrats in November, even though the president’s party usually gets “shellacked” in midterms.\n\n\n\nThe last time Nebraska sent a Democrat to the U.S. House from the 1st District was Rep. Clair Callan, who won in 1964 (and then lost two years later). And though Republicans still have a heavy advantage in the district, Pansing Brooks may have the track record to reach beyond party lines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPansing Brooks, an attorney finishing up her eighth and final year in the Nebraska legislature, was a Republican most of her life, which included a stint as co-chair of the local county GOP in the late 1980s. In 2008, however, she switched parties as her support for abortion and LGBTQ rights clashed with new party positions, according to the Omaha World-Herald.\n\n\n\nFlood served in Nebraska’s unicameral statehouse for 10 years, including as Speaker for six years in which he was elected the state’s youngest and longest-serving leader in that legislature. In 1999, before politics, he founded Flood Communications, which owns a host of local television and radio stations that cover statewide news. He is also an attorney.\n\n\n\nHibbing said that while Lincoln, the state’s capital city, is growing — helping Democrats, who do better in urban areas — overcoming GOP dominance in rural parts of the district is “too high a hill to climb right now.”\n\n\n\n“Hope’s one thing but actually winning the seat’s another,” Hibbing said. “And I still don’t see Democrats having a good chance to do that, even with a bump that they’re getting because of the Dobbs decision or various other things.”\n\n\n\nHowever, other leading Democrats are, perhaps unsurprisingly, more optimistic.\n\n\n\nState Sens. Carol Blood (D), who is running for governor, and Machaela Cavanaugh (D), who is seeking reelection, see the special election as evidence people want the government out of private decisions.\n\n\n\n“That’s true in Nebraska, it’s true in Kansas and it’s true across the country,” Cavanaugh told The Hill. “This is not a winning issue for anyone who wants to hinder women’s rights to reproductive health; it is a losing issue.”\n\n\n\nCavanaugh is one of two Democrats targeted by Republicans for voting against a proposed abortion ban this spring, which failed to advance in the unicameral legislature by two votes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNebraska Gov. Pete Ricketts (R) announced on Aug. 9 that there would not be a special session on abortion after senators failed to garner the necessary votes, though Republicans likely would have had the votes had Pansing Brooks been elected to Congress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNebraska Democratic Party Chair Jane Kleeb said the election showed the effects of work on the ground, but she expressed frustration at the lack of national Democratic support for Pansing Brooks.\n\n\n\n“We don’t need outside consultants or outside kind of magical tools that the latest vendors are selling,” Kleeb said. “What we need is resources from national party groups to actually believe and invest in what’s happening on the ground.”\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said the committee is focused on the Vargas-Bacon match-up as the party’s “best chance at success,” and one of 33 seats the committee is seeking to flip blue.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the National Republican Congressional Committee said the margins of the special election were closer than anticipated, but that Democratic hopes for an even better outcome in November were “probably misplaced.”\n\n\n\nStill, Doug Heye, a Republican strategist, said there has been “some cause for concern” as the election focus shifts from President Biden’s unpopularity to talking about Trump again, with some Republicans in Congress lobbing threats of investigating the Justice Department and the FBI over its search of the former president’s resort property should they take the House chamber next year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHeye still envisions a “good night” in November, with Biden’s approval rating less than Obama’s was before the 2010 midterms, when Republicans saw a wave of victories — including a 64-seat pickup in the House.\n\n\n\n“Most of the grounds should be fertile for Republican gains if they can stay out of their own way,” Heye said. “This is giving Democrats some hope and Republicans some concern, but that overriding approval rating for Biden still is a very significant factor.”",

        "description": "A newly released FBI document helps flesh out the contours of an investigation into classified material at former President Donald Trump&#x27;s Florida estate. But plenty of questions remain, especially because half the affidavit, which spelled out the FBI&#x27;s rationale for searching the property, was blacked out.That document, which the FBI submitted so it could get a warrant to search Trump&#x27;s winter home, provides new details about the volume and top secret nature of what was retrieved from Mar-a-Lago in January. It shows how Justice Department officials had raised concerns months before the search that closely held government secrets were being illegally stored and before they returned in August with a court-approved warrant and located even more classified records at the property.It all raises questions whether a crime was committed and, if so, by whom. Answers may not come quickly.A department official this month described the investigation as in its early stages, suggesting more work is ahead as investigators review the documents they removed and continue interviewing witnesses. Intelligence officials will simultaneously conduct an assessment of any risk to national security potentially created by the documents being disclosed.At a minimum, the investigation presents a political distraction for Trump as he lays the groundwork for a potential presidential run.Then there&#x27;s the obvious legal peril.A look at what&#x27;s next:What is the FBI investigating?None of the government&#x27;s legal filings released so far singles out Trump — or anyone else — as a potential target of the investigation. But the warrant and accompanying affidavit make clear the investigation is active and criminal in nature.The department is investigating potential violations of multiple laws, including an Espionage Act statute that governs gathering, transmitting or losing national defense information. The other laws deal with the mutilation and removal of records as well as well as the destruction, alteration or falsification of records in federal investigations.The inquiry began quietly with a referral from the National Archives and Records Administration, which retrieved 15 boxes of records from Mar-a-Lago in January — 14 of which were found to contain classified information. All told, the FBI affidavit said, officials found 184 documents bearing classification markings, including some suggesting they contained information from highly sensitive human sources. Several had what appeared to be Trump&#x27;s handwritten notes, the affidavit says.The FBI has spent months investigating how the documents made their way from the White House to Mar-a-Lago, whether any other classified records might exist at the property. The bureau also has tried to identify the person or people &quot;who may have removed or retained classified information without authorization and/or in an unauthorized space,&quot; the affidavit states.So far the FBI has interviewed a &quot;significant number of civilian witnesses,&quot; according to a Justice Department brief unsealed Friday, and is seeking &quot;further information&quot; from them. The FBI has not identified all &quot;potential criminal confederates nor located all evidence related to its investigation.&quot;Will anyone be charged?It&#x27;s hard to say at this point. To get a search warrant, federal agents must persuade a judge that probable cause exists to believe there&#x27;s evidence of a crime at the location they want to search.But search warrants aren&#x27;t automatic precursors to a criminal prosecution and they certainly don&#x27;t signal that charges are imminent.The laws at issue are felonies that carry prison sentences.One law, involving the mishandling of national defense information, has been used in recent years in the prosecution of a government contractor who stowed reams of sensitive records at his Maryland home (he was sentenced to nine years in prison) and a National Security Agency employee who transmitted classified information to someone who was not authorized to receive it (the case is pending).Attorney General Merrick Garland hasn&#x27;t revealed his thinking on the matter. Asked last month about Trump in the context of a separate investigation into the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, he responded that &quot;no person is above the law.&quot;What has Trump argued?Trump, irate over the records investigation, issued a statement Friday saying that he and his team have cooperated with the Justice Department and that his representatives &quot;GAVE THEM MUCH.&quot;That&#x27;s at odds with the portrayal of the Trump team in the affidavit and the fact that the FBI search occurred despite warnings months earlier that the documents were not being properly stored and that there was no safe location for them anywhere in Mar-a-Lago.A letter made public as part of the affidavit forecasts the arguments the Trump legal team intends to advance as the investigation proceeds. The May 25 letter from lawyer M. Evan Corcoran to Jay Bratt, the head of the Justice Department&#x27;s counterintelligence, articulates a robust, expansive view of executive power.Corcoran asserted that it was a &quot;bedrock principle&quot; that a president has absolute authority to declassify documents — though he doesn&#x27;t actually say that Trump did so. He also said the primary law governing the mishandling of classified information doesn&#x27;t apply to the president.The statute that he cited in the letter was not among the ones the affidavit suggests that Justice Department is basing its investigation on. And in a footnote in the affidavit, an FBI agent observed that the law about national defense information does not use the term classified information.What has the Biden administration said?The White House has been notably circumspect about the investigation, with officials repeatedly saying they will let the Justice Department do its job.The director of national intelligence, Avril Haines, notified Congress on Friday that her office would lead a classification review of the documents recovered during the search. Intelligence officials will also conduct an assessment of any potential risk to national security, Haines wrote the leaders of two House committees who had requested it.In the letter, Haines said any intelligence assessment will be &quot;conducted in a manner that does not unduly interfere with&quot; the criminal investigation.President Joe Biden appeared Friday to mock the idea that Trump could have simply declassified all the documents in his possession, telling reporters, &quot;I just want you to know I&#x27;ve declassified everything in the world. I&#x27;m president I can do — c&#x27;mon!&quot;He then said he would &quot;let the Justice Department take care of it.&quot;",

        "description": "The Brewers have selected the contract of outfielder Garrett Mitchell and placed outfielder Jonathan Davis on the 10-day IL with a right elbow effusion, the team announced. It will be the first taste of the majors for Mitchell, a former UCLA star and Milwaukee&#8217;s first-round pick (20th overall) in the 2020 amateur draft.\nMitchell has spent much of his season at the Double-A level this season, hitting .277/.353/.428 over 187 plate appearances.  This earned him a promotion to Triple-A for the first time, with Mitchell responding by delivering even more offense (.343/.435/.466) in 85 PA.  Unfortunately, Mitchell also missed about two months on the injured list due to an oblique strain, but he has made up for lost time with his strong Triple-A performance and now on the verge of his MLB debut.\nA leg injury also limited Mitchell&#8217;s first pro season to 64 minor league games (roughly split between high-A and Double-A ball) in 2021, so simply staying healthy has been a bit of an issue for the 23-year-old.  His lack of hitting progress was also some concern, as scouting reports for both Baseball America and MLB Pipeline indicated that Mitchell hit too many grounders and didn&#8217;t exhibit enough power.  To this end, Mitchell&#8217;s offensive numbers could be fueled more by some excellent batted-ball luck &#8212; a .378 BABIP at Double-A and a .444 BABIP at Triple-A.\nHowever, Mitchell also has the elite speed that lends itself to high BABIP numbers.  Both Pipeline and BA give him 80-grade speed, and between those wheels and an excellent glove and throwing arm, Mitchell&#8217;s defense already seems more than Major League-caliber.  This is good news for a Milwaukee team that has been looking for a regular center fielder, and with Tyrone Taylor also exhibiting some good glovework, the Brewers could use Mitchell and Taylor in a lefty/righty platoon that could at least solidify things defensively up the middle.",

Kate Brown (D) invoked the state’s Emergency Conflagration Act on Saturday after a massive fire erupted in southwest Oregon.\n\n\n\nThe Rum Creek Fire poses a “threat to life, safety, and property,” according to Brown’s declaration, qualifying for additional resources provided by the state.\n\n\n\n“It is important for all Oregonians to be prepared, follow all evacuation orders, and continue to follow local and statewide fire prevention regulations to keep our communities safe and our natural resources protected,” Brown said in the statement.\n\n\n\nUnder the Act, the Oregon Office of State Fire Marshal (OSFM) can now be dispatched to work with the state’s Department of Forestry (ODF) in fighting the fire, a threat which “exceeds the firefighting capabilities of local firefighting personnel and equipment.”\n\n\n\nThe fire, which is near Galice in Josephine County, has reached 4,700 acres in size, according to the governor’s office.\n\n\n\nThe Josephine County Sheriff’s Office put into effect Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 evacuation warnings for homes near the Rum Creek Fire.\n\n\n\n“OSFM is mobilizing 4 task forces and an IMT to the #RumCreekFire,” the Oregon OSFM tweeted Saturday.\n\n\n\n“Our resources will be there to protect life and structures. We will be in unified command with ODF &amp; the federal resources in place.”\n\n\n\n“This is a good reminder that conditions can change quickly, and that fire knows no bounds,” Brown said.",

        "description": "Andrew McCarthy: “Perhaps the most overlooked sentence in the partially disclosed affidavit released Friday is on Page 2: “There is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found at the PREMISES” (i.e., Mar-a-Lago).”\n\n\n\n“Because of the extensive redactions, we don’t know what the government’s claimed evidence of obstruction is. Still, if there is convincing proof of attempts to conceal or destroy government records, especially highly classified ones, that could change the equation. The Justice Department typically takes very seriously any tampering with witnesses or evidence. I am not saying the former president is guilty of such behavior — and again, we don’t know what the government represented to the court in this regard. But it might well be possible for the Justice Department to prosecute a narrow obstruction case without having to expose classified intelligence and the identities of, at least, most of its informants.”\n\n\n\n“Second, the former president could easily talk himself into being charged if he continues to rail against Justice Department and FBI corruption.”",

        "description": "Andrew Weismann: “The redacted affidavit provides additional evidence that the government exhausted every other avenue to get the rest of the documents. It offers a few more details about that back and forth with the Trump team. Within the Justice Department, there seems to have been concern that the Trump team had not been entirely forthright about having returned all the records and concern about interference with witnesses in the case, contradicting Mr. Trump’s current claims that he has fully cooperated with the department.”\n\n\n\n“The redacted affidavit is further proof that Mr. Trump’s flouting of criminal statutes persisted for a long time and gives every appearance of being intentional…”\n\n\n\n“Under Mr. Garland’s leadership, only the facts, law and precedent will matter. Mr. Trump’s penchant for hyperbole and spin to his base will be ineffective in a forum where the rule of law governs.”\n\n\n\n“The key questions that remain include what precisely is the full scope of what Mr. Trump took from the White House, why he took the documents and did not return them all and what he was doing with them all this time.”",

According to the World Health Organization, Australia’s caesarean rate is rising, with a predicted rate of 45% by 2030. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The Reds announced that right-hander Chase Anderson has been signed to a minor league deal, and assigned to the club&#8217;s taxi squad.\nCincinnati is Anderson&#8217;s third organization of the season, after previously signing minor league deals with the Tigers and Rays.  The righty has a 4.50 ERA over 80 combined innings with the Triple-A affiliates in Durham and Toledo, and opted out of his previous minors contracts in search of a team that might provide him with a better shot of reaching the majors.  Getting to the taxi squad would seemingly indicate that chance is near for Anderson, as the Reds are looking for rotation help with both Hunter Greene and Graham Ashcraft on the 15-day injured list.\nIf Anderson&#8217;s contract is selected and he gets into a game, it will officially mark the 34-year-old&#8217;s ninth season in the big leagues.  Anderson is very familiar with the NL Central, as he pitched with the Brewers from 2016-19 and delivered some very solid numbers as a member of the rotation.\nSince being traded to the Blue Jays after the 2019 season, Anderson&#8217;s career has taken a downturn.  He has a 6.94 ERA over his last 81 2/3 innings in the majors, tossing 33 2/3 frames with Toronto in 2020 and then 48 innings with the Phillies last year.  Home runs were a problem for Anderson even in his prime years, and they were a big contributors to his struggles in 2020-21, as he surrendered 21 homers to opposing batters.  His work in Triple-A this season isn&#8217;t especially promising on his front, as Anderson has been tagged for 16 homers over his 80 innings.\nHowever, the veteran should be in line for at least a couple of starts with Cincinnati, and has a chance to finish up his season on a high note.  Barring a really spectacular showing, it&#8217;s probably safe to guess that Anderson will have to settle for another minor league deal this winter, but he&#8217;ll certainly draw interest as an experienced starter who can eat innings.",

        "description": "The Pirates have claimed right-hander Robert Stephenson off waivers from the Rockies.  Infielder Kevin Padlo was designated for assignment in the corresponding 40-man roster move, and the Pirates will make another move on their active roster when Stephenson joins the team.\nStephenson was DFA&#8217;ed by Colorado earlier this week, and didn&#8217;t last long on the waiver wire before the Pirates snatched him up.  It isn&#8217;t surprising to see the Bucs take a chance on a live arm who has some of the highest velocity of any pitcher in baseball, and Stephenson was also a former top prospect for the division-rival Reds during his minor league career.\nThat early promise led to some good results as a reliever in 2019 and 2021, but this season has been a struggle for the right-hander.  Stephenson has a 6.04 ERA over 44 2/3 innings, due to a below-average 18.8% strikeout rate and a lot of hard contact allowed.  As fast (97mph) as Stephenson&#8217;s average four-seamer may be, batters have hit .379 against the pitch.\nIf Pittsburgh&#8217;s coaching staff can get Stephenson back to his 2021 form, he&#8217;ll be a nice bullpen addition for the Pirates both for the remainder of this season and in 2023, as Stephenson still has a third and final season of arbitration eligibility remaining.  The righty is out of minor league options, so the Pirates would have a DFA decision to make of their own if they wanted to move Stephenson to the minors and off their 40-man roster.\nPadlo is no stranger to the DFA carousel, as he has now been designated for assignment for the fifth time in a little over a year.  The Mariners claimed Padlo off waivers from the Rays in August 2021, starting a cycle that has been Padlo go from Seattle to the Giants, back to the Mariners, and then to Pittsburgh earlier this month when the Bucs claimed Padlo away from the M&#8217;s.\nAll of the movement has resulted in only 34 Major League plate appearances for Padlo this season (split over the Pirates, Mariners, and Giants), but he has performed well over 278 Triple-A PA.  The infielder has hit .270/.345/.484 with 12 homers and 13 doubles at the highest minor league level, continuing what has been a solid set of career Triple-A numbers.\nBetween that production and Padlo&#8217;s versatility as a third baseman who can be moved around the infield and into left field, it isn&#8217;t hard to see why teams keep having interest in Padlo, even if that interest has yet to manifest itself into a regular MLB job.  As such, it seems quite possible that another club might claim Padlo away from the Pirates.",

        "description": "As I wrote in “LittleBITS: iCloud Delivery Issues, Naples MUG, Howard Oakley” (24 January 2022), many Mac user groups continue to decline, with the COVID-19 pandemic making in-person meetings even harder.\nWe were particularly sorry to see the Corvallis Macintosh Users Group shut down earlier this month. CMUG had been the home group for the late, great Phil Russell, who created and regularly contributed to the club’s influential Mouse Droppings newsletter. The president of the Oregon MacPioneers User Group penned a nice tribute to CMUG and mentioned the similarly defunct Eugene Mac User Group. Oregon-based Mac users can check out the Portland Macintosh Users Group to stay within the state (and PMUG’s meetings are made available via Zoom), but there’s another option for those who can’t attend in-person meetings.\nNMUG, the Naples MacFriends User Group, has been on a tear, thanks to its weekly online meetings hosted by industry experts, including quite a few people close to TidBITS. I gave a presentation to NMUG about Apple’s WWDC announcements back in June, and on 19 October 2022, Glenn Fleishman will be drawing on his experience writing Take Control of Your Apple ID to discuss everything you need to know to configure your Apple ID, how you interact with Apple’s cloud-based services, and the best ways to troubleshoot account access problems.\nWhen I mentioned NMUG back in January 2022, the group was at 600 members. Now it boasts nearly 800 members worldwide and aims to break 1000 by the end of 2022. To that end, NMUG is offering two months of free membership for anyone joining in September. So if you’re looking for that MUG experience online, give NMUG a try.",

        "description": "I&#8217;ve long imagined a tool that would enable a teacher to help students learn how to write and edit. In Thoughts in motion I explored what might be possible in Federated Wiki, a writing tool that keeps version history for each paragraph. I thought it could be extended to enable the kind of didactic editing I have in mind, but never found a way forward.\n\nIn How to write a press release I tried bending Google Docs to this purpose. To narrate the process of editing a press release, I dropped a sample release into a GDoc and captured a series of edits as named versions. Then I captured the versions as screenshots and combined them with narration, so the reader of the blog post can see each edit as a color-coded diff with an explanation.\n\nThe key enabler is GDoc&#8217;s File -> Version history -> Name current version, along with File -> See version history&#8216;s click-driven navigation of the set of diffs. It&#8217;s easy to capture a sequence of editing steps that way. \n\nBut it&#8217;s much harder to present those steps as I do in the post. That required me to make, name, and organize a set of images, then link them to chunks of narration. It&#8217;s tedious work. And if you want to build something like this for students, that&#8217;s work you shouldn&#8217;t be doing. You just want to do the edits, narrate them, and share the result.\n\nThis week I tried a different approach when editing a document written by a colleague. Again the goal was not only to produce an edited version, but also to narrate the edits in a didactic way. In this case I tried bending GitHub to my purpose. I put the original doc in a repository, made step-by-step edits in a branch, and created a pull request. We were then able to review the pull request, step through the changes, and review each as a color-coded diff with an explanation. No screenshots had to be made, named, organized, or linked to the narration. I could focus all my attention on doing and narrating the edits. Perfect!\n\nWell, perfect for someone like me who uses GitHub every day. If that&#8217;s not you, could this technique possibly work?\n\nIn GitHub for the rest of us I argued that GitHub&#8217;s superpowers could serve everyone, not just programmers. In retrospect I felt that I&#8217;d overstated the case. GitHub was, and remains, a tool that&#8217;s deeply optimized for programmers who create and review versioned source code. Other uses are possible, but awkward. \n\nAs an experiment, though, let&#8217;s explore how awkward it would be to recreate my Google Docs example in GitHub. I will assume that you aren&#8217;t a programmer, have never used GitHub, and don&#8217;t know (or want to know) anything about branches or commits or pull requests. But you would like to be able to create a presentation that walks a learner though a sequence of edits, with step-by-step narration and color-coded diffs. At the end of this tutorial you&#8217;ll know how to do that. The method isn&#8217;t as straightforward as I wish it were. But I&#8217;ll describe it carefully, so you can try it for yourself and decide whether it&#8217;s practical.\n\nHere&#8217;s the final result of the technique I&#8217;ll describe.\n\n\nIf you want to replicate that, and don&#8217;t already have a GitHub account, create one now and log in.\n\nReady to go? OK, let&#8217;s get started.\nStep 1: Create a repository\n\nClick the + button in the top right corner, then click New repository.\n\n\n\nHere&#8217;s the next screen. All you must do here is name the repository, e.g. editing-step-by-step, then click Create repository. I&#8217;ve ticked the Add a README file box, and chosen the Apache 2.0 license, but you could leave the defaults &#8212; box unchecked, license None &#8212; as neither matters for our purpose here.\n\n\nStep 2: Create a new file\n\nOn your GitHub home page, click the Repositories tab. Your new repo shows up first. Click its link to open it, then click the Add file dropdown and choose Create new file. Here&#8217;s where you land.\n\n\nStep 3: Add the original text, create a new branch, commit the change, and create a pull request\n\nWhat happens on the next screen is bewildering, but I will spare you the details because I&#8217;m assuming you don&#8217;t want to know about branches or commits or pull requests, you just want to build the kind of presentation I&#8217;ve promised you can. So, just follow this recipe.\n\nName the file (e.g. sample-press-release.txt\nCopy/paste the text of the document into the edit box\nSelect Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request\nName the branch (e.g. edits)\nClick Propose new file\n\n\n\n\nOn the next screen, title the pull request (e.g. edit the press release) and click Create pull request.\n\n\nStep 4: Visit the new branch and begin editing\n\nOn the home page of your repo, use the main dropdown to open the list of branches. There are now two: main and edits. Select edits\n\n\n\nHere&#8217;s the next screen. \n\n\n\nClick the name of the document you created (e.g. sample-press-release.txt to open it.\n\n\n\nClick the pencil icon&#8217;s dropdown, and select Edit this file.\n\n\n\nMake and preview your first edit. Here, that&#8217;s my initial rewrite of the headline. I&#8217;ve written a title for the commit (Step 1: revise headline), and I&#8217;ve added a detailed explanation in the box below the title. You can see the color-coded diff above, and the rationale for the change below. \n\n\n\nClick Commit changes, and you&#8217;re back in the editor ready to make the next change.\n\n\nStep 5: Visit the pull request to review the change\nOn your repo&#8217;s home page (e.g. https://github.com/judell/editing-step-by-step), click the Pull requests button. You&#8217;ll land here.\n\n\n\nClick the name of the pull request (e.g. edit the press release) to open it. In the rightmost column you&#8217;ll see links with alphanumeric labels. \n\n\n\nClick the first one of those to land here.\n\n\n\nThis is the first commit, the one that added the original text. Now click Next to review the first change.\n\n\n\nThis, finally, is the effect we want to create: a granular edit, with an explanation and a color-coded diff, encapsulated in a link that you can give to a learner who can then click Next to step through a series of narrated edits.\nLather, rinse, repeat\n\nTo continue building the presentation, repeat Step 4 (above) once per edit. I&#8217;m doing that now.\n\n&#8230; time passes &#8230;\n\nOK, done. Here&#8217;s the final edited copy. To step through the edits, start here and use the Next button to advance step-by-step.\n\nIf this were a software project you&#8217;d merge the edits branch into the main branch and close the pull request. But you don&#8217;t need to worry about any of that. The edits branch, with its open pull request, is the final product, and the link to the first commit in the pull request is how you make it available to a learner who wants to review the presentation.\n\nGitHub enables what I&#8217;ve shown here by wrapping the byzantine complexity of the underlying tool, Git, in a much friendlier interface. But what&#8217;s friendly to a programmer is still pretty overwhelming for an English teacher. I still envision another layer of packaging that would make this technique simpler for teachers and learners focused on the craft of writing and editing. Meanwhile, though, it&#8217;s possible to use GitHub to achieve a compelling result. Is it practical? That&#8217;s not for me to say, I&#8217;m way past being able to see this stuff through the eyes of a beginner. But if that&#8217;s you, and you&#8217;re motivated to give this a try, I would love to know whether you&#8217;re able to follow this recipe, and if so whether you think it could help you to help learners become better writers and editors.",

Elizabeth Warren’s (D-Mass) presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nAfter more than a year of setbacks, liberals have had a good few weeks in Washington.\n\n\n\nThey were pleasantly surprised by the multibillion-dollar investment they secured toward climate measures from the Senate and White House and were equally happy when certain tax reform and health care provisions were included in the Inflation Reduction Act. They saw the scope of the package as proof they can get much of what they want with enough pressure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLiberals put student loan relief high on the president’s radar early in his administration and their push persisted even as he tackled massive crises, from inflation and gas prices to Russia’s war in Ukraine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey argued that Biden could cancel borrowers’ debt through executive action, bypassing the ideological disputes of Democrats in the Senate that have stalled his agenda at other critical junctures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd after Biden announced a plan this week to cancel $10,000 in debt for those making less than $125,000 and double that for Pell Grant recipients, some felt even more optimistic about the power of the progressive movement.\n\n\n\nRep. Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.), the head of the&nbsp;Congressional Progressive Caucus,&nbsp;said her flank had been “doggedly pursuing this,” for months, dating back to a conversation with Biden in March. She has maintained a line to the White House on the issue.\n\n\n\nThose accomplishments have the left wing swatting back at what they see as uncredible critiques that their goals aren’t realistic.\n\n\n\nModerates have made the case that independents in particular find progressive policies unappealing. They fought to trim the price tag on earlier versions of Biden’s climate and spending package as well as on certain health care and education priorities. Some centrist lawmakers lobbied against student loan forgiveness up until the final decision, arguing that it would further increase inflation.\n\n\n\nBut on Thursday, liberals got more good news. A Gallup poll taken in the wake of the series of progressive wins showed the president’s approval rating jumping to the highest spot in a year — 44 percent — in part due to an increase in support from independents.\n\n\n\nStill, for all progressives' celebrations on the policy front, they saw plenty of disappointment at the ballot box.\n\n\n\nOne state with hit the left particularly hard: New York. Home to “Squad” members Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D) and Jamaal Bowman (D), the state is usually seen as a bastion of support for progressive lawmakers.\n\n\n\nBut Democratic Trump impeachment counsel Dan Goldman, who was seen as more moderate, is projected to win the primary in the state’s 10th Congressional District, besting a field of progressive candidates including Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), who ran in the 10th District instead of the 17th. And Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) dispatched a progressive challenger by 30 points.\n\n\n\nEarlier in the year, former state Sen. Nina Turner, a co-chair of Sen. Bernie Sanders’s (I-Vt.) presidential campaign, lost for a second time to Rep. Shontel Brown (D-Ohio), who had the support of the party establishment. And in a closely watched primary in Texas, Jessica Cisneros, a young activist and attorney lost by a hair to the establishment’s choice, conservative Democratic Rep. Henry Cuellar. Cuellar’s supporters —&nbsp;and congressional leadership who weighed into the race —&nbsp;argued a progressive could not win his district.\n\n\n\nStrategists attributed many of the losses to the amount of money backing more moderate candidates.\n\n\n\n“Fragmentation plays a big part, as divided lefty fields opened up paths for ... Goldman,” said Max Burns, a Democratic strategist who worked on the New York race. “But you just can't talk about progressives' primary hardships without addressing the tens of millions of dollars in corporate dark money parachuted into major races.”\n\n\n\nThe worry over so-called dark money has been weighing heavily on progressives this cycle. The left has been drastically outspent by special interest groups that poured money into several important races to defeat them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nProtect Our Future, the political action committee affiliated with tech megadonor Sam Bankman-Fried, has spent money in both Democratic and Republican primaries, and a PAC called Mainstream Democrats has worked to protect moderate incumbents, including Cuellar.\n\n\n\nProgressives also say the American&nbsp;Israel Public Affairs Committee has been spending more aggressively and out-in-the-open this cycle.\n\n\n\nAnd Goldman, a Levi Strauss &amp; Co. heir, angered his progressive challengers by pouring millions of his own money into his campaign.\n\n\n\nBill Neidhardt, a Democratic operative with&nbsp;Left Flank Strategies&nbsp;and former campaign spokesperson for Sanders, agreed with the damning influence he sees outside spending factoring into party primaries this cycle.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Much of it comes down to big money in politics, with conservative Democrats using corporate PACs, or even self-funding in the case of millionaires like Dan Goldman,” said Neidhardt.\n\n\n\n“But I would also challenge the notion that progressives are coming up short. The Congressional Progressive Caucus is going to be stronger than ever next Congress with new members who beat out moderates like Becca Balint, Greg Casar, Delia Ramirez and Summer Lee,” he added.\n\n\n\nOne notable sleeper came from&nbsp;Maxwell Alejandro Frost,&nbsp;a 25-year-old Sanders-backed gun control activist who won the primary for Florida’s 10th Congressional District on Tuesday. The district’s blue tilt means he will likely become one of the youngest members of Congress next year.\n\n\n\nAnd on the Senate side, voters in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin opted to nominate two progressives —&nbsp;Lt. Gov. John Fetterman and Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes —&nbsp;to help Democrats with their quest to keep their majority.\n\n\n\n“The candidates have gotten a lot better honestly,” said Berger, noting that left wing groups like Justice Democrats and the Working Families Party have fine-tuned their operations to recruit and train contenders to mount credible challenges. “There’s more people who have experience who have decided to take the lead.”\n\n\n\nSome progressives also see the potential in future contests. Even if Democrats lose the House and their collective legislative power diminishes, there are signs of interest for a more liberal candidate than Biden or other possible contenders in 2024.\n\n\n\nAccording to a new USA TODAY-Ipsos poll released on Friday, Sanders leads in favorability among almost two dozen candidates in a hypothetical match-up. \n\n\n\n“Progressives are more popular than they appear,” said Burns. “And even with a torrent of money, corporate-backed candidates are still barely squeaking by.”",

It would take me hours to do it by hand, but it’s so much quicker with the automated help of a couple of Python scripts.Find out when and where a digital photo was taken: When you take a picture with your phone or a present-day digital camera, that picture has EXIF data embedded in it, with the date, time, and location where the photo was taken. I’ll show you how to extract that info!Editing photos: If you were assigned the task of shrinking a set of 100 photos by 25% (or any other similar basic photo editing task), you could do it manually, or you could make Python do it.Creating interactive documents with Jupyter Notebook: It’s more than just a Python tool used by data scientists, Nobel Prize winners, and Netflix, but a useful programming environment and operations platform for everyday tasks!Writing web applications with Flask: Just a Python makes programming much easier, the Python-powered Flask framework makes programming web applications much easier.Passing interview coding tests: Learn how to deal with the most dreaded part of the interview for a programming job, and why Python is a key part of my coding interview strategy.Using databases: Using databases is a key part of programming, and luckily, Python comes with a built-in database!Data science: This is a giant topic and could easily take up the time to do this course three times, but I’d be happy to go over the basics.Interactive storytelling and games: Python’s quite good at this, and I can walk you through the PyGame framework and Ren’Py interactive story system.Mobile app development: Yes, there are ways to do mobile app development in Python.\n\n\n\nWhat happens in the course?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is&nbsp;not&nbsp;a passive course!&nbsp;This isn’t the kind of course where the instructor lectures over slides while you take notes (or&nbsp;pretend&nbsp;to take notes while surfing the web or checking your social media feeds). In this course, you’ll follow along as I write code on my screen. You’ll actively take part in the learning process, entering code, experimenting, making mistakes, correcting those mistakes, and producing working applications. You will learn by doing.&nbsp;At the end of each session, you’ll have a collection of little Python programs that you wrote, and which you can use as the basis for your own work.\n\n\n\nThe course will start at the most basic level by walking you through the process of downloading and installing the necessary tools to start Python programming. From there, you’ll learn the building blocks of the Python programming language:\n\n\n\nControl structures that determine what your programs do,Data structures to store the information that your programs act on,Functions and objects to organize your code, andUsing libraries as building blocks for your applications.\n\n\n\nBetter still, you’ll learn how to&nbsp;think&nbsp;like a programmer.&nbsp;You’ll learn how to look at a goal and learn how you could write a program to meet it, and how that program could be improved or enhanced. You’ll learn skills that will serve you well as you take up other programming languages, and even learn a little bit about the inner workings of computers, operating systems, and the internet.\n\n\n\nWhat will you need for the course?\n\n\n\nNothing fancy:\n\n\n\nA computer that was made sometime in the last ten years.&nbsp;My main computer is a 2014-era MacBook Pro, but I’ll be doing demonstrations on a 2020 Acer Nitro V laptop that I got for a few hundred buck on Facebook Marketplace, and a $35 Raspberry Pi.Zoom and an internet connection.&nbsp;This&nbsp;is&nbsp;an online course, after all.\n\n\n\nHow do you sign up for the course or find out more?\n\n\n\nOnce again, you’ll want to contact Computer Coach’s Kasandra Perez at Contact Kasandra Perez at kasandra@computercoach.com or (813)-254-6459 to find out more about the course or register.\nThe post I’m teaching another 5-week / 10-evening Python course starting September 7th! appeared first on Global Nerdy.",

You know, maybe you weren&#8217;t gonna vote in November, and suddenly you just got 20 grand… And you know, if you can get off the bong for a minute and head down to the voting station… or just send in your mail-in ballot that the Democrats have helpfully sent you, it could drive up turnout, particularly among young people.”\n\n\n\n— Sen.

        "description": "Andrew McCarthy: “Perhaps the most overlooked sentence in the partially disclosed affidavit released Friday is on Page 2: “There is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found at the PREMISES” (i.e., Mar-a-Lago).”\n\n\n\n“Because of the extensive redactions, we don’t know what the government’s claimed evidence of obstruction is. Still, if there is convincing proof of attempts to conceal or destroy government records, especially highly classified ones, that could change the equation. The Justice Department typically takes very seriously any tampering with witnesses or evidence. I am not saying the former president is guilty of such behavior — and again, we don’t know what the government represented to the court in this regard. But it might well be possible for the Justice Department to prosecute a narrow obstruction case without having to expose classified intelligence and the identities of, at least, most of its informants.”\n\n\n\n“Second, the former president could easily talk himself into being charged if he continues to rail against Justice Department and FBI corruption.”",

It offers a few more details about that back and forth with the Trump team. Within the Justice Department, there seems to have been concern that the Trump team had not been entirely forthright about having returned all the records and concern about interference with witnesses in the case, contradicting Mr. Trump’s current claims that he has fully cooperated with the department.”\n\n\n\n“The redacted affidavit is further proof that Mr. Trump’s flouting of criminal statutes persisted for a long time and gives every appearance of being intentional…”\n\n\n\n“Under Mr. Garland’s leadership, only the facts, law and precedent will matter. Mr. Trump’s penchant for hyperbole and spin to his base will be ineffective in a forum where the rule of law governs.”\n\n\n\n“The key questions that remain include what precisely is the full scope of what Mr. Trump took from the White House, why he took the documents and did not return them all and what he was doing with them all this time.”",

        "description": "The Mets announced a quartet of roster moves, including the activation of Eduardo Escobar from the 10-day injured list.  Left-hander David Peterson was also called up from Triple-A to start tonight&#8217;s game against the Rockies, while righty Connor Grey was optioned to Triple-A and infielder Yolmer Sanchez was designated for assignment.\nEscobar will return after just the minimum 10 days, though he had been been bothered by his oblique problem for a few games leading up to his eventual IL placement.  Fortunately, Escobar&#8217;s strain was pretty minor, and he&#8217;ll now get back to the NL East-leading Mets in relatively short order.  He won&#8217;t be returning to a starting job, however, as Luis Guillorme (currently on the IL himself) had already eaten into Escobar&#8217;s regular playing time at third base, and now top prospect Brett Baty has been called up and is part of the mix at the hot corner.  It seems like Escobar will be part of a platoon with Baty until Guillorme is healthy.\nSanchez was claimed off waivers from the Red Sox last week to address this lack of infield depth in Queens, and the former Gold Glover might well find himself on the move again now that he&#8217;s back on the DFA wire.  (Intriguingly, the White Sox might again be a possibility for Sanchez now that Yoan Moncada and Tim Anderson are both on the injured list.)\nOver a three-game tenure with the Mets, Sanchez appeared only as a late-game defensive sub, without any plate appearances.  For the season as a whole, Sanchez has only 44 PA and a .322 OPS in limited action with the Red Sox.\nPeterson has been up and down from Triple-A Syracuse many times this season, tossing 83 2/3 innings and starting 15 of 19 games filling in for various injured Mets starters.  With Carlos Carrasco on the IL, it has created yet another chance for Peterson to make a spot start or two.  The southpaw has performed admirably, with a 3.44 ERA over his 83 2/3 frames.",

        "description": "A federal judge said Saturday she’s inclined to grant Donald Trump’s request to bring in an outsider to oversee the review of more than two dozen boxes of materials the FBI seized from the former president’s Florida estate earlier this month. In her brief order, which she emphasized was not a final decision, U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon also directed the Justice Department to produce by Tuesday “a more detailed” list of items seized from Trump’s residence on Aug. 8 as well as the status of the government’s ongoing review of those materials, which includes the use of a “filter team” to screen for attorney-client privileged records. The FBI executed a search warrant of the Mar-a-Lago estate aimed at recovering what a magistrate judge said were “highly classified” documents in Trump’s possession. The search was part of a criminal investigation into alleged “willful retention” of classified information, theft of government records and obstruction of justice. Cannon, who was nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate about a week after his defeat in 2020, said she plans to hold a hearing Thursday in West Palm Beach on the former president’s request for a special master. She typically convenes court in Fort Pierce, Fla., about an hour’s drive north of there. The judge’s two-page order giving “notice of [her] preliminary intent to appoint a special master in this case” came less than a day after Trump’s attorneys late Friday made a pitch for an independent review of the materials seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate and before prosecutors filed any reply. Cannon gave no indication how she viewed Trump’s claims that the search was unnecessary and extreme. Instead, she asked Trump to file a brief responding to the Justice Department’s produced list of seized materials. She also asked both sides to describe specifically the role they envision for a special master. And she asked DOJ to reveal the status of its filter review, and whether any investigators outside of the review team had seen the seized materials. The Department of Justice declined to comment on the ruling. Appointments of special masters to oversee the handling of evidence seized in federal criminal investigations are unusual, but typically have occurred when prosecutors seize records from an attorney’s office. Judges in Manhattan used the mechanism in recent years in connection with investigations into two Trump attorneys: Michael Cohen and Rudy Giuliani.",

        "description": "Intelligence officials in the Biden administration will review the national security risk posed by top-secret documents held at the Mar-a-Lago home of former President Trump.\n\n\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines sent a letter to two Democratic representatives on Friday, obtained by Politico, noting that intelligence would assess the risk resulting from potential disclosure of the classified information in the documents.\n\n\n\n“The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) are working together to facilitate a classification review of relevant materials, including those recovered during the search,” wrote Haines to House Oversight and Reform Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.).\n\n\n\nThe letter was written shortly after the release of a redacted version of the search affidavit filed by the FBI before officers raided Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort.\n\n\n\nThe affidavit stated that reports indicated there could be “evidence of obstruction” at Mar-a-Lago, justifying a search for the documents.\n\n\n\nHaines told Maloney and Schiff that intelligence officials’ assessment of national security risk would not “unduly interfere with DOJ’s ongoing criminal investigation.”\n\n\n\n“We are pleased that in response to our inquiry, Director Haines has confirmed that the Intelligence Community and Department of Justice are assessing the damage caused by the improper storage of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago,” the two lawmakers told Politico on Saturday.\n\n\n\n“It is critical that the IC move swiftly to assess and, if necessary, to mitigate the damage done — a process that should proceed in parallel with DOJ’s criminal investigation.”",

        "description": "More than&nbsp;105,000 Americans died of drug overdoses&nbsp;in the 12 months that ended this past October, with two out of three linked to the scourge of fentanyl almost entirely being smuggled across our Southern border.\n\n\n\nAlaska, despite its location farther from the Southern border than any state in the continental U.S., has not been spared.\n\n\n\nOver a period of weeks this past March, there were seven deaths and more than 20 overdose poisonings linked to fentanyl in the Matanuska-Susitna Valley in what the Drug Enforcement Agency classifies as a “mass overdose event.”\n\n\n\nA month later,&nbsp;in two separate arrests, our High Intensity Drug Trafficking Area Task Forces seized 4,700 counterfeit pills laced with fentanyl.\n\n\n\nThe 1,244 grams of fentanyl we seized in the first three months of this year is twice as much as we seized in all of 2021, when overdose deaths increased by 71 percent over 2020.\n\n\n\nThose 1,244 grams are enough to kill 660,000 Alaskans, or about 85 percent of our population.\n\n\n\nFentanyl in powder and pill form is making its way to Alaska via parcel, carried on planes, boats and vehicles, or shipped over water. In one of the April arrests, the fentanyl reached our Southeast panhandle on a barge; in the other, it was mailed to an address in the Mat-Su Valley where two men from California and one from Arizona were arrested.\n\n\n\nAccording to the DEA, fentanyl is coming here after precursor chemicals from China are mixed into powder or pressed into counterfeit pills by Mexican drug cartels. The cartels are clearly benefitting from the humanitarian crisis of hundreds of thousands of migrants attempting to illegally cross the border every month that are overwhelming our Customs and Border Patrol agents.\n\n\n\nThe numbers don’t lie: after the Biden administration reversed nearly every policy of the previous administration at the border, illegal border crossings have surged and drug seizures have declined.\n\n\n\nAccording to CBP reports, illegal border crossing encounters&nbsp;have more than doubled since 2019. At the same time,&nbsp;drug seizures&nbsp;this July were down by&nbsp;33 percent&nbsp;compared to July 2021.\n\n\n\nA 200 percent jump in fentanyl seizures at the border in July compared to June&nbsp;generated headlines, but overall drug seizures were actually down 14 percent for the month. Seizures of meth, cocaine, heroin, and “other,” which includes oxycontin and precursor chemicals, are all on pace to fall far short of 2021.\n\n\n\nJust 1,500 pounds of heroin have been seized this year compared to 5,400 pounds last year.\n\n\n\nWe can safely assume this drop in seizures can’t be attributed to the cartels taking up other lines of work, especially as fentanyl poisonings keep setting records. On July 5,&nbsp;one million fentanyl pills were seized&nbsp;in Inglewood, Calif., in a bust linked to the Sinaloa Cartel.\n\n\n\nState leaders are doing the best we can, and Alaska has teamed up with others to share intelligence to combat trafficking.\n\n\n\nLike other states, we recognize this is also an addiction issue. We’re bringing to bear all forces we can muster through government resources and partnerships with nonprofit treatment centers to provide help and work to remove stigmas that can prevent people from seeking help.\n\n\n\nBut our powers are limited. States can’t punish China for sending fentanyl precursors to Mexico, and we can’t protect the border.\n\n\n\nThe states delegated our national defense to the federal government when we formed our republic, and the responsibility for securing our borders and defending Americans from deadly drugs crossing it lies solely with President Biden.\n\n\n\nUnmoved by the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans, not even the cratering support for Biden and Democrats among overwhelmingly Hispanic districts that border Mexico appears to be enough to force a policy change.\n\n\n\nWhether it’s for moral reasons to save American lives, or for cynical ones to save his party’s political future, President Biden has all the motivation he needs to reverse his disastrous policies on the Southern border and with China.\n\n\n\nMike Dunleavy is the 12th governor of Alaska.",

        "description": "After thoracic outlet syndrome surgery kept Trevor Rosenthal from pitching in 2021, it looks like the 2022 season will also be a total write-off for the veteran reliever.  Brewers manager Craig Counsell told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&#8217;s Curt Hogg (Twitter links) and other reporters that Rosenthal will &#8220;probably&#8221; miss the rest of the season due to a lat injury in a recent Triple-A rehab outing.  Counsell compared Rosenthal&#8217;s injury to the posterior shoulder issue that kept Freddy Peralta out of action for almost two and a half months of the 2022 campaign.\nRosenthal wasn&#8217;t signed during the 2021-22 offseason, but a midseason throwing showcase led to a guaranteed contract with the Giants worth a prorated $4.5MM.  At the time of the signing, Rosenthal was recovering from a hamstring strain, and was still sidelined when the Brewers landed Rosenthal (and his contract) at the trade deadline in a swap with San Francisco.  While Rosenthal was making good progress in working his way back in rehab, Brewers president of baseball ops David Stearns said that the lat problem is &#8220;a completely new injury&#8221; that only just surfaced.\n&#8220;He&#8217;s been working exceptionally hard to get back here.  He was close, the ball was coming out really good, and now we have a setback,&#8221; Stearns said.\nThe trade with the Giants now looks like a backfired risk for the Brewers, and yet another strange detail in what has been a bizarre five-year stretch for Rosenthal.  Tommy John surgery kept off the mound for the entire 2018 season, and he pitched only 15 1/3 innings in 2019 and then 23 2/3 innings in 2020, appearing for four different teams during that two-season span.  While his 2019 numbers were poor, Rosenthal looked quite good in 2020, leading to a one-year, $11MM free agent deal with the Athletics that resulted in Rosenthal never making an actual appearance for the A&#8217;s, due to thoracic outlet syndrome.\nThe $4.5MM deal was already something of a surprising total for a pitcher with Rosenthal&#8217;s recent injury track record, notwithstanding his strong career numbers.  Since it now looks like he&#8217;ll go more than two years without throwing a Major League pitch, the right-hander will probably have to settle for a minor league deal this winter.  Some questions might have to be asked about whether or not Rosenthal will continue his career in the face of all these health problems, but he is still only 32 years old.\nAs for Milwaukee, the team gave up minor league outfield prospect Tristan Peters to the Giants, and the lack of return on Rosenthal will surely bring some fresh criticism of the team&#8217;s deadline moves.  Between dealing All-Star closer Josh Hader to the Padres for a trade package that included Taylor Rogers, as well as the swap that brought Matt Bush from the Rangers, it was a bullpen-heavy set of transactions that (with almost four weeks of hindsight) looks to have not been enough.  Milwaukee has struggled to an 8-14 record in August, falling six games back of the Cardinals in the NL Central race and 2.5 games behind in the wild card race.",

        "description": "Way back in spring training, after Kris Bryant signed his seven-year, $182-million mega-deal, but before he got hurt, and before the starting rotation blew multiple gaskets, and before the team posted the worst road record in the majors, I predicted that the Rockies would finish with a 78-84 record.\nI even mentioned to a colleague that if the Rockies played well and could get to around .500 by mid-season, and if they made a move or two at the trade deadline, they might be a surprise wild-card team.\nMy colleague laughed at me.\nTurns out the joke was on me. Not only are the 2022 Rockies a bad, disappointing team, but they also lack an identity. Right now, they&#8217;re just treading water.\nHow did it all go so wrong? Let&#8217;s paint that picture by the numbers:\n25: The number of road games the Rockies (18-41) are on pace to win, which would be the second-fewest in franchise history for a full season. The 2014 team finished 21-60.\n36: Home runs hit on the road thus far, tied with Detroit for the fewest in the majors. The Rockies are on pace to finish with 49 road home runs, which would tie the 2000 club for the fewest in franchise history.\n2: Home runs hit on the road by catcher Elias Diaz so far. He hit 18 home runs last season, nine at home and nine on the road.\n.209: Team batting average with runners in scoring position on the road, and that number includes just six home runs. True, the Rockies have almost always struggled to hit in the clutch on the road, but not like this. Since Coors Field opened in 1995, the Rockies have hit .305 with RISP at home vs. hitting .242 away from home.\n35: Stolen bases, the fewest in the National League and the second-fewest in the majors. Only the Twins (26) have swiped fewer bags.\n5.38: Cumulative ERA for Colorado&#8217;s starters, the second highest in the majors, behind only the Nationals&#8217; 5.95. Manager Bud Black touted the rotation as the strength of the team, but every single starter has failed to live up to expectations. It&#8217;s hard to believe that back in 2018, the Rockies&#8217; rotation had a 4.17 ERA, the second-best in franchise history.\n5.22: ERA for right-hander German Marquez, who was a first-time All-Star last summer. After his last start, Marquez said his performance was &#8220;frickin’ frustrating.&#8221; And the painful truth is that Marquez has a 5.51 ERA since last year&#8217;s All-Star Game.\n4.80: ERA for the bullpen, the third-highest in baseball, with only Kansas City (4.86) and Cincinnati (4.86) worse.\n3.44/7.10: The first number is walks issued by Rockies pitchers per nine innings, the sixth-highest in the majors. The second number is the strikeouts per nine innings, the fewest in the majors. That&#8217;s not a good combination.\n.983: Team fielding percentage, the second worst in the majors behind Pittsburgh (.979). The Rockies are on pace for their worst fielding performance since the 2016 club had a .982 mark.\n15: Errors at third base for Ryan McMahon, including a costly one in Friday night&#8217;s loss to the Mets. Last season, McMahon, a Gold Glove finalist, committed just five errors at third base.\n42: The number of games Bryant has played this season. He&#8217;s missed time because of a back injury and plantar fasciitis. There is a strong possibility he won&#8217;t play again this season. The Rockies are 20-22 in the games in which Bryant played.",

Tate Reeves (R) declared a state of emergency on Saturday for areas of the state affected by river flooding.\n\n\n\n“I encourage individuals in the flood zones to be cautious, take appropriate precautions, and evacuate if necessary,” Reeves wrote in the declaration.\n\n\n\nWhile some flooding has occurred, more is expected to occur this week, though earlier than originally predicted.\n\n\n\nReeves said that the Pearl River, located in central Mississippi near other flooding, “is expected to crest on Monday … at 36 feet.”\n\n\n\n“The time is now to start making preparations to protect you and your family,” wrote Reeves.\n\n\n\nThe governor said that his emergency declaration would allow state agencies, including the Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA), to assist with the flooding and its aftermath.\n\n\n\nMEMA and the Reeves administration have worked together to deploy sandbags and prepare search and rescue teams, according to the emergency announcement.\n\n\n\nReeves added that MEMA is continually monitoring flood levels using drones and other instruments.\n\n\n\nFloods swept across the Southwestern U.S. last week as the National Weather Service warned of a potential tropical cyclone.\n\n\n\nSimilar trends of unstable weather have appeared in other areas of the country and throughout Mississippi.",

        "description": "7:06PM: The Yankees officially placed Chapman on the 15-day IL, retroactive to August 24.\n6:14PM: The Yankees will place left-hander Aroldis Chapman on the 15-day injured list due to a leg infection, manager Aaron Boone told the YES Network&#8217;s Jack Curry (Twitter links) and other reporters.\nChapman last pitched on August 19, and Boone said part of that layoff has been due to the reliever&#8217;s battle with an infection that developed after Chapman got a leg tattoo.  Boone stated that he believes Chapman will pitch again this season, but the lefty will now be out until at least the second week in September, even accounting for a few days of backdating on his IL placement.\nThe unusual injury adds to what has been a tough season for Chapman, who already missed over five weeks due to left Achilles tendinitis.  By the time Chapman returned to the active roster, Clay Holmes had taken over as New York&#8217;s closer, leaving Chapman relegated to lower-leverage roles rather than even a solid set-up job.  Since beginning his season with 10 1/3 scoreless innings, Chapman has struggled to a 7.08 ERA over his last 20 1/3 innings of work.\nEven with Chapman far less than his usual effective self, his IL placement is another hit to a bullpen that has suddenly been crushed by injuries over the last couple of months.  Holmes may be back from his own IL stint within a few days&#8217; time, but Holmes and Chapman are joined by Scott Effross, Miguel Castro, Zack Britton, and Albert Abreu on the injured list, while Michael King and Chad Green have already been ruled out for the rest of the season.  Wandy Peralta and Lucas Luetge are the only remaining left-handers in New York&#8217;s relief corps now that Chapman is out.\nThe Yankees entered Saturday&#8217;s action with a comfortable 8.5-game lead in the AL East, as an ongoing five-game winning streak has eased some concerns after a mediocre stretch of play since the All-Star break.  Getting some of those injured relievers back before the playoffs will further bolster New York&#8217;s chances in October, but in Chapman&#8217;s case, the question must be asked whether the Yankees could conceivably leave him off a playoff roster altogether.\nWhile Chapman is a seasoned playoff performer with a 2016 World Series ring to show from his time with the Cubs, he&#8217;ll need to return in good health and then deliver some consistent outings in September to clinch his spot for the postseason.  This is also the last season of Chapman&#8217;s three-year, $48MM contract, so a platform for free agency is also undoubtedly on Chapman&#8217;s mind.",

        "description": "James Fitzgerald is a financial journalist and chief reporter at Citywire.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the United Kingdom’s prime ministerial hopefuls Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak struggle to nail down a coherent direction for the country, it has become increasingly evident that outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson’s 2019 clean-out of Tory moderates has left the party suffering from a lack of talent and a vacuum of policy ideas.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJohnson’s wild swing to the populist right after winning an 80-seat majority was the beginning of the end for moderate Tory political ideals and programs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe lack of experience in his Cabinet and, indeed, the potential policies being tossed around by leadership candidates Truss and Sunak, highlight that the government has run out of ideas, which doesn’t bode well for the country as it enters a period of uncertainty and a cost-of-living crisis not seen since the end of the World War II.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoth Truss and Sunak have spent weeks on their respective campaigns, throwing policy proposals around with gusto: Tax cuts benefiting the wealthy, when inflation is in double digits and the poor are suffering most? Sure. Cutting the civil service and tackling its “woke” ideology? Why not? It was even revealed recently that the Treasury’s considering giving already strained GPs the responsibility of deciding whether people deserve extra cost-of-living relief.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe fundamental issue with Truss and Sunak’s policy spray-around is that none of it is consistent or very well thought out, and it’s purely targeted at the 160,000-plus Conservative members who are going to decide who will become the next prime minister. This week’s YouGov poll, putting Labour ahead by 15 points, shows that huge swathes of the country aren’t exactly confident that these ideas will help them through this crisis.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nForeign Secretary Truss, for example, with her promise of a growth boom and tax cuts across the board, doesn’t seem to realize — or simply doesn&#8217;t care — that these policies will probably lead to a massive inflationary spiral over and above the double-digit price hikes the U.K. is already suffering from. Former Conservative Chancellor Nigel Lawson warned this could be the case earlier this month, stating that former Prime Minister Edward Heath&#8217;s similar policies in the 1970s crippled the British economy and put millions out of work.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd though it’s not necessarily surprising that coherent economic policy isn’t either candidate’s strong suit, it is just a bit shocking when we consider that Sunak was chancellor for the best part of two years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat’s becoming clear, however, is that the 2019 exodus of moderate Conservatives — due to Johnson’s desire to swerve to the right and promote his supporters — has created a void. There are currently very few experienced ministers left in Cabinet, and especially in the Treasury.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKen Clarke, who was home secretary from 1992 to 1993 and chancellor of the Exchequer from 1993 to 1997, retired from the Commons in 2019 after losing the Conservative whip, having voted to block a ‘no-deal’ Brexit. Phillip Hammond, former Prime Minister Theresa May’s right-hand man in No.11, is also gone. And so too is 2019 leadership hopeful Rory Stewart, the former secretary of state for international development and minister of state at the Ministry of Justice who spent years in Iraq and Afghanistan with the Foreign Office. He now spends his days hosting a political podcast.&nbsp;Even Winston Churchill&#8217;s grandson and Conservative party grandee&nbsp;Nicholas Soames had enough, stepping away from the government after butting heads with Johnson over Brexit in 2019.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInstead, both Truss and Sunak have trumpeted Margaret Thatcher as inspiration for their policy ideas, and they’ve even begrudgingly agreed with some of former Labour Prime Minister Gordon Brown’s recent proposals to fix a broken economy — such as stopping the looming increase in the energy price cap.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe only problem with this, however, is that Thatcher was prime minister 30 years ago, when the economy was in a very different state than it is now, and she’s been dead for 10 years. Meanwhile, Brown was obviously a progressive who wanted to spread money across the country — especially to the less fortunate — which isn’t exactly popular with Tory voters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThings could have been different had Hammond or Clarke still been present in the back benches, ready to tap Truss and Sunak on the shoulder to provide guidance in steering the U.K. through the current crisis, and to quietly have a word when their ideas are balmy. But this is no longer a possibility. It seems, moderate ideas are old news, and offering incoherent policy to appease the Conservative faithful is in vogue.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSimply put, the now outgoing Johnson’s populist politics have left the U.K. in a dangerous place. There is, frankly, no one left in the Conservative party to provide any balanced policy proposals, as no one has any experience in doing so.&nbsp;\n\n\n\ninstead, what the U.K. is left with is two prime ministerial hopefuls throwing ideas at a wall and hoping something sticks — which will only harm their election hopes in 2024 and throw the country into a bigger crisis.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Dany Jimenez&#8217;s season is over due to a right shoulder strain, as the Athletics have placed the right-hander on the 60-day injured list.  Austin Pruitt&#8217;s contract was selected from Triple-A in the corresponding move.\nIn an overall rough season for the A&#8217;s, Jimenez has been a bright spot, posting a 3.41 ERA over 34 1/3 innings and earning a team-high 11 saves.  A .231 BABIP helped Jimenez overcome some dicey advanced metrics like a 12.4% walk rate, but Jimenez&#8217;s ERA was also somewhat inflated by a three particularly poor outings out of 34 total appearances.  (In those three bad games, Jimenez allowed 10 earned runs in 1 2/3 innings, and only six runs over his other 32 2/3 frames of work during the season.)  With Lou Trivino struggling in the closer&#8217;s role, Jimenez ended up taking over the bulk of save chances.\nUnfortunately, Jimenez&#8217;s bothersome right shoulder has now ended this solid rookie season.  It is the second time Jimenez has been sent to the IL with a shoulder strain, as a similar injury put him on the shelf for over six weeks, from mid-June to the start of August.\nThis was Jimenez&#8217;s first extended stint in the majors, as his only previous MLB experience was 1 1/3 innings with the Giants in 2020.  Jimenez is a two-time Rule 5 Draft selection, but in both cases was returned to the Blue Jays when neither the Giants (in 2020) or the A&#8217;s (in 2021) kept him on their active roster for the entire season.  Jimenez elected free agency this past winter and rejoined Oakland on a minor league deal.\nPruitt will make a quick return to the active roster after being designated for assignment and then outrighted off the 40-man earlier this week.  The right-hander has a 4.78 ERA over 37 2/3 innings out of Oakland&#8217;s bullpen, as Pruitt&#8217;s excellent control hasn&#8217;t overcome his below-average 17.2% strikeout rate.",
