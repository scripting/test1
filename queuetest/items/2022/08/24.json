        "description": "AUGUST 24: Chicago has formally selected Farrell&#8217;s contract, relays Meghan Montemurro of the Chicago Tribune (on Twitter). Hendricks, who is unlikely to pitch again this season after revealing the presence of a small capsule tear in his throwing shoulder, was indeed transferred to the 60-day IL to create the 40-man roster spot. Chicago also placed southpaw Steven Brault on the 15-day IL with a should strain, recalled reliever Kervin Castro from Iowa, optioned Anderson Espinoza and sent Padilla back to Triple-A after yesterday&#8217;s doubleheader.\nAUGUST 23: The Cubs are adding right-hander Luke Farrell to the big league roster before tomorrow evening&#8217;s game against the Cardinals, manager David Ross told reporters (including Tim Stebbins of NBC Sports Chicago). He&#8217;ll get the start for the contest.\nIt&#8217;ll be the first MLB outing of the season for Farrell, who signed a minor league deal in April. He&#8217;s spent the entire season at Triple-A Iowa, starting 11 of his 17 outings. Over 59 innings, Farrell has a 5.03 ERA with a below-average 19% strikeout rate and a higher than average 10.9% walk percentage. It&#8217;s the first extended rotation stretch for the Northwestern product since 2018, also a stint in the Chicago farm system.\nFarrell has come out of the bullpen for 58 of his 63 big league outings, working 87 2/3 innings between the Royals, Reds, Cubs, Rangers and Twins. He owns a 4.93 ERA at the major league level, including a 4.74 mark in 20 outings with Minnesota last season. Farrell typically runs solid swing-and-miss rates, but he&#8217;s had spotty control and given up quite a few home runs at the major league level.\nThe Cubs will need to formally select Farrell&#8217;s contract tomorrow. He&#8217;ll be the third pitcher added to the 40-man roster in two days, as Chicago also brought up Javier Assad and Nicholas Padilla today. Those transactions brought the 40-man to full capacity, but the Cubs could easily transfer either Kyle Hendricks or Wade Miley to the 60-day injured list to free a spot.",

        "description": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Maxwell Alejandro Frost, a 25-year-old Generation Z activist and occasional Uber driver supported by progressives, is just one of more than a dozen candidates who are poised to head to Congress after Tuesday’s primaries.\nThe list in Florida also includes Cory Mills, a defense contractor and skeptic of the 2020 election results who won a bitter GOP primary.\nRepublican Gov. Ron DeSantis overhauled Florida’s congressional districts after he muscled through a new map that increased the number of GOP-friendly districts. It means that many of Tuesday’s primary winners are expected to easily win the general election in November.\nSeveral Democratic incumbents — including Reps. Val Demings (D-Fla.) and Charlie Crist (D-Fla.) — are running for higher offices, leaving their seats up for grabs.\nFrost, who picked up endorsements from Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and raised the most money among Democrats in the race, won the Democratic primary to succeed Demings in a crowded race that also featured state Sen. Randolph Bracy and former Reps. Corrine Brown and Alan Grayson. Grayson made waves when he publicly confronted DeSantis over gun violence as the Republican governor was appearing with a conservative political commentator in Orlando.\n\nFrost will make history as the first member of his generation in Florida to make it to Congress if he wins Florida’s 10th congressional district, as expected in November.\n“It’s hard to wrap my head around,” Frost said in a phone interview. “We have been campaigning for a year. We still have a lot of work to do and I’m not going to take the general election for granted.” \nAnna Paulina Luna, who unsuccessfully challenged Crist in 2020, won the GOP primary again for Florida’s 13th congressional district. Luna, who had been endorsed by former President Donald Trump, withstood a furious challenge by Kevin Hayslett, who had the backing of former Trump security adviser Michael Flynn and top Republicans in Pinellas County, including Florida House Speaker Chris Sprowls.\nLuna will square off against Eric Lynn, who once worked for President Barack Obama’s administration. The seat, however, now tilts Republican after redistricting. Trump won the reconfigured district in 2020 by more than 7 percentage points.\n\nThe Pinellas County race was the most expensive congressional primary in the state, according to an analysis by AdImpact.\nLaurel Lee, who stepped down as Florida’s top election official earlier this year, won the Republican primary for Florida’s 15th congressional district, beating back rivals state Sen. Kelli Stargel and state Rep. Jackie Toledo. The seat was newly created during redistricting since Florida picked up a 28th congressional seat due to population growth.\n\nThe race included a flurry of negative ads, many of them paid by super PACs. But the negative tone of the contest came nowhere close to matching the onslaught in the race for Florida’s 7th congressional district, which includes suburban areas near Orlando. That contest included Mills and conservative state Rep. Anthony Sabatini, who had the backing of Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) and clashed with state House leaders who he labeled “RINOs,” or Republicans in name only.\nMills, who has publicly said he believes that the 2020 election was rigged against Trump, defeated Sabatini on Tuesday, a loss that Sabatini on Twitter contended was a win by “the Swamp” that paid for “a $1.6 million influx of fake news pieces in the last 14 days.”\nThe seat is currently held by Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.), who chose not to run for reelection in advance of the district becoming altered due to redistricting.\n\nState Sen. Aaron Bean easily won the Republican primary for Florida’s 4th district, a now-GOP friendly district that was created after the Legislature dismantled the North Florida district now held by Rep. Al Lawson, a Black Democrat.\nJared Moskowitz, who had been DeSantis’ state emergency management director, won the Democratic primary for Florida’s 23rd congressional district, blowing past opponents who had questioned his ties to the governor. State Sen. Annette Taddeo — who briefly ran for governor — won the primary for Florida’s 27th congressional district, setting up a match with incumbent Rep. María Elvira Salazar (R-Fla.). Democrats have targeted this race as the one GOP seat they may be able to flip in Florida.\n\nMost incumbents seeking reelection easily won their primaries, including Gaetz, who brought in top GOP celebrities including Donald Trump Jr. to campaign for him in his conservative Panhandle district after his primary opponent spent roughly $500,000 on ads that ripped into Gaetz, who has been under federal investigation for sex trafficking. Gaetz has denied all wrongdoing and has not been charged.\nGaetz’s opponent will be Rebekah Jones, the fired health department worker who earned national media attention over unsubstantiated allegations that Florida was manipulating Covid-19 death data. Jones won the Democratic primary.\n\nAnother incumbent who won — GOP Rep. Daniel Webster — survived a bit of a close call in a primary from Laura Loomer, who came within a few thousand votes of toppling the 73-year-old veteran. Loomer is a far-right activist who has been kicked off social media platforms. She ran against Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.) in 2020 in a South Florida race, but this year she challenged Webster, a long-time incumbent who became the first Republican to serve as Florida House speaker since reconstruction.\nWebster ultimately prevailed in the race, but only because he outperformed Loomer in Orange County, his long-time political base. Loomer bested or nearly matched Webster in the two counties that are home to The Villages, the GOP bastion of the state.",

        "description": "Democrat Pat Ryan is projected to defeat Republican Marc Molinaro in the special election for New York's 19th Congressional District on Tuesday, giving Democrats a win in a swing district thought to be a bellwether for November. \n\n\n\nCNN and ABC called the race shortly before 11:55 p.m.\n\n\n\nTuesday's special election garnered special attention as an indication of how voters could behave in November, and what issues could galvanize them to vote.\n\n\n\nMolinaro zeroed in on the economy while Ryan looked to seize on anger surrounding the overturning of Roe v. Wade to drive their respective voters to the polls. The Democrat rolled out his first television ad of the campaign cycle, which focused on abortion, less than an hour after the Supreme Court announced its decision to strike down protections for the procedure. \n\n\n\nDemocrats are likely to tout Ryan's win as a positive sign going into the midterms in what is expected to be a tough year for the party.  \n\n\n\nRyan will represent the district through January, replacing former Rep. Antonio Delgado (D-N.Y.), who was appointed lieutenant governor earlier this year. Ryan was also projected on Tuesday to win the Democratic nomination for the November election for New York's newly drawn 18th Congressional District. ",

        "description": "ALBANY, N.Y. — Democrat Pat Ryan won a special election Tuesday in a swing district in New York’s Hudson Valley, a significant victory for his party in a seat which has been closely watched as the country’s best bellwether this summer.\nRyan, the Ulster County executive, led Republican Marc Molinaro with 51 percent of the vote when the Associated Press called the race shortly after midnight. The district is closely divided: President Joe Biden carried it by fewer than 2 percentage points in 2020.\n\nThe race in the battleground district, which had been represented by Democrat Antonio Delgado until he left to become New York’s lieutenant governor in May, saw both candidates focus their messaging on the issues that will dominate each party’s talking points in November&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/24/pat-ryan-molinaro-new-york-special-00053458&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d128-d881-a5ff-f12b7b6a0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d128-d881-a5ff-f12b7b6a0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">focus their messaging on the issues that will dominate each party’s talking points in November.\nRyan’s television ads hammered on the need to elect a representative who would fight for abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court’s June decision overturning Roe v. Wade, while Molinaro, the Dutchess County executive, centered his campaign on crime and inflation. \nThe outcome marked the latest in a string of recent House special elections in which Democrats have outperformed recent baseline numbers in the districts.\n\n\n\n“Choice was on the ballot,” Ryan said in a statement while declaring victory. “Freedom was on the ballot, and tonight choice and freedom won. We voted like our democracy was on the line because it is.”\nTop Democrats quickly touted his victory as a sign there’s more to come as they look to maintain control of the House in the general elections in November. \n“Upstate New Yorkers showed up to the polls and voted for a true champion who will stand up for the values we hold sacred in New York — reproductive freedom, protecting our fundamental rights, and creating opportunity for everyone,” Delgado said in a statement.\n \n\nRyan, a graduate of nearby West Point, has been executive of the increasingly-blue county in the Hudson Valley since 2019. Ryan overwhelmingly won his home county of Ulster and nearby Columbia County and stayed competitive against Molinaro in Dutchess to carry him to victory.\nRyan will serve only four months in the current district, and he and Molinaro will be on the ballot again in November — but in separate competitive districts. \nRyan handily defeated primary opponent Moses Mugulusi on Tuesday in his race for a full term in November, and he will face off against Republican Assemblyman Colin Schmitt in a seat centered on Poughkeepsie.\nMolinaro, meanwhile, will run in a sweeping district across parts of the Hudson Valley and central new York against Ithaca attorney Josh Riley, who defeated businessperson Jamie Cheney in a Democratic primary on Tuesday.\n\n“Whether it’s tonight or it’s Nov. 8, we are going to win the 19th Congressional District and give voice to people who are working too damn hard and getting too little in return,” Molinaro said Tuesday night. \nThe new district where he’ll face Riley in November is a little bit more Democratic-friendly than the one he ran in on Tuesday, while the district Ryan will be running in this fall was won by Biden by about 8 percentage points.",

        "description": "ALBANY, N.Y. — State GOP Chair Nick Langworthy declared victory Tuesday over controversial Buffalo developer Carl Paladino in a battle for an open congressional seat in New York’s southwestern corner.\nThe Associated Press called the race shortly after 12:30 a.m. Langworthy had a 4.2 percentage-point lead with over 95 percent of the votes counted, up 52.1 percent to 47.9 percent.\nLangworthy has spent most of the campaign widely characterized as the underdog. Even the internal polls that he released showed him with “momentum” rather than a lead.\n\nBut he eked out a win thanks to a strong showing in the rural corners of a district that stretched from Erie County and through parts of the Southern Tier.\n“When you confront a bully you punch him in the face and you take him down a peg,” Langworthy told supporters. “And we did that here in this district tonight and we sent a loud and clear message that people want decent, stable, honest, conservative Republican leadership.”\nPaladino convincingly won Buffalo’s suburbs, where he’s universally known. But the six rural counties in the district that include Jamestown and Elmira, they all went overwhelmingly for Langworthy, letting him eke out a win.\n“Tonight the Southern Tier made me the comeback kid!” Langworthy said at a victory party.\n\nPaladino refused to concede.\n“We are seeing a number of statistical irregularities in a number of counties that we will be looking in the coming days. We want every single legal vote to count,\" Paladino spokesperson Vish Burra said in a statement.\nLangworthy has been the New York Republican chair since 2019. He has spent his tenure prioritizing a GOP win in this year’s gubernatorial election and has spent over a year working to get his party’s nod for Rep. Lee Zeldin, who won the primary in June.\nWhile Zeldin remains the underdog to Gov. Kathy Hochul, Langworthy’s victory removes a headache from his efforts. Democrats had made clear they’d tie him to the candidacy of Paladino, who has regularly made incendiary and overtly racist comments throughout his public life.\nThe seat opened up after former Rep. Tom Reed announced his retirement and two other incumbents declined to run in the new district following a messy redistricting process.\nLangworthy will face Democrat Max Della Pia in November in a district where Donald Trump received 59 percent of the vote in the new district’s borders in 2020. Trump did not endorse in the race.\nDella Pia also ran in a special election to finish off Reed’s term on Tuesday night, but he lost to Steuben County GOP chair Joe Sempolinski.",

        "description": "ITHACA, N.Y. — Joe Sempolinski’s path toward being likely one of the shortest-tenured members of Congress in New York history hasn’t exactly been straightforward.\nThe Steuben County Republican Committee chair began campaigning last year in an upstate district that stretched past Jamestown, 130 miles to the west. A new round of maps led him to start campaigning in a potential district that connected his home in the Southern Tier to Lewis County, 200 miles to the northeast in the Adirondacks.\nAnother redistricting plan resulted in Sempolinski dropping out and supporting Rep. Claudia Tenney when she announced plans to move out of the Utica area and run nearby. \nNow he’s well-positioned to be elected to the U.S. House in his own right — but don't blink. If he wins, he will have the second-briefest stint in Congress of the nearly 1,500 New Yorkers who have ever served in the chamber.\nSempolinski is running in an Aug. 23 special election to fill, until year's end, the heavily Republican seat that was vacated in May by Republican Rep. Tom Reed, his former boss. \nBut Sempolinski isn't looking to be elected to a full two-year term in November under new district lines. So if he wins the special election as expected, come January he'll be back home in Canisteo rather than the halls of Washington.\n“I’m running to serve for approximately four months. I would do it if it were for four minutes — because this is my home,” he said in a recent interview in Ithaca. \nSempolinski has spent most of the past decade working for Reed as district director, which required him to traverse the vast district stretches from the southwestern corner of New York to near Binghamton in the east and Seneca Falls and Geneva in the north.\n“Nobody knows that district as well as I do,” he said.\nHow Sempolinski might end up in Congress\n\n\n\nReed announced last year that he would not seek another term after he was accused of sexual misconduct, and Sempolinski quickly jumped into the race to replace him.\nBut the future of the district as the state debated new congressional maps was far from certain. One of the biggest questions throughout the drawn-out process was whether the Southern Tier along the Pennsylvania border would continue to have a seat of its own or whether it would be chopped up and joined with urban areas further north.\nTenney’s seat was ultimately the one that was split the most. And when she made clear she was willing to move to run elsewhere, that meant every incumbent Republican representing upstate had a district of their own, and Sempolinski, 39, stepped aside.\nEven he thought that was the end of his House aspirations.\nThen Reed abruptly announced his resignation in May, creating a special election to finish off the final months of his term. Since neither Tenney nor neighboring GOP Rep. Chris Jacobs could run in a special election in one corner of the state while representing another area, talk among Republicans quickly turned to having a placeholder.\nEnter Sempolinski.\n“When you swipe your little card [in Washington] and you press the yes or no button, you speak for about three quarters of a million people, which is a really profound thing if you think about it,\" he said of his potential election. \"So to do that once is meaningful. And three of those four months, the House is going to be in session, so there’s going to be a lot more than one vote cast.”\nIn the special election, Sempolinski will face Democratic candidate Max Della Pia, a former Air Force wing commander. Della Pia is also running for a full term in November, and he's hopeful that if he could pull off the special election upset against Sempolinski, it would propel his candidacy in the fall.\n\"It may be only four months or so, but from a political standpoint I think it's significant,\" Della Pia said. \"If I won, I would be going into the general election as an incumbent.\"\nThe district, however, is perhaps the safest Republican one in New York; Reed received 58 percent of the vote in 2020.\nWhile candidates expect turnout to be low in an atypically scheduled late-August primary, Republican participation in the special election will likely be stronger than elsewhere in New York.\nJacobs and Tenney swapped seats after the final district lines were released in May. Then, Jacobs came out in favor of gun control days after he announced his reelection. Backlash from Republicans led to him to drop out, and a fiery primary to face Della Pia between state GOP Chair Nick Langworthy and Buffalo developer Carl Paladino has now ensued. About 60 percent of the new district they are running in overlaps with the old Reed seat.\nThere are some Democratic primaries in parts of the district too, including in Ithaca, which is being moved to the congressional seat where Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro will be the GOP nominee in November. But they overlap with smaller portions of the seat that Sempolinski is seeking. \n“[Thanks to] Carl and I really getting a lot of Republicans out to vote, that’ll be taken care of,” Langworthy said of Republican turnout in the special election.\nA short timer\n\n\n\nSo what would Sempolinski do with a term that probably couldn’t start any earlier than Sept. 13, when the House next meets and will conclude Dec. 31?\nHe said he would be on some committees — though noted Republican leadership has made clear he’s got “the last draft pick” in choosing which ones — and would have the same opportunity to mark up bills as any other member.\nHe cited economic development as an issue he would like to focus on. And he would also like to work, if also elected, with Molinaro, who’s running in a separate special election against Ulster County Executive Pat Ryan in the eastern half of the state on the same day after Democratic Rep. Antonio Delgado resigned to serve as lieutenant governor.\n“One similarity with myself and Mr. Molinaro, my sort of running mate in the other special election, is we’re both very concerned about things that impact developmentally disabled kids,” Sempolinski said. “I have a daughter with Down syndrome; he has a daughter that’s on the autism spectrum. I’ve mentioned that to Marc, let’s see if there’s something in that arena.”\nThere have been only a handful of New Yorkers in the state’s history to serve in Congress for less than a full term, but, ironically, two of them have done so in the area recently.\nDemocrat Eric Massa won an election in the seat that preceded Reed’s in 2008, but resigned after 14 months in office when he admitted to instigating tickle fights with his staffers. An Erie County clerk named Kathy Hochul — now governor — won a special election to represent a neighboring seat in 2011, but did not win a full term the following year.\nThe record for the briefest tenure in New York’s history seems to belong to John Ward Hunter, who finished off the final 89 days of a term for a Brooklyn seat in 1866 and 1867.\nHis stint in Congress was most notable for an incident when House Republicans criticized Democrats for being sympathetic to the former Confederate states. Hunter, a Democrat, called that a “base lie.”\nHe quickly acknowledged that such language was “totally uncalled for.” But the standards of the House at the time meant those words were “a violation of the dignity and decency of debate,” and Hunter would go down in history as the 10th member of Congress ever censured.\nHunter would later become the mayor of Brooklyn. He and poet Walt Whitman were among the founding members of the Society of Old Brooklynites, or “SOBs,” a still-extant group that has spent over a century opposing the former city’s decision to merge with Manhattan.\nWhile Sempolinski would likely fall short of Hunter’s mark for brevity by a few weeks, he might claim a different milestone.\nAfter all the “twists and turns” of the past year and Reed’s retirement, he “needed to get a job,” he said. That wound up being with one of his “good friends,” Assemblymember Joe Giglio (R-Cattaraugus).\n“We were having lunch when it looked like I wasn’t running, and he said ‘why don’t you take a job with me,’” Sempolinski said. “So I was his chief of staff for about two months … I think I’m the first Assembly aide ever to leave to become a congressman.”\nAnd the Assembly’s minority conference might also provide an employment option after his potential congressional tenure.\n“[Giglio] said I could have my job back afterwards,” Sempolinksi said.",

        "description": "ALBANY, N.Y. — New York Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul had a 14 percentage-point lead over Republican challenger Lee Zeldin, the Siena College Research Institute found in a poll released Tuesday\nHochul led 53 percent to 39 percent in the first public poll conducted since the June primaries and the first to survey likely general election voters.\nWhile that’s a sizable lead for the incumbent, it’s also the third-best performance by a GOP nominee in a public gubernatorial poll in New York in the five elections since Republican Gov. George Pataki last ran in 2002. An outlier poll from Quinnipiac in 2010 found Andrew Cuomo with only a 6-point lead over Carl Paladino, and one from Siena a few days before Cuomo won the 2018 election by 22 points found him leading Marc Molinaro by 13 points.\n“Fourteen weeks is a long time in politics, and we know most voters don’t really begin to focus on elections till after Labor Day,” Siena spokesman Steve Greenberg said in a release. \n“Still, Hochul has an early — but certainly not insurmountable — lead. In fact, while Democrats have taken the last four gubernatorial elections, Zeldin’s current 14-point deficit matches the closest Republicans have come in those races, when Andrew Cuomo defeated Rob Astorino 54-40 percent in 2014. In August 2014, Cuomo led Astorino by 32 points, 58-26 percent.” \nHochul led by a margin of 70 percent to 21 percent among New York City voters. Zeldin led 46 percent to 43 percent in the suburbs and 48 percent to 45 percent upstate.\nA Republican has not won a statewide race since 2002 when Pataki was elected to a third term.\nOther Democrats enjoy double-digit leads: Sen. Chuck Schumer led Republican challenger Joe Pinion 56 percent to 35 percent. And Comptroller Tom DiNapoli similar had a 21-point edge, topping challenger Paul Rodriguez 51 percent to 30 percent.\nAttorney General Tish James led Republican challenger Michael Henry 50 percent to 36 percent.\nNone of these three Republicans had any significant name recognition. \nAbortion, gun control remain popular: Voters supported major components of the recent law by Democrats in the state Legislature to overhaul the concealed carry firearm law following a Supreme Court decision that stuck the existing one.\nA total of 82 percent of respondents supported adding requirements like a background check to obtain a concealed carry permit, while 15 percent opposed the expansion.\nRequiring businesses to post signs saying that concealed carrying is allowed was backed 63 percent to 32 percent, while prohibiting concealed weapons in locations like houses of worship and public transportation was backed 60 percent to 34 percent.\nOnly 25 percent of respondents supported the Supreme Court’s recent decision overturning Roe v. Wade, while 68 percent opposed it.\nSiena polled 806 likely voters from July 24 through July 28. The poll had a margin of error of 3.5 percentage points. View the crosstabs here.",

        "description": "HOWES CAVE, N.Y. — The candidates agree on one thing: Their upstate New York special election is a key midterm bellwether that will demonstrate just how energized the electorate is about the nation's single most critical issue.\nThey just don’t agree on what that issue is.\nRepublican Marc Molinaro, the executive in Dutchess County, is focused on the economy and taming inflation. And Democrat Pat Ryan, the executive in Ulster County, says he'll preserve abortion rights. \nThe victor in New York's 19th Congressional District will win just four months in office, filling the seat Democrat Antonio Delgado vacated when he became New York's lieutenant governor. \nBut the Aug. 23 contest — the first battleground House election since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade — could prove far more consequential, giving the clearest indication yet of whether abortion will be the issue that decides control of Congress.\nRyan, whose campaign has also focused on other recent Supreme Court rulings related to climate change and New York’s overturned concealed carry law, debuted his first campaign ad an hour after the court handed down its abortion decision in June.\n \n\n“We’ll look back on that week — or those really 48 hours of those decisions — as a real moment where the county woke back up in terms of what’s at stake, where we could go if we don’t intervene and change the trajectory,” he said in an interview at his campaign office in Kingston.\nMolinaro has previously supported taking New York’s law on abortion out of the criminal code, but he opposed 2019 legislation to codify abortion protections.\nOn Wednesday, Ryan challenged Molinaro to a debate solely focused on the issue.\n“This public debate on abortion rights would give Molinaro a chance to break his silence and correct the record on his stance—or make the case to voters why the federal government should restrict women’s basic human rights,” he said in a release. \nMolinaro has focused on the economy as he makes his case to the electorate.\n\n\n\n“There is little question that voters across upstate New York are focused on the rising cost of living and crime,” he said in an interview after he met with law enforcement in the hamlet of Howes Cave, a regular tourist spot known for its vast caverns. “People live in the now, and right now they can’t afford to make ends meet — they’re running up credit card bills to cover rising expenses, they’re worried about home heating fuel prices.”\n\"They’re making desperate choices, and frankly, that’s what voters are concerned about.”\nIn many ways, it's the most competitive high-profile race in the country — in the months when candidates are usually fine-tuning their messages ahead of November.\nAnd it comes under unusual circumstances: Molinaro and Ryan are competing to finish off the final few months of Delgado’s term in a seat that stretches from suburban Poughkeepsie to Cooperstown. Then they will be on the November ballot for separate seats due to new district lines.\nThe race pits two rising stars who live on opposite sides of the Hudson River against each other.\nMolinaro became the youngest mayor in the country when he won an election in the Poughkeepsie suburb of Tivoli at the age of 19 in 1995, but lost a quixotic gubernatorial campaign against Andrew Cuomo in 2018. Still, he's outpolled other Republicans in his swing county and has long been viewed as Republicans’ best chance at retaking the congressional seat Delgado won in 2018.\nRyan, a graduate of nearby West Point, finished second in the seven-way primary Delgado won that year. When Ryan ran for county executive in 2019, he received 78 percent of the vote for an office where the last Democratic contender got just 57 percent. He was open to a run for statewide office as Cuomo’s demise began last year.\n\n\n\nRegardless of how August shakes out, the two are going right back on the campaign trail for November contests in two newly drawn districts that contain pieces of the seat they are currently vying for. Both of those newly drawn seats are potentially competitive, and one candidate will run with the advantages of incumbency while the other enters with the brand of a recent loser.\nBut more immediately, the August contest will offer a preview of just how well the parties’ current messages might resonate in the fall. Both have plenty of topics that come up in their public appearances, but the heart of their campaigns rests in the issues that are at the center of the national debate.\n“The challenge economically and financially on upstate farmers, families, and small businesses is going to become even more challenging,” Molinaro said at an event outside a Schoharie Mobil gas station last week. “American inflation is tacking 2 to 4 percentage points ahead of European nations. Why? Because of reckless spending and dangerous policies coming out of Washington.\"\n \n\nHe urged his listeners to encourage their acquaintances to vote in August, even if they initially “decide that gas is a little too expensive to get in the car and drive to the polling place.”\nThere’s no better seat in New York to determine how these warring messages might resonate. Ever since a little-known lawyer named Kirsten Gillibrand stunned Republican Rep. John Sweeney in a predecessor district in 2006, it has been among the state’s most hotly contested.\nThe right and left have traded control since. Republican Chris Gibson took the seat by 5.6 percentage points in 2012, fellow Republican John Faso took it by 8.2 points in 2016. Then Delgado won by 5.2 points and 11.6 points in 2018 and 2020 respectively. Joe Biden won the district with less than 51 percent of the vote two years ago.\nEven if the abortion message resonates, few people expect the national climate to be as good for Democrats as it was in the years when Delgado won the seat with some breathing room. There’s plenty of evidence that Democratic voters are nowhere near as enthused as they were when Donald Trump was in the White House.\nBut there’s one critical factor on Ryan’s side that has been lost in some of the national prognostications on the race: Democratic enthusiasm has cooled less in recent years in this district than anywhere else in New York.\nConsider the local elections in November 2021. Those were among the worst on record for Democrats in places like Long Island. But the party performed extremely well in the mid-Hudson Valley, growing their majority in the Ulster County Legislature to its largest ever. Democrats won the sheriff’s office in nearby Columbia County for the first time in most observers’ memories.\n\n\n\nIn June, more Democrats voted in the Assembly primary for a seat centered on Kingston than in any other district in the state. And while Democratic turnout in last month’s gubernatorial primary dropped across the board compared to 2018, six of the 10 counties with the smallest dip are in the congressional district.\nIn the communities “really focused on driving change and progress” in recent years, Ryan said, “that flame is burning strong. … And the Supreme Court decisions are fuel on that flame.”\nMuch of that continued progressive energy can be attributed to a unique trend in the district.\nWoodstock, Hudson and Kingston have grown in recent decades as popular destinations for Brooklyn and Manhattan residents looking to move away from crowded New York City. There was an effort before Delgado’s 2018 victory to encourage residents of deep-blue districts to register to vote at their second homes in the purple seat.\nThat shift went into hyperdrive two years later when the Covid-19 pandemic turned living in a crowded city into a health risk. Tens of thousands of New York City residents have moved to the region since March 2020. By and large, they're Democrats.\nThat might not be enough to completely reshape the district's political landscape. But it could certainly offset dispassionate Democrats who are trending away from the ballot box there.\nThe baseline in the district could fall somewhere between Faso’s 8.2-point win in 2016 and Delgado’s average margin of victory of 8.4 points — making the race about as much of a toss-up as there can be.\nRyan shared an internal poll showing that Molinaro is ahead by 3 points. When voters are told that Molinaro has “opposed guaranteeing abortion rights,” Ryan said he’s up by 12 points.\nThose are believable numbers. But they don’t account for where voters will land if they’re made familiar with Molinaro’s position on abortion as well as an incessant message that Democrats like Ryan aren’t doing enough to tackle inflation.\n“There are enough Democrats agreeing with Democrats in state and federal government right now to have a pragmatic Republican who has lived the life of upstate New York,” Molinaro said.\n“I’ve known Pat, we’re friends — well we were until at least a few months ago, I hope we are afterward,” Molinaro said. “And I think right now more than ever, we just need somebody who is really going to hold Washington and Albany accountable. And Pat’s not able to do that, he’s not. He will be another vote for the Democratic majority in the House.”",

        "description": "ALBANY, N.Y. — The surprise resignation Monday of New York's top judge led to a groundswell of calls from Democratic state and federal lawmakers to reshape the court and move it in a more progressive direction in response to the conservative shift on the U.S. Supreme Court.\nChief Judge Janet DiFiore said she would resign next month, giving Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and the Democratic-led state Senate the opportunity to pick a new judge outside of the moderate picks made by former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who remade New York's top court during his 11 years in office.\nDemocrats in New York said the pick for the Court of Appeals in the coming months needs to counteract the Supreme Court's recent decisions to overturn Roe v. Wade and toss a restrictive concealed carry gun law that the state had on the books for a century.\n“It’s a real changing of the guard,” state Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Brad Hoylman (D-Manhattan), whose committee will need to sign off on any nomination, said in an interview with POLITICO. “It’s a pivotal moment for Governor Hochul to build her own legacy with a court that hopefully is both independent but respectful of the Legislature’s prerogative.”\nThe replacement will also be a chance for Hochul to address concerns that the court had close ties to Cuomo, particularly DiFiore who maintained a friendship with Cuomo during their years living in Westchester County. He picked her as chief judge in 2016.\n\"In light of recent U.S. Supreme Court decisions and now news of the New York Chief Judge stepping down, it is more important than ever that Governor Hochul nominates and the Senate confirms a progressive chief judge,\" Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie (D-Bronx) wrote on Twitter.\nHolyman pointed to DiFiore’s election as Westchester district attorney while an enrolled member of the GOP in 2005: “Let’s not forget that the chief judge was a Republican and a prosecutor. I don’t think that necessarily reflects the background that the Senate would want to see in a new chief judge.”\nThat background has been at the center of numerous complaints from the left about the court’s tilt in recent years.\n\n\n\nAs Cuomo departed office last year, the court consisted entirely of members he appointed. And it was dominated by former prosecutors like DiFiore.\nThere was plenty of evidence that the judges' resumes shaped the court’s decision making. Albany Law School Professor Vin Bonventre recently calculated that the DiFiore court heard an average of only 49 criminal appeals year compared to 101 per year under predecessor Jonathan Lippman. The chief judge was part of a four-member bloc in the seven-member court that often issued conservative rulings on subjects like police misconduct.\nProgressives have campaigned for a more diverse collection of experience on the bench in advance of each of the three appointments made over the past three years. It was clear within hours of DiFiore’s departure that the campaign will ramp up ahead of Hochul's move to make a new pick.\n“The absence of a public defender and civil legal services attorney on the court creates a tremendous gap of knowledge and experience,” the Legal Aid Society said in a statement. “It is more important than ever that Governor Hochul nominates and the Senate confirms a progressive chief judge,” Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie wrote on Twitter.\nRep. Hakeem Jeffries, (D-Brooklyn) who feuded with the court after DiFiore wrote the majority opinion in April that struck down the new Democratic-drawn district lines, was terser in his statement.\n“Good riddance,” he said.\nDiFiore turns 67 in August and was still a few years away from the mandatory retirement age of 70. A governor nominates a candidate for the state Court of Appeals and needs to be confirmed by the state Senate.\nBeyond the ideological bent of the court, the pick will also go a long way toward reshaping the popular perception that the top court functioned as a Cuomo ally.\nHochul, who is seeking full, four-year term in November, will have nominated only two of the seven members after picking a DiFiore replacement. None of the other five appointed by Cuomo will have their terms expire before 2027.\nBut none of the judges has been as closely connected to Cuomo as DiFiore.\n\n\n\nBefore picking her for the court, Cuomo chose DiFiore to chair the Joint Commission on Public Ethics. That entity spent most of its 11-year existence widely maligned as a toothless ethics watchdog controlled by the governor that is now being replaced by Hochul.\nCuomo also faced widespread calls to give Attorney General Tish James the power to investigate allegations of sexual misconduct levied against him as his administration began to implode in February 2021. His administration tried to fend off the scandal by pitching an investigation led jointly by James and the chief judge.\nThat raised a lot of eyebrows in Albany, not the least due to the fact that DiFiore’s role meant she would likely proceed over any potential impeachment trial. She quickly supported Cuomo’s pitch, though James refused to go along and ultimately was given the power to direct the probe that led to the governor’s resignation five months later.\n“I hope the next chief judge wants to protect litigants by creating more judges and funding the court system, which is suffering enormous backlogs from Covid and the need to move its filing system into the 21st century,” he said. “That’s going to take resources.”\n\n\n\nHoylman also pointed to DiFiore’s regular willingness to impose the same 2 percent annual budget increase on the courts that Cuomo said executive branch agencies should be subjected to.\nHe said that “the Legislature has been willing” to push for more help money for the courts in the annual budget, “but through collaboration with the previous governor,” the judicial branch didn’t ask for them.\n“It was alarming to those of us in the Senate that would regard themselves in effect as an executive agency by agreeing to the governor’s spending cuts,” Hoylman said.\nThe Commission on Judicial Nomination will screen candidates for the court opening in the coming months and create a short list of potential appointees. Hochul will then pick a name from that list, which would be sent to the Senate for confirmation.\nThe 12-member commission that has the first step in the process still has three Cuomo appointees on it, including former gubernatorial counsel Mylan Denerstein and former Assembly member Dede Scozzafava.\nHochul said in a statement on Monday that she looks \"forward to reviewing the recommendations of the Commission on Judicial Nomination as we work to appoint new leadership to the Court.\"",

        "description": "NEW YORK — Former federal prosecutor Dan Goldman beat a crowded field of Democrats — including incumbent Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.) — vying for a new congressional seat in Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn.\nGoldman was counsel to House Democrats during the first impeachment of former President Donald Trump, and he leaned on that experience heavily in campaign ads and forums by casting himself as a candidate with unique investigative chops that he could train on the GOP.\nHe declared victory around 10:30 p.m. Tuesday, with a little over 1,000 votes separating him from state Assemblymember Yuh-Line Niou in a contest with 13 names on the ballot and more than 64,000 votes cast. Hours later, the Associated Press called the race for him.\n\n“While we will appreciate and respect the Democratic process and make sure that all the votes are counted, it is quite clear from the way that the results have come in that we have won,” Goldman told supporters as he declared victory. “It is because of you and everyone in this room who worked so hard together to get us here, working toward a shared pragmatic and progressive vision for this city and this country.”\nAddressing her supporters before the AP’s call, Niou said she was holding out for the full tally.\n“Tonight’s results aren’t yet what we hoped to hear. But we will not concede until we count every vote,” Niou said. “Because what we can do together is too important to give up this fight. Our vision is that we sent a powerful mission and powerful message this election. We sent the message that things can get better, that things can change, that people can take back control of their government.”\nJones, who opted to move to the city to avoid a potential primary with Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) in New York’s suburbs conceded Tuesday night. He currently represents parts of Westchester and Rockland counties. City Council Member Carlina Rivera also conceded.\nA crowded field competed for the Brooklyn-and-Manhattan seat, created by a court-ordered redistricting plan.\nGoldman emerged as the frontrunner in polls, and opponents quickly sought to paint him as too moderate for the district. But the city’s institutional left split their support among several of those candidates.\nAn heir to the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. fortune, Goldman poured $4 million from his own personal wealth into the race and received a cash infusion from family and company associates early on. Those deep pockets allowed him to blanket the airwaves with ads.\nHe won the endorsement of the New York Times, an influential nod in a district with many affluent liberals.\nIn the closing days of the race, rivals set their sights on toppling Goldman from the front runner’s perch, accusing him of trying to buy the race — though they declined to consolidate behind a single alternative.\nJones and Niou held a joint press conference denouncing Goldman’s wealth and his personal investments. And last week, Rivera and former Rep. Liz Holtzman, also a candidate in the NY-10, held a similar tag-team event to ding Goldman over abortion, targeting comments he later walked back saying he was open to some restrictions on the procedure.\n\n“Once he got the Times endorsement, it became clear he was the frontrunner,” said political consultant Jon Paul Lupo, who is not working for anyone in the race. “And if you’re one of the other candidates, you have to figure out a way to chase him down.”\nNiou leaned on door-knocking and phone banking — key elements for a sleepy August primary. The furthest left in a field where multiple candidates competed for the progressive lane, she won the endorsement of the Working Families Party. She could still run on the WFP’s ballot line in the general election.\nNiou, who is Taiwanese American, also seized on the opportunity to increase Asian representation in a district that is 20 percent Asian, uniting Chinatowns in Manhattan and Brooklyn’s Sunset Park.\nThe 10th district was created after a judge threw out a gerrymandered redistricting map designed by state Democratic lawmakers and ordered up a new one. The result threw New York’s political world into chaos.\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) represents the current 10th district. But his home and base on the Upper West Side were moved to the 12th district and he opted to run there against fellow incumbent Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), a contest he won Tuesday night.\n\nMadina Touré contributed to this report.",

        "description": "NEW YORK — One of Mayor Eric Adams’ top aides has amassed a personal fortune that included more than $500,000 in income last year, a palatial Florida estate and at least $1.2 million worth of investments, according to a new financial disclosure.\nThe mandatory filing, released Thursday by the city’s Conflicts of Interest Board, shows chief of staff Frank Carone is every bit as wealthy as his lavish lifestyle suggests: A mover and shaker known in political circles as a frequent patron of the city’s trendiest restaurants and an avid traveler for work and pleasure.\nCarone’s personal finances, disclosed for the first time since he assumed the $251,982-a-year City Hall job in January, stemmed from a Brooklyn law firm he helped grow into a sprawling practice that handles everything from divorce proceedings to criminal litigation.\nCarone joined the ranks of the firm, Abrams Fensterman, a decade ago and was named a top partner six years later. During his tenure, he kept a hand in local politics and played a central role in Adams’ mayoral campaign.\nLast year, Carone held between $1.2 million to $3.3 million in stocks, securities and a retirement account, according to the annual form — which was amended on Wednesday and released weeks after those of other top city officials. He invested in several industry-specific index funds along with Amazon, Alphabet (the parent company of Google), JP Morgan Chase and Waste Management, among others.\nThe lawyer also poured more than $1.5 million into a trio of businesses — a surgery center, an investment firm and a lending company — all headquartered at the same Lake Success address of one of Abrams Fensterman’s offices in Nassau County, according to the 23-page disclosure.\nA man of high taste, Carone owns at least four properties, including a 5,000-square-foot house in Boca Raton, Fla., according to the disclosure. The ethics board does not require filers to list their primary residences, making it difficult to discern the scope of one’s real estate holdings. But Carone enjoys waterfront views from the deck of his Mill Basin home and purchased a $2.2 million co-op on the East Side of Manhattan after Adams took office.\nThrough the law firm, Carone provided legal guidance to the embattled Brooklyn Democratic Party, which is embroiled in a civil war between party loyalists and reformers — something that has spilled into the Adams administration’s political agenda as high-ranking staffers have gotten involved in low-level races to help allies and unseat foes.\nBut Carone’s relationship with Adams transcends politics.\nDuring Adams’ 2021 mayoral campaign, he provided legal counsel, hosted fundraisers and offered discounted office space that the candidate only paid for after POLITICO inquired about the seeming freebie. In fact, the two are so close they have spent Thanksgiving dinners together.\nThey also share a penchant for the city’s pulsating night life.\n“In my prior role as a law firm partner, the nature of my business required me to network and spend most nights at dinners and events,” Carone wrote in the disclosure form, explaining the up-to-$10,000 in dinners and gifts he accepted over the course of 2021. “As a city employee, I have recused myself from working on any matters involving any of my former clients.”\nAs POLITICO previously reported, Carone divested from the firm on Dec. 31, 2021, and has employed something of an honor system as he navigates potential conflicts of interest with Abrams Fensterman clients who have city business. For example, a high-profile real estate firm he represented, Fortis Property Group, is building a waterfront skyscraper in Downtown Brooklyn for which it will have interactions with municipal agencies. The company has also lobbied the Adams administration, though not Carone directly, public reports show.\nCarone disclosed that days before the start of the Adams administration, he was still owed more than $500,000 from clients.\n“I had many clients who owed fees for services rendered and cannot list names,” Carone wrote on his Conflicts of Interest Board disclosure. The form, which was amended on Wednesday and released weeks after most city officials’ disclosures, covers all of 2021.\n“Before he began his position at City Hall, Frank fully separated from his former law firm,\" City Hall spokesperson Fabien Levy said in a statement. \"As part of that arrangement, he is not eligible for any additional payments due to his former firm. We cannot speak as to whether any of these accounts have been paid to the firm or not, as Frank has no involvement any longer.”\nAsked why he did not name clients who owe money to the firm, Carone cited discretion.\n“During the year, we bill clients and sometimes they pay on time and sometimes they do not. This is a general answer and nonetheless my clients from last year deserve privacy and I am obligated to respect that,” he said.\nA representative of Abrams Fensterman — where Carone’s brother is a partner working in real estate and government relations — said the firm was in the process of collecting what it is owed, but stressed none of the money would go to Carone.\n“The dollars referenced were owed to the entity Abrams Fensterman of which he was a member. ... Those arrears are being collected by the firm,” said the representative, Gary Lewi. “It is important to restate that Mr. Carone has no interest in Abrams Fensterman and, for that matter, any asset of the firm.”",

        "description": "NEW YORK — In a deep-blue stronghold of 8.8 million people, where Democratic voters dominate Republicans 7 to 1, a conservative city lawmaker from the remotest reach of the self-proclaimed “forgotten borough” has emerged a power broker.\nStaten Island Council Member Joe Borelli, leader of the 51-member body’s five-person Republican caucus, is playing an outsize role reforging the Council district lines that lawmakers must defend next year in an off-cycle election triggered by once-in-a-decade redistricting.\nBorelli, who made a local name for himself defending Donald Trump on cable news, appeared to ally himself with one of the city’s top Democrats (Mayor Eric Adams) and outmaneuver another (Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, no relation to the mayor) in service of a redistricting coup that’s shaping battle lines for years to come.\nHe was granted just three appointees to a 15-member commission that is overseeing the map-drawing process. The mayor, meanwhile, placed seven members and the speaker got five. Yet in selecting the prevailing map this month, the commission opted against another proposal that would have required Staten Island to absorb neighborhoods in Brooklyn, according to a copy of the discarded map reviewed by POLITICO.\nThe result gave Borelli what he'd been hard at work angling for: Staten Island’s borders stayed intact and its three Council seats remained virtually unchanged, even as districts were upended elsewhere.\nThe ripple effects were immediate and expansive.\nStaten Island’s population grew over the last 10 years, but at a slower rate than other parts of the city. To meet requirements that each district contain roughly the same number of people, the commission shifts lines to grow or shrink its size. Keeping Staten Island whole left less wiggle room to design the remainder of the jigsaw puzzle while still complying with a host of city, state and federal criteria.\nIn Manhattan, for example, population growth required several districts to shed voters — shrinking their boundaries. Having more leeway there would have reduced the need to carve up neighborhoods like Hell’s Kitchen.\n“The border between Staten Island and Brooklyn is nearly a mile and $20,” Borelli said in an interview from a family vacation in Greece Monday, referring to the oft-lamented toll on the Verrazzano-Narrows Bridge that links the boroughs. “We have nothing in common with any other part of the city, and given our small population, we already have a hard enough time getting attention from City Hall.”\nStaten Island — home for decades to a massive garbage dump that has since shuttered — long ago dubbed their suburban enclave the “forgotten borough.” And their elected officials have a rich tradition of rejecting integration, arguing their perceived poor treatment all but mandates they maintain their unique identity. In fact, Borelli recently moved to revive an old proposal that the borough secede from the rest of the city.\nWhen it comes to keeping island-specific Council districts, Democrats and Republicans alike who represent the self-contained, conservative bastion agree, Borelli said. He plans to defend the redistricting proposal even as many of his Council colleagues mount challenges against their new lines before the commission finalizes the maps by February. \n“I will use whatever influence I have to make sure Staten Island doesn’t lose an ounce of power at City Hall,\" Borelli said.\nWhen the redistricting process got underway earlier this year, Borelli said he immediately made clear his desire to avoid any expansion into Brooklyn. Along with his two Staten Island Council counterparts, including Democratic Council Member Kamillah Hanks, he encouraged residents to testify publicly in favor of keeping the borough intact.\n“We ask that we continue to be the Forgotten Borough, in the sense that we be independent, that all three of our districts be ourselves,” the Port Richmond Strong Civic Association said in testimony that referenced the borough’s role in protecting George Washington’s boats from seizure by Lord Charles Cornwallis. “It rescued the American war effort,” the testimony continued.\nThe wealth of input was among nearly three hours of public comments at a July 7 public hearing at Staten Island Borough Hall that convinced the commission to keep the districts on-island, according to Eddie Borges, the commission’s spokesperson.\n“There was a major turnout,” he said. “And that influenced the commissioners.”\nDays before the maps were released July 15, Borelli told POLITICO he was “optimistic” the commission would heed his request.\n“If someone coughed and it sounded like ‘redistricting commission,’ I reminded them how important it was to keep Staten Island whole,” he said on Monday.\nGiven his numerical disadvantage on the commission, Borelli would need to forge an alliance or gain the tacit approval of either the mayor’s or the speaker’s camps to protect Staten Island.\nBorelli, a Council member for seven years after serving in the state Assembly for two years, came to the table on good terms with the mayor’s team, having sided with them amid the contentious Council speaker’s race in December. The in-house contest sowed the seeds of dissent between the mayor and Brooklyn Council Member Justin Brannan, who represents Bay Ridge, the politically purple district across the water from Staten Island.\nSome of the mayor’s top lieutenants have openly expressed disdain for Brannan since that race, so much so that it was widely expected the maps would not favor him in his Bay Ridge seat, where he won reelection by a razor-thin margin in 2021. Weeks before the maps came out, the Bay Ridge Democrats, a club founded by Brannan, tweeted that the neighborhood was in danger of being split into three pieces.\nHis concern appears justified: When the maps were released, Bay Ridge had been drawn into the same district as the Latino stronghold of Sunset Park, forcing Brannan to potentially face off against Democratic colleague Alexa Avilés. The two have publicly denounced the lines, which the commission says were drawn to create a predominantly Asian district nearby.\nSeveral people involved in the process, who spoke about ongoing negotiations on condition of anonymity, said they believed Borelli teamed up with the mayor — something Borelli would not confirm.\n“Nothing is settled until it’s settled,” he said.\nPressed whether his appointees forged an alliance with the mayor’s, he replied: “You’ll have to ask them. … I am aware, of course. But I don’t need to be calling the plays to be the general manager of our small team.”\nWhen asked whether the mayor’s commissioners formed an alliance with Borelli’s — and what role anger at Brannan played in the process — a mayoral spokesperson only praised the mayor’s picks.\n“We have full faith in the work of our nominees to the independent Districting Commission, and trust they will unveil a final map that represents the diversity of New York City after additional community input,” mayoral spokesperson Fabien Levy said in a statement.\nCommission Chair Dennis Walcott said at a July 15 meeting that the lines were drawn in response to community input.\nBorges, the spokesperson, said he did not know whether the mayor’s appointees teamed up with Borelli’s, but the commission did not break into different factions when it voted 11-2, with one abstention, to release a preliminary set of maps earlier this month. One commissioner was on vacation and did not vote.\n“This is not a commission where they were organizing and voting together, it was very collegial,” he said, noting that all commissioners had the opportunity to provide input as the maps were being drawn.\nYet not everyone applauded the outcome.\nIn addition to pitting Brannan and Avilés against each other, an Orthodox Jewish voting bloc in Williamsburg has been carved up, one Bronx politician’s district office is now outside the district he represents and Hell’s Kitchen will now be divided into three districts instead of two.\n“[The GOP] want to see Staten Island retain some special status,” said one Democratic Council member who asked not to be named. “And that screws up a lot of the other districts.”\nIndeed, the commission’s decision impacts every seat in the city. And members are starting to make their concerns known to Speaker Adrienne Adams, who largely stayed out of the process after appointing her five commissioners — two of whom voted against releasing the new maps — according to multiple people familiar with the process who spoke with POLITICO.\nCouncil spokesperson Breeana Mulligan said the body’s hands-off approach was designed to maintain the commission’s independence.\n“Redistricting is about New Yorkers and the representation of our communities, and the public’s interest must be protected from being overtaken by political interests,” she said in a statement. “Now that these first preliminary draft maps have been released, it is imperative that the voices of all New Yorkers be heard to bring us closer to final maps.”\nMembers expect the speaker to weigh in on the new lines before the commission releases its next round of maps. And the Council will eventually have the opportunity to exercise a one-time veto, which would send the maps back for more revisions.\nBut Borelli and the GOP will retain the best seat in the house.\n“As bizarre as it is, the person who holds the most cards is actually the minority leader,” said one person involved in a previous Council redistricting process. “Because he or she can make the deal.”",

        "description": "NEW YORK — When Dan Goldman mounted a short-lived run for state attorney general last year, he quickly raised more than $600,000 from a network of family members, many of whom are connected to the fortunes of Levi Strauss &amp; Co., a titan of the blue jean industry to which he is an heir.\nNow, the lead counsel to House Democrats in the first impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump is running in a crowded Democratic primary for an open congressional seat spanning Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn. And while Goldman has said he hasn’t tapped into any personal wealth, many of the same immediate and extended kin with Levi Strauss &amp; Co. ties are again lining his pockets.\nThe familial money flowing to Goldman is part of a larger current of money from outside the newly drawn 10th Congressional District, public records show. That means moneyed donors from elsewhere in New York and across the country, rather than potential constituents, are underwriting candidates’ paid media and ground operations — activities that will prove decisive with no incumbent in the 13-person race.\nAnd with just a month to go before what could be a sleepy August primary, time is of the essence.\n“They have to spend a lot of time on name recognition, which is a drain on resources but is necessary,” said political consultant Basil Smikle Jr. “That is going to require a lot of money. If they can get that quicker from sources outside the district, it’s important that they do that — and they can explain it later.”\nOf the $2.7 million that individuals gave to the top-five-grossing Democratic primary candidates, more than three-quarters of the cash came from ZIP codes outside the district, according to an analysis of Federal Election Commission data covering the second quarter of the year.\nCampaigns must disclose the address of anyone giving more than $200, a requirement that paints a picture of fundraising activity in the district and the immediate surrounding area.\nSmaller donations, which are not itemized by individual donor, made up another $155,000 of the five candidates’ collective haul. Along with contributions from political action committees, they were not included in POLITICO’s analysis.\n\nGoldman, who also served as a Manhattan federal prosecutor, raised $279,400 from contributors living inside the district — the most out of any candidate.\nHe also raised more than three times that amount from outside the seat, far eclipsing his competitors.\nDonors from California, for example, poured around $277,000 into his campaign coffers, FEC data show. That’s more than Manhattan Assembly Member Yuh-Line Niou, another Democrat running for the seat, raised from the entirety of her itemized contributions over the same period, which covers April through June.\nThe Golden State is home to members of Goldman’s extended family, many of whom are intertwined in the generational wealth generated by San Francisco-based Levi Strauss &amp; Co.\nWhile candidates typically tap into friends and family connections early in their fundraising, taken together Goldman’s haul is significant. He raised more than $200,000 from immediate and extended family — including aunts, uncles and cousins — along with a few others involved in organizations connected to the family.\nMany of the same people also contributed five-figure sums to Goldman’s run for attorney general last year, when he raised more than $1 million in a month.\nAn aunt who lives in San Francisco, for example, chipped in nearly $70,000 to Goldman’s attorney general campaign. In June, she gave $5,800 to her nephew’s congressional run, the most allowed by the FEC for the primary and general campaigns. Peter Haas Jr., whose father helped grow Levi Strauss &amp; Co. into a global brand beginning in the 1950s, gave roughly $23,000 to Goldman’s attorney general campaign and $2,900 to his congressional run.\nGoldman’s campaign said that more than 2,000 people contributed, including 1,500 people who gave $100 or less.\nA spokesperson noted that Goldman raised the most money from within the district, and said that his overall fundraising is a result of his national platform as an MSNBC analyst — and from his screen-time during the impeachment trial.\nIn total, Goldman, who has about $1 million left in his account, raised just under a third of his campaign cash from neighborhoods in the district.\nSeveral of his competitors raised less.\n\nJust 14 percent of the roughly $440,000 in itemized donations to U.S. Rep. Mondaire Jones, for example, came from within the new 10th District.\nJones currently represents parts of Westchester and Rockland counties north of New York City, and with $2.8 million, he's sitting on the largest war chest in the race. The freshman lawmaker opted to run for the open New York City seat after a chaotic redistricting process would have pitted him against U.S. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney on his home turf north of the five boroughs.\nJones recently moved into the district, but his donor base did not appear to follow.\nHe saw some of his biggest hauls from Manhattan ZIP codes north of the district — along with Rockland and Westchester counties, according to FEC data, though he also raised significant sums from Brooklyn Heights and Tribeca.\nAt the other end of the spectrum, City Council Member Carlina Rivera raised more than a third of her donations from inside the district, the most of any of the five top Democratic primary candidates. She has roughly $354,000 on hand.\nAmong Rivera’s benefactors from outside the 10th District was a concentration of the state’s lobbying class, which appears to be betting on her run. Donors from the Parkside Group, Geto &amp; de Milly, Patrick Jenkins, Pitta Bishop &amp; Del Giorno, Constantinople &amp; Vallone and CMW Strategies all chipped into her campaign. A donor from Tusk Strategies who gave also lives in the district.\nSome of those lobbyists, such as Michael Woloz of CMW Strategies, gave to other candidates — namely former Mayor Bill de Blasio, who dropped out of the running Tuesday after raising $483,725 from individual donors who gave more than $200. More than 80 percent of them lived outside the district.\nNiou, the Manhattan assembly member, raised around $196,000 from the same type of donors. And while only 21 percent came from within the district, she also had the highest share of small-dollar donations that are not required to be itemized.\nDonations under $200 represented a fraction of contributions to most of the top five, but they constituted around 18 percent of Niou’s haul.\nTechnically speaking, Assembly Member Jo Anne Simon’s funding came almost exclusively from the district — but that's because it came out of her pocket and she lives there.\nThe Democratic state lawmaker loaned her own campaign $134,000 and chipped in another $5,000 donation, representing more than two-thirds of all the money she raised.",

        "description": "NEW YORK — Former Mayor Bill de Blasio ended his congressional bid, and his political career, Tuesday with $450,000 left in campaign coffers and a pile of unrelated debt — now he may be able to use the leftovers to fulfill some of his outstanding obligations.\nThe Park Slope resident has lingering debt with other campaign accounts and owes six figures to a white-shoe law firm. The city’s Department of Investigation has also hit him with the tab for a city-funded security detail during his 2019 run for president.\nRules from the Federal Election Commission, however, limit what de Blasio can do with the cash. He cannot, for instance, appropriate the money for personal use. \nThe backstory: The former mayor’s obligations stem from a few sources.\nA federal political action committee he set up in 2018 called Fairness PAC owes $30,625 in outstanding payments but has just over $3,000 on hand.\nHis presidential campaign account is similarly underwater by about $75,000.\nDe Blasio has vowed to set up a legal defense fund to pay more than $300,000 to Kramer Levin Naftalis &amp; Frankel, which represented him during an ethics investigation into his fundraising. The city's Conflicts of Interest Board said Wednesday that no such fund has been set up. \nAnd the city’s Department of Investigation has called on the mayor to pay around $320,000 to cover the cost of his NYPD security detail during his presidential run.\nA debt-free BdB? The mayor could keep the money at the federal level to use for a future run for office or for a political action committee, but the FEC generally prohibits candidates from transferring leftover cash back to old accounts, a spokesperson said Wednesday.\nThat means it’s unlikely the mayor would be able to wipe out what he owes from his federal PAC. Instead, he would be limited to contributing $5,000 annually.\nHowever, an advisory opinion from 1987 pertaining to the ill-fated presidential run of late Sen. John Glenn suggests that de Blasio may be able to pay off debts stemming from his own quest for the White House. And according to the FEC, there is no rule prohibiting campaigns from reimbursing localities for the cost of security — meaning his tab with the NYPD could be fair game.\nDe Blasio could also transfer the money wholesale to a state committee, according to the FEC and the state Board of Elections. He would have two to choose from: The New York Fairness PAC, which he ostensibly set up to support the campaigns of like-minded Democrats, and New Yorkers for a Fair Future, the vehicle he used to explore a run for governor last year.\nBoth of those committees are solvent.\nElection lawyer Martin Connor said the 2017 ethics probe pertained to de Blasio's fundraising activity on the state level, so he might be able to transfer the campaign cash to a state committee and then put it toward his tab with Kramer Levin. \n\"[The investigation] did relate to his political activities in the state, and/or his actions as a public official in the state,\" Connor said. \"So I think he can use state campaign funds to pay that bill.\"",

        "description": "Former Mayor Bill de Blasio is done running. \nIn a Tuesday tweet, the Park Slope resident — who represented the neighborhood on the City Council and served as the city public advocate before moving into Gracie Mansion — announced he was dropping out of a crowded congressional race to represent Lower Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn.\nThe move, he noted, also marked his end in electoral politics. De Blasio ran for president in 2019 and more recently toyed with a run for governor before launching a bid for the 10th Congressional District, an open seat created this year in the state's chaotic redistricting process.\n\"It's clear the people of #NY10 are looking for another option and I respect that,\" de Blasio tweeted. \"Time for me to leave electoral politics and focus on other ways to serve. I am really grateful for all the people I met, the stories I heard and the many good souls who helped out.\"\nCampaign adviser Neal Kwatra said in an interview that while the former mayor received great feedback while interacting with voters, public polls and internal research showed a narrow path for de Blasio to win. \n\"There was a cognitive dissonance with what we were seeing on the campaign trail and in the streets and what we were finding in the research,\" he said. \nDe Blasio ended his eighth-year tenure in City Hall with low polling numbers, especially among the type of white liberals in brownstone Brooklyn that represent a key voting bloc within the 10th District.\nIn a recent poll from Data for Progress, just 5 percent of respondents supported de Blasio, putting him at the back of a pack that includes Council Member Carlina Rivera, Assemblymembers Yuh-Line Niou and Jo Anne Simon, former federal prosecutor Dan Goldman and U.S. Rep. Mondaire Jones. Despite de Blasio's almost universal name recognition in vote-rich parts of the district, Rivera led the poll with 15 percent support.\nBruce Gyory, a senior government and policy adviser at law firm Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips who has been tracking the race, said New York City mayors typically have a hard time winning elected office after their terms are up. Running city government inevitably involves making decisions about sanitation, crime, housing and education that anger some slice of the electorate. And after eight years, those slices add up to a significant portion of the pie.\n\"Moses, Muhammad and Jesus, if they came down and were mayor, would not leave with overwhelming popularity, even amongst their own followers,” he said. “It’s just the nature of the beast.\"\nShould de Blasio have waited, Gyory argued, he might have had a better shot at winning a race.\n“He probably should have given his electoral ambitions time for there to be a kind of renaissance of his reputation, rather than the more immediate recollections of frustration that any two-term mayor would face,” he said.\nThe former mayor raised nearly $500,000 during his short-lived congressional run — with many former staffers chipping in — and as of the end of June had spent just over $60,000, leaving him sitting on a serious pot of cash. The former mayor and some of the past campaign committees he is associated with have outstanding tabs, though it was unclear if he could use any of the federal contributions to pay off those bills.",

        "description": "In Kyiv, we are marking the day under the constant threat of Russian attack – and facing a watershed in the course of the war  A year ago on 24 August – the 30th anniversary of Ukraine’s independence – a new generation of pilots were leading the Ukrainian air forces flying over Independence Square in Kyiv. The fighter jet column was headed by Anton Lystopad, who was recognised as one of the country’s best pilots. He was 30 years old, born in the year of independence. Almost a year later, in August 2022, Lystopad received the Order for Courage from the president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy. A few days after the ceremony, he was killed in combat.Lystopad’s story may sound almost too symbolic, but Ukrainians have become used to such tragic symbolism. Six months on from the start of the Russian invasion, with its indiscriminate bombardment of peaceful towns, the atrocities and horrors of Bucha and Mariupol, but also the solidarity, resilience and sacrifices we have experienced, everything feels sharper and deeper. The bitterness of losses and the joy of survival.

        "description": "Dan Goldman, an attorney who served as the lead counsel in the first impeachment trial against former President Trump, is projected to win the Democratic primary in New York’s 10th Congressional District.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press called the race at 12:39 a.m. Wednesday.\n\n\n\nGoldman was among a dozen candidates seeking the Democratic nod in the New York House district.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), who currently represents the 10th Congressional District, wound up facing Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) in the newly created 12th Congressional District due to redistricting.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOther Democrats vying for seat included Rep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), who represents the 17th Congressional District but ran in the 10th to avoid a primary fight with another member of Congress; New York state Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou, New York City Council Member Carlina Rivera and former New York City Comptroller Liz Holtzman.\n\n\n\nGoldman, a Levi Strauss &amp; Co. heir, poured millions of dollars into his election bid, and he had received a coveted endorsement from The New York Times editorial board. Some candidates sought to portray the former federal prosecutor as attempting to \"purchase\" his seat and not being liberal enough for their party.\n\n\n\n“He’s not [a] traditional politician. He hasn’t held elected office before, and it’s something that we’ve had to grow accustomed to, but it’s you know, it’s par for the course. And Dan, through all of it, is very much committed to keeping things positive … and, you know, let everybody else scrap it out and do whatever they want,” Goldman’s campaign told The Hill in an interview last week.",

If you are of a certain vintage, that name will probably bring back a Proustian rush of sensory memories: Impulse Vanilla Kisses body spray, the feel of a Primal Scream Screamadelica cassette in your hands, the taste of Hooch on your tongue – all the greatest hits of 1990s Britain. At only 18, De Cadenet was one of the hosts on the cult Channel 4 late-night show The Word, and images of her in all her messy teenage glory, with chunky blond hair falling around her shoulders and tights always ripped, were everywhere. The tabloids gleefully tutted at the careening nightlife antics of the “wild child”, as they invariably called her.When she was 20, she ran off to the US with John Taylor of Duran Duran soon after she had their daughter, Atlanta. Despite the doomsayers’ predictions, she did not become another show-business casualty: she and Taylor broke up but remain friends, and she later married Nick Valensi from the Strokes and had twins. Her professional career was even more surprising as she became a portrait photographer for glossy magazines – and a good one. Continue reading...",

        "description": "A New York special election seen as the last, best test of the electorate’s midterm leanings confirmed what Democrats hoped and Republicans feared: Predictions of a red wave may be overblown.\nTo be sure, Donald Trump had a winning night. But so did Ron DeSantis, who demonstrated Trump isn’t the only Republican in Florida with a political machine.\nPrimaries in four more states, including New Hampshire, are yet to come. But Tuesday marked the last of the year’s major, multi-state contests, leaving the shape of the general election landscape all but complete.\nHere are five takeaways from a key primary night in Florida and New York:\nNew York’s ‘canary in a coal mine’\nIt would have been easy to write Nebraska off as a fluke, after Democrats ran better than expected in a House race there last month. But then came Minnesota, where Democrats again beat expectations. And then, in New York on Tuesday, the dam broke.\n“Well, shit,” one Republican strategist texted late Tuesday, as results from a Hudson Valley special election filtered in.\nIt would have been a victory for Democrats if they’d even kept it close. Instead, Democrat Pat Ryan beat Republican Marc Molinaro in a district that Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020, but that would have appeared to favor Republicans in a normal midterm climate.\n\nOverall, on the last major primary night of the year, the winds appeared to be shifting in Democrats’ favor.\nIt can be tempting to read too much into special elections. They’re not always predictive of results in the fall, and Republicans this year have overperformed in some places, too. In June, the GOP won a South Texas House seat that had been held by a Democrat.\nBut that was before Roe shook the political landscape. Ever since, it’s been nothing but one sign after another that Democrats — while still widely expected to lose the House in November — might not be in for the all-out drubbing once predicted.\nThe New York race to succeed Democrat Antonio Delgado in a New York House district is likely a better indicator than the House races in Minnesota or Nebraska. For one thing, it’s the most current data we have. But more than that, it’s a competitive district where both parties spent real money and tested their general election messaging — abortion for Democrats, the economy for Republicans. It was about as close to a November test run as we’re going to get.\n“This is a Republican versus a Democrat. They’re not crazy. No one’s off the wall,” said Hank Sheinkopf, a longtime Democratic strategist based in New York. “That’s why it’s a good test.”\n \n\nDemocrats passed and then some.\n“If Pat Ryan out-and-out wins, or even comes within 5 points of beating Molinaro, all projections of a red wave are completely overblown,” said New York-based Democratic strategist Jon Reinish, a former aide to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.). “This race is really a canary in a coal mine.”\nBut Trump is still rolling\nIn a midterm cycle dominated by Donald Trump, it was a House race in Florida on Tuesday that laid bare more clearly than anywhere just how much Republicans are willing to stomach in their service to the former president and his fiercest allies.\nNot even a federal investigation into whether Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) had sex with a 17-year-old girl and paid her for it (Gaetz has denied any wrongdoing) was enough to dent his MAGA celebrity. Not even close.\nGaetz, a Trump favorite, beat his closest opponent by more than 40 percentage points.\nWith the primaries all but finished now, Trump’s midterm record is not without blemishes. There was his humiliation in Georgia in May. His preferred candidates lost gubernatorial races in Idaho and Nebraska. And in New Hampshire, Trump-world failed to find any prominent Republican to run against the incumbent governor, Chris Sununu. Sununu, who called Trump “fucking crazy” at the roast-style Gridiron Club dinner this year, is likely to easily win re-nomination in his primary next month.\nBut for the most part — from J.D. Vance’s victory in the Ohio Senate primary in May to Rep. Liz Cheney’s (R-Wyo.) ouster in Wyoming last week — the midterms belonged to the former president.\n \n\nGaetz was the icing on the cake.\n“In general, probably the former president has maybe even a better win-loss record than some people would have expected,” said Mark Graul, a Republican strategist who worked on George W. Bush’s 2004 campaign.\nIf Trump-ism is ever going to “flush its way through” the Republican Party, he said, the lesson of this year’s primaries is that “it’s going to take more than one election cycle.”\nDeSantis’ flexes his political muscle\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ political muscle was on full display Tuesday night, as candidates he endorsed won a handful of key state legislative races and a wave of school board seats, which were a main focus for the governor in the final weeks of the 2022 midterm.\nDeSantis’ biggest legislative win was Republican Kiyan Michael, who is running for a Jacksonville state House seat. Michael was running against more established and better funded politicians, including a former state representative.\nDeSantis did not endorse until late in the race, but his support gave Michael immediate momentum to overcome her Republican rivals. She ended up securing 47 percent of the vote in a three-way primary.\n \n\nDeSantis also backed Florida Senate candidate Blaise Ingoglia and Jonathan Martin, both Republicans. The impact of the governor’s endorsement was felt long before Election Day because it cleared a potentially crowded field in both races.\nFor the final weeks of primary season, DeSantis put an outsized effort, including contributions from his personal political committee, into local school boards across the state. It’s part of his broader agenda to reshape Florida’s education system.\nIt worked. Of the 30 school board candidates that got DeSantis’ formal support, 21 won their election bids Tuesday night.\nFlorida Republicans, with DeSantis taking the lead, have poured thousands of dollars into school board races this election cycle, elevating those generally sleepy races into top midterm targets for the GOP, and putting at times surprised Democrats on underfunded defense.\nMore fringe candidates headed to Congress\nDefense contractor Cory Mills boasted that he would make the media shed “real tears” after news accounts reported on how his company sold tear gas used on Black Lives Matters demonstrators. Mills has also questioned the legitimacy of President Joe Biden’s win in 2020.\nAnna Paulina Luna, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump, alleged last year that a handful of her rivals were engaged in a conspiracy to kill her.\nBoth are poised to join the Republican caucus in Congress after winning their respective primaries for Florida’s 7th and Florida’s 13th congressional districts. The contests in both races were noisy, bitter and expensive.\n\nThe GOP candidates are likely to win in November because the districts were reshaped to favor Republican candidates under a controversial new congressional map championed by Gov. Ron DeSantis. Currently Republicans hold a 16-11 edge in Florida’s congressional delegation. After adding one seat due to population growth, the new map is projected to give the GOP a 20-8 margin in the next session of Congress.\nThe result was that Republicans vying for the new seats shifted even further to the right.\nIt didn’t work for all candidates. Laura Loomer, a far-right activist who has been kicked off social media platforms for anti-Islamic posts, came close to knocking off longtime GOP incumbent Rep. Dan Webster. But Webster — buoyed by votes in his home county — managed to beat her by a few thousand votes in the race for Florida’s 11th congressional district. Another candidate — Martin Hyde — said FBI agents would have wound up in a “body bag” if they had searched his home like they did Mar-a-Lago. But longtime incumbent Rep. Vern Buchanan soundly thrashed Hyde in the GOP primary for Florida’s 16th congressional district.\nA Roe asterisk for Democrats in Florida\nEverything we know about the overturning of Roe v. Wade is that it will likely be a major motivator for Democrats in the fall.\nWhat abortion does not appear to be — given Nikki Fried’s wipeout in the Florida gubernatorial primary on Tuesday night — is singularly determinative.\nFried, the state agriculture commissioner — once heavily promoted as the future of the Democratic Party in the state — had spent much of the primary campaign casting her opponent, Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.), as at best untrustworthy on the issue. Crist, a former Republican governor of the state before morphing into an independent and, eventually, a Democrat, said during his U.S. Senate run in 2010 that he would advocate for “pro-life legislative efforts.”\n \n\nEven days before this year’s primary, when asked if he was “pro-life,” Crist responded, “I’m for life, aren’t you?” before adding, “I’ve been pro-choice in every single decision I’ve made that affects a women’s right to choose.“\nSo, what’s more important to Democrats than Roe?\nElectability, it seems.\n“I think the litmus test question in this race is who is the candidate who can best defeat DeSantis, which is a strategic question that I think most Democratic voters are applying,” said Fernand Amandi, a veteran Democratic pollster and consultant in Florida.\nCrist is widely considered an extreme longshot in the general election against DeSantis, even among Democrats.\nBut paradoxically, while Crist needed to survive the politics of abortion to win on Tuesday, it’s that same thing that he will need to be competitive at all in November.\nIf not for Roe, Amandi said, “I’m not certain that the Democrat would have a chance.”",

        "description": "With Democrats increasingly airing their doubts about Joe Biden’s presidency, one allied Democratic National Committee member decided it was time to try and plug the chatter.\nWilliam Owen of Tennessee recently drafted a resolution to put his fellow committee members on record as being supportive of the sitting president. The DNC has approved similar measures for past presidents. But the motivation this time was different. Owen said he wanted to blunt the pessimism surrounding Biden that was emanating from within the party’s own ranks.\n“I keep reading all of these articles about Democrats saying they don’t want him to run,” Owen said, adding that the resolution he’s proposing to take up next month will “put all the DNC folks on record saying they are supporting him.”\nThat a DNC member felt the need to get his colleagues on record about their party’s leader speaks to the political predicament Biden finds himself in. Less than 100 days before the midterm elections, the president’s job approval rating has fallen below 40 percent, and polls suggest majorities of Democrats would prefer a different nominee in 2024. Even now, coming off his best week in recent memory — with the recalcitrant Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) agreeing to a major climate, tax and health care bill and Biden announcing the killing of al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri in a drone strike — the president can’t seem to escape the intraparty skepticism.\n\nOver the weekend and in subsequent interviews this week, Manchin declined to endorse Biden’s reelection. Rep. Dean Phillips (D-Minn.), said publicly that he doesn’t want Biden to run again, and on Tuesday, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) said she doesn’t “believe” he will.\n“Any [midterm election candidate] who’s polling is getting a poll back right now showing the president is more of a drag than Obama was in the midterms,” said Danielle Cendejas, a Democratic strategist whose firm did campaign mail for both of Barack Obama's presidential campaigns. “That, I think, leads to a pile on of Democrats who are frustrated about their prospects.”\nFor Biden, who is still testing positive for Covid-19, she said, “In this environment, he’s just in such a tough spot. The poor guy can’t even get sympathy for being sick.”\nInside the White House, aides fear comments like those from Phillips and Maloney could embolden other elected leaders to join suit. Already, they have watched as Democratic leaders spent weeks dodging questions about whether they want Biden to run.\nTo push back on the emerging narrative, they’ve deliberately sought out supportive voices — and highlighted the remarks of others, including Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Govs. Gavin Newsom of California and J.B. Pritzker of Illinois, who have lent their encouragement to a Biden 2024 bid.\nWhite House spokesperson Chris Meagher said Biden “is focused on delivering results for working families, building the economy from the bottom up and middle out – getting Americans back to work, making our communities safer, and cutting costs for families.” Aides note the string of recent accomplishments they’ve scored and the testimony from other Democrats that this first term could shape up to be historically productive.\nIn the statement, Meagher added that “MAGA Congressional Republicans are advancing an extreme agenda: putting Social Security and Medicare on the chopping block, proposing a national ban on abortion, and oppose common sense proposals to raise the age to purchase an assault weapon.”\nBut privately, Biden aides and advisers also are increasingly resigned to the fact that his standing won’t meaningfully rebound before November, even with the slate of recent good news and the possibility of a major prescription drug and climate bill being passed before the election.\n“The numbers are the numbers,” said one Biden confidant, who went on to immediately argue that the president’s standing going into the midterms would improve ahead of 2024.\nPart of what has fed despair in the party is the inability of the White House to turn around its numbers. Even as the price of gas has fallen dramatically and the Manchin agreement was announced, Biden’s job approval rating barely changed, ticking up two points from the previous week to 39 percent in Wednesday’s POLITICO/Morning Consult poll.\n \n\nOne adviser to major Democratic donors conceded that outside of Washington, “nobody gives a shit” about the Manchin legislative breakthrough. “[The Biden administration] doesn’t understand that the only thing people care about is inflation, gas prices and the economy writ large.”\n“Of course there’s no messaging, and of course they don’t have any idea what the message is,” the adviser added. “They’re living in La La Land.”\nAnother senior Democratic strategist, who spoke on condition of anonymity to protect client relationships, said they had conducted extensive interviews with swing-state voters ahead of the midterms. The conclusion from those surveyed was that Biden’s persistently weak standing had to do with voters’ fatigue, on everything from the lingering pandemic to the spate of mass shootings, which injected a higher degree of fear into peoples’ lives.\n“Americans are looking for someone that will make them feel something — anything — again,” the strategist said.\nBut to other Democrats, Biden is a victim of a national media ecosystem trying to prove its toughness covering a Democratic presidency after four years of Donald Trump — and the White House’s inability to adapt to that reality.\n“I don't think that [Biden’s] handled that as well as you would like,” said Matt Angle, a longtime Democratic consultant from Texas. “If four things good happen in one day and one bad thing happens, the story is gonna be about the one bad thing and that may just be a product of the times that we're in. The negative polls create stories about negative polls, and then it all kind of builds on itself.”\nA president’s public approval rating is historically closely tied to his party’s performance in the midterms, and there is almost no reason to think Biden’s numbers will improve before November. Presidents at this point in the midterm election calendar have traditionally not mustered a late bounce.\nStill, the generic congressional ballot — perhaps a better indicator of midterm performance — has been looking better for Democrats in recent weeks. And the party on Tuesday celebrated a rare victory in Kansas, where voters in a heavily Republican state overwhelmingly rejected an anti-abortion state constitutional amendment. The result suggested the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade could improve the party’s prospects in some swing states and suburban House districts.\nThere’s also an emergent, albeit minority, view among Democrats that candidates in the 2022 cycle can successfully decouple from Biden and his diminished standing with voters — and that they could do it, primarily, by running against Trump and Trumpism.\n“It was always difficult for Republicans to win when they embraced MAGA. Once that decision was made, this election became not a typical midterm,” said Simon Rosenberg, a Democratic strategist who is loudly challenging the conventional wisdom that the GOP will score big in the midterms. “People continue to argue that this is a typical election and they are wrong. They were wrong all along.”\nBut even if Democrats stave off the most disastrous outcome in November — losing the Senate — it won’t be because of Biden.\nLike some other Democrats, Owen suggested that if the Manchin climate and prescription drug deal passes, the unemployment rate remains low and gas drops below $4 a gallon — all credible possibilities — Democrats may escape the midterms suffering less damage than has widely been expected. His proposed resolution, which could be amended before the DNC takes it up, does not mention 2024, but asks DNC members to express “our full and complete support” for Biden and his administration. Democrats, he said, could even hold onto their majority in the House.\n\nBut Democrats have found reasons for optimism before and been disappointed. Last year, it was an infrastructure package and a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief bill many in the party believed could turn things around, only for those wins to be eclipsed by other matters, including the pandemic and inflation.\n“Everyone is looking at this reconciliation bill, and it’s something,” said Aaron Chappell, political director of the Sen. Bernie Sanders-aligned group, Our Revolution. “But it’s late, and it’s little … Should it pass? Yes. Is it enough to deal with widespread frustrations with the president, especially with the progressive base? We’ll have to see.”\nThe president’s unpopularity does complicate the degree to which he’s personally involved in the midterms beyond raising money. And while a midterm drumming for Democrats would damage Biden’s standing further, previous presidents have recovered from such scenarios. Biden — if he runs again — would almost certainly be re-nominated.\n“If Joe Biden is compared with the unspoken or unidentified ideal, then sure it's easy to rag on him and find somebody else better,” Angle said. “But the truth of the matter is that if Joe Biden runs for re-election, he's going to be seen straight up against Donald Trump, or Ron DeSantis or somebody who's very polarizing. They’ll have a lot of negatives, and Biden will start to look really good against them.”\nEven Biden’s internal party skeptics concede as much. One Democratic strategist critical of Biden noted that the last time a sitting Democratic president was seriously challenged was when Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) took on Jimmy Carter, “and Carter still came out on top.”\nHe added: “The other half of the equation is, ‘Who’s our Ted Kennedy?’ I don’t see a Ted Kennedy standing around.”",

        "description": "Democrats can see glimmers of new midterm life, after the stunning defeat of an anti-abortion measure in Kansas. Eric Greitens is the big loser in Missouri — which means the Republican Party as a whole won. And in Michigan, Rep. Peter Meijer has conceded in a primary fueled by his vote to impeach former President Donald Trump.\nVotes are still being counted in some of the most important races. But as the multi-state primary made its return on Tuesday after a summer hiatus, the shape of the general election landscape fell more clearly into view.\nHere are five takeaways from the first primary night of August:\nThe Roe earthquake is real\nIt would have been a victory for Democrats and abortion rights activists if they’d even kept it close in Kansas.\nInstead, as the heavily Republican state rejected an anti-abortion constitutional amendment, it marked a political earthquake with the potential to reshape the entire midterm campaign.\nIn the first test of abortion politics since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, turnout soared in Kansas despite a heat advisory and little else to draw Democrats to the polls. Yet in a state where Trump beat President Joe Biden by nearly 15 percentage points in 2020, the amendment was failing badly — in a brushback to Republican legislators who were preparing to move legislation restricting abortion.\n \n\nAnd if the politics of Roe proved fraught for Republicans in Kansas, it’s going to be even more treacherous for the GOP in swing-ier, more moderate swaths of the country.\n“I think it should indicate both in Kansas and nationally that people can be energized around the notion that the Republicans are determined to have government mandates about women’s healthcare decisions, and that is something that doesn’t sit well with lots of people,” said former Kansas Gov. Kathleen Sebelius, who served as Health and Human Services secretary in the Obama administration.\n\nThe Roe decision, she said, “has lit people on fire.”\nIn a bleak midterm election landscape for Democrats, Roe almost certainly won’t be enough to keep Republicans from winning the House. And the result in Kansas isn’t a perfect indicator of how voters will treat abortion in candidate races. The question voters were deciding there was a state constitutional amendment that would have cleared a path for the state legislature to ban abortion, not a candidate race where multiple issues and personalities are at play.\nStill, the outcome in Kansas was the first real evidence supporting a near-universal consensus among Democratic and Republican political operatives alike: That Roe will likely help Democrats at the margins in November, energizing base Democrats and improving the party’s standing with independents and suburban women.\n\n\n\nThe challenge for Democrats now will be to attach their candidates to abortion rights — and to hammer Republicans on the issue in the fall — while Republicans will labor to keep the focus on rising prices and talk about anything other than Roe.\nRepublicans make it easier on themselves\nRepublicans dodged two bullets on Tuesday. In Missouri, Eric Greitens, the disgraced former governor, finished far behind in his Senate primary bid. And in Michigan, Tudor Dixon emerged from a gubernatorial primary full of more hard-line contenders many Republicans feared would be a drag on the party in November.\nThat’s good news for the GOP. And it’s a departure from where the party appeared to be heading in many of its early primaries — picking candidates who seem dangerously prone to getting in the way of the good political environment for Republicans.\nIn Pennsylvania, physician Mehmet Oz, the Republican nominee for Senate, has been polling so poorly Republicans are discussing alternative paths to the Senate majority. Republicans all but conceded the gubernatorial race in heavily-Democratic Maryland after nominating Dan Cox, the Trump-endorsed state lawmaker who organized buses to Washington for the rally preceding the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\nIt's possible the early results on Tuesday will turn out to be a blip. In Arizona, Mark Finchem, an election denier running for secretary of state with Trump’s endorsement, was running ahead. And overall in this year’s primaries, said Jason Roe, the former executive director of the state Republican Party in Michigan, “I think in a lot of cases we have nominated our weakest general election candidates, so the primaries have not served us well.”\nBut for the traditionalist wing of the Republican Party, the early indications on Tuesday were mostly positive. An exception: Kari Lake, the Trump-endorsed candidate for governor who still insists, falsely, that Trump won the 2020 election, pulled ahead of Karrin Taylor Robson, the establishment-backed candidate, as vote-counting continued through Wednesday morning.\n \n\nBut in a House district in the state, Ron Watkins, a celebrity in the QAnon conspiracy world, was barely even registering.\nAnd then there were the three House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump. One of them, Meijer, lost in Michigan. But in Washington, Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse were both in position to survive their primaries if early returns hold.\nThe Meijer name wasn't enough to overcome political gravity in West Michigan\nEighteen months ago, days after casting one of his first votes in Congress for the impeachment of Donald Trump, Meijer purchased a flak jacket to protect himself from mortal danger. The political danger, though, has hung over him ever since.\nWest Michigan Republicans unleashed their wrath Tuesday on the first-term congressman and scion of the Midwestern supermarket chain that shares his last name. They never forgave the 34-year-old combat vet for that vote — and it’s particularly notable that someone with that last name, in this place, couldn’t outrun it, even though Meijer’s legislative record has him on track to pass more laws than any House Republican freshman in decades.\nMeijer has now become the second pro-impeachment Republican to lose a primary, falling to Trump-backed John Gibbs, the former Trump administration Housing and Urban Development official and software engineer who moved to the district to challenge the congressman.\nThe former president “still [has] a very, very strong following with very reliable Republican voters,” a source close to the Meijer campaign told POLITICO Tuesday evening. “And I think John Gibbs spent pretty much the entirety of the campaign preaching to the Trump faithful.”\nEarly Wednesday, Meijer had fallen behind Gibbs by more than a thousand votes. After midnight, the Gibbs campaign was already celebrating. “We are toasting,” AnneMarie Schieber, Gibbs’ spokesperson said. “And praising God. The people’s voice is heard.”\n\nMeanwhile, the House Democratic campaign arm’s decision to bankroll Gibbs’ campaign to the tune of $425,000 down the homestretch looked all the more consequential—comparable to what Gibbs raised the entire cycle. The Democrats’ decision meant “they were seeing something that spooked them,” the Meijer source said, “and that was the prospect of Peter Meijer winning and going into a rematch versus [Democratic nominee] Hillary Scholten.”\n“Meijer ran a tactically sound campaign, spent enormous money relative to Gibbs, and it’s hard to gauge the built-in value of the Meijer last name in Michigan,” said Jeff Timmer, the former executive director of the Michigan Republican Party and a senior adviser to the anti-Trump Lincoln Project.\nBut in this case, even the Meijer name wasn’t enough to overcome political gravity of a party that still orbits Trump. “Gibbs had no money and ran a shitty amateurish campaign,” Timmer said. “But he didn’t vote for impeachment and Gibbs will win.”\nElection denialism is still flourishing\nMark Finchem has captured the Republican secretary of state nomination in Arizona. But the notorious election denier is just the tip of the iceberg.\nFinchem, a state lawmaker, built a decisive lead over a splintered field in Arizona for secretary of state. Now, he is joining a growing cohort of diehard Trump loyalists who will be in competitive general elections to be their states’ next chief election officer.\nRepublicans have, in some cases, avoided the most extreme candidate for other statewide battleground offices. But in many swing states, Republican voters have done the opposite in secretary of state contests, rewarding candidates who have done the most to undermine trust in the electoral system.\n\n\n\nTheir elevation to the statewide ticket could hamper other Republican candidates — who would have to answer for a running mate’s election denialism, as many try to dance around the question in front of a general election audience. And their presence would ensure that, instead of moving past the lies about the 2020 election, they would remain center stage well into 2022.\nThat class of conspiracy theorists includes Nevada’s Jim Marchant and Michigan’s Kristina Karamo, alongside Pennsylvania gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano, who would appoint the state’s leading election official if he wins in November.\nJust one of them winning in November could set up an unprecedented — and dangerous — situation in which an election official’s first priority is not running a fair election, but trying to vindicate the fantasies of a former president.\nAnd yet … Trump takes a hit\nFinchem may have won in Arizona and Meijer lost his seat in Michigan. But two other House Republicans who, like Meijer, voted to impeach Trump were in far better shape on Tuesday in early returns.\nIf Reps. Jaime Herrera Beutler and Dan Newhouse of Washington survive their primaries, impeachment backers will go 2-for-3.\nAnd if the results shift and they don’t make it? The fact that the outcome in any race hinging on impeachment is even close is indicative of a gradual weakening of Trump’s hold on the GOP. Impeachment for Trump-ists was not a minor offense, after all, but the gravest sin.\nThe standard — and fair — knock on Trump’s midterm endorsement record is that it’s padded, with the former president going in for any number of Republicans who face nominal or no opposition at all. His farcical endorsement in Tuesday’s Missouri Senate primary of “Eric” — in a race featuring both Eric Greitens and eventual winner Eric Schmitt — underscored the point.\nBut the real evolution in Trump’s endorsement record may be its diminishing significance. Yes, he can still pull a Republican across the finish line, and he may be the most dominant force in the party. But he isn’t the only one anymore.\nJohn Thomas, a Republican strategist who works on House campaigns across the country, said late Tuesday that Republicans “playing for keeps in November” may have started by nominating “some of the more electable candidates tonight.”\nRepublicans, he said, were “willing to buck Trump in certain circumstances to protect their chances of victory in November.”",

        "description": "About three dozen former Democratic House and Senate members have signed on to an open letter blistering national Democrats for their meddling in this year’s Republican primaries, often to the benefit of pro-Donald Trump hard-liners.\nThe letter, shared first with POLITICO, is the latest in growing backlash against the controversial practice, in which Democrats have been elevating far-right Republicans they believe will be easier to defeat in the fall.\n“As former members of Congress and the Cabinet, we oppose any practice that intentionally elevates election deniers,” the letter reads. “And as members of the Democratic Party, we are dismayed by the recent practice of Democratic organizations intervening in Republican primaries to promote candidates who deny the outcome of the last presidential election.”\n \n\nIt goes on: “These destructive primary tactics aim to elevate Republican candidates who Democrats hope they can more easily beat in November. But it is risky and unethical to promote any candidate whose campaign is based on eroding trust in our elections. We must stop this practice, and stop today.”\nThe letter’s signatories include former senators and House members from across the country, including former Sens. Gary Hart of Colorado and Carol Moseley-Braun of Illinois, as well as former House Democratic leader Dick Gephardt. Former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer, a former general chair of the Democratic National Committee, also signed on.\nThe letter, issued through the political reform group Issue One, follows Democratic interventions in Republican primaries in Maryland, Pennsylvania, California and other states. And despite mixed results, those efforts are ongoing. Ahead of the primary on Tuesday in Michigan, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee placed a TV ad buy designed to lift the Trump-endorsed Republican running against Rep. Peter Meijer, a House Republican who voted to impeach Trump.\n \n\nDemocratic proponents of the practice have said it is GOP primary voters, not Democrats, who are expressing Republicans' allegiance at the ballot box to Trump-ism and the far right. And they have defended meddling as smart politics — a way to stack the deck against Republicans in the general election by saddling them with a less electable nominee. \nThe risk is that those Republicans may be more competitive than they seem. In Pennsylvania, where Democrats intervened on behalf of hard-liner Doug Mastriano in that state’s gubernatorial primary, Mastriano appears now to have at least a credible chance of winning.",

Ron DeSantis (R) this fall.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe primaries and special elections in the two states were among the last to take place before the country enters the sprint toward the general election, and they offer some final clues about the political landscape heading into the fall.\n\n\n\nHere are five takeaways out of New York and Florida:\n\n\n\nDemocrats make safe choice to take on DeSantis\n\n\n\nStaring down the potential of four more years of Ron DeSantis in the governor’s mansion, Florida Democrats turned to a familiar face.\n\n\n\nRep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.), himself a former Republican governor of Florida, beat state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried on Tuesday for the Democratic nomination to take on DeSantis in November, setting up his second general election campaign to reclaim his old office in Tallahassee in less than a decade.\n\n\n\nHeading into the primary, Crist appeared to have an edge over Fried. But his victory was still a blow to Florida’s only statewide elected Democrat and someone who had been heralded as the future of the state party.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFrom the outset of her campaign for governor, Fried billed herself as “something new,” casting herself as part of a new generation of Democrats in the state that could bring the fight to DeSantis in November.\n\n\n\nBut Florida Democrats ultimately chose the establishment favorite in Crist, who argued that his “happy warrior” persona and compromise-minded brand of politics made him the best candidate to win over moderates and independents disenchanted with DeSantis’s combative style and culture war rhetoric.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic establishment held its own\n\n\n\nIt was a good night for the Democratic establishment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn New York, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), the chair of Democrats’ House campaign arm, prevailed in his primary over a progressive challenger. Former Rep. Max Rose (D-N.Y.) overcame a challenge from his left, giving him a chance to reclaim his old House seat in November.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd Daniel Goldman, who prosecuted the first impeachment case against former President Donald Trump, beat out his main progressive rival, state Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou.\n\n\n\nA similar case played out in Florida: Crist, who had the support of Democratic establishment heavyweights, beat out Fried in the party’s gubernatorial primary, while Jared Moskowitz, a former state representative and Florida emergency management director, defeated five other Democrats to win the nomination to succeed retiring Rep. Ted Deutch (D-Fla.).\n\n\n\nOverall, Tuesday was a show of force for the party establishment, even amid signs that voters in both parties are irritated with their figureheads.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs Democrats look to ward off a red wave in November, the primary results as a whole might just be a sign that voters aren’t ready to take any chances on less-experienced candidates.\n\n\n\nSpecial elections in New York give Democrats new hope\n\n\n\nRepublican Joe Sempolinski pulled off a win for a vacant Western New York House district on Tuesday, holding a seat for the GOP after former Rep. Tom Reed (R-N.Y.) stepped down earlier this year.\n\n\n\nHis win was, naturally, a disappointment for Democrats. But it’s not all bad news for the party in power. Democrat Max Della Pia came closer than expected to pulling off an upset in the race.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd Democrats scored an even bigger win in the special election to represent New York’s 19th District, where Democrat Pat Ryan defeated Republican Marc Molinaro in a race that was seen as a bellwether of the political environment ahead of November.\n\n\n\nDella Pia’s closer-than-expected loss and Ryan’s narrow win add up to the latest evidence that Democrats may be on the verge of regaining some lost momentum in the runup to the November midterm elections.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe party has so far faced a bruising political outlook this year, but with the Supreme Court’s decision earlier this summer to overturn Roe v. Wade, the seminal abortion rights case, Democrats have seen a burst of energy in recent weeks, raising their hopes of avoiding an electoral rout this fall.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMaloney loss ushers end of political era in Manhattan\n\n\n\nNo matter who won the Democratic primary to represent New York’s Manhattan-based 12th District, the race was destined to end the political career of one Democratic heavyweight. In the end, that turned out to be Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.).\n\n\n\nMaloney lost her primary on Tuesday to Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.). Both currently helm powerful committees in the House – Maloney is the chair of the Oversight and Reform Committee, while Nadler leads the Judiciary Committee – and both have served in Congress since the early 1990s.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere was little animosity between Nadler and Maloney. The two members of Congress are ideologically similar and have a long history of working together. They were only pitted against one another as a result of New York’s redistricting process, which combined the cores of their Manhattan districts earlier this year.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, the results on Tuesday all but assure that Maloney won’t be returning to Washington next year for the first time since 1993. Nadler, meanwhile, is virtually guaranteed another term on Capitol Hill, given the district’s strong Democratic politics.\n\n\n\nParticularly contentious primary season gives way to general election\n\n\n\nThe 2022 primary season isn’t over just yet, with a handful of states still waiting to choose their nominees for November.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the primaries in Florida and New York saw some of the final major showdowns before the general election campaign starts in earnest and marked the beginning of the end of a particularly contentious primary season that saw incumbents fighting incumbents, Democrats battling over the direction of their party and Republicans squabbling over their loyalty to Trump.\n\n\n\nWith the primaries nearly over, the focus will now turn to larger questions: Can Democrats defy history and stave off a midterm thrashing, even with President Biden’s approval ratings plumbing new lows? Can Republicans keep their base energized even without Trump on the ballot?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd most importantly, which party do voters trust the most to control Congress for at least the next two years?",

        "description": "In one of his most sweeping endorsement days, Trump backed 19 candidates in Florida alone, the home of his always-in-the-news Mar-a-Lago resort.\nAlso notable is who he did not endorse in the Sunshine State: Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is gearing up for a potential 2024 run for the presidency that could pit him against Trump, though neither possible candidate has announced official plans yet.\nThis week, Trump's endorsements even extended (sarcastically) to Democrats. Trump made posts on Truth Social jumping into the middle of primaries including New York City Democrats Dan Goldman, the lead counsel against Trump during the first impeachment hearings, and Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.), who was chair of the House oversight committee during Trump's presidency. Both candidates immediately rejected the backing.\n\nLast week, Trump’s preferred candidate in Wyoming, Harriet Hageman, also left easily with an almost 40-point win against Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who earned Trump’s ire for her impeachment vote and leadership on the Jan. 6 committee. Meanwhile, fellow Trump endorsee Sarah Palin is in limbo in Alaska as the state prepares to tabulate votes in its ranked-choice special House election on Aug. 31. \nFlorida wins\nATTORNEY GENERAL\nAshley Moody\n\n\n\nWon unopposed.\nMoody is a former Democrat whose family once sued Trump over a condominium dispute. She has become a major voice in high-profile conservative cases in the state since she took office in 2019. She joined the motion brought by Texas attorney General Ken Paxton and others that sought to overturn 2020 election results in four states, which was later shot down by the Supreme Court.\nShe also served on Trump’s National Law Enforcement Commission as the sole attorney general. In his endorsement, Trump said Moody was “a crusader fighting opioid abuse and human trafficking ever since. Ashley Moody will never let you down.”\nCHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER\nJimmy Patronis\nWon unopposed.\nAG COMMISSIONER\nWilton Simpson\nWon with 65 percent of the vote.\nSENATE\nMarco Rubio\n\n\n\nWon unopposed.\nRubio seemed to be in political trouble last year with elements of the GOP, but that evaporated when Trump endorsed him last April. He has stopped short of criticizing Trump in the years following their presidential bids against each other in 2016. Rubio declined to vote against 2020 election results, in contrast to fellow Florida GOP Sen. Rick Scott — but nevertheless, Trump called him “a tireless advocate for the people of Florida.”\nRubio will face Democratic Rep. Val Demings in November in a highly watched contest.\nFL01\nMatt Gaetz\nWon with 70 percent of the vote. He voted to overturn 2020 election results.\nOne of Trump’s strongest supporters in the House, Gaetz helped stall the first impeachment trial against the former president by disrupting committee hearings. Gaetz has also been under investigation for alleged sex trafficking since last year. He previously asked Trump to give preemptive pardons, a common practice for the former president while he was in office, to himself and other congressional politicians. Trump denied having heard such a request.\nGaetz has worked to “fight the never-ending witch hunts from the radical left that are destroying our country,” Trump wrote in his endorsement.\nFL02\nNeal Dunn\nWon unopposed. He voted to overturn 2020 election results.\nFL03\nKat Cammack\nWon with 85 percent of the vote. She voted to overturn 2020 election results.\nFL05\nJohn Rutherford\nWon with 66 percent of the vote. He voted to overturn 2020 election results.\nFL06\nMichael Waltz\nWon with 77 percent of the vote.\nFL12\nGus Bilirakis\nWon with 80 percent of the vote.\nFl13\nAnna Paulina Luna\nWon with 45 percent of the vote.\n\nFL16\nVern Buchanan\nWon with 86 percent of the vote.\nFL17\nGreg Steube\nWon unopposed. He voted to overturn 2020 election results.\nFL18\nScott Franklin\nWon with 73 percent of the vote. He voted to overturn 2020 election results.\nFL19\nByron Donalds\n\n\n\nWon with 84 percent of the vote. He voted to overturn 2020 election results.\nThe freshman congressman has made waves in the House, meeting with the ex-president in New Jersey soon after saying the Congressional Black Caucus excluded him for his conservative views last June. Donalds also hosted Trump and his wife Melania for a Christmas celebration last December.\n“Congressman Byron Donalds has been a terrific advocate for the people of Florida and our Country,” Trump said in his endorsement.\nFL21\nBrian Mast\nWon with 78 percent of the vote. He voted to overturn 2020 election results.\nFL26\nMario Diaz-Balart\nWon with 84 percent of the vote. He voted to overturn 2020 election results.\nFL28\nCarlos Giménez\nWon with 73 percent of the vote. He voted to overturn 2020 election results.\nDistrict 12 MIAMI-DADE County Commissioner\nJuan Carlos Bermudez\nWon with 66 percent of the vote.\n\nNew York wins\nNY21\nElise Stefanik\n\n\n\nWon unopposed. She voted to overturn 2020 election results.\nThe No. 3 House leader rose quickly, assuming Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney’s position after Cheney fell out of favor with the House GOP for her stance on Trump. Stefanik said she speaks with Trump multiple times a week, who has called her “one of my killers,” and recently headlined a New York rally with him. Trump also once suggested her as a potential 2028 presidential committee, a position she denied pursuing at the moment.\nNY24\nClaudia Tenney\nWon with 54 percent of the vote.\nICYMI: Wyoming wins on Aug. 16\nSECRETARY OF STATE\nChuck Gray\nWon with 50 percent of the vote.\nWyoming State Treasurer\nCurt Meier\nWon with 71 percent of the vote.\nAT-LARGE HOUSE DISTRICT\nHarriet Hageman\n\n\n\nWon with 66 percent of the vote.\nTrump selected Hageman to oppose Cheney after the incumbent voted to impeach him and joined the House committee to investigate the Jan. 6 attacks, becoming a top political target ahead of the midterms. Voters soured on Cheney quickly and gave Hageman a decisive win. After her victory, Trump said, “This is a wonderful result for America, and a complete rebuke of the Unselect Committee of political hacks and thugs… Now she can finally disappear into the depths of political oblivion where, I am sure, she will be much happier than she is right now.”\nICYMI: Alaska wins on Aug. 16\nGovernor\nMike Dunleavy\nAdvanced with 42 percent of the vote.\nSenate\nKelly Tshibaka\nAdvanced with 40 percent of the vote.\nAT-LARGE HOUSE DISTRICT\nSarah Palin\n\n\n\nAdvanced with 32 percent of the vote.",

        "description": "In its largest-ever independent expenditure, a Latino-focused super PAC announced a $500,000 digital and TV ad buy today for Carlina Rivera, a progressive Democratic candidate in the crowded race for New York’s open 10th Congressional District seat.\nNuestro PAC, which is dedicated to mobilizing Latino Democratic voters, released the ads five days before Tuesday’s primary — a 15-second digital ad in Spanish and English, and a 30-second TV spot in English.\nTheir spending is the latest in a pool of support from other Hispanic-centered organizations hoping to boost the New York City Council member, who is among a dozen candidates vying to represent the redrawn district. Rivera has also received endorsements from Democratic Reps. Nydia Velázquez and Adriano Espaillat, as well as Council Speaker Adrienne Adams.\nThe district is one of New York’s most diverse, with an 18 percent Hispanic population. Should she be elected, Rivera would be the fifth Latino in New York’s 26-member House delegation when Congress reconvenes in January.\nOther prominent contenders for the district this cycle include Rep. Mondaire Jones, Manhattan assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou and Trump impeachment attorney Daniel Goldman. Through the expenditure, Nuestro PAC wanted to help increase Rivera’s name recognition in the last week before the Aug. 23 primary, said Chuck Rocha, Democratic strategist and Nuestro PAC senior adviser.\n“There’s very few Latinas in the U.S. Congress. As [for] representation as a whole in America, Latinas are left out of so many conversations,” Rocha told POLITICO. “We just see this as a chance for the next generation of Latina leaders to make it to Congress.”\nWhile the late August primary is expected to have low turnout, the new seat has attracted millions in spending, particularly from Jones and Goldman, who have dropped more than $2 million each. Rivera is the next highest fundraiser, and has spent more than $420,000 this cycle, according to OpenSecrets.\nIn a PIX11/Emerson College poll conducted last week, Rivera was tied for third with 13 percent of the vote, behind Goldman’s 22 percent and Niou’s 17 percent. Jones also polled at 13 percent.",

        "description": "For the first time, abortion has entered the top-five issues concerning Latino voters, according to a new poll from two Latino civil rights organizations which showed Democrats with a 2-to-1 edge in the chase for Latinos’ midterm votes.\nMore than 70 percent of respondents said the procedure should be legal regardless of their personal beliefs, according to the survey from Hispanic civil rights and advocacy group UnidosUS and civic engagement organization Mi Familia Vota.\nA majority of respondents (77 percent) said they would probably vote or certainly vote in the upcoming November elections, and a little over half said they planned to vote for a Democratic House candidate in the midterms, while 22 percent said they would vote for a Republican and 21 percent said they were undecided.\nThe survey comprised 2,750 eligible voters in Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia and Pennsylvania, with an overall margin of error of plus or minus 1.9 percentage points. The poll includes registered and unregistered eligible voters and was conducted at the end of July.\nRespondents' top-ranked issues for elected officials to address were inflation, crime and gun violence, and jobs. More specifically, cost of living, gas prices and low pay were the most concerning to voters.\nImmigration reform and border security, the pandemic and reduced government spending were among the least prioritized issues by respondents.\nMore than half of respondents said they thought the Democratic party was “effective” compared to 45 percent who said the same about the Republican Party. Just over half of the respondents approved of Biden’s job performance, compared to 42 percent disapproval.\nGary Segura, president of BSP Research, said these numbers were not necessarily positive for the GOP or for Democrats.\n“The reason why there might be soft support among Latinos on the Democratic side is quite clear,” Segura said. “There’s been no increase in wage, no action on immigration for the things that Latinos lined up for in 2020. You could say they didn’t get what they bargained for.”\nHealth care ranked fourth in terms of Latinos’ political priorities. After the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, polling has varied on Latino attitudes toward abortion, particularly in communities with large Catholic populations. Though many Latinos do not personally agree with the procedure, a majority of survey respondents still said they support open access to abortion across the states. Less than a quarter of respondents said religious leaders should tell members which candidates and policies to back.\n“Abortion has become far more salient, and I would say that’s just one of the more stunning findings of the poll,” Segura said. “I go back in my polling and I find abortion hovering around the 2 to 3 percent range in terms of importance to the Latino voters. Here, we have 19 percent of our voters who chose it as the first, second or third priority.”\nMore than half of survey respondents said they did not want elected officials to pass regulations on the procedure, while 16 percent said abortion should be illegal in all states. Florida respondents were the least likely to agree with open access, at 70 percent support for abortion, and Nevada respondents were the most likely at 81 percent.\nAdditionally, 80 percent of Latinas said regardless of their personal beliefs, it is wrong to make abortion illegal, compared to 72 percent of Latino men. Along with other women of color, Latinas are often disproportionately affected by health care inaccessibility — while also having higher abortion rates than non-Hispanic white women.\n“Hispanics can be a stabilizing force in American politics… they reject extremes,” said Clarissa Martínez De Castro, vice president of UnidosUS Latino Vote Initiative. “They oppose taking away rights as illustrated by their views on abortion. They want to see progress on challenges facing the country … yet misconceptions and mistaken assumptions about this electorate persist. And these have an impact on anemic or ineffective engagement that we’re consistently seeing with these voters.”",

        "description": "Rep. Liz Cheney’s campaign has raised millions over the last year, making her one of the top House fundraisers this year. But ahead of Tuesday’s primary, Cheney is getting outspent on Wyoming’s airwaves by Harriet Hageman anyway, according to AdImpact.\nHageman has raised less campaign money than Cheney but has outpaced her on TV since at least early July, the ad-tracking service’s data shows. The Donald Trump-endorsed challenger aired three ads this week, two of which went negative on Cheney. One called her “desperate” and controlled by dark money and Democrats, while the other says the incumbent has made “this election all about her. Well, it’s not about her, it’s about you.”\nThe other Hageman ad centers on a case in which she represented a Wyoming landowner against the Environmental Protection Agency.\nSince last week, Cheney has focused her campaign on an ad featuring her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney. Dick Cheney spends 60 seconds calling Trump a “coward” who lost his election in 2020.\n“A real man wouldn’t lie to his supporters,” Dick Cheney said in the ad. “He lost his election, and he lost big. I know it. He knows it, and deep down, I think most Republicans know.”\nThe spot is meant to air on Fox News during “Fox &amp; Friends” and Sean Hannity’s prime-time show, according to Axios. But the ad has also aired outside Wyoming, with $23,911 being spent so far on Washington D.C.-based airings, per AdImpact.\nCurrently, there are only three outside PACs spending on the race: the Protect Freedom PAC launched a video on Wednesday that accused Liz Cheney of being part of the Washington elite and partnering with “Nancy Pelosi and the radical left to demonize Republicans.”Another from Wyoming Values PAC said Liz Cheney had left behind Wyoming’s conservative values “a long time ago” and touted Hageman as the solution. Finally, an ad from Americans Keeping Country First said Hageman put “her ambition before Wyoming” over a Colorado-Wyoming water pipeline issue.\nFour more ads to watch this week\nSenate Majority PAC dropped a new ad on Wednesday in favor of Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman, laying out opponent Mehmet Oz’s many homes and properties compared to himself, who has “one in Braddock, Pennsylvania.” While Oz bought a house in the state eight months ago, says the ad, Fetterman has “Pennsylvania in his blood.”\nThe National Republican Senatorial Committee and Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) released a new coordinated spot featuring men in law enforcement uniforms saying it’s not America that has failed, but Rubio’s presumptive Democratic opponent, Rep. Val Demings. One speaker calls her “just another radical rubber stamp” on policies like defunding the police. The buy has totaled more than $267,000 thus far.\nThe NRSC also dropped big money against Sen. Raphael Warnock last week, spending on an ad saying the incumbent “didn’t see it coming” on issues like “Biden’s reckless spending” and local job creation efforts. “Warnock means well, but it’s not really working,” the narrator says.\nIn Hawaii’s lieutenant governor race, Change Now PAC released an ad against state Rep. Sylvia Luke for taking thousands in “corrupt” money when she was chair of the House Finance Committee, funds she said she was returning to the state Campaign Spending Commission. “If Sylvia Luke is judged by the company she keeps, she shouldn’t be lieutenant governor,” the ad ends.\nTOP CANDIDATE SPENDING (8/3/22-8/10/22, per AdImpact):&nbsp;\n— Kelly for AZ Senate: $2,212,016\n— Warnock for GA Senate: $1,653,527\n— Shapiro for PA Governor: $1,369,281\n— Demings for FL Senate: $1,359,994\n— Ryan for OH Senate: $966,913\nTOP COMMITTEES/OUTSIDE GROUPS/SUPER PAC SPENDING (8/3/22-8/10/22, per AdImpact):\n— Yes on 27 (CA Prop 27 Mobile Sports Betting and Revenue, CA Housing Issue): $6,250,237\n— Californians for Tribal Sovereignty and Safe Gaming (CA Prop 27 Mobile Sports Betting and Revenue, CA Gambling Issue): $3,863,338\n— One Nation (GA Senate, NH Senate, NV Senate, AZ Senate, OH Senate, WI Senate): $3,453,984\n— Senate Majority PAC (NV Senate, WI Senate, AZ Senate, NC Senate, PA Senate, GA Senate): $3,026,622\n— Club for Growth Action (WI Governor, FL CD-13, IL Governor): $2,265,245",

        "description": "The search of Donald Trump's Florida compound by federal agents Monday has the former president's base rallying to stand with him — including many of his potential rivals for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination.\nFlorida Gov. Ron DeSantis jumped out Monday night, tweeting that the FBI search was “another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the regime’s political opponents.” And he has been quickly joined by others who could be competing against Trump in a primary next year.\nGovernors like South Dakota’s Kristi Noem and Virginia’s Glenn Youngkin called the FBI’s actions “unprecedented” and “stunning.” Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas said the search was “next-level Nixonian … to target a former president and political rival.” Florida Sen. Rick Scott said the Biden administration had a “history of going after parents &amp; other political opponents.”\n \n\nThe criticism of the FBI and the Biden administration's handling of the situation wasn't unanimous: Former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie told SiriusXM's Julie Mason in an interview that the search of Trump's safe and other areas in Mar-a-Lago was \"fair game\" if the \"factual underpinnings\" that led to the FBI’s search checked out. And Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.) told CBS This Morning that Americans need to let the situation “play out” and see what happens, though he also said it will raise questions about political motivation for the FBI's action.\nScott, who is running for re-election and is frequently cited as a potential 2024 contender or Trump vice president pick, drew criticism over his comments. In private, Trump allies fumed over his more measured approach, and on Twitter, Trump fans said it could have taken him out of the running to be Trump's vice president.\nBut for the most part, the reaction among potential Republican presidential candidates was to defend Trump. That included former Vice President Mike Pence, who has broken with Trump in several ways this year amid fallout from the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection, before which Trump pressured Pence not to certify the 2020 election results.\nPence tweeted that the search “undermined public confidence” in the justice system and called on Attorney General Garland to explain why it was conducted.\n“After years where FBI agents were found to be acting on political motivation during our administration, the appearance of continued partisanship by the Justice Department must be addressed,” Pence wrote.\n \n\nAs news of the FBI search continued to spread, GOP activists, consultants and donors also lined up behind Trump. Several said the support for Trump they’ve heard from conservative voters was almost unanimous and could clear the field for the former president.\n“I had gotten calls from people last night that were getting kind of tired of Trump, not so much they wanted to move on from him, but more that they were sick of the drama. Well, that’s over,” said Shiree Verdone, co-chair of both of Trump’s Arizona campaigns. “Just talking to people now, they are irate, and they are ready to support Trump. Even some people who were not full Trumpers, but are so upset with what happened [FBI search]. It seems this is really going to elevate Trump.”\nJames Blair, a Republican operative, said the FBI move will both galvanize the former president’s base while adding more supporters, who view the search as government overreach.\n“American's will view this as an aggressive escalation of Democrats' move toward silencing political opponents,” he said. “Trump's voters will mobilize, and he will earn new ones because sensible people in the middle will think this is a bridge too far.”\nDon Tapia, Trump’s former ambassador to Jamaica and major GOP donor, embraced the former president after the FBI search, saying he flew the American flag outside his house upside down in a show of protest.\n“What happened at Mar-a-Lago to a former president is unfounded,” he said in an interview. “I am not proud of this government today. This had to be approved by the attorney general and the DOJ at the highest levels. This is distressing to me as an American, not as a Republican, Democrat, or Trump donor.”\nSeveral other prominent Republicans compared the situation to how other countries’ leaders have handled political opposition. Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.) released a series of tweets and videos comparing the move to what would happen in “third world Marxist dictatorships.” Rubio’s comments particularly resonate with Florida’s Hispanic voters — many who fled communist regimes in Cuba or Venezuela.\n“We’ve never been a country where people who take power, like becoming president, now use that power to persecute their past or future political opponent,” Rubio said in a video filmed outside at night. “We’ve never seen that — until tonight.”\nSen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) called for Garland's impeachment in a tweet thread of his own.\nScott, though, had a more measured response when asked about the situation on CBS Tuesday morning.\n“It has to be something of incredible magnitude for, at least, my side of the aisle to say that was warranted,” Scott said. “Without that, we’re going to find ourselves in a very big mess as it relates to the credibility of the FBI. As opposed to rushing to judgment, the most important thing we can do is let it play out.”\nIn his interview, Christie referenced his seven-year stint as U.S. attorney for New Jersey, when he said he had to make “analogous decisions” to the Monday search of Mar-a-Lago. The search warrant aims to determine whether the former president mishandled White House records, according to two people familiar with the matter.\nWhen he issued similar warrants, Christie explained, he needed to be confident there would be enough evidence to charge the person being investigated. If nothing was found, the search would be “unjust,” he said.\nIn a lengthy statement Monday, Trump likened the search to Watergate, saying the FBI “even broke into my safe.” Such behavior during the execution of a search warrant isn’t an uncommon practice, Christie said.\n“It’s fair game,” the former governor said. “It’s not anything that's out of bounds to go into a safe, and it happens frequently in federal law enforcement. But again, you have to have the factual underpinnings to be able to convince a federal judge that you need and have the right to do that.”\nIt’ll be important for the search warrant affidavit, which contains the reasoning behind the FBI search, to be made public in the near future, Christie said.\n“I hope that more information comes sooner rather than later, because the longer you let this sit out there, the more speculation will generate. And that's not good for anybody,” he said. “Extraordinary situations require extraordinary actions, and if you're going to take an action like this, you can't just treat it like any other case in terms of your public disclosure.”\nMeridith McGraw contributed to this report.",

        "description": "A new poll from Asian and Pacific Islander American Vote gives more insight into voting behavior, party identification and key issues among registered Asian American voters — a diverse demographic that has seen heightened levels of political engagement and representation over the past several elections.\nA majority of respondents said they planned to vote in the November general election, with 33 percent calling themselves “more enthusiastic” about voting in this cycle compared to previous ones. In terms of party identification, 44 percent of respondents said they were Democrats, while another 35 percent said they were independent, another party or didn’t think in terms of party affiliation. 19 percent said they identified as Republicans.\nIncluding independent respondents, 56 percent leaned towards Democrats compared to 26 percent who leaned Republican.\nRegardless of affiliation, most of the respondents said they had never been contacted by either party, including 52 percent who had never heard from the Democratic Party and 60 percent who said the same about the GOP.\nChristine Chen, executive director of APIA Vote, said when the organization had launched a comprehensive field program with translated mailers, phone banking and door-knocking campaigns, many individuals said this was the first time someone had reached out to them about politics.\n“[The parties] are leaving out people who are actually interested in voting, but they are not really getting the information and being engaged,” Chen said. “If we focus on that base of new voters and those who are in need of a little more language assistance as well, we can be able to motivate them to turn out in larger numbers.”\nAPIA Vote is a nonpartisan organization dedicated to increasing civic engagement, and has partnered with several other groups, including AAPI Data, to conduct and release a biannual Asian American voter survey since 2012.\nThe June 2022 survey consisted of 1,601 voters, split between Chinese, Filipino, Indian, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese Americans, with an overall margin of error of plus or minus 2.5%. Data was also disaggregated based on gender, age, country of birth, region and party identification.\nIssues like health care and the economy ranked as “extremely important” for Asian American voters, along with education, crime and gun control. Other topics like foreign policy in Asia and the growing wealth gap were not as high-priority.\nKarthick Ramakrishnan, founder of AAPI Data, said Asian Americans have been left out of lobbying on other important matters like environmental justice or gun control, despite supporting policies like stricter gun laws.\n“Asian Americans are not single issue voters — they’re not just civil rights voters, they’re not just immigration voters,” Ramakrishnan said.\nAnd there are sharp political differences within the larger group of Asian American respondents, according to the survey. Breaking the data down by ethnicity and party identification, Indian American voters showed the deepest loyalty to the Democratic Party, with 70 percent, with Japanese Americans not far behind at 65 percent.\nAnother standout group was Vietnamese Americans, who were more likely to identify as Republicans and vote for a Republican candidate than the larger Asian American pool.\nUp to 40 percent of Vietnamese respondents said they would vote for a Republican House or Senate candidate, compared to around 27 percent of all Asian American respondents. The group also had a much higher favorable rating of former President Donald Trump than other ethnicities, with 49 percent saying they had a “very favorable” or “somewhat favorable” opinion of Trump.\nOne explanation could be religious affiliation, Ramakrishnan said: The Vietnamese American community is more Catholic — and less progressive on issues like reproductive rights — compared to Chinese Americans, who are less religious overall.\nIn terms of gender, both parties have increased attention on Latino, Asian and Black men, who have supported Republican candidates in small but increasing margins over the past few cycles — though the majority still vote for Democrats. The APIA Vote survey showed up to a 9-point gap between men and women who would vote for a Republican candidate, though Ramakrishnan said that divide is smaller compared to other racial demographics.\nThough the survey did not include a question about reproductive access, past surveys have shown that Asian Americans are some of the strongest supporters of abortion rights, said Janelle Wong, co-director of AAPI Data.\n“Asian Americans are actually very distinctively progressive when it comes to supporting access to abortion,” Wong said. “Even the most conservative Asian American groups tend to be fairly progressive on this issue. So I don’t think this is an inroad for Republicans.”",

        "description": "The United States has asked Mexico to review whether workers at a Piedras Negras, Coahuila, auto parts factory are being denied free association and collective bargaining rights, the U.S. Trade Representative's office announced today. This is the fifth such case brought by the U.S. using the so-called rapid response mechanism in the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA).\nThat provision allows North American nations to challenge the trade and labor practices of their neighbors, potentially imposing trade restrictions if violations are found.\nThe request comes in response a petition for review from two Mexican labor organizations.\nThe U.S. asked Mexico in June&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-227a-d60a-a1fe-66faeae40000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">U.S. asked Mexico in June to review whether similar rights were being denied at a Teskid Hierro facility, also in Coahuila. The two countries additionally announced a resolution of another RRM issue in a Panasonic facility in Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-227c-d411-a5a6-a27d0cbb0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Reynosa, Tamaulipas, Mexico last month. \n“Our continued use of the Rapid Response Labor Mechanism underscores the Biden-Harris Administration’s serious commitment to advancing the rights of workers,” Trade Representative Katherine Tai said in a release. “Workers deserve the right to freely organize for the union of their choice. We look forward to working with the Government of Mexico to promptly address this issue, as we have done in prior instances.”\nNext steps: After Tai’s request&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/Manufacturas%20VU%20USMCA%20RRM%20Request%20for%20Review.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d01c-d881-a5ff-f11f13410003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d01c-d881-a5ff-f11f13410004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Tai’s request, Mexico has 10 days to agree to conduct a review on whether the facility workers have been denied free association and collective bargaining rights, and another 45 days from Thursday to complete it.",

        "description": "Welcome to your daily campaigns deep dive, where we explore the inner workings of the midterm races, fundraising, staffing and advertising.\nWhile Democrats have dominated the airwaves on abortion issues nationally, a more evenly matched ad campaign is brewing in Kansas, ahead of an August ballot measure vote about whether the state constitution includes the right to abortion.\nIn 2019, the Kansas state Supreme Court decision that protected the right to “bodily autonomy,” which included abortion access, and prohibited Kansas lawmakers from passing laws that restricted that right. The state still has a limit on abortions past 22 weeks.\nLast January, state Republicans voted to put an abortion amendment, known as “Value Them Both,” on the primary ballot that would either give the state Legislature power to restrict or outlaw the procedure — a “yes” vote — or to maintain the current law — a “no” vote. However, the amendment would not automatically ban abortion if passed.\nConfused? So are many voters. That hasn’t stopped them from signing up to vote in droves as advocacy groups pump millions into broadcast ads taking a number of different approaches to the issue ahead of the Aug. 2 vote.\nReproductive rights organization Kansans for Constitutional Freedom has spent big — nearly $900,000 in the last month alone, per AdImpact — to urge voters to vote “no” on the amendment. Multiple ads from the group call the ballot measure “confusing” and say it “goes too far,” while others include women sharing stories about their opposing views on the procedure but common support for broader abortion access.\n“They call it a constitutional amendment. The truth? It’s a strict government mandate designed to interfere with private medical decisions,” the narrator says in one ad from last month. “Say no to more government control, vote no on changing the constitution.”\nOrganizations that want voters to say “yes” have also put out ads with extreme exaggerations about what current Kansas law allows. One ad from the Christian group Kansas Family Voice claims “Joe Biden and liberal justices” want to mandate abortion with no restrictions, and says voting “yes” on the amendment allows representatives to end “painful late-term abortion,” which was already restricted by Kansas state law. The ad started airing Wednesday.\nAnother “yes” vote advocate, Value Them Both, has released several spots over the past month calling the 2019 state Supreme Court decision “radical” and claiming Kansas is an “abortion haven” or “destination.” One video compares Kansas to California, saying their state “now allows painful, dismemberment abortions,” referring to dilation and evacuation procedures that Republican state legislators attempted to ban in 2015. The group has spent more than $690,000 on advertising in the past month, per AdImpact.\nFIVE MORE ADS TO WATCH THIS WEEK\nA new spot for Florida Senate candidate Val Demings addresses Republican Sen. Marco Rubio directly, criticizing his Senate attendance records in comparison to her “27 year” track record as Orlando police chief. “When Florida needs you, you just don’t show up,” she says. “It’s simple — you don’t show up for work, you lose your job.” Florida’s primary is Aug. 23.\nPennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman released an ad last week against Republican candidate Mehmet Oz. While Fetterman got involved in politics to improve his town, Oz is “all about North Jersey,” he says in the spot. “He says he’ll fight for working people. OK?” Fetterman says sarcastically, words juxtaposed over Oz and his Hollywood sidewalk star. “Hey, Doc Hollywood, save your money. Pennsylvania is not for sale.”\nA One Georgia PAC ad features a former deputy sheriff “Dennis” who says the permitless carry law Gov. Brian Kemp signed in April “makes it easier for criminals” to carry firearms in public spaces. “Brian Kemp may talk tough, but he makes us less safe, because the last place we want more criminals with guns is here.” The PAC backed Republican gubernatorial David Perdue earlier this year.\nCrypto PAC Web3Forward released two new ads this week in favor of House candidates Glenn Ivey of Maryland and Patrick Branco of Hawaii. Ivey’s ad plays up his connections to former President Barack Obama and want for gun control, while Branco’s video highlighted his work in the state House on issues like health care access and affordable housing.\nTOP CANDIDATE SPENDING (7/6/22-7/13/22, per AdImpact):&nbsp;\n\n Shapiro for PA Governor: $1,396,633\n Demings for FL Senate: $1,322,298\n Warnock for GA Senate: $1,207,990\n Pritzker for IL Governor: $1,150,843\n Robson for AZ Governor: $1,145,017\n\nTOP COMMITTEES/OUTSIDE GROUPS/SUPER PAC SPENDING (7/6/22-7/13/22, per AdImpact):\n\n Yes on 27 (CA Gaming Issue): $4,142,706\n Computer and Communications Industry Association PAC (Internet Regulation Issue): $3,863,338\n One Nation (GA Senate, NH Senate, NV Senate, WI Senate, AZ Senate): $3,352,248\n United Democracy Project (MD-04, MI-13, MI-11): $2,957,319\n Coalition for Safe Responsible Gaming (CA Gaming Issue): $2,341,861",

        "description": "Democratic candidates in races across the country are rushing out ads on abortion in the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision striking down Roe v. Wade. Many of the spots emphasize electing liberal senators to enshrine abortion protections — and prevent the chamber from flipping come November.\nThe Senate most recently blocked a bill to codify abortion rights in May, voting along party lines, save for Sen. Joe Machin (D-W.Va.) Now, a new slate of ads focus on Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) and other GOP lawmakers, warning against Republicans taking over the majority next year.\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) put out a spot on Tuesday, saying while the Supreme Court had overturned Roe, McConnell could help pass a national ban as majority leader. “That would erase Connecticut’s law, which protects a woman’s right to choose. He’s only one seat away from control, and Connecticut could be the deciding vote.”\nIn a Wednesday ad, Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vt.) said McConnell had “hijacked” the Supreme Court process by packing the slate with anti-abortion judges. “If Republicans take the Senate again, McConnell will make things even worse.” Washington Sen. Patty Murray’s ad from Saturday warned against McConnell’s “handpicked candidate,” Tiffany Smiley, who would work with him to “ban abortions nationwide.”\nOther ads blamed candidates like Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Nevada Republican Adam Laxalt, reminding voters the contenders are anti-abortion. After Roe v. Wade was overturned, Johnson sided with the Supreme Court and told Wisconsin voters, “If you don’t like the [abortion laws] in your state… you can move,” said a spot from Planned Parenthood Action Fund released Tuesday.\nPro-abortion rights group EMILY’s List Action aired two nearly identical videos in the Boston market for incumbent Sen. Maggie Hassan, one before and one after the Supreme Court decision. The ads say Hassan is working on federal law to protect a woman’s right to make “personal decisions. This is about our freedoms, and in the live free or die state, we mean it.”\nIn comparison, Republican candidates and groups have barely touched the issue in new ads following Friday’s decision. The spots with the most money behind them, and some of the only ones airing this week, came from Value Them Both, a Kansas-based group working on an upcoming ballot measure about whether Kansans will have the right to an abortion in the state constitution. The group’s most recent ad buy started June 23, calling the state “an abortion destination because of a radical court decision,” and asking voters to “restore common-sense abortion limits” by voting for the amendment.\nFOUR MORE ADS TO WATCH THIS WEEK\nIn an ad titled “Saddle Up,” South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem rides a horse across the state’s plains as she recounted her father’s motto: “We don’t complain about things — we fix them.” She says the state has the “best economy in the nation” and has moved past dark days. “Here, freedom runs free. So saddle up, we’re just getting started,” Noem narrates as she rides into the horizon.\nAs tensions over housing prices increase in Hawaii and other states, gubernatorial candidate Lt. Gov. Josh Green promised to make investments in affordable housing so working families can keep living in the state. “Hawaii is our home and we should be able to afford to stay here,” a woman says while playing with her child.\n“Some launches are more complicated than others,” an ad for Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker starts as footage of a space rocket plays. Airing only in downstate markets, the video promotes the governor’s efforts to create manufacturing training academies in southern areas of the state. “It’s not rocket science — J.B. is working for Illinois,” a narrator says.\nArizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs released an ad revealing some of the death threats she received from people who denied the legitimacy of the 2020 presidential election. The gubernatorial candidate said she drew the line when people “came after my family, our state, our freedom.” Hobbs added the state needs leaders who can defend reproductive health care, lower costs and fix local schools.\nTOP CANDIDATE SPENDING (6/22/22-6/29/22, per AdImpact):&nbsp;\n\n Pritzker for IL Governor: $1,841,539\n Demings for FL Senate: $1,613,984\n Warnock for GA Senate: $1,435,363\n Delgado for NY Lt.

        "description": "As cryptocurrency companies and figures step up their involvement in American politics, one new group — American Dream Federal Action PAC — has started playing an outsized role in Republican primaries.\nFTX Digital Markets co-CEO Ryan Salame launched the PAC in April with a $4 million initial investment, focusing mainly on issues related to cryptocurrency, national and economic security. Salame chipped in another $8 million in May, and the super PAC has spent more than $7.3 million for nine Republican congressional candidates, according to FEC filings.\nAlongside FTX’s Sam Bankman-Fried — who has funded the Protect Our Future super PAC that’s spent big in Democratic primaries — Salame has also financed the more-general GMI PAC, a fund that in turn sends money to Democratic-candidate backer Web3 Forward PAC.\nIncreased political expenditures from investors like Salame come as cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin trended downwards this spring, and some individual investors worried about the future of the currency system.\nThis month, ADFA has aired more than 30 ads, according to AdImpact — primarily aimed at Republican races in Alabama and Illinois, plus some digital advertisements for South Dakota Rep. Dusty Johnson.\nADFA has often boosted more establishment-oriented or “governing”-minded candidates against more hard-right primary foes, but the group’s advertising doesn’t stick out as moderate. Leading up to Senate candidate Katie Britt and House candidate Dale Strong’s races this week, ADFA spent more than $362,000 on three videos ragging on the “radical left,” who could turn the “American dream into a socialist nightmare.” Strong and Britt both won in their respective runoff elections on Tuesday.\nThe PAC also plastered the airwaves for the member-versus-member Illinois race between GOP Reps. Rodney Davis and Mary Miller in the 15th District. ADFA has spent more than $2.3 million on the race, according to FEC filings, with many concentrated in the past two weeks. The spots mainly concentrate on veterans, law enforcement support and Davis’ anti-abortion stance. The ads also promote Davis as a truer conservative compared to Miller — who has former President Donald Trump’s endorsement.\nIn other recent crypto spending, the Crypto Freedom PAC placed almost $671,000 in cable and broadcast flights in the Arizona senate race on Wednesday. On Tuesday, Crypto Innovation got involved in Oklahoma Senate candidate Markwayne Mullin’s race, centering Trump’s endorsement and issues like inflation.\nFOUR MORE ADS TO WATCH THIS WEEK:\nAhead of the Arizona Republican Senate primary, the pro-Blake Masters super PAC Saving Arizona put out an ad against candidate Jim Lamon on Wednesday, calling him “China’s candidate for Senate.” The video features stereotypical music and gong noises in the background. In red and gold script, boxes try to connect the candidate to “slave labor” at nuclear power plants before labeling him “Jim Lamon for U.S. Senate (R-China)” at the end of the video.\nSomos PAC released an ad against the GOP nominee for Senate in Nevada, Adam Laxalt, saying he opposed the Affordable Care Act, the “single most important type of insurance we have in the Latino community.” He also put pharmaceutical profits over health care, the narrator adds.\nA Wednesday spot for Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.) juxtaposes her against construction workers who say the senator “stood up to her own party” when Washington Democrats tried to impose a new mining tax. “Catherine Cortez Masto wasn't afraid to pick up some dirt either,” an unnamed worker says. “Catherine puts Nevada first, and that's what we need in a senator.”\nGeorgia Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://cd.politicopro.com/member/369737&quot;,&quot;personId&quot;:&quot;369737&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000181-8dbe-df92-a1e7-edff66cc0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;353fe80b-e1b5-3663-85ca-add066ecafc0&quot;}\">Raphael Warnock speaks to viewers about his father in a video from Friday. He stresses his desire to work across the aisle and with other members of his party while hammering the elder Warnock’s message of: “If somebody hires you to do a job, do the job they hired you to do.” He released another ad on Friday called “Walker vs. The Truth,” claiming his opponent lied about having 800 employees at his business when he really has eight.\nTOP CANDIDATE SPENDING (6/17/22-6/22/22, per AdImpact):&nbsp;\n\n Pritzker for IL Governor: $1,367,025\n Delgado for NY Lt.

        "description": "As Republicans seek to make further inroads with Latino voters in the midterms, a left-leaning nonprofit group is out with a new poll showing Latinos are worried about mass shootings and abortion access — two key issues for Democrats this year.\nThe poll conducted for Voto Latino, which surveyed Latino voters across seven battleground states, found 86 percent of respondents said mass shootings are “either a crisis or major issue” in the United States. Seventy-one percent said such events worried them “a lot” or “some.”\nResults come on the heels of the May school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, a predominantly Hispanic city. In addition, most respondents supported gun safety laws including background checks, safety training and requiring safe home storage. A smaller majority supported policies like prohibiting concealed carry or banning sales of assault weapons or high-capacity magazines.\nSix in 10 of respondents said their own state’s gun laws were not restrictive enough, and they identified limited mental health resources, gun laws and culture as factors that contributed to mass shootings in their home state.\nThe poll was run for Voto Latino from June 2-7 by Change Research, contacting 1,033 registered voters in seven states: Texas, Arizona, Nevada, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina and Pennsylvania. The margin of error was plus or minus 3.1 percentage points.\nOn abortion, the survey found 68 percent of Latinos believed abortion should be legal in all or most cases, while 10 percent said abortion should be illegal in all cases. A majority of Latinos surveyed said they were paying attention to the Supreme Court draft opinion that indicated Roe v. Wade could be overturned, and 64 percent said they were more motivated to vote in the general election because of the incoming decision.\nAbortion has played a key factor in a number of recent races, including the Democratic primary campaign for Texas’ majority-Latino 28th District, where immigration attorney Jessica Cisneros narrowly lost to incumbent Rep. Henry Cuellar. One of the sole anti-abortion Democrats in Congress, Cuellar has said he believes his views on abortion match those of his constituents. However, no recent district-specific polling shows how residents of the area feel on issues like reproductive rights.\nDuring her campaign, Cisneros countered by saying opinions among Latinos have been changing in the district. The Voto Latino poll found women and voters under 35 more strongly support abortion rights.",

        "description": "Young Saoirse comes from a line of strong women forced to fight for their land in this luminous story of prejudice and patriarchyDonal Ryan’s latest novel is a book of opposing forces. It begins with an ending – the abrupt loss of a character we have only just met – yet concludes with a hope for the people he left behind. Between those events lies a coming-of-age story that explores the challenges of growing up in a tight rural community in 1980s Ireland, and the broader landscape of prejudice, misogyny and family conflict.Ryan won the Guardian first book award in 2013 for The Spinning Heart, set in rural Ireland after the collapse of the Celtic Tiger. His seventh novel follows the lives of four generations of the Aylwards, a family of strong Irish women whose men have either died or absconded. They gather around the kitchen table to smoke and talk and drink tea, and in the process help us understand our own lives just that little bit better. Nana is at the head of this table: a woman who has buried two of her sons, yet whose wry observations provide much of the humour. Opposite Nana is her widowed daughter-in-law Eileen, and loitering in the doorway is our narrator, Eileen’s young daughter Saoirse (a name Eileen worries over: “if she ever goes to America the Yanks won’t have a clue how to pronounce it”), eavesdropping on a life she has yet to understand.

        "description": "This live blog is now closed. You can read our latest story on the leadership contest here:Liz Truss refuses to commit to appointing ethics adviserThe cross-party Commons Treasury committee has expressed concerns about reports that Liz Truss, the frontrunner in the Tory leadership contest, may hold an emergency budget in September without asking the Office for Budget Responsibility to update its fiscal and economic forecast.The OBR usually publishes a new forecast alongside a budget, and it provides an independent assessment of what impact the budget measures will have. The system was put in place by George Osborne to discourage the Treasury from making dubious claims about what its tax and spending announcements might be able to achieve.OBR forecasts provide transparency and reassurance to the markets on the health of the nation’s finances. As a committee, we expect the Treasury to be supporting and enabling the OBR to publish an independent forecast at the time of any significant fiscal event, especially where, unlike other recent fiscal interventions, this might include significant permanent tax cuts.Whether such an event is actually called a budget or not is immaterial. The reassurance of independent forecasting is vital in these economically turbulent times. To bring in significant tax cuts without a forecast would be ill advised. It is effectively ‘flying blind’.

        "description": "A €75-million superyacht seized from sanctioned Russian steel billionaire Dmitry Pumpyansky attracted 63 bids at a closed auction in Gibraltar, the territory&#8217;s Office of the Admiralty Marshal said Tuesday.\n\n\n\nThe future owner of the 72-meter Axioma will be able to enjoy its glass elevator spanning four decks, a 3D cinema, an open-air gym, a jacuzzi and an infinity pool, among many other amenities. A guest review in the SuperYacht Times describes the ship as a &#8220;luxury beach house&#8221; featuring &#8220;a beautiful double-deck main salon.&#8221;\n\n\n\nThis is the first public sale of a seized asset since Russia invaded Ukraine six months ago. However, the proceeds are unlikely to go to Kyiv, but rather to investment bank JPMorgan. Court documents reported on by Reuters show the bank lent €20.5 million to Pyrene Investments Ltd, a British Virgin Islands-listed firm owned by a holding company that is itself owned by Pumpyansky. Sanctions against the oligarch forced Pyrene to default on the loan. \n\n\n\n&#8220;Any surplus after JPMorgan’s mortgage has been paid off and the cost of arrest will go into an account at the Supreme Court of Gibraltar, and frozen until the sanctions are sorted,&#8221; Nigel Hollyer, who is supervising the auction for Gibraltar&#8217;s Admiralty Marshal, told SuperYacht Times. \n\n\n\nThe Admiralty Marshal in Gibraltar has yet to pick the yacht&#8217;s new owner, whose name won&#8217;t be disclosed. \n\n\n\nPumpyansky was the owner of OAO TMK, a steel pipe manufacturer for the oil and gas industry. He resigned last March, as he was added to the EU&#8217;s list of sanctioned Russian oligarchs.",

        "link": "https://www.caughtbytheriver.net/2022/08/lamont-dozier-obituary/",
        "description": "Bill Brewster marks the passing of the late songwriter, instrumental in the success of the Tamla-Motown label, who died earlier this month aged 81.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLamont Dozier’s dizzyingly diverse catalogue showed a man whose fingertips were there or thereabouts at the birth of everything from soul music through to disco, boogie and jazz-funk. His partnership with brothers Eddie and Brian Holland (the much feted Holland-Dozier-Holland) is as iconic as any in the Brill Building, scoring 28 Top Twenty hits between 1963 and 1966, for acts like Diana Ross &amp; The Supremes, The Four Tops, Jr. Walker &amp; The All-Stars, The Isley Brothers and Martha Reeves &amp; The Vandellas. Driven by Motown CEO Berry Gordy’s insatiable drive and factory conveyor-belt methods, the trio were instrumental in guiding the organisation to greatness — and world domination — before a fall-out in 1967 led to their premature departure from the company who’d single-handedly redefined the sound of (young) Black America. \n\n\n\nLamont Herbert Dozier was born in Detroit on June 16th, 1941, wrote his first song aged 10 (the snappily-titled ‘A Song’) and was active in the bubbling Motor City music scene by the age of 14 with local heroes The Romeos, alongside fellow singer Ty Hunter (who would later sing in both Glass House and The Originals, both produced by Dozier). He had a brief spell living in New York as a young man, but returned and recorded a few sides for Anna Gordy’s Anna label, before it was subsumed into Berry’s Tamla-Motown organisation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlthough Dozier’s singing career stalled, he was partnered up with the Brian Holland and his brother Eddie, the former having delivered Motown’s first US #1 with ‘Please Mr Postman’ for the Marvelettes. Their first song together was Marvelettes’ ‘Lockin’ Up My Heart’, featuring singer Gladys Horton, an early sounding board for HDH. When Horton turned down another song, ‘Where Did Our Love Go’, they handed it to the Supremes, giving them the first of five successive #1s written and produced by the same team:&nbsp; ‘Baby Love’, ‘Come See About Me’, ‘Stop! In The Name Of Love’ and ‘Back In My Arms Again’.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHolland-Dozier-Holland displayed a feverish work routine, competing with other on-staff production teams, sometimes writing two or three songs in a day. “If we didn&#8217;t complete them at least we would start them,” Dozier told Paolo Hewitt in 1984. “We would have parts of the songs, like hooks, or maybe parts of verse, so that at the end of the day we would have something accomplished.” And they were not averse to unorthodox practices, if the results provided hits. Paranoia, jealousy and loneliness were frequent themes in the early songs of HDH, with Dozier later confessing he’d deliberately sabotage real life relationships to lay the creative groundwork: “I used to break up with girls just to feel miserable enough to write a sad song about them.”That’s not all. Holland-Dozier-Holland all but invented northern soul in 1965 with the Four Tops’ ‘I Can’t Help Myself’, with its its doubled-up snare hits, breakneck pace and lyrics imbued with the sugar-rush of yearning. While most self-respecting northern DJs would never have played the all-too-common Motown label in the early 1970s, they unearthed a forgotten HDH gem, R. Dean Taylor’s ‘There’s A Ghost In My House’, when DJ Ian Levine rediscovered it in 1973. It was a Top Three hit in the UK in 1974, seven years after its original release. (They would also later be responsible for another later period northern smash, Eloise Laws’ ‘Love Factory’.)\n\n\n\nIn 1967, unhappy with royalty payments HDH demanded an audit of their royalties. Motown countersued to the tune of $4m. The team had effectively gone on strike, setting up their own labels, Invictus and Hot Wax, in secret. MOTOWN ENGINE MISFIRES, reported the Detroit Free Press. They were mired in the dispute for the next few years, eventually releasing the huge hit ‘Band Of Gold’ (with a pseudonymous writing credit of Edythe Wayne) for Freda Payne, backed by the Motown Funk Brothers. At one stage the team had Payne at #1, with new group led by General Johnson, Chairman Of The Board, at #3 in the UK pop chart.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“When they left it devastated us&#8221;, confessed Four Tops’ Lawrence Payton. “Without them we couldn’t get a hit record. Besides, we weren’t getting much action anymore as an act.” The Tops left for ABC/Dunhill where they eventually scored their first crossover song in five years with ‘Keeper Of The Castle’.In  1973, Dozier decided to leave the Invictus camp and strike out on his own. He signed to a solo deal with ABC that also included duties as an in-house producer. The deal handed him a debut solo hit with ‘Fish Ain’t Bitin’’, an unusually political song for Dozier,  pleading with disgraced President Nixon to go: “Tricky Dick is tryna be slick; and the short end of the stick; is all I&#8217;m gonna get it; Tricky Dick, please quit.” His debut, Out Here On My Own, also contained early disco smash, ‘Take Off Your Make Up’, as well as the title track. While he only recorded one further solo set for ABC, he produced albums for Aretha Franklin (with whom he’d gone to elementary school), Dionne Warwick and Ben E. King and underrated LPs for The Originals, Margie Joseph and Popcorn Wylie (California Sunset, Heard The Words Feel The Feeling and Extrasensory Perception). Dozier didn’t speak to the Holland brothers for the next ten years. \n\n\n\nSigning for Warner Bros., his most successful album was 1977’s Peddlin’ Music On The Side, in which he enlisted a phalanx of African players and singers, with old friend Hugh Masekela helping the Detroit veteran recruit from his home continent. The African influence was at its most obvious on the album’s big hit ‘Going Back To My Roots’, Dozier’s first big Europe-wide hit (Odyssey also had a Euro chart smash with the song in 1981).Dozier persevered with his solo career despite reservations about live performing. In fact, it wasn’t until the late 1970s, when he was already five solo albums deep that he decided to go on tour — the first live performances since the days of the Romeos in the late 1950s. “All those years I thought Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye had it going for them so easily,” he confessed to Robin Katz. “I always thought it was the songwriters who did the creative work. But I&#8217;ve learned you can also destroy your popularity with a bad stage act. Recording and performing go hand in hand. Performing requires a lot of preparation. You need to be visual. I tend to feel awkward standing on a stage.”Dozier continued recording right through to 2018, though his last album of original material was the 1991 Atlantic Germany release, Inside Seduction, which was co-produced by Phil Collins, with whom he’d struck up a friendship during the making of 1988 movie Buster. During a long and storied career, the only Grammy Lamont Dozier won was for ‘Two Hearts’, a Motown pastiche he co-wrote with Phil Collins for the Collins-led movie. In fact, from 1958 to 1983, only three Black acts won the Grammy award for Song Of The Year. Dozier died peacefully at his home in Scottsdale, AZ on August 8th, 2022. The celestial choir up there got itself one of the all-time greats.\n\n\n\nLamont Dozier, June 16, 1941 – August 8, 2022\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nBill Brewster has compiled a playlist in tribute to Lamont Dozier, which you can listen to here.",

Top of the league, it’s amazing what a lovely new kit or two, some sublime Ian Wright #content on the socials, and the arrivals of Gabriel Jesus, Oleksandr Zinchenko, Fabio Vieira (who is nearing full fitness) and William Saliba (who has reportedly signed a new long-term contract after his return from his loan spells) can do for the brand.Pedro Neto is the latest to be linked to the Emirates, and a fine buy he would be too, giving Arsenal some natural width to go with all their silky, jinking cut-inside-and-finishers. The Wolves winger would not come cheap though, with the Portuguese flyer signing a new five-year contract in March. Bids will start from £50m, apparently, and much depends on the potential departure of Nicolas Pépé to Nice. Continue reading...",

Could it be that we don’t have a clear idea about what health is or what healthcare is for? David Haslam looks beyond debates about funding and health systems to examine this seemingly insatiable need. In doing so, he offers examples from his work as a GP, his leadership roles at the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice), and his personal experience of cancer treatment.There are now more than 6.6 million people on NHS waiting lists in England, fewer than two-thirds of patients receive prompt cancer treatment and most waiting-time targets have not been met for several years. The Commons health and social care committee has reported that the NHS is missing 12,000 hospital doctors and 50,000 nurses and midwives, predicting that 1 million more jobs will be required to meet demand for health and social care over the next decade. The acute crisis undoubtedly results from more than a decade of austerity, exacerbated by the pandemic. But this is not just a local problem. A World Health Organization (WHO) report found health spending growing faster than the economy in almost every country. Continue reading...",

Cruz is most famous for her working relationship with Pedro Almodóvar; often she’s described as his muse – demeaningly, I think. Well, with this playful satire of the movie industry, Argentinian film-making duo Mariano Cohn and Gastón Duprat give her all the power in the role of a borderline tyrannical auteur with a bonkers streak (think Marina Abramović or maybe even Björk).

Plus: recession stalks Europe.Get the magazine delivered to your homeThe troop buildups, the belligerent speeches, the excruciatingly staged Kremlin policy meetings … for months, the signs had been there in plain sight. Nonetheless, the order in the early hours of 24 February from Vladimir Putin to invade Ukraine came as a lightning bolt, one that would change Europe for years to come.Six months on, the swift victory Putin seems to have expected from his “special military operation” is a distant memory, the war mired in seemingly intractable deadlock.

        "description": "NEW YORK — By former cop and Democratic Mayor Eric Adams’ account, New York is teeming with career criminals who are reoffending in record numbers, after nation-leading reforms eliminated cash bail for most crimes in the state.\nBut Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul and legislative leaders say few defendants freed pending trial go on to reoffend, while scores more are spared the city’s festering jails — thanks to the new laws heralded by progressives and accepted by some moderates.\nThe dispute has become irreconcilable, a near-daily point of disagreement between two powerful Democrats. And it’s largely driven by one thing: The sides are relying on fundamentally different data.\nTheir discord is part of a larger battle over how to balance equity amid rising crime nationwide, an issue that has divided the party and set back the reform movement launched by the death of George Floyd. And New York’s bail laws were thrust into the fore by a recent incident involving Rep. Lee Zeldin, the Republican nominee for governor, who was publicly attacked by a man who was swiftly released from custody.\nAmerica now looks to New York as the proving ground for criminal justice reforms — and sees a moderate Democrat at war with his own party.\n“Our criminal justice system is insane. It is dangerous. It’s harmful. And it’s destroying the fabric of our city,” Adams said this month as he continued to push Hochul and lawmakers to rescind their two-year-old reforms. “As a result of this insane, broken system, our recidivism rates have skyrocketed.”\n\n\n\nNew York passed the sweeping bail reform law in 2019, prohibiting cash bail for all but the most serious misdemeanors and felonies. State judges cannot hold defendants based on their perceived dangerousness, and are only required to use the least restrictive means of ensuring defendants return to court. The reforms quickly ignited a firestorm, and state lawmakers rolled back portions of the law in 2020 just months after enactment, and again this year.\nBut they’ve rejected Adams’ demands for a special session in Albany to pass even stricter pretrial detention. The mayor, who has been scrambling to combat a stubborn spike in crime after running on the issue last year, also wants more teens charged as adults in serious crimes, rolling back a 2017 law.\n“We never said that the cause of crime in the state is because of bail reform,” Hochul, whose reelection Adams has endorsed, said at a gun-safety announcement the day after Adams called for a special session. “That is too simplistic. That is a political slogan.”\n‘I don’t know why we hire lawyers’\nAdams, whose moderate stances and law-and-order agenda often endear him to state Republicans, is relying on surgically sliced NYPD crime stats to demonstrate a rise in rearrests to support his calls for stricter bail laws and more judicial discretion.\nHochul and the Democratic leaders in the Assembly and Senate are meanwhile using the state court system’s figures, which they say paint a much different picture.\nEarlier this month, the mayor unveiled data showing that rearrests for certain crimes have risen in the last five years.\nRelying on NYPD figures, Adams said the share of people arrested for burglary who went on to be arrested for another felony within 60 days rose from 7.7 percent in 2017 to 25.1 percent in 2022. The mayor said that works out to 393 rearrested this year, though the math actually puts it at 373.\nFelony rearrests for defendants accused of grand larceny similarly rose for that period, from 6.5 percent to 16.8 percent — or 310 rearrests this year. The rearrest rate for accused car thieves increased from 10 percent to 20.3 percent, to 125 this year. For petit larceny — crimes like shoplifting — it rose from 8.1 percent to 21.2 percent compared to five years ago. The mayor did not provide baseline figures for petit larceny.\nBefore bail reform laws took effect in 2020, judges had discretion to set bail for those crimes. Now, they cannot — except for first-degree grand larceny.\nAdams also released a list of the city’s top 10 reoffenders. He wouldn’t name the recidivists, but the New York Post named one in an exclusive story published not two hours before Adams’ press conference.\n“I don’t know why we hire lawyers,” Adams said later that day, when asked why he wouldn’t publicly identify members of the rogues gallery himself.\n\n\n\nThe mayor’s accounting may be striking, but he is relying on anecdotes and “cherry picking data,” according to state Sen. Michael Gianaris (D-Queens), a sponsor of the original bail reforms.\nAnd since the bail laws took effect in 2020, it’s harder to argue the correlation is also causation, especially because Adams’ numbers don’t indicate how many people rearrested in 2017 were even assigned bail.\nSome could have been let go under a judge’s discretion or assigned a bail amount that they paid before allegedly reoffending, according to Gianaris.\n\"The data is pretty clear and unambiguous that the rates of reoffense by people who are out pending charges ... has not changed,” Gianaris said in an interview. \"They're taking statistics about the broader crime increase, which nobody disputes, and laying it at the feet of bail reform. And they make no logical connection between the two.\"\nDueling Data\nCrime has risen nationwide since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, which coincided with bail reform taking effect in New York, even in cities that did not change their bail laws.\nThe city would not provide a fuller dataset in time for publication and said it chose 2017 because that was one of the safest years in city history at a time when the worst policing abuses, such as widespread stop-and-frisk, had been reined in.\nCritics say Adam’s NYPD data is unreliable, however, because it only reflects arrests, not charges pursued in court. Most arrests are ultimately dismissed, and police tend to “inflate” arrest rates and charges, contends Amanda Jack, an attorney with the Legal Aid Society.\nAccording to figures published by the New York State Unified Court System, people released without bail reoffend at similar rates to those who are assigned bail and pay it, suggesting bail is not a deterrent.\nOn average, the rate is a little under 20 percent over the last two years, the data shows. Since 2020, an average of 9.6 percent of people arraigned for a crime statewide were rearrested and arraigned on a misdemeanor. Seven percent went on to be charged with a subsequent nonviolent felony, and 2.8 percent were rearrested and arraigned on a violent felony, according to state court figures.\nIn New York City, the stats were similar: On average over the last two years, 19.2 percent were arrested again — 8 percent for a misdemeanor, 7.8 percent for a non-violent felony and 3.4 percent for a violent felony.\nRearrests are also dropping — 23 percent of defendants arrested statewide in 2020 were rearrested on another charge. Last year, that figure dropped to 19.5 percent.\nThe state only began tracking repeat arrest data when bail reform took effect, making it impossible to make comparisons with the time before the overhaul.\nIn a bid to rectify the discord between Adams’ figures and the state’s, Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, also a moderate Democrat, invited the mayor to compare notes.\n“To this point, I still haven’t received anything from Mayor Adams in terms of data,” Heastie said last week.\nHeastie has also pointed to surging crime across the country, even in jurisdictions that did not enact major criminal justice reforms.\n“Crime is up all over the country even higher than here in the state of New York. We are getting through the nationwide pandemic that has an effect on things,” he said. “People don't want to talk about all these things. All they want to talk about is bail reform, bail reform. Because I believe that some people want to use it for political purposes. And I believe that it's an easy thing to blame.”\nAdams did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the criticism.\nBetter judgment\nThe two rollbacks to bail reform have granted judges more discretion. Now Hochul and others say they need to use it.\nUnder the reforms, judges may set bail for a felony or more serious misdemeanor that causes identifiable harm to a person or property if the crime was allegedly committed while the defendant was out on pretrial release for the same class of infraction.\nThis year, lawmakers added theft to that provision, making repeat shoplifters eligible for bail. However, the rule doesn’t apply if the theft is considered “negligible.” The provision applies only to alleged offenders with pending cases, not those with past criminal records.\nUnder tweaks to the state bail law that passed this year, judges should also consider whether a defendant is accused of doing serious harm to someone and whether they have a history with illegal guns.\n\nHochul has floated continuing education for judges so they’re aware of all their options.\nOn Friday, she ordered the arrest of a Bronx man who was released without bail after allegedly sucker-punching a man who ended up in a coma.\nPolice charged the man, a sex offender, with attempted murder, but the Bronx District Attorney’s office chose to instead pursue a misdemeanor assault and harassment charge, and the man was released without bail.\nThe court failed to hold him on a parole violation, the governor said, as she ordered his capture.\n“This is a person on lifetime parole, and as of minutes ago, that person is now in custody. That is at my direction,” she said.",

        "description": "Citizen hackers crippling government infrastructure. Government-backed trolls targeting enemy diplomats on social media. A country&#8217;s leader pushing his agenda to a global audience.\n\n\n\nRussia&#8217;s updated playbook against Ukraine? Think again. It’s how Kyiv has taken on Moscow in cyberspace.\n\n\n\nIn the six months since Moscow invaded its Western neighbor in February, Kyiv has borrowed heavily from online tactics first pioneered by the Kremlin to attack its opponents, promote itself on the global stage and fight back against its larger opponent in the increasingly entrenched war in Eastern Europe.\n\n\n\nAs Ukraine celebrates its independence day on August 24, POLITICO analyzed how the country&#8217;s digital tactics have often mimicked those of Russia — and at times left Moscow flat-footed and outflanked by the Ukrainian government&#8217;s media savvy and bottom-up strategy for how to weaponize the internet and technology.\n\n\n\nHere are the four things you need to know about Ukraine&#8217;s digital tactics:\n\n\n\n1. Controlling the narrative\n\n\n\nFew people globally knew much about Volodymyr&nbsp;Zelenskyy before Russia&#8217;s invasion. But the comedian-turned-Ukrainian president has galvanized his massive social media presence — his Telegram channel, alone, has more than 1 million followers — to undermine Russia&#8217;s state-backed propaganda machine. \n\n\n\nIn often heart-felt pleas, taken on his own smartphone in underground bunkers or on the frontline, the 44-year-old has brought the war into the hands of people worldwide and made it personal for people with little, if any, direct connection to Ukraine.\n\n\n\nThat pitch — part propaganda, part awareness campaign — has been taken up more broadly too. Government ministers, the country&#8217;s agencies and even average soldiers have peppered social media with footage of the war, including alleged war crimes against Ukrainian civilians by Russian soldiers.\n\n\n\nIt has proved a successful counterweight to Moscow&#8217;s top-down propaganda machine that relies heavily on glitzy state media to accuse Zelenskyy of being a Nazi and Ukrainians of similarly carrying out atrocities against Russian-speaking civilians in the east of the country. \n\n\n\nWhile those pro-Moscow messages are still gaining traction in Latin America and Africa, Zelenskyy&#8217;s digital public affairs campaign has proven highly successful in framing Western allies&#8217; view of the Russian invasion.\n\n\n\n2. Splitting the internet\n\n\n\nRussia has long had aspirations of isolating the country&#8217;s digital ecosystem from the wider world. Ever since its tanks rolled into Ukraine, the Kyiv government decided to lend it a hand. \n\n\n\nMykhailo Fedorov, Ukraine&#8217;s digital minister and Zelenskyy&#8217;s right hand on tech, has led the charge of what he calls a &#8220;digital blockade,&#8221; successfully badgering reams of Western tech companies to pull out of Russia in the past months. \n\n\n\nEveryone from Apple to Netflix took steps to stop offering goods and services in Russia, often following the young Ukrainian tech entrepreneur-turned-minister&#8216;s urging on social media.\n\n\n\nMykhailo Fedorov is Ukraine&#8217;s digital minister and Zelenskyy&#8217;s right hand on tech. He led the &#8220;digital blockade&#8221; on Russia: badgering reams of Western tech companies to pull out of the country |  Fabrice Coffrini/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\nThe campaign hasn&#8217;t been 100 percent successful. When Fedorov pleaded with Meta to stop Russian access to both Facebook and Instagram, the tech giant declined. The company cited the need for Russians to access independent information about the war. (Moscow then went on to ban both services under the country&#8217;s &#8220;extremism law.&#8221;) Fedorov&#8217;s pleas to shut down internet services in Russia was also met with skepticism from civil rights groups calling to keep lines open to support Russia&#8217;s domestic opposition to the war. \n\n\n\nStill, the speed with which the Ukrainian minister has managed to trigger strategic shifts at tech firms to curtail services for political reasons is remarkable — and in many cases breaking with long-held policy positions in the tech sector.\n\n\n\n3. Hackers of the world, unite\n\n\n\nDays into the war, Fedorov — again — did something unprecedented: he called for volunteers, both in and outside of the country, to create an &#8220;IT Army&#8221; of hackers to target Russia with predominantly unsophisticated cyber attacks in response to the invasion. \n\n\n\nFast-forward six months and the hundreds of thousands of would-be hacktivists have taken down scores of Russian websites, attacked the country&#8217;s state media and leaked reams of sensitive data onto the internet — much to the embarrassment of the Kremlin.\n\n\n\nIn this cyber battle, Russia&#8217;s own digital troops still far outgun Ukraine&#8217;s volunteer squad. Kremlin-linked groups have repeatedly attacked its Western neighbor with malware and hacking campaigns, and, most recently, tried to bring down the country&#8217;s electricity network in April. Hackers with ties to Belarus, a close Moscow ally, also successfully targeted Ukrainian government websites earlier in the year, according to Ukrainian officials. \n\n\n\nBy crowdsourcing its hacking efforts to Ukraine&#8217;s droves of IT engineers and outside supporters, Kyiv is borrowing from Russia&#8217;s years-long strategy to unleash rogue cybersecurity specialists if it plays to its geopolitical favor.\n\n\n\n4. Data: the enemy of my enemy is my friend\n\n\n\nIn many Western countries, Palantir and Clearview AI — tech companies that develop big data and artificial intelligence applications for the military and law enforcement sectors — have earned reputations for flying close to the legal edge and prompted calls to ban their privacy-intrusive tools. \n\n\n\nUkraine, however, has embraced both controversial firms in its battle with Russia as it uses all weapons at its disposal. \n\n\n\nAuthorities have used Clearview AI&#8217;s facial recognition technology to identify Russian soldiers killed in combat so that Kyiv can inform their families directly in a bid to undermine Russian morale. Critics warn that such practices may lead to misidentifying people and represent potential privacy violations.\n\n\n\nIn June, Zelenskyy also met with Alex Karp, Palantir&#8217;s chief executive, in Kyiv during which the military contractor announced plans to up a local office as part of its efforts to support Ukraine&#8217;s war effort. &#8220;Modern warfare has changed the rules, and technology plays a big role in it,&#8221; Fedorov, the country&#8217;s digital minister, said after the meeting. &#8220;Cooperation with Palantir is of great importance for us, as it will help us strengthen our army and defeat the enemy as soon as possible.&#8221;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of&nbsp;POLITICO Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one-stop-shop solution for policy professionals fusing the depth of POLITICO journalism with the power of technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive, breaking scoops and insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomized policy intelligence platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-level public affairs network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY GO PRO\n\n\n\nLOG IN",

The seminal home computer, launched 40 years ago this month, featured an 8-bit microprocessor, a huge 64k of memory and a set of graphics and sound chips that were designed by the engineers at Commodore’s MOS Technology subsidiary to power state-of-the-art arcade games. That didn’t happen. Instead, Commodore president Jack Tramiel ordered the team to build a home computer designed to smash the Atari XL and Apple II. So that’s what they did.I didn’t know any of this when my dad brought home a C64 one afternoon a year after the launch of the machine. Ours came with a Dixons cassette featuring a number of little demo programs and a copy of Crazy Kong, a version of Nintendo’s Donkey Kong, written entirely in Basic, and fairly mediocre. I played it to death anyway. That Christmas, I asked for some actual good games, which would include the legendary multi-stage shooter, Beach Head, the inventive platformer, Lode Runner and the footie game International Soccer, one of the few titles to come on a cartridge rather than a cassette tape.

        "link": "https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/08/24/making-the-greatget-together-great-for-everyone",
        "description": "Joshua Straub has cerebral palsy and is a full time wheelchair user. He has been to the Minnesota State Fair a few times, but says he feels like the fairgrounds have aged and not always kept up with ADA regulations. Some spaces are more difficult than others to access for wheelchair users. The coliseum has narrow entrances, the grounds are crowded, the curb ramps are small and often easy to miss. Several years ago Straub tipped his wheelchair and broke his finger. While he says there are many positives, they tend to be outweighed by a few high impact barriers.“As I have gotten older the State Fair has began to become a bit more trouble than it’s worth,” he said. In recent years after hearing stories similar to Straub’s, the State Fair has taken the wide issue of accessibility and brought it to the forefront of their planning. They offer an extensive accessibility guide including ASL interpreting services and sensory-friendly visits.Christine Noonan, marketing and guest supervisor at the fair, says it’s important that the fair sees the issue of accessibility beyond visible physical disabilities.“We have a very broad view of accessibility. When you’re going to something like the Great Minnesota Get-together, you need to try to make it a great experience for everybody,” she said.The accessibility committee at the fair is wide, encompassing everything from transportation, ticketing, entertainment, food and rides. That’s purposeful, Noonan says, to make sure that accessibility touches every department. Every six weeks they meet and talk about challenges and resources. Noonan says it is a process rather than an end goal, but they’re excited about the possibilities.“We are 100 percent willing to try and make any accommodation. Everything is on the table, we are open for feedback and criticism, that’s important to us and the way that we move forward,” she said.  Last year, the Fraser Sensory Building made its debut. Located on the west side of Cosgrove Street, south of the home improvement building, the building has sensory support volunteers, tool and techniques such as weighted blankets, shoulder wraps, calming music and fidget toys. While Fraser is marketed toward helping autistic Minnesotans, senior therapist Gina Brady says anyone needing a break or who may be anxious is welcome.“There are so many sounds, lights and smells — sometimes it’s helpful if people have a place to go and just kind of remove themselves from all of that stimulation for a little bit,” Brady said.The building is often used during the parade each day or right after fair-goers enter the gates and may need a break before they start their day. They also sell sensory kits for $45 that include fidgets, noise reducing headphones and other sensory tools that Brady said can help modify the environment once they leave the building.“We want people to be able to experience more of the fair and have as many tools and strategies as they need.”Jillian Nelson, community resource and policy advocate with the Autism Society of Minnesota (AuSM), says the fight for sensory-friendly space at the fair and other large gatherings in Minnesota has been a work in progress.AuSM has worked with different festivals and groups throughout the state to model what sensory support can look like at large events. Nelson, who is autistic herself, said she really hopes to create an expectation that all community events can follow to have options of accessibility. Nelson said the Fraser building is a great resource, but like Noonan, says the conversation must be ongoing.“Accessibility is not a one and done deal, it is about growing and developing to create the most inclusive space,” Nelson said. “To be a full accessible society, there needs to be a space for people with disabilities to belong in all spaces, especially those community and culture spaces because those are the things that make life vibrant and beautiful and proud to be Minnesotans.”The fair offers a sensory section of their accessibility guide with tips and tricks when visiting. Below are points included in their guide. Click here for the Fraser Minnesota State Fair social narrative.When to visitCome early in the day. Arriving by 8 a.m. will enable you to enjoy much of the fairgrounds before it gets crowded and the noise gets louder. Many people come as early as 7 a.m. when we open, walk through the barns and livestock area to see the animals, eat breakfast and stroll the grounds. The Pet Pavilions and Kemps Little Farm Hands areas open at 8 a.m.; the other buildings and exhibits open at 9 a.m. and are rarely crowded right when they open. The rides and games at Kidway open at 9 a.m., and Mighty Midway opens at 10 a.m., and are not usually busy in the morning. Lines for activities and food are often shorter earlier in the day.It’s also recommended to visit on Monday, Tuesday or Wednesday. Attendance on these days (especially Wednesday) is much less than on the weekends. Lines for activities and food tend to be shorter on these days.Things to doThe Fraser Sensory Building is an oasis specially created for fair guests of all ages with sensory-processing challenges who may find the sights, sounds, smells and crowds of the fair overwhelming. See above for more information about the building and the services and resources offered. The Fraser Sensory Building is open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily (8 p.m. on Labor Day) and is located on the west side of Cosgrove Street just south of the Home Improvement Building.Two interactive outdoor exhibit areas in Family Fair at Baldwin Park — Alphabet Forest and Math On-A-Stick — are geared toward children and provide fun, hands-on activities in a relaxing, shaded environment; these areas tend to be less crowded and less hectic. Guests can come and go, do some or all the activities, and stay as long or as short as they’d like. These two areas are right across the street from the 4-H Building.On the outdoor Family Fair Stage at Baldwin Park, we have a variety of entertainment designed for the whole family — jugglers, music and dance, magic and more. The seating area is less crowded than other parts of the fair, and there’s easy in-and-out access in case guests come late or want to leave early.The Thank A Farmer Magic Show is an engaging, educational program that weaves together magic tricks and fun facts about agriculture, farmers and where our food comes from. The seating area is usually less crowded, so there’s room to move around. This program is presented three times a day at the Christensen Farms Stage outdoors in front of the CHS Miracle of Birth Center. (The 1 p.m. show is ASL-interpreted.)The FFA Leadership Center and Chapter House is right next door to the Christensen Farms Stage and the CHS Miracle of Birth Center. Venture inside for hands-on activities exploring aspects of farming and agriculture. Activities are led by youth involved in the statewide FFA program. The exhibit area is typically not as crowded and is quieter than other places on the fairgrounds. The building is open 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. daily (3 p.m. on Labor Day).Many of the animal competitions are held in the Warner Coliseum. While some shows are very popular (such as the draft horse show, Western horse speed races and the llama-alpaca costume contest), many of the exhibitions are held throughout the day, and the Coliseum is not very full. The Coliseum air tends to be cooler too, so it’s a nice place to sit and rest and watch cattle, other livestock and horses being judged.What to bringGuests are welcome to bring their own sensory tools such as noise-reducing earmuffs or fidgets.

        "description": "LONDON —&nbsp;Britain’s Defense Secretary Ben Wallace has suggested the U.K. may tighten visa conditions for Russians, but expressed doubts about a total ban on all Russian tourists.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on BBC Radio 4’s Today program Wednesday, Wallace said he thought the U.K. “can toughen up the conditions” of its visa system, but added: “I am not sure whether an outright ban is the right way.”\n\n\n\nBaltic countries are currently pushing for a full EU-wide ban on Russian tourists, which EU foreign ministers are set to discuss in Prague next week. The proposal has met with resistance in Germany, Greece and Cyprus among other member countries. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and other senior officials in Kyiv have demanded a total block on Russian travelers. \n\n\n\nEU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell poured cold water on the proposal this week, saying the EU would “have to be more selective.”\n\n\n\nWallace is the first U.K. minister to openly discuss whether London could modify its own visa rules in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\n“That’s a matter for the home secretary to look at,” he added. “But I don’t like — and I’m sure none of your listeners like — watching oligarchs’ wives or indeed Russian senior officials’ wives enjoying themselves in Greece or the south of France, or on superyachts around the world, while their army is committing war crimes in Ukraine. I think that is very wrong.”\n\n\n\nWallace denied “any wavering” in Western support for Ukraine, but admitted “there’s always a few disagreements about the level of sanctions.”\n\n\n\nSpeaking on Sky News, Wallace’s deputy James Heappey also rejected any suggestion that spiraling energy prices might force the U.K. to rethink its position.\n\n\n\n“I can understand why lots of people &#8230; worrying about the cost of living will be agreeing &#8230; that arguably the most straightforward solution for the cost-of-living crisis is that we reestablish relations with Russia, and everything goes back to the way that it was in the European energy market,” Heappey said. “Every single thing I have seen in the last six months tells me that that would be catastrophic for security in the Euro-Atlantic.”\n\n\n\nCamille Gijs contributed reporting.",

        "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/austria-600-day-without-climate-law/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication",
        "description": "Can’t be in breach of your climate law if you don’t have a climate law.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat’s the situation Austria finds itself in as the country marked 600 days without national climate legislation on Tuesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe conservative-Green coalition in Vienna vowed ambitious action upon taking office in early 2020, with a 2040 climate neutrality pledge —&nbsp;a decade ahead of the EU’s midcentury goal and five years ahead of neighboring Germany.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo-and-a-half years later, that target remains an empty promise, experts say.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAustria’s previous climate legislation, which governed emissions during the 2010s, expired at the end of 2020. A replacement was drafted in spring 2021 but never passed as the Greens and the conservative Austrian People’s Party (ÖVP) hit a negotiating deadlock.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis week, as parts of Austria saw flash floods when heavy rainfall hit soils desiccated by drought, politicians from both parties acknowledged that no progress was in sight.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ÖVP has rejected efforts to give the legislation teeth —&nbsp;the new draft law would not only have set an emissions budget for Austria as well as sectoral goals, but also imposed automatic sanctions in the event of a breach.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe April 2021 draft envisaged a €100 fine per ton of CO2 in breach of annual and sectoral targets, with the penalty amount gradually increasing every year. Any breach would also have prompted an increase in fossil fuel taxes. The revenues were meant to finance a green investment fund.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nÖVP climate spokesperson Johannes Schmuckenschlager told local media that concrete measures like legislation to expand renewable energy were more important and that an overarching climate protection law was “not the top priority.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Greens, for their part, say no deal is better than a bad deal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLukas Hammer, the party’s climate spokesperson, said the governing parties could easily agree on a law resembling the expired legislation, which lacked enforcement mechanisms and was criticized as weak by experts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“But we won’t settle for that,” he told POLITICO. “A climate protection law needs to have teeth to work.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDistant dream of climate neutrality\n\n\n\nHammer stressed that the absence of a climate law didn’t mean no action had been taken, pointing to Austria’s so-called climate ticket — an annual travel-anywhere-you-like public transport pass working out to €3 a day — as an example. \n\n\n\nThe Alpine country boasts vast hydropower resources and generates more than 80 percent of its power from renewables, a target Germany hopes to achieve by 2030. Its overall energy mix, however, remains highly dependent on fossil fuels.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast month, the Austrian Institute of Economic Research said that while the country’s emissions were on a downward trend, the 2040 target is a distant dream. \n\n\n\nThe researchers estimated that at its current pace, Austria would reach climate neutrality in 2065 or 2070 — a calculation that didn’t take into account the likely increase in energy emissions this winter when the country is expected to burn more c as the EU weans itself off of Russian gas supplies.\n\n\n\nThe Verbund AG combined cycle gas turbine power plant, right, stands alongside the site of Austria&#8217;s last coal-fired power station in this aerial photograph taken in Mellach, Austria |  Akos Stiller/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\n\n\n“If a tough climate protection law were to be passed, it would quickly become clear that this government is not on target,” said Reinhard Steurer, professor of climate policy at Vienna’s University of Natural Resources and Life Sciences.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEfforts to reduce emissions had been stepped up under the current government, he acknowledged. But in the absence of a “grand plan,” Austria is “muddling along” on climate action.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs a result, the 2040 target “is an illusion,” Steurer said. “There is no plan for it. The policy currently being made does not match the goal.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&#8216;Pure symbolism&#8217; \n\n\n\nAustria isn’t the only EU country without a climate law. All member countries are bound by the bloc’s emissions reduction legislation and carbon pricing system, including the overall goal of climate neutrality by 2050.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the Austrian government promised voters it would be more ambitious than Brussels, said Volker Hollenstein, head of policy at the environmental group WWF Austria.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“An ambitious climate law is a central component of climate policy that takes its own targets seriously,” Hollenstein added. Without such a law, including strong enforcement mechanisms, “it remains completely unclear how Austria intends to achieve its goals.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the EU prepares for a winter energy crunch, Vienna has also signed up to the bloc’s plan to reduce gas demand by 15 percent over the coming months.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the country — which even managed to increase its dependence on Russian gas from 80 percent to 87 percent since the invasion of Ukraine —&nbsp;also doesn’t yet have much of a plan for cutting consumption.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBesides the climate law, Austria’s energy efficiency legislation also expired at the end of 2020. The coalition hasn’t managed to agree on a replacement for that, either.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGiven the ÖVP’s reluctance, some have called on the Greens to quit the coalition. Hammer says that would play into the conservatives’ hands.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’ve pushed through other climate measures in this coalition, it’s never been easy,” he said. “In climate politics, I’m used to the fact that you have to fight. I will certainly not do the ÖVP the favor of getting out of their way.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ÖVP and its climate spokesman did not respond to requests for comment. The conservative party has taken a nosedive in the polls in recent months, but the next election won&#8217;t be until 2024. \n\n\n\nSteurer, the climate policy professor, said both parties were engaging in a game of pretend over the 2040 target.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The 2040 goal is basically pure symbolism,” he said. “It is not enshrined anywhere — there is no plan for it, no path toward it, no binding commitment.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of&nbsp;POLITICO Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one-stop-shop solution for policy professionals fusing the depth of POLITICO journalism with the power of technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive, breaking scoops and insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomized policy intelligence platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-level public affairs network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY GO PRO\n\n\n\nLOG IN",

        "description": "From the case of Dan Mallory to the story of Kaavya Viswanathan, literary critic Bethanne Patrick looks back on some of the strangest book scandals everHandsome and accomplished, Dan Mallory seemed to be the new golden boy of American letters. He had a glittering CV, worked for prestige publishers in London and New York and wrote a psychological thriller, The Woman in the Window, that was a huge bestseller and adapted into a Netflix film.He also burnished his public persona with falsehoods.

He would have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. In the morning, he made lassi or smoothies with it, just adding water or yoghurt. In the afternoon, he kneaded it into a dough.There was more cooking involved in the evening; the sattu was seasoned with onion, chillies and the oil from the pickle – this makes a very nice spicy filling that goes inside a dough ball called litti chokha. It’s my heritage dish. It’s sold on the street in Varanasi, Patna, in fact most of eastern Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. Traditionally they are cooked on the burning embers of cowpats.

The word pentiment means an earlier painting covered up by a later one, and the plot sees Moller scraping away lies to uncover the truth.The game’s director Josh Sawyer at developer Obsidian has a degree in history, and studied the Holy Roman Empire in particular. “I’d always wanted to make a historical game,” he says. “And around the time that Microsoft acquired us [in 2018], I thought it would be cool to try to pitch a very small-scale game.” He chose the 16th century because it was an era of great social upheaval, not unlike the period we’re living through today.Pentiment is out on Xbox and PC in November.

        "description": "Global Franchisor Expands Portfolio with Indianapolis-Based Company\n\n\n\nNeighborly, an umbrella franchisor of service brands that cater to home and business owners, has acquired Lawn Pride and expects to begin franchising the lawn-care brand next year. With this acquisition, Neighborly now has more than 30 brands that operate internationally.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a news release announcing the acquisition, Neighborly President and CEO Mike Bidwell noted that Indianapolis-based Lawn Pride’s fertilizing, weed control, aeration and over-seeding services are highly rated by its customers. Through the acquisition, he said, “we see tremendous opportunity to grow the brand to new heights beyond its home market.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLawn Pride’s History and Future\n\n\n\nLawn Pride founder and President Andrew Neher established the company more than 30 years ago while he was still attending college. “With a lot of hard work and a highly dedicated and talented team, we built Lawn Pride into the thriving business it is today,” Neher stated in Neighborly’s news release. “Now it’s time for the Lawn Pride team and the Neighborly team to collaboratively write the company’s exciting next chapters. … The organization’s proven franchise model is a game-changer for achieving accelerated brand growth.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnder Neher’s leadership, Lawn Pride built a stellar teamwork-focused corporate culture, developed a reputation for operational excellence, and has continually emphasized customer service and value, according to the news release. In acknowledging the importance of Lawn Pride’s employees, the franchisor is making them eligible to begin vesting into the Neighborly Associate Equity Program.\n\n\n\nJoshua Sevick, president of The Grounds Guys, another Neighborly brand, will oversee the integration of Lawn Pride into the Neighborly family of brands. The two lawn-care brands have differing service models and will operate independently. The news release quoted Sevick as saying he looks “forward to seeing Lawn Pride experience the same success under Neighborly that we’ve witnessed across all of our home-service brands.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbout the Neighborly Franchise\n\n\n\nBased in Waco, Texas, Neighborly has more than 30 diverse brands and 5,000 franchises that serve some 12 million customers in six countries. The company was founded in 1981 by Don Dwyer and previously was known as the Dwyer Group.\n\n\n\nThe Neighborly franchise has online platforms and an app that make it easy for consumers to locate nearby Neighborly franchisees when they need assistance. These brands’ specialists can repair, remodel, replace and maintain various indoor and outdoor possessions that are vital for comfortable, aesthetically pleasing home and business functioning.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmong Neighborly’s other North American brands are Aire Serv, Cumberland County Glass, Dryer Vent Wizard, Five Star Painting, Glass Doctor, HouseMaster, Molly Maid, Mosquito Joe, Mr. Appliance, Mr. Electric, Mr. Handyman, Mr. Rooter, Portland Glass, Precision Door Service, ProTect Painters, Rainbow International, Real Property Management, ShelfGenie and Window Genie.",

        "description": "A spiky teenage heroine from Pakistan brings a fresh perspective to the coming-of-age, coming-to-America novelTwo-thirds in to American Fever, Hira, the 16-year-old protagonist, and her friend Zahra – both on study exchange schemes from Pakistan – are discussing “Americanness” and American culture. Hira’s host family are white, and based in Lakeview, Oregon, while Zahra is living with a Pakistani family in New Jersey, prompting them to debate the “authenticity” of their experiences. When Hira argues that there is value in living with people different from you, Zahra shrugs, “As long as they’re not the white kids at school, whose first question to me is always ‘Where are you from?’” To this, Hira quickly replies, “But you are from elsewhere, yaar.” It is the sharpness, and surprise, of Hira’s statement – and there are several such moments throughout the novel – that makes Dur e Aziz Amna’s coming-of-age, coming-to-America debut novel stand out.Back in Pakistan, Hira hadn’t been dreaming of America “desperately, passionately, like the Hollywood foreigner’s yearning for America, like the third worlder’s slobbering”. Mostly, she had wanted to escape the stifling smallness of high school and home: the same schoolgirls, who called their periods their “visitors”, and the same married girls, “who wore their piety and innocence like goddamn medals to be polished every night before bedtime”.

And casting people of colour as fictional British aristocrats in the declining years of George III need be no more of an affectation than having non-white people play factual kings in Shakespeare’s history plays.This good-natured entertainment is certainly more watchable than the wince-makingly smug new version of Jane Austen’s Persuasion on Netflix, which misjudges the same approach. Mr Malcolm’s List understands its parameters and limitations and the value of leaving the fourth wall unbroken, and maybe above all it understands that Bridgertonian intrigue is in the brisker tradition of Georgette Heyer, not Austen. Everyone involved takes a demure yet also gleeful pleasure in the ridiculous bonnets and preposterous bows, the furbelows, foppery and unfeasibly tall hats. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Royal Albert Hall, LondonThe conductor was back at the Proms for the first time sine 2011 with a rather special orchestraZubin Mehta is one of the outstanding conductors of our time, yet over the last two decades he has become an increasingly rare visitor to London. He last appeared at the Proms in 2011, and his return was warmly received. With it came the Proms debut of a rather special orchestra; founded 12 years ago, the Australian World Orchestra brings together expatriate Australian musicians from all over the globe to work alongside their home-based colleagues. The lineup for its current tour includes players from across the northern hemisphere, from San Francisco to Hong Kong, who meld into a remarkably flexible ensemble.Mehta clearly brings the best from them too. He has always been a superb interpreter of the Second Viennese School, and he began this concert with two works by Webern, the Passacaglia Op 1 and the Six Pieces for Orchestra Op 6, the more manageable 1928 revision rather than the original gargantuan version. His stormy account of the passacaglia, unmistakably expressionist, found echoes in the climaxes of the orchestral pieces, in the snarling brass of the second and the final outburst of grief in the funeral-march fourth, while the AWO’s outstanding woodwind (hard to identify individually, as the programme listed the players alphabetically by section) made every melodic shard count.Available on BBC Sounds until 10 October. The BBC Proms continue until 10 September. Continue reading...",

        "description": "At the start of a new high school sports season in Minnesota teams hold tryouts, scrimmages, and first games. For a few of Minnesota’s best-known players, there is a new opportunity to make money.In June, the Minnesota State High School League approved guidance that allows students to sign name, image and likeness (NIL) deals. That means companies can contract with students to advertise or endorse products.Proponents are excited for the opportunity to give athletes a chance to make some money and get business experience. But some coaches and experts are worried about how pay for some will change high school athletics.Bayliss Flynn of Edina High School was the first Minnesota student known to cash in on the opportunity. Flynn is a goalie on Edina’s varsity soccer team, and she also played for the Minnesota Aurora in the team’s inaugural season. Just days after the state league issued its guidance, she signed an NIL deal with TruStone Financial Credit Union.Katie Aafedt is Flynn’s coach at Edina High School. She was excited that the first NIL deal in the state went to her athlete— and to a woman.“I think these athletes work so hard, and this is kind of their lifelong passion, especially by the time they get to high school,” Aafedt said. “It’s a great reward.”Basketball coach Larry McKenzie is more concerned. He coached for 42 years, most recently with the boys basketball team at Minneapolis North High School. His record of six state championships over the course of his career landed him in the Minnesota Basketball Coaches Hall of Fame.In July, he announced his retirement from coaching. NIL was one of the reasons he cited for leaving.“It was a big part of my decision-making of getting out,” he said. “I personally just think it’s going to create a lot of additional chaos for coaches.”The NIL debate recently trickled down to the high school level from the college level. In July 2021, the NCAA enacted a rule that college athletes could take NIL deals.In Minnesota, such deals were already allowed for high schoolers — there is no state law saying students cannot enter these contracts.But the rule gets a little more complicated for athletes. National rules governing high school sports require that students be amateurs. If students get paid to play, they violate their amateur status and lose their eligibility to compete at the high school level.  NIL deals do not technically pay students to play. They pay students for the use of their name or image to endorse products or advertise for companies.Minnesota State High School League Executive Director Erich Martens said the league’s priority with its guidance was to clarify those rules.“Our students are pretty incredible entrepreneurs in lots of different ways,” Martens said. “They’re able to capture revenue in ways that maybe generations before them hadn&#x27;t really thought about or didn&#x27;t exist. This hopefully helps them to do that in a safe way.”The guidelines include a few limitations. Athletes can’t wear their school uniforms or mention their team in ads, and contracts can’t compensate students for specific athletic achievements, like points scored.But even though the rule technically keeps students in the amateur category, some worry that it’ll change the game.One of McKenzie’s concerns is equity. He worries that students at wealthier schools will end up getting more deals, and that students will want to transfer to those schools for the NIL opportunities.Minnesota’s policy says that NIL contracts can’t induce a student to attend a certain high school or transfer somewhere else. But McKenzie thinks this will happen informally. Students already want to go to the schools with the best uniforms, the nicest locker rooms, and the newest facilities, and with NIL he thinks a history of contracts will be added to that list.“Everybody knows there are already outside influences. I don’t know why you wouldn’t think that money would be a factor,” McKenzie said. “It’s not intended for that, but it’s going to happen.”Chris Pham is a lawyer in Minneapolis who specializes in sports and entertainment law. He began following NIL law as it took effect nationwide at the college level last summer. He shares McKenzie’s concerns about equity.He has heard from college parents who say their kids are switching from where they are committed to play based on rumors that athletes at other schools have NIL deals. Colleges are not allowed to use promises of NIL deals to recruit, either — but he believes it is happening anyway. He foresees the same thing happening in high school.“There are some schools, even at the high school level, that have more resources,” Pham said. “If they have that drawing power and that ability to create opportunities, I don’t see why that would be any different ... than it is at the college level in terms of improper recruiting.”McKenzie saw students and their parents stressing over each other’s stats.“We’re already dealing with who gets the most shots and who gets the most playing time, and now we’ve gotta deal with who makes the most money,” he said.Even though Aafedt is not too worried about NIL, she does worry about some of the other changes in the world of high school sports. She started coaching more than 20 years ago.“The pressure is tenfold what it was even five years ago,” she said. “I’m much more worried about mental health and their physical bodies.”Now she sees mounting expectation for students to be year-round athletes. Sticking to a single sport all year is physically tough, she said, as is the goal so many have to play at top collegiate levels.Students also depend on social media to gain name recognition which can lead to NIL deals. Aafedt says she is proud of her athletes for using social media to speak out about issues that matter to them, too.McKenzie advises athletes interested in NIL to seek help from attorneys who can walk students through the conditions and tax responsibilities they are signing up for. Like any business agreement, he says, NIL deals are not something to take lightly.Amid the changes, Aafedt said she continues coaching because there are athletes with passion for the sport that transcends winning and pay.“I would say a significant portion of them are here because they truly love it. I have not seen a downshift in that.”  ",

For many, these are deal breakers, a reason to abandon Chrome and jump ship to other browsers.\n\n\n\nGoogle Chrome Logo &#8211; Transparent\n\n\n\nGoogle might be working on a solution to this problem.\n\n\n\nBattery Saver Mode\n\n\n\nA new Google Chrome flag showed up in the Canary channel today:\n\n\n\nEnable the battery saver mode feature in the settings: When enabled, shows the battery section in the performance settings page – Mac, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, Fuchsia, Lacros.\n\n\n\nThe flag does not do anything yet. It doesn&#8217;t even add a battery saver mode to the settings page. However, we might soon be able to run Google Chrome on a battery diet.\n\n\n\nI tried digging around the Chromium Gerrit repository looking for additional clues. However, I could not find any additional information about this upcoming feature. \n\n\n\nSo for now, all we can do is wait for this flag to be functional and then test it out. Stay tuned to Chrome Story for further updates as this story develops.\n\n\n\nHigh Efficiency Mode\n\n\n\nIn addition to the power-saver mode, Chrome is getting one more option to tune its performance. Here is the new flag for this feature:\n\n\n\nEnable the high efficiency mode feature in the settings: When enabled, shows the performance section in the performance settings page – Mac, Windows, Linux, ChromeOS, Fuchsia, Lacros.\n\n\n\nFor now, this flag also is an empty shell.\n\n\n\nWill this feature convince you to come back to Chrome, if you are using another browser now?\n\n\n\nSource: Chromium Gerrit.",

But water resource officials say it's not just the stars who are using more than their fair share - thousands are being warned about using too much water.\n\n\n\nThey're some of the biggest names in Hollywood: Sylvester Stallone, Kevin Hart, and Kim and Kourtney Kardashian. They're also apparently some of the biggest water wasters in the Hidden Hills neighborhood of Calabasas.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tList of celebrities who live in Calabasas\t\n\n\n\n\nLas Virgenes Municipal Water District officials say the stars, some of which aren't even home, are among some 1,600 customers who have surpassed 150% of their monthly water budgets at least four times since the agency declared a drought emergency last December. \n\n\n\nNow water officials say they may install a device that will restrict their water usage to their properties.\n\n\n\n\"They are in line to get a flow restriction device put on their water meters in order to limit how much water they're continuing to use,\" said Michael McNutt of the Las Virgenes Municipal Water District.\n\n\n\nMcNutt says the device will cause indoor faucets to trickle out and outdoor sprinklers will go from flowing freely to sputtering to a stop.\n\n\n\nHe explains the only surefire way to avoid getting a flow restriction device is to contact the water district and sign a commitment form that you'll work with the district to come into compliance. If you don't, you'll get a flow restriction device put on for two weeks straight.\n\n\n\n\"If, once it's removed, they continue to exceed their water budgets by 150%, it's put back on for a minimum of a month,\" McNutt said.\n\n\n\nViolators will also get hit with some pretty pricey fines for each violation.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tSouth Carolina principal found dead in car with suspect still inside, sheriff says\t\n\n\n\n\nRepresentatives for Stallone and retired NBA star Dwyane Wade say the are taking measures to reduce their water usage. Las Virgenes officials say all the stars who have been publicly outed are taking some of the necessary steps.\n\n\n\n\"The great thing about the celebrities is they're all working with us to get to where they need to be,\" McNutt said.\n\n\n\nDistrict officials say people need to do away with thirsty lawns and replace them with drought-tolerant landscaping and install drip irrigation, which sends the water straight to the root to help save things like trees.\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, water officials say they'd love to work with high-profile people to demonstrate how to create a more drought-tolerant California.\n\n\n\n\"What I would love for them to do is contact me and work with me to put out public service messages, not only about what they're doing, but how people can be like them and be a part of the solution,\" McNutt said.\n\n\n\nWater officials say that they have installed about 50 of those flow restriction devices to different homes. McNutt says none of those homes belong to celebrities because all of them are cooperating to bring down their water usage.",

        "description": "President Biden ran as a cure to former President Trump, but he’s relying on a handful of officials appointed under the prior administration and serving in critical governing roles who are tackling everything from hostage negotiations to the Kremlin.\n\n\n\nOne example is John Sullivan, a former deputy secretary of State who served under Rex Tillerson. He is in charge of running a skeleton-staffed embassy in Moscow as the U.S. ambassador to Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother is Roger Carstens, the State Department’s special envoy for hostage negotiations, who has been a central player in efforts to secure the release of WNBA star Brittney Griner and other Americans wrongfully detained or held hostage in foreign countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden has also left in place FBI Director Christopher Wray, who is currently fighting off attacks from Trump’s allies over the bureau’s unprecedented search of the former president’s Mar-a-Lago property. Biden’s decision to keep Wray came despite objections from some on the left who wanted him to replace the Trump-appointed FBI director before the end of his 10-year term.\n\n\n\nAnd last November, Biden decided to nominate Jerome Powell — a Republican nominated by Trump as Federal Reserve chairman — to a second term atop the Fed, which plays a primary role in fighting inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Biden has faced pressure from some corners to find ways to replace other officials appointed under Trump –– like those running the IRS and the Postal Service –– who have faced scrutiny for controversies that have occurred within their agencies under their watch.\n\n\n\nThe few Trump appointees that Biden has chosen to keep have some things in common, namely that they are not seen as diehard Trump loyalists and they have bipartisan support in Congress.\n\n\n\nIn the case of Powell, for example, Biden cited the Fed chairman’s bipartisan accolades and commended him for standing up to “unprecedented political interference” from Trump.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I believe we need to do everything we can to take the bitter partisanship of today’s politics out of something as important as the independence and credibility of the Federal Reserve,” Biden said at the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTom Shannon, who served as undersecretary of state for political affairs during the Trump years, described Sullivan as a “good governance Republican” who didn’t let politics get in the way of doing his job.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“He was brought in because of his long experience in government and the fact that [the Trump] administration had very few people that fit that bill and that had not already become ‘never Trumpers,’ ” Shannon said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSullivan served as acting secretary of State under Trump until Mike Pompeo replaced Tillerson to lead the department, after which Sullivan moved to the ambassadorship in Moscow in 2019.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think it was wise for the Biden administration to keep him in place because he was a known quantity to the Russians and he’s a tough-minded guy, so he wasn’t going to shy away from the tougher issues that we face in our relationship,” Shannon continued.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome Democrats have called for Biden to take a more aggressive stance in ousting remaining officials left over from the Trump administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We think they should all go,” said Jeff Hauser, founder and director of the progressive Revolving Door Project. “We just don’t trust them.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHauser was critical of Wray, blaming him for failing to disrupt the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The idea that somebody redeems themselves fully by not going along with everything that Trump wants is just a bizarre standard,” he said. \n\n\n\nDan Coats, who served as Director of National Intelligence under Trump from 2017 to 2019, described Wray as someone who “walks down the middle and does everything he possibly can to protect the FBI’s reputation of not getting involved and doing things for political purposes.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nCoats also defended Wray amid criticism from the right over the Mar-a-Lago search.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“My first thought was Chris would not have signed off on that unless he thought the process was not working or they were not getting the right answers back from lawyers or others and it was serious enough to take that action,” Coats said in an interview with The Hill. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMax Stier, founding president and CEO of the Partnership for Public Service, said that continuity even in a small number of positions can help minimize disruptions caused by the vast turnover in political positions — particularly those that require Senate confirmation — following presidential transitions.  \n\n\n\n“If you can find someone who’s going to do the job well, you’re well advised to keep them,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe continuity in Carstens’s role was welcome news to some families of Americans detained overseas who didn’t have to grapple with new leadership in an office handling their family members’ cases.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The longer your family’s case goes on, that continuity becomes hugely helpful,” said David Whelan, whose brother Paul has been held in Russia since 2018, in a recent interview.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShannon also said that Carstens’s background in the military — he is a former Green Beret — “gives him a certain amount of neutrality.” Carstens took on the role in 2020 left vacant by Robert O’Brien, who left State for the White House to become Trump’s fourth and final national security adviser.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStier argued that the federal government is hampered by an over-reliance on political appointees, which he said total about 4,000. Career officials, who number about 1.9 million according to Stier’s organization, cannot be easily fired by incoming administrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden therefore faces limits in who he can remove. Some Trump-era political appointees reportedly “burrowed” into government agencies by transitioning to career roles before the Biden administration took over.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The overall system, in my view, is broken,” Stier said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut other Trump nominees that remain in their roles could be soon on the way out.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden is facing a decision as to whether to replace IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig, whose current four-year term is coming to an end.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre wouldn’t answer if Biden had confidence in Rettig earlier this year amid controversy over audits targeting former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired, and former deputy FBI director Andrew McCabe, who was dismissed under the previous administration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHelming the IRS has acquired even more importance in recent weeks, as Congress passed and Biden signed a sweeping law that includes $80 billion in additional funding for the agency for hiring and enforcement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe president has also faced pressure from the left to orchestrate the removal of Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, a Republican donor and businessman who stirred controversy for making cost-cutting changes at the Postal Service that slowed mail delivery in 2020 during the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden cannot himself remove DeJoy, but the postmaster’s critics have urged his nominees to the Postal Service’s nine-member board of governors to vote to remove him. But even with a handful of new Biden appointees confirmed, the board has not taken any steps to change leadership.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDeJoy has been focused on implementing a 10-year plan to boost revenue for the Postal Service announced last year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It is a great honor to serve as the 75th Postmaster General of the United States,” DeJoy said in a statement to The Hill. “The Postal Service has a proud and ongoing history which I have, and will continue to uphold, of performing our vital work in an apolitical and nonpartisan fashion.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDeJoy said that he and his team “remain focused on implementing the Delivering for America Plan, and on ensuring that the United States Postal Service will be a vibrant and thriving organization for decades to come that will provide the American people and American businesses the high quality service they expect and deserve.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSecret Service Director James Murray — whose agency is in hot water due to the deletion of text messages sought by the congressional committee investigating Jan. 6 — is expected to retire sometime this year, though he delayed those plans to help navigate investigations into the missing messages.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHauser called on Biden to remove Department of Homeland Security Inspector General Joseph Cuffari, another Trump appointee who has been under fire for his handling of the deleted Secret Service text messages sent and received around Jan. 6.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Biden has been wary of purging watchdogs in a way that could remind Americans of Trump’s firing spree against inspectors general following his first impeachment, and the White House seems keen to allow the investigations to play out.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAsked whether Biden had plans to fire Cuffari during a briefing earlier this month, Jean-Pierre replied simply: “No.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "A bombshell Twitter whistleblower complaint alleging the company has major security deficiencies is adding fuel to Elon Musk’s core argument in his case against Twitter as he tries to back out of his&nbsp;$44 billion deal&nbsp;to buy the platform.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer Twitter security chief Peiter Zatko’s complaint, made public Tuesday, complicates the legal challenge for the social media platform.&nbsp;Twitter is suing in an effort to force Musk to complete his acquisition of the company after he walked away from his binding offer over accusations that Twitter breached the agreement by failing to provide him with sufficient data about spam accounts.\n\n\n\nZatko has had no contact with Musk, and the drafting of the complaint predates Musk’s involvement with Twitter, according to Whistleblower Aid, the group representing Zatko.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNonetheless, key portions of the redacted 84-page complaint,&nbsp;published by The Washington Post, appear to bolster Musk’s accusations, even referencing tweets from Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal to Musk about the number of bots on the platform as a “recent example of misrepresentations.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMusk’s legal team is already leaning into using Zatko’s complaint as the Musk-Twitter case heads to an October trial.\n\n\n\n“We have already issued a subpoena for Mr. Zatko, and we found his exit and that of other key employees curious in light of what we have been finding,” said Alex Spiro, an attorney for Musk.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwitter's lawsuit against Musk was filed in July. It marks one of several fronts on which Twitter will have to navigate hurdles in the fallout from the whistleblower complaint, which includes a lengthy list of accusations about security deficiencies that the company denies and will also force Twitter to face scrutiny from Congress and federal regulators that have been increasingly hostile toward tech companies in recent years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This throws gasoline into the fire around the bot issue with Musk and Twitter,” Wedbush analyst Dan Ives said. “This alarming story also raises security concerns which will be a major focus of the Beltway on Twitter. For the Musk camp this story is like a kid looking under the tree on Christmas morning heading into Delaware court.”\n\n\n\nTwitter is pushing back strongly on Zatko’s allegations — as it has with accusations made by Musk.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context,” a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement. “Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders.”\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson said Zatko was fired for “ineffective leadership and poor performance.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJeffrey Manns, a professor at the George Washington University Law School, said it is too early to tell how the allegations will impact the case, but they could give Musk more leverage to back out of the deal or renegotiate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“At least up until this day, I think that conventional wisdom is that Elon Musk doesn't have a lot to hang his hat on when it comes to backing out of the deal,” Manns said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn order to boost Musk’s case, there needs to be more substance to back up the whistleblower’s claims, he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The accusations are salacious in terms of misconduct and misrepresentation by leadership concerning both the levels of security and the number of fake accounts. But all we know at this point is we have a former employee who is raising what could be legitimate concerns. Until there's greater scrutiny to show whether the former employee can back that up, the jury is out,” Manns said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMusk engaged in a public back-and-forth with Agrawal in May, roughly a month after reaching a deal to buy the company, about the number of bots or spam accounts on Twitter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAgrawal responded by stating that “we are strongly incentivized to detect and remove as much spam as we possibly can.” Zatko’s complaint calls the response a lie, alleging that&nbsp;the metric Twitter uses to quantify the average number of users on the platform that can view ads — called the mDAU, or monetizable daily active user, metric —&nbsp;incentivizes executives to avoid counting spam bots as mDAU because that figure is reported to advertisers.&nbsp;If the mDAU metric included spam bots that do not click through ads, then it&nbsp;could lead&nbsp;advertisers&nbsp;to shift to other platforms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe complaint alleges there are “many millions of active accounts” not considered mDAU that include spam bots.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Therefore Musk’s suspicions are on target: senior executives earn bonuses not for cutting spam, but for growing mDAU. In Fact, Twitter created the mDAU metric precisely to avoid having to honestly answer the very questions Mr. Musk raised,” the complaint states.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAgrawal later followed up&nbsp;his statement about spam removal&nbsp;with what appeared to be a more direct response to Musk, tweeting that an estimate of less than 5 percent of “reported mDAU” every quarter are spam accounts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe complaint states Agrawal’s expanded explanation doesn’t include “out-and-out lies but they rely on world play to district and mislead Mr. Musk, and everyone else” and that the general public would not understand&nbsp;the difference between the metric Agrawal is using and the overall Twitter user population&nbsp;without insight into Twitter’s calculation for mDAU.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwitter spokeswoman Rebecca Hahn told the Post that Twitter removes more than a million spam accounts every day, adding up to more than 300 million per year. She told the paper that Twitter “fully stands” by its Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filings and approach to fighting spam.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOthers also questioned Zatko’s accusations, according to the Post’s report.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA person familiar with Zatko’s tenure at Twitter told the Post the company investigated Zatko’s security claims during his time there and concluded they were sensationalistic and without merit. Four people familiar with Twitter’s efforts to fight spam told the Post that the company uses extensive manual and automated tools to measure and reduce spam.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZatko started at Twitter in November 2020 in the security/integrity lead position after being courted by Twitter founder and then-CEO Jack Dorsey, according to the complaint. He was fired in January.\n\n\n\nA core part of Zatko’s complaint alleges that Twitter was not complying with a 2011 consent order from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for the past decade. The FTC ordered the company to create and maintain a security program designed to protect privacy and nonpublic consumer information as part of a settlement agreement over an FTC complaint that hackers were able to gain control of Twitter on two occasions in 2009.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUp until the time of Zatko’s termination, Twitter “remained out of compliance in multiple respects” with the 2011 order, the complaint alleges.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe whistleblower disclosure was reportedly sent to the SEC, FTC and Department of Justice (DOJ) last month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter being publicly released Tuesday, Zatko's allegations caused an immediate stir in Washington. Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have criticized Twitter, and the new accusations are prompting calls for an investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee received the complaint and is “in the process of setting up a meeting to discuss the allegations in further detail,” a committee spokesperson said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We take this matter seriously,” the spokesperson added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTop senators on the Judiciary Committee also vowed to take action.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If these claims are accurate, they may show dangerous data privacy and security risks for Twitter users around the world.&nbsp; As Chair of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I will continue investigating this issue and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations,” the committee's chair, Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa), the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, said in a statement that the claims raise “serious national security concerns as well as privacy issues, and they must be investigated further.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Take a tech platform that collects massive amounts of user data, combine it with what appears to be an incredibly weak security infrastructure and infuse it with foreign state actors with an agenda, and you've got a recipe for disaster,\" Grassley said.\n\n\n\nSen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) sent letters urging the FTC and DOJ to take action in response to the allegations raised by the whistleblower complaint.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.) sent a letter to the FTC with a similar request.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These troubling disclosures paint the picture of a company that has consistently and repeatedly prioritized profits over the safety of its users and its responsibility to the public, as Twitter executives appeared to ignore or hinder efforts to address threats to user security and privacy,” Blumenthal wrote.",

        "description": "The Biden administration is expected on Wednesday to announce it is canceling a chunk of student debt, even as it faces criticism that going too far could hamper efforts to fight off inflation.\n\n\n\nSome progressive Democrats have argued that forgiving student debt could help their party and Biden in the midterm elections given the crushing debt facing millions of students. Yet there is also reason to think the plan carries some real political risk.\n\n\n\nRecent polling shows a majority of Americans are worried about the impact debt forgiveness plans could have on inflation, a huge issue in the midterms.\n\n\n\nUnder the potential forgiveness plan, borrowers earning less than $125,000 per year could see at least $10,000 in cancellation of their federal student loans. The amount is much lower than many progressives aimed for but would mark the most significant forgiveness in federal student debt for borrowers ever.\n\n\n\nThe idea has drawn pushback from Republicans, who have strongly come out against Democratic-led proposals for student debt relief in recent months, denouncing them as unfair and inflationary.\n\n\n\n“The federal government does not ‘forgive’ or ‘cancel; student loans — they take the debt and give it to every American, including those without a degree. It’s just wrong,” Sen. Mike Braun (R-Ind.) tweeted on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nAn analysis&nbsp;released by the Penn Wharton Budget Model (PWBM) on Tuesday estimated the plan could run up about $300 billion in costs, with the potential to reach $330 billion if the effort is continued through the next decade for new borrowers and others who could qualify.\n\n\n\nKent Smetters, faculty director for PWBM, said the cost increase to continue the program for&nbsp;subsequent years would be much smaller in magnitude “because the assumption is that this is a one-time forgiveness per borrower.”\n\n\n\nAs for the impact the plan would have on inflation, Smetters estimated it to&nbsp;be more&nbsp;marginal in size, saying it would “basically barely show up in some sense in the standard inflation metric.”&nbsp;Though he added the plan could have future implications for inflation in higher education costs and “change how people finance college.”\n\n\n\n“That could also change how colleges themselves price things,” Smetters said, asking, “Will colleges themselves actually increase tuition and capture a lot of the benefit?”\n\n\n\nAs for the impact the plan would have on inflation, Smetters estimated it to be more marginal in size, saying it would “basically barely show up in some sense in the standard inflation metric.”\n\n\n\nLast month, annual consumer inflation hit 8.5 percent, easing from a four-decade high of 9.1 percent the prior month, though still much higher than what economists say is normal.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have pinned much of the blame on Democrats, specifically citing stimulus spending passed under the Biden administration as helping fuel inflation, as well as pandemic relief programs like the ongoing student loan pause.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlthough experts have said government spending under both the Trump and Biden administrations has had an impact on inflation, they also downplay the effects of the years-long payment freeze on the recent spike in costs.\n\n\n\nBut the Biden administration is still facing pressure to end the relief as government spending attracts more attention amid rising inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Marc Goldwein, senior vice president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said the effects of extending a current pause on payments is “not gigantic,” he also said it’s one of the “most direct and instantaneous tools that the administration has” to combat inflation.\n\n\n\n“It’s not large relative to the size of the inflation problem. But it’s large relative to the president’s tools to fight inflation,” Goldwein told The Hill last week.\n\n\n\nHowever, advocates and Democrats pushing for forgiveness say rising prices underscore the need for continued relief to borrowers, citing economic hardship faced by lower income borrowers as inflation remains high.\n\n\n\n“Inflation is most definitely a problem I think that we should be talking about, and it impacts student loan borrowers tremendously,” said Persis Yu, policy director for the Student Borrower Protection Center.&nbsp;“Especially low income student loan borrowers, who would really benefit from cancellation because they're the folks who are spending more of their income right now on milk and bread.”\n\n\n\nAdvocates have also pushed back on plans by the White House to apply income restrictions to who is eligible for student loan forgiveness. But there are questions about whether the current income caps set at $125,000 are too high.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe recent PWBM analysis estimated about 70 percent of the debt forgiven under the proposed $10,000 plan “accrues to households in the top 60 percent of the income distribution.”\n\n\n\nSmetters said roughly 30 percent “would go to the bottom 40 percent of the income distribution.”&nbsp; However, he also noted the analysis doesn’t account for racial demographics of borrowers, which advocates say is important to factor in.\n\n\n\nProponents of student loan relief often promote the effort as a means to promote racial equity, while noting the disproportionate burden faced by borrowers of color, especially Black borrowers, who experts say are more likely to borrow at higher rates and struggle with repayment.\n\n\n\n“We often conflate income with wealth in that we're&nbsp;not always capturing everybody who really needs assistance when we do means testing, in particular with income caps,” Yu said.\n\n\n\nYu particularly pointed to the&nbsp;yawning wealth gap&nbsp;between white and Black households, saying Black borrowers need higher incomes “to be able to afford homes, and to build savings, and retirement.”",

        "description": "Top Federal Reserve officials will spend three days plotting the next moves in their fight against inflation from a Wyoming ski resort as millions of Americans struggle with the rising cost of basic goods.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Fed's annual summer policy summit in Jackson Hole, Wyo., kicks off Wednesday as the bank attempts to steer the U.S. out of high inflation and away from a recession.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe event, which is closed to the public, begins with two days of panels and paper presentations focused on a central theme and concludes with a speech from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile only a few dozen attendees will witness Powell’s remarks, the text of his speech could give financial markets, Fed analysts and the American people a closer look at his views.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It's a chance for the chair to speak his mind,” said Steve Englander, global head of North America strategy at Standard Chartered Bank, in a Tuesday interview.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“He can reference whatever he thinks is important and kind of guide readers to see how he views the world,” Englander said, comparing the Jackson Hole speech to the president’s annual State of the Union Address.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There's a feeling that it gives them greater insights,” he continued.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLike his predecessors, Powell has used his past Jackson Hole speeches to frame his vision on the Fed’s&nbsp;approach to its biggest challenge of the moment, beyond the month-to-month speculation of what the bank will do to interest rates. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFed watchers generally don’t expect Powell to hint at what the Fed will do in September during its next monetary policy meeting — particularly with so much uncertainty facing the bank in its fight against inflation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“While the U.S. economy is not in recession, and we do not believe it will fall into one this year, the impact of inflation will not soon dissipate,” wrote Joe Brusuelas, chief economist at audit and tax firm RSM, in a Tuesday preview.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“With inflation now permeating the housing sector, which will be difficult to unwind, Powell’s speech on Friday will almost certainly be one to remember and frame the domestic and global economic narrative into the beginning of the next business cycle,” he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnnual inflation fell slightly in July and prices held even month-over-month, according to Labor Department data released earlier this month. The numbers were an encouraging break from months of steadily increasing price growth. Gasoline prices have also continued to fall through August, and supply chain issues that drove much of the rapid increase in the prices of goods are also appearing to ease.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe combination of slowing price pressures and a steep decline in some sectors of the economy sensitive to higher interest rates — particularly housing — spurred speculation the Fed may soon ease up on interest rate hikes. Doing so could ease concerns of the Fed pushing the U.S. into a recession by raising rates to a point that stalls economic growth.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the brief dip in inflation is likely cold comfort to Powell and the Fed, who were caught off guard by the persistence of rapid price growth through much of the past two years. The Fed is still working to rebuild its credibility after expecting inflation to fall far sooner, only to watch it rise despite a series of sharp interest rate hikes earlier in 2022.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We are seeing some green shoots, but they don't want to declare victory prematurely,” said Derek Tang, co-founder and economist at research firm Monetary Policy Analytics, in a Monday interview.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTang, like many Fed experts, expects Powell to reinforce the Fed’s commitment to bringing inflation down while acknowledging the pain likely to come with higher interest rates. While the labor market has remained strong and added 528,000 jobs in July alone, it is unclear how much longer U.S. households can keep powering the economy through spending with rates on the rise.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Even if inflation comes down, prices have still risen a lot over the last two years, so cost of living is still a big issue for many families,” he said. “Incomes are also rising, but they're not necessarily keeping pace with inflation just so people feel for them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They are very kind of sensitive to that potential disconnect there. Because otherwise, you're going to feel gaslighted right?” Tang continued. “They're gonna be really careful about the messaging around that.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "The Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), a super PAC aligned with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), is launching ads targeting vulnerable Democratic Reps. Kim Schrier (Wash.) and Elaine Luria (Va.) on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe $615,000 in ads targeting Schrier and $395,000 aimed at Luria amount to over $1 million in additional ad buys for CLF, and are the PAC’s first ads in those districts, which the nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates as \"toss-ups.\"\n\n\n\nMessaging in the ads centers on inflation and the economy, and on tying the two members to President Biden.\n\n\n\nThe ad targeting Schrier directly addresses a claim in&nbsp;one of her own ads&nbsp;that she was “taking on the Biden administration to suspend the gas tax.”\n\n\n\n“Schrier votes with Biden 100 percent of the time,” a narrator in the&nbsp;CLF ad&nbsp;says. It charges that Schrier voted for bills that contributed to inflation despite her knowing that they would do so, playing audio from a June 2021 telephone&nbsp;town hall&nbsp;saying that Democrats knew there was a “possibility” that the American Rescue Plan stimulus package could cause prices to go up and lead to inflation.\n\n\n\nThe ad targeting Luria says she praised the economy despite inflation and fears of a recession, with a narrator accusing her of “spewing liberal talking points, making excuses for Biden and [House Speaker Nancy] Pelosi.”\n\n\n\nThe ads knock up CLF’s investments to $2.3 million in Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District where Luria is running, and over $4 million in Washington’s 8th Congressional District where Schrier is. \n\n\n\nCLF announced in April that it has&nbsp;reserved $125 million nationwide&nbsp;in television and streaming service ad space through the November elections.\n\n\n\n“Elaine Luria and Kim Schrier tell a different story back home, but in Congress they’re little more than loyal foot soldiers for Biden and Pelosi’s failed agenda,” CLF communications director Calvin Moore said in a statement. “With Americans suffering from record prices for gas and groceries, families can’t afford to send Luria and Schrier back to Congress.”\n\n\n\nSchrier and Luria were both first elected to Congress in the 2018 “blue wave” that flipped their districts from GOP to Democratic control.\n\n\n\nSchrier will face Republican businessman and former prosecutor Matt Larkin in November, while Luria will go up against Republican Virginia state Sen.

        "description": "This morning, victorious primary candidates in New York and Florida race ahead to Election Day while Ukrainians in the midst of war nervously celebrate their independence day.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBefore we dive into U.S. political contests, a look at a threatened ally:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe United States today will publicly stand with Ukraine as it marks its sixth month of war with Russia.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe administration is expected to commit another $3 billion in assistance to train and equip Ukrainian forces for years to come, according to U.S. officials (The Associated Press). The funding under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative will support contracts for drones, weapons and other equipment that may not see the battlefront for a year or two, officials told the news wire.\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Laura Kelly, reporting from Kyiv, describes Ukrainians as determined to keep fighting even as the war’s horrors and uncertainties are never out of mind.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe State Department and U.S. Embassy in Kyiv warned Americans to leave Ukraine immediately ahead of today’s independence day celebrations, describing Russia as stepping up efforts to launch attacks on civilian infrastructure and government facilities timed to events this week, which commemorate 31 years since Ukraine broke its ties with the Soviet Union (CNN).\n\n\n\nHalf a year of war has cost countless lives, upended families, turned parts of cities and homes into rubble, and transformed some small Ukrainian communities into graveyards. Russia initially believed Ukraine would fall within days (The Associated Press). The war, now at a standstill, has no end in sight. Russia, an international pariah because of its February invasion, appears to be weathering tough global sanctions that in turn are painful for European nations because of resulting energy shortages and rising costs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The U.S. Embassy urges U.S. citizens to depart Ukraine now using privately available ground transportation options if it is safe to do so,” the embassy said on its website, citing unspecified advance “information.”\n\n\n\n“The security situation throughout Ukraine is highly volatile and conditions may deteriorate without warning,” it added.\n\n\n\nIn Kyiv, there’s a ban on all big gatherings through Thursday. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who today said his country has been “reborn” six months into war (The New York Times),is among those warning that Moscow may carry out intense attacks, including missile strikes, today or this week (The Associated Press).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We are fighting against the most terrible threat to our statehood and also at a time when we have achieved the greatest level of national unity,” Zelensky said during a Tuesday evening address (Reuters).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZelensky and international officials, including the secretary general of the United Nations, continue to warn that a catastrophe could result from the Russian military’s seizure and occupation for months of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. All that stands between the world and nuclear disaster are dedicated Ukrainian operators working at gunpoint. (The New York Times).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. teacher Marc Fogel, who was sentenced to 14 years in a Russian penal colony in June after his arrest last year for possession of half an ounce of medical marijuana prescribed for pain in the U.S., once taught international history to children of U.S. diplomats (The Washington Post). His family wants him included in the potential prisoner swap being negotiated by the Biden administration to free WNBA star Brittney Griner and former Marine Paul Whelan, both currently serving long sentences in Russia. On Tuesday, nine senators urged the State Department to designate Fogel as “wrongfully detained” and also seek his release as part of diplomatic efforts (CNN).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The United States cannot stand by as Mr. Fogel wastes away in a Russian hard labor camp,” wrote Sens. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), Pat Toomey (R-Pa.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), Jon Tester (D-Mont.), Steve Daines (R-Mont.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.), Shelley Moore Capito (R-W.Va.) and Tim Kaine (D-Va.).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n▪ The New York Times: Images chronicle the war’s toll (photographers’ slideshow from Ukraine since February).

The two lawmakers were squeezed into the same Manhattan-based district after an unanticipated redistricting ruling earlier this summer threw the Empire State’s maps into chaos, leading to a game of political musical chairs. The 2020 Census also played a role as New York lost a congressional seat after the decennial count.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It might have been so much easier to move away from this community and represent a different part of the city,” Nadler, 75, said at a victory party on the Upper West Side. “I have lived here for my entire adult life, I love the people of this community and what they represent. Why would I want to be any place else?”\n\n\n\nNadler, who twice played key roles in impeaching former President Trump, thanked Maloney for her “decades of service to our city.” The congresswoman rose to prominence in the fight to win health care benefits for Sept. 11 first responders (The Hill).\n\n\n\n▪ The New York Times: Nadler defeated Maloney in one of several bitter primaries being decided in New York.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Democrat Pat Ryan wins bellwether special election for New York House seat previously occupied by New York Lt.

Ron DeSantis (R) in November.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCrist, who lost a Senate bid as an independent in 2010 and a gubernatorial campaign four years later as a Democrat, won 60 percent of the vote. Fried, the lone Democratic statewide office holder who has been considered an up-and-coming candidate, was backed by only 35 percent of Sunshine State Democrats.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCelebrating his win, Crist on Tuesday night took a swipe at DeSantis’ widely assumed 2024 hopes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Our fundamental freedoms are literally on the ballot my friends. A woman’s right to choose: on the ballot. Democracy: on the ballot. Your rights as minorities are on this ballot. That’s what’s at stake in this election,” he said. “Make no mistake about it because this guy wants to be president of the United States of America and everybody knows it.

That claim was denied by the Archives after consulting with the Justice Department.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As the Department of Justice’s National Security Division explained to you on April 29, 2022: ‘There are important national security interests in the FBI and others in the Intelligence Community getting access to these materials. According to NARA, among the materials in the boxes are over 100 documents with classification markings, comprising more than 700 pages. Some include the highest levels of classification, including Special Access Program (SAP) materials,’” Steidel Wall wrote.\n\n\n\nTwenty more boxes of items were seized from Mar-a-Lago in the search this month. Included in that batch were four sets of top-secret documents and seven other sets that are deemed classified (The Washington Post).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs The Hill’s Rebecca Beitsch writes, Trump’s intransigence and refusal to turn over documents to the authorities could bolster the Justice Department’s case against the ex-president. In addition, it also raises the question once again of whether the delay in handing over the documents was harmful to national security.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ The New York Times: Trump, without the presidency’s protections, struggles for a strategy.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Judge gives Trump until Friday to clarify his request for a special master on records seized by the FBI.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Karl Rove: Trump legal problems dampening Republican “enthusiasm” ahead of midterms.\n\n\n\n▪ Axios: Sen. Rick Scott's (R-Fla.) ill-timed Italian vacation.\n\n\n\nTwo men were convicted Tuesday of a conspiracy to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D), marking a big win for the Justice Department in a second trial for the pair of criminals. Adam Fox and Barry Croft Jr., were also found guilty of attempting to obtain a weapon of mass destruction.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat weapon was a bomb intended to blow up a bridge in the event the kidnapping would have happened at Whitmer’s vacation home in an attempt to thwart police. Croft, 46, was also convicted of a separate explosives charge. In April, a jury was unable to reach a unanimous verdict, prompting the subsequent trial.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You can’t just strap on an AR-15 and body armor and go snatch the governor,” Assistant U.S. Attorney Nils Kessler told jurors (The Associated Press).\n\n\n\nPolitico: FBI Director Christopher Wray was hired to be boring. Now, he’s guiding the agency through threats and MAGA hate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES\n\n\n\n➤ ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n\nPresident Biden today is expected to announce his decision about student loan forgiveness, a judgment that will spark divisions within his party, invite harsh criticism from Republicans and put the White House on defensive hours before the president and first lady Jill Biden, an educator, launch an election-season drive at a Maryland high school on Thursday to gin up grassroots support for Democratic candidates.\n\n\n\nBiden has mulled for more than a year what is becoming a no-win announcement. In the end, sources say he has opted for a targeted plan of up to $10,000 in debt relief for borrowers whose incomes fall below a certain threshold, likely $125,000 per year, according to reporting by The Hill, CNN and other national news outlets. He will package that with another temporary extension of the current moratorium on student loan debt repayments, which expires in a week and was put in place by his predecessor at the outset of the pandemic.\n\n\n\nTaken together, the student debt relief will be a far cry from the $50,000 per borrower sought for years by progressives, a figure Biden said flatly during a town hall event last year was excessive and would not happen on his watch (USA Today).\n\n\n\n“My point is: I understand the impact of debt, and it can be debilitating,” Biden told his audience a month into his term. “I am prepared to write off the $10,000 debt but not $50 [thousand], because I don't think I have the authority to do it,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe issue does not cut cleanly along party lines with voters because many former middle- and lower-income students and their families signed loan documents for college and scrimped for years to pay off the debts. They say they would get no benefit retroactively if they have fulfilled those loans, no matter how much economic hardship they shouldered.\n\n\n\nEconomists argue over student debt forgiveness policies, believing that some beneficiaries choose expensive private schools, might not need the relief or could wind up seizing a windfall and spending it, which they argue could be inflationary. The Federal Reserve has reported that Americans owe about $1.75 trillion in student loan debt.\n\n\n\n▪ The Washington Post: After delay, Biden readies student loan help for millions.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Biden student loan plans caught in inflation debate crosshairs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Biden’s job approval rating is 41 percent in a new Reuters/Ipsos poll (not great but a slight summer improvement. The survey has a margin of error of plus or minus 4 points).\n\n\n\nThe Hill: More than halfway through his term, Biden is still relying on a handful of Trump appointees in critical government posts. Some in his party have complained about long-running vacancies in key jobs.\n\n\n\nThe Hill: As Biden and Democratic candidates continue to argue that gasoline prices have dropped for 70 consecutive days and that the U.S. economy and the labor market remain strong despite high inflation, many in both parties will be listening Friday at 10 a.m. ET as Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell speaks at a prominent economic forum in Wyoming. Will September’s rate hike by the central bank be as aggressive as its last two 75-basis-point decisions? Inquiring candidates, the president, economists, investors and business leaders are trying to figure out where monetary policy heads next.\n\n\n\nBloomberg News: Powell has a chance to reset market expectations at Jackson Hole.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOPINION\n\n\n\n■ Why I won’t be masking my kids this school year, by Leana S.

Only about two-thirds of eligible Americans have been inoculated with the primary series of two shots, and far fewer have received booster doses. Deaths per day have averaged close to 400 people this summer. Existing vaccines continue to provide strong protection against serious illness and death from infections with the coronavirus’s BA.5 version, according to public health officials, and many other Americans have contracted COVID-19, recovered and gained some immunity along the way.\n\n\n\nModerna on Tuesday said it asked the Food and Drug Administration for authorization of its reformulated COVID-19 booster shot for adults 18 and older, which targets the BA.5 omicron subvariant. Moderna followed a similar request filed by Pfizer on Monday. The jab would be for individuals age 18 and older (NBC News).\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post: The Cayman Islands allows unvaccinated travelers to return.\n\n\n\nOverall life expectancy in the U.S. dropped by 1.8 years from 2019 to 2020, according to a new National Vital Statistics report. The decline affected all 50 states and Washington, D.C., ranging from 0.2 years in some states to as many as 3 years in New York. The dip is attributed to COVID-19 and an uptick in drug overdose deaths, marking the largest year-to-year change in more than 75 years. Following New York’s 3-year decrease is Washington D.C., which saw life expectancy fall by 2.7 years (The Hill).\n\n\n\nThe Hill: Here are the states with the largest declines in life expectancy.\n\n\n\nA new, fatal case of Ebola was confirmed in the Congolese city of Beni, the nation’s ministry of health announced Monday, linking it to a previous outbreak. Congo’s dense tropical forests are a natural reservoir for the deadly virus, which causes fever, body aches and diarrhea. The country has recorded 14 outbreaks since 1976. The 2018-2020 spread involved nearly 3,500 total cases, and the virus killed 66 percent of those infected. Since then, vaccines and monoclonal antibody treatments have proved effective against the virus where populations have access, according to the World Health Organization (The Associated Press).\n\n\n\nTotal U.S. coronavirus deaths reported as of this morning, according to Johns Hopkins University (trackers all vary slightly): 1,041,491. Current average U.S. COVID-19 daily deaths are 387, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\n➤ TECH\n\n\n\nIn an explosive whistleblower complaint filed last monthwith the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission and obtained by The Washington Post, former Twitter security chief Peiter “Mudge” Zatko alleges the company misled regulators about lax security that opened the platform to embarrassing hacks, including the commandeering of accounts held by such high-profile users as Elon Musk, former President Obama and Trump.\n\n\n\nThe complaint has potential implications for Twitter’s legal battle with Musk, who is trying to get out of a $44 billion contract to buy the social media platform. The deal includes a pledge by Twitter that its shareholder filings are accurate.\n\n\n\nZatko also alleged the company prioritized user growth over reducing spam. Executives stood to win individual bonuses of as much as $10 million tied to increases in daily users, the complaint asserts, and nothing explicitly for cutting spam.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwitter denied the allegations, saying Zatko was fired 15 months ago “for poor performance and leadership.” The Post said it obtained a copy of the disclosure from a senior Democratic aide on Capitol Hill after a redacted version of the 84-page filing went to congressional committees.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill: Twitter whistleblower adds fuel to Musk's allegations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmazon is in the news because of heightened consumer privacy concerns tied to its expansion plans. The company announced it will spend billions of dollars in two gigantic acquisitions, one in health care and one in iRobot (maker of the Roomba vacuum), which if approved would expand its data collection and intimate impact on the lives of consumers (The Associated Press). For example, the newest Roombas include sensors that map and remember the floor plans of residences.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE CLOSER\n\n\n\nAnd finally … 🇺🇦 ⚽On Tuesday, the Ukrainian soccer league started its new season in an empty, 65,500-seat Olympic stadium in Kyiv after a poignant ceremony paying tribute to those fighting in the war with Russia. Ahead of Independence Day today, large crowds are banned and the country is under martial law.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a defiant gesture of Ukraine’s search for regular life, two teams from the war-torn east, Shaktar Donetsk and Metalist 1925, competed to a draw without the cheers and revelry of spectators. It was the first top-level soccer match played in the country since Russia’s invasion (The Associated Press).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay Engaged\n\n\n\nWe want to hear from you!

        "description": "The Girl Scouts website calls Raspberry Rally a &quot;thin, crispy cookie infused with raspberry flavor and dipped in chocolaty coating.&quot;Girl Scouts of the USAA new Girl Scout cookie has joined the lineup. Meet Raspberry Rally, which is being called the sister of the iconic Thin Mint. Or is it a challenger?&quot;We hope that we&#x27;ll hear some healthy competition from folks – maybe a little Thin Mint-Raspberry Rally battle,&quot; Wendy Lou, the chief revenue officer of Girl Scouts of the United States of America, told NPR. Usually, Girl Scouts launches a cookie with a new design, totally unlike its predecessors. Reimagining a cookie with an existing format is something new for them, Lou said. But while the Raspberry Rally may be comparable to a Thin Mint, Girl Scouts still had to develop its flavor and internal color.From concept to production, it takes about two years to debut a new Girl Scout Cookie. Girl Scouts of the United States of America, or GSUSA, first conduct market research and receive input from Girl Scout troops and cookie fans for ideas. The company also researches consumer trends to see what&#x27;s popular. Because berry flavors are currently popular, Lou said, they realized a raspberry cookie could be a hit.After the research stage, GSUSA tests their leading ideas with Girl Scout Cookie lovers. Once the organization learns what catches fans&#x27; interest, it works with its bakers to work on the flavor and develop a recipe.&quot;It&#x27;s a little bit light and a little bit sweet, but not overwhelming [...] You feel like you can eat 20 of them,&quot; Lou said.Raspberry Rally is online-exclusive, and can be ordered through a Girl Scout.Girl Scouts of the USAThen, the new cookie goes through the naming process, as well as final tests with an advisory group of Girl Scouts from across the country to make sure it&#x27;s scout-approved. They helped choose Raspberry Rally as the winner.The Girl Scout&#x27;s slogan this year is &quot;Ready, set, rally!&quot; The annual event each troop holds to kick off their cookie season is called a rally, but the word &quot;rally&quot; is also intended to celebrate the spirit of the community that comes together to support Girl Scouts, Lou said.The Raspberry Rally will be available exclusively online during the local cookie season, alongside the rest of the Girl Scout Cookie lineup. The season varies across the country, but typically falls between January and April. The profits from cookie sales stay local, according to the Girl Scouts&#x27; website, and fund activities and community projects for each troop.Lots of other cookies were in the running, but Lou said she can&#x27;t share what they were, as Girl Scouts may end up making them another year. In the last couple of years, Girl Scouts has been releasing a new cookie annually, and Lou said it&#x27;s still up in the air how long this one will be around. Copyright 2022 NPR.

I went to Bosnia in 2001, Afghanistan in 2003, Iraq in 2005, Iraq in 2007. And then [Iraq] again in 2010,&quot; he says, &quot;My body was ... the &#x27;check engine&#x27; light came on.&quot;He moved home to the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in northeastern Montana, but things didn&#x27;t calm down for him right away. He got on the Assiniboine and Sioux Tribal Council there, and even went to Washington, D.C., to testify before the Senate about VA care for Native vets. He was invited to serve as one of 15 vets on the first-ever VA Secretary&#x27;s Advisory Committee on Tribal and Indian Affairs. That was around the time he realized that he&#x27;d been trying to help his people without taking the time to help himself.&quot;I guess I&#x27;ve been so busy ... getting out of the military diagnosed with PTSD myself, I haven&#x27;t been able to seek care,&quot; he recalls.And when he tried to get the care, he says, it wasn&#x27;t easy.Native veteran Gerald Jackson lost both of his legs to diabetes. With the help of Jestin Dupree, Jackson travels five hours to Billings, Mont., where the nearest VA hospital is located.Sarah Mosquera for NPRJestin Dupree regularly visits Native veteran Gerald Jackson. Dupree often helps Jackson run errands such as grocery shopping, depositing checks and attending appointments at the VA hospital.Sarah Mosquera for NPRA memorial dedicated to the Assiniboine and Sioux veterans who have served in the U.S. military from the Fort Peck Indian Reservation.Sarah Mosquera for NPRAccording to the Department of Veterans Affairs, American Indians and Alaska Natives serve in the military at proportional rates higher than any other group, but they often have trouble accessing care because VA facilities are far away or backlogged. It took Dupree six months to get an appointment, he says, and when he did, the therapist wasn&#x27;t a vet, he wasn&#x27;t Native, and it didn&#x27;t go well.&quot;My first time actually opening up with mental health. Being through these countries I&#x27;ve been through and being through these situations, a lot of my friends have killed themselves that I&#x27;ve deployed with,&quot; he says, &quot;To hear a guy who&#x27;s never been through what I&#x27;ve been through, tell me, you know, to me, it was like, he&#x27;s brushing it off.&quot;Studies show Native vets have higher incidence of PTSD — and Dupree says there&#x27;s still a strong stigma around getting help with mental health. That first bad experience was enough to put him off.&quot;They had called me four days after, and I said, &#x27;You know what? Do me a favor, lose my number. Don&#x27;t ever call me again. I don&#x27;t feel comfortable talking to you guys,&#x27; &quot; he says.What did make Dupree feel better was helping other veterans. He took a job with the tribal government checking on the vets who live all over the reservation, which stretches for 90 miles along U.S. Route 2 in northeastern Montana.&quot;Life&#x27;s a little slower, but in turn, I enjoy going to meet these other veterans. A lot of &#x27;em don&#x27;t know the help that&#x27;s available for them,&quot; says Dupree.Some days Dupree is driving vets to their appointments at the VA in Billings, Mont., — about 10 hours round trip, and that&#x27;s in the summer, when it&#x27;s not snowing. Other days, he just makes his rounds, checking in on older vets who don&#x27;t have cellphones or internet. And some vets he likes to visit because it&#x27;s fun for him — like Kenneth Ryan, the former tribal chairman.Native veteran Jestin Dupree spends many hours driving around, visiting elderly veterans to help them run errands or attend appointments at the VA hospital in Billings, Mont., five hours away.Sarah Mosquera for NPRJestin Dupree was born in Poplar, Mont., on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation but left to serve in the U.S. Army from 1998 to 2014. He eventually returned to the reservation when his daughter called him and said, &quot;Dad, I want you to move home now.&quot;Sarah Mosquera for NPRAssiniboine tribal member Kenneth Ryan sings a traditional warrior song about going to war. &quot;You cannot be a leader in your community, until you&#x27;ve seen battle,&quot; Ryan says.Sarah Mosquera for NPR&quot;You can&#x27;t become a leader of your tribe until you&#x27;ve gone to war,&quot; Ryan said, explaining why Natives serve in such high numbers.Ryan joined the Army in 1965, to be a paratrooper. Instead, the Army decided he was too good at typing and made him do clerical work. That was hard, because Ryan wasn&#x27;t sure he was truly fulfilling the warrior tradition. But his elders told him he had.&quot;They called you and you went, you didn&#x27;t say no. And you would&#x27;ve done anything they had you do,&quot; he says.Veterans are honored at tribal ceremonies and celebrations — and Ryan says he was welcomed home with a song.&quot;Well they sang that song for me. So that&#x27;s how I&#x27;m — I&#x27;m a veteran. And I&#x27;m one of the most privileged men in the whole world,&quot; Ryan says.Jestin Dupree says helping veterans access their VA benefits and filling in the gaps in VA care on the reservation is his new mission.\n&quot;Like, if I wasn&#x27;t doing anything today, I would go check on every single one of &#x27;em,&quot; he says.\nNative veteran Jestin Dupree raises and lowers the American flag every day near the Native Veteran Memorial in the heart of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation.Sarah Mosquera for NPRCopyright 2022 NPR.

Pelosi was sentenced to five days in jail for a DUI that happened May 28, 2022, in Napa County, California.Andrew Harnik/APPaul Pelosi, the husband of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, has been sentenced to five days in jail after being convicted Tuesday of misdemeanor driving under the influence in California, the Napa County District Attorney&#x27;s Office announced. Pelosi, 82, was arrested May 28 and later charged with driving under the influence and causing injury — &quot;based upon an automobile collision,&quot; the DA said — and having a blood alcohol level above 0.08 percent. The latter charge was dismissed after Pelosi entered a guilty plea. Pelosi has already served two days, and will not have to stay in jail for two of the days due to good behavior, according to court records. He must also serve three years of probation and pay $4,927 in victim restitution for medical bills and lost wages. Pelosi did not appear in court for his sentencing, as it is not required by California law, unless mandated by a judge. Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "Maxwell Frost speaks during a March For Our Lives Florida drive-in rally and aid event at Tinker Field in Orlando on March 26, 2021.Orlando Sentinel/TNSProgressive activist Maxwell Frost, one of the first members of Generation Z to run for Congress, has won his Democratic primary, according to a race call by The Associated Press. Frost&#x27;s win nearly secures his path to Congress since the Orlando-based seat is considered a solidly Democratic district. Frost will face off against Republican Calvin Wimbish in November. &quot;Today&#x27;s election is proof that Central Florida&#x27;s working families want representation that has the courage to ask for more,&quot; Frost said in a statement. &quot;I share this victory with the nurses, forklift drivers, teachers, caregivers, social workers, farmers, union organizers, cashiers, and other members of this vibrant community who supported this campaign.&quot;At 25 years old, Frost just qualifies for the age requirement to serve in the U.S. House. The 2022 midterms mark the first election where members of Generation Z can run for congressional office. The Pew Research Center considers anyone born between 1997 and 2012 to be Gen Z. Frost campaigned on key progressive issues, including Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, student debt cancelation and an end to gun violence. He first became involved in political organizing in 2012 while in high school following the mass shooting in Newtown, Conn. He&#x27;s also spoken publicly about surviving a separate incident of gun violence. &quot;Our generation has been born into a lot of trauma and a lot of civil unrest around people being frustrated with things. And I think because of that, our generation naturally thinks about things in a bit of a different way,&quot; Frost told NPR.The former March for Our Lives national organizing director and ACLU activist beat out a crowded field of nine other competitors, including state Sen. Randolph Bracy and former Florida Reps. Corrine Brown and Alan Grayson. Frost also topped his competitors in fundraising while racking up key national endorsements from progressive leaders, including Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. In an interview with NPR, Frost acknowledged that age plays a symbolic role in his campaign.  &quot;Yes we march, yes we engage in mutual aid, yes we engage on social media, and now we&#x27;re running for office because we believe that we are prepared to be in the rooms and to be the voice for our communities and we can do that and young people should be allowed,&quot; he said.

        "description": "Ahead of his first solo album, the xx’s musician opens up about queerness, his love for horror baddies, and why he is finally a believer in sharing – in real life and in musicFew indie musicians have made the kind of impact on pop music that Oliver Sim has. With the xx, the band he founded as a teenager with Romy Madley Croft and Jamie xx, Sim has won a Mercury prize, topped the UK album charts twice and played on some of the biggest stages in the world. Meanwhile, the xx’s distinctive, minimalist take on R&amp;B and indie-pop was infiltrating the mainstream: by the mid-2010s, you could hear fragments of their musical DNA in songs by Rihanna, Beyoncé and Drake.In September, Sim becomes the last member of the band to step out as a solo artist with Hideous Bastard, an album of ragged, off-kilter pop and post-punk that explores queerness, masculinity and shame. Featuring vocals from Bronski Beat’s Jimmy Somerville on opener Hideous – which deals with Sim’s HIV diagnosis at 17 – and production from Jamie xx throughout, it’s an album that, refreshingly, elides the empowerment/self-hatred binary that many pop records from LGBTQ+ artists seem pressured to fit into.

        "description": "Troxy, LondonBacked by his Freedom Band, songs are attacked with gleeful venom, the relentlessly inventive frontman repeatedly striking gold with his haywire impulsesIt’s a brazen move to open a set before an audience expecting a rock’n’roll show with a brace of space-folk strums. But while audience chatter and the voices of the bar staff occasionally threaten to drown out Californian garage-psychedelicist Ty Segall and sideman Emmett Kelly, the sulphurous magic they conjure on their acoustic guitars can’t be smothered. If a certain wilfulness seems to guide Segall tonight, it’s more than balanced out by how often his haywire impulses strike gold. The haunted Haight-Ashbury madrigals of Good Morning and heavy comedown vibes of Californian Hills are darkly mystical folk, while the Beatles-go-country charm of Orange Color Queen showcases songwriting chops unabashedly immersed in the classics.Nevertheless, deafening cheers do greet the arrival of Segall’s Freedom Band colleagues, and the plugging in of their amplifiers. However, the primal, concise garage-pop nuggets on which Segall surfed to cult status are mostly absent tonight, replaced by squalling, heavy rock marathons. A power quintet with twin lead guitars, and keyboardist Ben Boye lending a proggy undertow, the Freedom Band play loud and they play long (like their hair). Crucially, they transcend mere 70s revivalism by the gleeful venom with which they attack these songs, and the way the restlessly inventive Segall laces even the gnarliest of riff-outs with pop stardust. While a couple of the sludgier tunes might aim for gold but score only grunge, the lysergic biker-rock of Hello, Hi is transformed into glorious powerpop by its acid harmonies and McCartney-esque flourishes, while Alta’s languid swing between spaced-out Grateful Dead jamming and colossal, slow-building crescendos lends it a cosmic, epic vibe.

Continuing their history of tackling political issues – 1988’s breakthrough album, Sunshine on Leith, featured songs outlining their stance on Scottish nationalism – it’s a record that touches on everything from the weaponising of nostalgia to the bubble of modern life. Recorded in Wales and produced by long-term Manic Street Preachers producer Dave Eringa, it features that band’s James Dean Bradfield on a handful of tracks.Dentures Out should continue the Reid twins’ recent creative and commercial success, with each of their last five albums landing inside the UK Top 40 and Scottish Top 5. Known to most people as the bespectacled hitmakers behind 1987’s Letter from America and, of course, 1988’s wedding reception favourite I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles), the pair have chalked up hits in the UK, Australia and the US – where I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles) belatedly peaked at No 3 after appearing in 1993 romcom, Benny &amp; Joon. Its longevity was also assisted by a Comic Relief version that hit No 1 in the UK in 2007. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Foreign actors are waging a digital war on the backbone of the U.S. economy. The SolarWinds cyberattack, perpetrated by Russian hackers and undiscovered until nine months after it occurred, was a digital intrusion that had no precedent in our nation’s history. The hackers wormed their way into key federal agencies including the departments of State, Energy, Defense, Treasury and Justice.\n\n\n\nThe federal government was far from the only victim of SolarWinds. In Arizona, Ohio, California and Texas, the hackers targeted everything from state hospitals to prominent universities. The intruders were inside these computer systems for months — and we didn’t know the scale of the damage until long after the intrusion. With a different backdrop, cyber espionage of this magnitude would merit around-the-clock coverage.\n\n\n\nBut this attack was discovered amid social upheaval around a fraught presidential election and a raging pandemic. A computer breach of the nation’s most sensitive agencies in that crowded context took a backseat.\n\n\n\nCyber threats are not aimed solely at large companies; smaller operations face danger, too. Recently, Brandon Wales, executive director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), voiced concern about potential vulnerabilities: “[Smaller communications entities] should not assume that they’re … not in the crosshairs of a more sophisticated nation state.” Wales noted that smaller companies could give malicious cyber actors a foothold in the nation’s larger critical service operations.\n\n\n\nAn influx of federal funding for new broadband networks across the country is headed toward local governments, but this won’t significantly decrease the risk for community networks — municipalities are unlikely to spend the funds to prevent a modest community network from becoming a weak link that invites cybercrime.\n\n\n\nLocal governments are good at many things, but asking them to understand how to keep local networks safe and protect connections to the nation’s internet infrastructure is a stretch. Cybersecurity plans deserve more scrutiny at every level — especially given the possibility of local weaknesses in our network fabrics via government-owned and -operated broadband networks that often lack the tools to detect cyber intrusions.\n\n\n\nGovernment-owned networks (GONs) were not a sound plan even before SolarWinds or the ransomware attacks that took down Colonial Pipeline and JBS Foods. For decades, municipal governments have tried and failed to build local broadband networks that provide community internet access. In nearly every case, the GONs failed to draw enough subscribers and taxpayers were left with a steep bill. The only winners were expensive broadband consultants who saw an opportunity to collect federal grant dollars for network buildout by persuading local leaders that their proposals would bring cheaper, faster internet. It’s hardly feasible for a municipality to build a local network; it’s even less likely they’ll spend the funds to maintain and secure it.\n\n\n\nGONs’ poor economic track record, along with the need for improved cyber awareness, should have convinced the Biden administration that spending billions of dollars on municipal broadband operations would create numerous weak points in our network backbone. SolarWinds proved that federal agencies, with their massively funded cybersecurity programs, are still challenged with the remit to protect themselves from digital breaches.\n\n\n\nWhat confidence can citizens have that a town, city or state, with a locally built and run internet network, isn’t equally or more vulnerable?\n\n\n\nConsider also how hackers fooled a top-tier Department of Homeland Security (DHS) system into believing their hacks were ordinary computer activity in 2015. What hope is there, then, for a GON in a city like Knoxville, Tenn., which already suffered a ransomware attack and whose entire budget is less than 0.9 percent of that of the DHS? And yet, egged on by the Biden administration and consultants, Knoxville is flirting with running its own broadband system. Estimates suggest the network will take seven years to build — hardly the faster, cheaper internet option citizens have been promised by their city officials.\n\n\n\nCommercial broadband providers, on the other hand, spend tens of billions of dollars annually to keep things running safely. They invest heavily in network security, pay hundreds of professionals to guard their network operations, and endlessly brainstorm ways to protect customers’ information.\n\n\n\nWe should build on what the COVID-19 work-from-home period has taught us: that our networks work extraordinarily well. Rather than overbuilding duplicative networks in areas that already have good broadband coverage, the state should partner with the private sector to close coverage gaps and build secure networks that give new internet users safe access. There is almost no question that the size and nature of these cyber threats will continue to escalate. We need to strengthen our network defenses — not build new, defenseless networks.\n\n\n\nShane Tews is a nonresident senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, where she focuses on cybersecurity issues and emerging technologies.

You can (partly) thank Boris JohnsonIf you’ve walked through redeveloped parts of London recently you may have noticed an eerily similar type of building. Every edge is so crisp and flat that staring at it face-on gives you the weird sensation the world has temporarily turned 2D. This single style has emerged as the hegemonic default for housing developments in London. Dubbed New London Vernacular (NLV), it has three key markers: lots of brick, deep-set portrait windows and flat facades. The name is utilitarian, to match its attitude: new London to mark its age and location, and vernacular to describe its defining purpose, which is to speak broadly the same dialect as some of the capital’s most valuable properties.NLV is catnip to planners, who have had to abide by the London Housing Design Guide since 2010. This guide spells out exactly what the NLV should be: “great background architecture”. It came from the desk of the then mayor of London, Boris Johnson, whose mark on the face of London’s contemporary housing stock will long outlive the expensive wallpaper on the walls of No 10. Developers are drawn to the discretion offered by NLV because everything from a studio flat to a penthouse can be slotted into these facades, meaning they can appeal to a variety of buyers.

Labor demand is still historically strong, offering only faint signs of cooling. There are nearly two job openings for every unemployed person seeking work. That means many workers who are losing their jobs are quickly landing jobs. Some are even weighing multiple offers and accepting positions that pay more and better align with their skills.”",

        "description": "You’ll be surprised at the burst of flavour you can get from this thrifty Tuscan soup made mainly with tomatoes and bread“As its name implies,” the Milan-born Anna del Conte explains in her book of northern Italian food, this Tuscan tomato soup “is like a pap you give to babies”. Pap doesn’t sound very appetising, though, so “bread soup” is perhaps slightly sexier, but, to be honest, bread and tomato porridge would be more accurate. Whatever you call it (and I’d advise sticking to the Italian), it’s a regional classic and a surprisingly pleasing way to use up both over- or underripe tomatoes and stale bread – a simple, thrifty marriage of good ingredients that makes a lovely late summer or early autumn lunch or supper. Oh, and it happens to be vegan, too. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Justin Verlander was totally fine leaving with a no-hitter intact after six innings against the Minnesota Twins on Tuesday night.“I like to go deep in games in the regular season, but I’d rather do it in the postseason or at least be fresh and strong for that,&quot; the Houston ace said.Verlander posted his major league-leading 16th win and the Astros beat the Minnesota Tuesday night in Carlos Correa’s return to Houston.Verlander (16-3) allowed just one runner to reach base — Nick Gordon struck out in the second inning on a wild pitch to get aboard. Verlander fanned 10 and lowered his MLB-best ERA to 1.87 in his spectacular return after missing almost two seasons after Tommy John surgery.Manager Dusty Baker said Verlander was on a pitch limit of 90 Tuesday as the Astros transition from a six to five-man rotation. But he still asked Verlander if he wanted to keep going since he hadn&#x27;t allowed a hit.“After six innings at ... 91 pitches, you know it’s not going to be one of those nights,&quot; Verlander said. “Maybe 15 years ago, 10 years ago when I loved throwing 130-something. But not now and specifically not after Tommy John in my first season back.&quot;The 39-year-old Verlander was pulled after 91 pitches. He is the only active player to have thrown three no-hitters — in May, he lost a no-hit try against the Twins in the eighth inning at Target Field.Ryne Stanek relieved to begin the seventh and Correa led off with Minnesota&#x27;s first hit.“I didn’t want to get no-hit on the first game back, so I had to drop that one in there,&quot; Correa said.Alex Bregman&#x27;s homer helped the AL West-leading Astros build a 4-0 lead. The Twins scored twice in the ninth and had the bases loaded before Bryan Abreu struck out Jake Cave to end it.The Twins lost their fourth straight in a night of struggles at the plate that came after they placed All-Star outfielder Byron Buxton on the injured list with a hip strain. Until their late rally, the most noise Minnesota made came when manager Rocco Baldelli was ejected during an animated argument.Correa, making his first visit to Houston after leaving the Astros to sign with the Twins this offseason, received a huge ovation when honored during a pregame ceremony where he was presented with his AL Championship ring. The crowd reaction was also huge in his first at-bat in the first inning and the star shortstop tipped his batting helmet to the adoring fans before stepping in the box.The reaction wasn’t nearly as warm when he broke up the Astros&#x27; combined no-hit bid with a liner to center field that a diving Mauricio Dubón couldn’t corral. That was the only hit for Correa, who was selected first overall by the Astros in 2012 and spent his first seven seasons in Houston.Jose Miranda hit an RBI single with one out in the Twins ninth. There were two outs when Max Kepler&#x27;s run-scoring single cut the lead to 4-2 and chased Hector Neris. He was replaced by Abreu, who walked Gio Urshela to load the bases but fanned Cave for his second save.Dubón gave Houston the lead with an RBI single in the second inning and Trey Mancini made it 2-0 with his run-scoring double in the fourth. Bregman’s 18th homer this season was a two-run shot in the seventh.Yordan Alvarez added a single for the Astros on a night his family from Cuba got to see him play professionally for the first time. Father Agustín Eduardo Álvarez Salazar, mother Mailyn Cadogan Reyes and brother Yonder Alvarez Cadogan — each decked out in his jersey — gazed wide-eyed at the field as they watched him step to the plate.“This is one of my biggest moments in my entire life,” his father told The Associated Press in Spanish through a translator. “And I could be able to say so many words, but the truth is that there are no words to express what I’m feeling right now.”Alvarez was moved to know how special it was for his parents to finally see him play after being away from them for so long.“It means everything,&quot; he said in Spanish through a translator. “Obviously, when I came into the United States it was not easy. And when I arrived here, I arrived by myself. I knew I had their support, but obviously they weren’t here.&quot;Things got testy in the fifth when Twins starter Aaron Sanchez (0-1) plunked Jose Altuve on the left thigh. There was some jawing between Altuve and Sanchez and benches cleared, but there wasn’t any pushing or shoving.Order was soon restored, but after Yuli Gurriel walked on four pitches, Baldelli came out of the dugout yelling at the umpires. He was soon ejected by first base umpire Todd Tichenor, but that didn’t stop him from screaming and gesturing wildly for a couple more minutes before leaving the field.Baldelli said he was upset because believes he was charged with a visit to the mound when he went to try and calm down Sanchez and wasn&#x27;t properly informed of it.“At the bare minimum I think there’s probably it’s necessary for someone to come over and let us know that a visit was given,&quot; he said. “So that’s it. I disagreed and I disagreed on multiple levels.&quot;Tichenor said Baldelli should have known that he had been charged with a visit.“The mound visit constitutes the manager going on top of the mound and talking to the pitcher, that’s a visit. Or a coach,&quot; Tichenor said. “That’s a visit.&quot;Sanchez, who was the starter in a combined no-hitter for the Astros in 2019 against Seattle, yielded six hits and two runs in four-plus innings after being called up from Triple-A Tuesday.Trainer’s roomTwins: OF Kyle Garlick (bruised rib cage) is scheduled to begin a rehabilitation assignment at Triple-A St. Paul Wednesday. He is set to be the team’s designated hitter Wednesday before playing in the outfield Thursday. Moving upVerlander&#x27;s big night moved him past Pedro Martinez (3,154) and Max Scherzer (3,157) and into 13th place on the all-time strikeout list with 3,161.Uvalde strongMayah Zamora, who spent 66 days in the hospital as a victim of the Uvalde elementary school shooting, threw out the ceremonial first pitch. Zamora got to meet Correa before the game, and his foundation along with several other charities worked together to find alternative lodging for her family while they build them a new home.The foundation began work to get Zamora a new home after she learned that the shooter, who wounded her and killed 19 students and two teachers, lived just blocks from her home where she was too upset to return to after leaving the hospital.Up nextHouston’s Framber Valdez (12-4, 2.72) opposes Dylan Bundy (7-5, 4.60) when the series continues Wednesday night.",

        "description": "For each home run the Mets hit during the month of September, we are donating money to the National Domestic Violence Hotline, concurrent with a raffle event at EBBS at Citi Field on September 17. It’s that time of year again, Amazin’ Avenue community! It is time for A Pod of Their Own’s fourth annual Dollars For Dingers fundraiser! As always, all proceeds will go to the National Domestic Violence Hotline (@ndvh), a cause A Pod of Their Own cares about deeply.\nEach year we ask that our listeners pledge money for every dinger the Mets hit in the final month of the season. There is also a section for bonus pledges if you would like to add an extra incentive. Last year, we had bonuses for dingers from our favorite players, grand slams, strikeouts, manager ejections, lost earrings, shirtless walk-offs, and Busch Lites. Be as creative as you want. The only limit is your imagination! If you are interested in making a pledge add your name (first names or nicknames are fine), contact info (social media handles or emails are fine), and pledge amount to this Google doc and we will keep track of the tally. It is never too late to get involved; you can make a pledge any time before the end of the month-long fundraiser!\nIt is also not limited to the Mets or the National Domestic Violence Hotline. Your donation could be based on how many dingers another team hits or the money could go to a local women’s shelter of your choosing.\nWe will also be raising funds for the National Domestic Violence Hotline via an in-person raffle event. This year we are overjoyed to announce that Dollars 4 Dingers has returned to Citi Field. Our raffle event will be held Saturday, September 17th at 4:00pm at EBBS at Citi Field. \nWe will have a ton of fun prizes to raffle off the day of the event which will wrap up before first pitch of that evening’s Mets game against the Pirates—which is the Gary Cohen bobblehead giveaway, by the way! So, if you have tickets to the game, do not fear; you won’t miss a single pitch! But, you are also free to stick around at EBBS and watch the game with your fellow Mets fans after the event. \nOver the past three years we have raised over $25,000 for charity and we hope to make Dollars for Dingers 2022 the biggest year yet! We greatly appreciate the overwhelming support for Dollars For Dingers this community gives us every year. From the bottom of our hearts, we thank you.\nLFGM and let’s hit some dingers!",

Moscow could install a puppet government.”\n\n\n\n“That was the Kremlin’s plan.”\n\n\n\n“Instead, what transpired in and around Kyiv in the ensuing 36 days would represent the biggest foreign blunder in the 22-year rule of Russian President Vladimir Putin. His assault on the city instantly reordered the security architecture of Europe against Moscow and isolated his nation to a degree unseen since the Cold War. To the surprise of the world, the offensive against the Ukrainian capital would end in a humiliating retreat, which would expose deep systemic problems in a Russian military he had spent billions to rebuild.”",

        "description": "Lack of sleep blunts our generosity, research finds.\nLack of sleep is known to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, depression, diabetes, hypertension, and overall mortality. However, new discoveries show that a lack of sleep also impairs our basic social conscience, making us withdraw our desire and willingness to help other people.\n&#8220;When people lose one hour of sleep, there&#8217;s a clear hit on our innate human kindness&#8230;&#8221;\nIn one portion of the new study, the scientists showed that charitable giving in the week after the beginning of  daylight saving time, when residents of most states &#8220;spring forward&#8221; and lose one hour of their day, dropped by 10%—a decrease not seen in states that do not change their clocks or when states return to standard time in the fall.\nThe study, led by research scientist Eti Ben Simon and professor of psychology Matthew Walker, both of the University of California, Berkeley, adds to a growing body of evidence demonstrating that inadequate sleep not only harms the mental and physical well-being of an individual, but also compromises the bonds between individuals—and even the altruistic sentiment of an entire nation.\n&#8220;Over the past 20 years, we have discovered a very intimate link between our sleep health and our mental health. Indeed, we&#8217;ve not been able to discover a single major psychiatric condition in which sleep is normal,&#8221; Walker says. &#8220;But this new work demonstrates that a lack of sleep not only damages the health of an individual, but degrades social interactions between individuals and, furthermore, degrades the very fabric of human society itself. How we operate as a social species—and we are a social species—seems profoundly dependent on how much sleep we are getting.&#8221;\n&#8220;We&#8217;re starting to see more and more studies, including this one, where the effects of sleep loss don&#8217;t just stop at the individual, but propagate to those around us,&#8221; says Ben Simon. &#8220;If you&#8217;re not getting enough sleep, it doesn&#8217;t just hurt your own well-being, it hurts the well-being of your entire social circle, including strangers.&#8221;\nBen Simon, Walker, and colleagues Raphael Vallat and Aubrey Rossi report their results in the journal PLOS Biology. Walker is the director of the Center for Human Sleep Science. He and Ben Simon are members of the Helen Wills Neuroscience Institute at UC Berkeley.\nThe new report describes three separate studies that assessed the impact of sleep loss on people&#8217;s willingness to help others. In the first study, the scientists placed 24 healthy volunteers in a functional magnetic resonance imager (fMRI) to scan their brains after eight hours of sleep and after a night of no sleep. They found that areas of the brain that form the theory of mind network, which is engaged when people empathize with others or try to understand other people&#8217;s wants and needs, were less active after a sleepless night.\n&#8220;When we think about other people, this network engages and allows us to comprehend what other person&#8217;s needs are: What are they thinking about? Are they in pain? Do they need help?&#8221; Ben Simon says. &#8220;However, this network was markedly impaired when individuals were sleep deprived. It&#8217;s as though these parts of the brain fail to respond when we are trying to interact with other people after not getting enough sleep.&#8221;\nIn a second study, they tracked more than 100 people online over three or four nights. During this time, the researchers measured the quality of their sleep—how long they slept, how many times they woke up—and then assessed their desire to help others, such as holding an elevator door open for someone else, volunteering, or helping an injured stranger on the street.\n&#8220;Here, we found that a decrease in the quality of someone&#8217;s sleep from one night to the next predicted a significant decrease in the desire to help other people from one subsequent day to the next,&#8221; Ben Simon says. &#8220;Those with poor sleep the night prior were the ones that reported being less willing and keen to help others the following day.&#8221;\n&#8220;Sleep &#8230; is an incredible lubricant to prosocial, connected, empathic, kind, and generous human behavior.&#8221;\nThe third part of the study involved mining a database of 3 million charitable donations in the United States between 2001 and 2016. Did the number of donations change after the transition to daylight saving time and the potential loss of an hour of sleep? They found a 10% drop in donations. This same dent in compassionate gift-giving was not seen in regions of the country that did not change their clocks.\n&#8220;Even a very modest &#8216;dose&#8217; of sleep deprivation—here, just the loss of one single hour of sleep opportunity linked to daylight saving time—has a very measurable and very real impact on people&#8217;s generosity and, therefore, how we function as a connected society,&#8221; Walker says. &#8220;When people lose one hour of sleep, there&#8217;s a clear hit on our innate human kindness and our motivation to help other people in need.&#8221;\nAn earlier study by Walker and Ben Simon showed that sleep deprivation forced people to socially withdraw and become more socially isolated. A lack of sleep also increased their feelings of loneliness. Worse still, when those sleep-deprived individuals interacted with other people, they spread their loneliness to those other individuals, almost like a virus, Walker says.\n&#8220;Looking at the big picture, we&#8217;re starting to see that a lack of sleep results in a quite asocial and, from a helping perspective, anti-social individual, which has manifold consequences to how we live together as a social species,&#8221; he says. &#8220;A lack of sleep makes people less empathetic, less generous, more socially withdrawn, and it&#8217;s infectious—there is contagion of loneliness.&#8221;\n&#8220;The realization that the quantity and quality of sleep affects an entire society, caused by an impairment in prosocial behavior, may provide insights into our societal state of affairs in the present day,&#8221; Walker adds.\nThis finding also offers a novel approach to improving these specific aspects of our society.\n&#8220;Promoting sleep, rather than shaming people for sleeping enough, could very palpably help shape the social bonds we all experience every day,&#8221; Ben Simon says.\n&#8220;Sleep, it turns out, is an incredible lubricant to prosocial, connected, empathic, kind, and generous human behavior. In these divisive times, if there was ever a need for a strong, prosocial lubricant to enable the very best version of ourselves within society, now seems to be it,&#8221; says Walker, author of the international bestseller, Why We Sleep (Penguin Random House, 2017). &#8220;Sleep may be a wonderful ingredient that enables the alacrity of helping between human beings.&#8221;\n&#8220;Sleep is essential for all aspects of our physical, mental, and emotional lives,&#8221; Ben Simon says. &#8220;When sleep is undervalued in society, not only do we get sleep-deprived doctors, nurses, and students, but we also suffer from unkind and less empathic interactions on a daily basis.&#8221;\nIn developed countries, more than half of all people report getting insufficient sleep during the work week.\n&#8220;It is time as a society to abandon the idea that sleep is unnecessary or a waste and, without feeling embarrassed, start getting the sleep that we need,&#8221; she adds. &#8220;It is the best form of kindness we can offer ourselves, as well as the people around us.&#8221;\nSource: UC Berkeley\nThe post Just 1 hour of lost sleep saps our generosity appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "The U.S. military conducted precision airstrikes in Syria against Iran-backed groups at President Biden’s direction on Tuesday, U.S. Central Command announced.\n\n\n\nCol. Joe Buccino, U.S. Central Command’s communications director, said in a statement that the strikes targeted “infrastructure facilities” in the city of Deir ez-Zor, located in eastern Syria, used by groups affiliated with Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\n\n\n\n“Today’s strikes were necessary to protect and defend U.S. personnel,” said Buccino. “The United States took proportionate, deliberate action intended to limit the risk of escalation and minimize the risk of casualties.”\n\n\n\nThe strikes came days after Iran-backed groups fired rockets that landed in the vicinity of Syria’s Green Village base that housed U.S. troops.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNone of the troops were harmed in the attack, but Combined Joint Task Force-Operation Inherent Resolve officials said a separate rocket attack on Jan. 5 by Iran-backed groups damaged the base and a mosque nearby.\n\n\n\n“At President Biden’s direction, U.S. military forces conducted precision airstrikes in Deir ez-Zor Syria today,” said Buccino. “These precision strikes are intended to defend and protect U.S. forces from attacks like the ones on August 15 against U.S. personnel by Iran-backed groups.”\n\n\n\nBuccino added that Biden gave the order for the strikes under his Article II authority to protect U.S. personnel.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the White House for comment.\n\n\n\n“The United States does not seek conflict, but will continue to take necessary measures to protect and defend our people,” said Buccino.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. first sent ground troops to Syria in 2015 to combat the terrorist organization ISIS and back the Syrian Democratic Forces. Iran has backed Bashar al-Assad’s regime in Syria, at times leading to fighting between Iran and the U.S.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Iran and the U.S. have engaged in indirect negotiations for more than a year to restore the Iran nuclear deal, which would limit Iran’s nuclear ambitions to ease sanctions against the country.\n\n\n\nAs one point of contention in the negotiations, Iran has desired the U.S. remove the IRGC — which U.S. Central Command said supported groups that conducted the Aug. 15 strike — from its list of terrorist organizations, but the Biden administration reportedly has been hesitant to do so as part of a potential deal.",

        "description": "President Biden marked Ukraine’s Independence Day on Wednesday by announcing a nearly $3 billion security assistance package to bolster Kyiv as it battles the Russian invasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House announcement came as Ukraine braced for stepped-up attacks from Russia on the holiday, which also coincided with the six-month mark of the start of Moscow’s military campaign.\n\n\n\n“Over the past six months, Ukrainians have inspired the world with their extraordinary courage and dedication to freedom,” Biden said in a statement Wednesday morning announcing the $2.98 billion package of weapons and equipment for Ukraine. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They have stood resolute and strong in the face of Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine. And today is not only a celebration of the past, but a resounding affirmation that Ukraine proudly remains — and will remain — a sovereign and independent nation,” Biden continued. “The United States of America is committed to supporting the people of Ukraine as they continue the fight to defend their sovereignty.”  \n\n\n\nThe package represents the single largest tranche of U.S. assistance to Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion in February. Biden said it would allow Ukraine to obtain additional air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, drones, and radars.  \n\n\n\nUkraine officials and international diplomats were told to telework on Wednesday due to increased threats of Russian attacks. Kyiv also banned public Independence Day celebrations. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has sent billions in weapons and military equipment as well as economic and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine to help its forces battle the Russians and help address the effects of the war.\n\n\n\nThe latest funding comes from the nearly $40 billion bipartisan Ukraine assistance package that Congress approved earlier this spring.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. weapons have played a critical role in helping Ukrainian forces defend their territory against the Russian invasion. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Many people are saying we’re brave fighters, and that’s the truth — but we wouldn’t exist already if there was no support from the U.S. Literally, the U.S. saved and is saving Ukraine. It’s not a metaphor, it’s a clear truth,” Oleksii Arestovych Arestovych, an adviser to the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, told The Hill in an interview in Kyiv on Tuesday.  \n\n\n\nRussia failed early on in its goal of capturing the capital of Kyiv and has since shifted its focus to Ukraine’s east.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe trajectory of the war is unclear, and the White House has warned that it could drag on for months if not longer. Biden said in Wednesday’s statement that the latest assistance package would ensure Ukraine “can continue to defend itself over the long term.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLaura Kelly contributed reporting.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 8:28 a.m.&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/3608785-when-judges-sometimes-change-their-spots/",
        "description": "The iconic Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren was a grievous disappointment to his appointing president, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who famously called his selection “the biggest damned fool mistake I ever made.” \n\n\n\nBut Warren didn’t change his philosophy in how he chose to judge during a judicial career. In fact, he had never been a judge before Eisenhower nominated him. He quickly acclimated himself; for example, pushing the Supreme Court to unanimity in Brown v. Board of Education, and greatly enhancing the rights of criminal defendants. Warren had been a relatively conservative California attorney general and governor but somehow he morphed, for whatever reason, into a great liberal on the bench.\n\n\n\nCertainly, other justices have disappointed their nominating presidents or confirming senators who expected them to vote in particular ways on pivotal issues before them, only to later see them exhibit a different sense of purpose, or perhaps authority, in their idiosyncratic role as judges.\n\n\n\nMany judges who have sat on the Supreme Court or lower courts, though, indeed have changed — perhaps “evolved” in their thinking or worldview — after spending time observing, possibly examining, the ebb and flow of society’s travails. They may determine, even subconsciously, a need to consider a more personally “validating” role than they previously imagined for themselves, in order to somehow make society “a better place.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis process doesn’t occur in a specific moment in time, in which someone, particularly a judicial officer, “finds” himself or herself — and it may not be a reversal of one’s personal philosophy of judging at all. It may just be an unarticulated, evolving sense by the individual jurist that, as Justice Benjamin Cardozo brilliantly put it, “the great tides and currents which engulf the rest of men do not turn aside in their course and pass the judges by.”\n\n\n\nWithout an objective calculus made here of judges who have been “moved,” one hazards that the internal evolving or morphing that judges experience more often than not favors a more liberalized philosophy of judging. Why, though, has that happened? What inner voice motivates the changed orientation? And was it there before but submerged, or has it newly developed for some reason?\n\n\n\nThe questions I pose are inspired by a July 29, 2022, article by New York Times columnist David Brooks, titled, “How To Find Who You Are.” He loosely articulates — although not about judges — whether it is wise to sit in a room alone and focus on yourself to get in touch with “the real you” or to self-actualize the “real you.” Brooks posits that a person isn’t a closed system that can be studied in isolation: “A self exists only in relation to something else, while perceiving and interacting with the world.” \n\n\n\nThe writer sees us as mimetic creatures — imitators — who learn by imitating what “excellent others” have done before us. Brooks argues that sometimes even friends alone can stimulate man and open up sides of his nature that hitherto have been locked.\n\n\n\nThe Brooks analysis regarding “finding oneself” as applied to the evolving nature of some judges might seem apostasy — especially to the orthodoxy that believes that judges should simply follow precedent and reflexively leave to the executive and legislative branches of government the role of “doing good” or making society “better.” After all, despite what Cardozo says, should judges allow the needs of a changing society to impact decision-making and how they do their job? Consider that this would mean engaging with litigants with a conscious goal of deciding in favor of the good guy, even if the law unambiguously supports the bad guy or the unsympathetic side of the case he occupies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe evolving nature of the thinking processes of some judges may seem almost Darwinian-like — that judges almost begin their judicial career in a certain way to address cases, only to instinctively change along the continuum of their careers. For Brooks it might be like a rock musician who, as life continues, gradually strays from the strident tendencies of hard rock to a more becoming, “mature” sound — and greater meaning.\n\n\n\nPerhaps it’s simply a product of aging or the nurturing confidence accorded through tenure or communal recognition that help mold one’s music on the one hand, or legal judgments on the other — for the one using a guitar, the other using a gavel, to foster what he or she really wants to say or do, or wants to say or do now. For Brooks, it’s about how an artist or writer might “find oneself.” On the bench, it’s more directly about how a judge might re-find his or her role in a changing society, or how a “changed judge” even finds that the change lurks inside himself or herself and not somewhere else at all.\n\n\n\nJoel Cohen, who practices law at Stroock &amp; Stroock &amp; Lavan in New York, is a former member of the New York State Judicial Conduct Commission.

        "description": "After months of isolation and anxious about touring again, Ezra and two friends walk the length of the UK meeting musicians in an uplifting documentaryGeorge Ezra’s reputation as the nicest man in pop emerges intact from this easygoing documentary that follows his 95-day, 1,200 mile walk from Land’s End to John o’Groats. Striding out in box-fresh hiking boots, tent strapped to his rucksack, he’s joined by two old mates from his uni days in Bristol, Adam Scarborough and Christy Tattershall, who direct. (Though we never catch a glimpse of the support vehicle that presumably carried the acoustic guitar and fire pit.)It’s spring 2021. Ezra is anxious about touring again. After months of isolation, he wants to be back out in the world, but he’s nervous about returning to a punishing schedule. Sitting by a river in West Yorkshire, he tells Scarborough and Tattershall how unwell touring left him before the pandemic, emotionally and mentally drained. He describes breaking down in London on a rare day off, crying his eyes out trying to pull on a sock. Ezra is very good on mental health.

        "description": "Police at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport say they’ve found the family of an infant girl who turned up with a woman at one of the airport&#x27;s light rail stations. Authorities said the girl, believed to be about 10 months old, was found about 9 p.m. Sunday with a woman at the airport. Police said they believe the pair arrived via a Blue Line light rail train. Police described the woman as “a person in crisis” but did not offer any further details. “Investigators do not believe that the woman is a relative or guardian of the child,” said a crime alert from the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension. The woman apparently did not offer any information, either about the child’s family or identity. Police said they didn’t have any reports of missing or abducted children that matched the girl’s description. But a Tuesday night alert from airport police and the BCA, which included pictures of the child wrapped in a blanket and held by an unidentified adult, apparently helped. Authorities reported early Wednesday the girl had been identified, and her mother located safe.&quot;Thanks to all who shared the alert and provided info that helped investigators identify the child and locate her relatives,&quot; the BCA reported.",

Following an event at the White House last week in which the president signed into law Democrats’ climate, healthcare and tax legislation, White House staff drowned out questions about Mr. Trump by blasting music through the speakers.”\n\n\n\n“Now, with midterm campaign season getting into full swing, Mr. Biden plans to make criticizing Mr. Trump’s agenda a key part of his message as he seeks to paint a contrast with Republicans, aides said. But he has no plans to wade into the political minefield of the Mar-a-Lago search. Mr. Biden will deliver a speech on Thursday at a rally in Maryland with Democratic officials.”",

But then came Minnesota, where Democrats again beat expectations. And then, in New York on Tuesday, the dam broke.”\n\n\n\n“It would have been a victory for Democrats if they’d even kept it close. Instead, Democrat Pat Ryan beat Republican Marc Molinaro in a district that Joe Biden narrowly won in 2020, but that would have appeared to favor Republicans in a normal midterm climate.”\n\n\n\n“Overall, on the last major primary night of the year, the winds appeared to be shifting in Democrats’ favor.”\n\n\n\nSaid one GOP strategist as results came in: “Well, shit.”",

His assault on the city instantly reordered the security architecture of Europe against Moscow and isolated his nation to a degree unseen since the Cold War. To the surprise of the world, the offensive against the Ukrainian capital would end in a humiliating retreat, which would expose deep systemic problems in a Russian military he had spent billions to rebuild.”",

(Just so we’re clear: This analogy is meant to invoke a stubborn donkey that, Looney Tunes–style, is craning to reach a carrot hanging in front of its face while its driver whacks its behind with a stick.)Indeed, although the IRA includes dozens of new benefits, it creates only one new penalty for pollution: the methane-emissions fee, which will charge oil and gas companies at least $900 for every ton of methane that they leak into the atmosphere.However you feel about the IRA, it probably has something to do with this fact. While some climate activists have fretted that the law does not punish fossil-fuel companies enough, centrists have argued that its complicated industrial policy would have been better as a simple carbon tax. But just about everyone has recognized that this all-carrots, no-sticks aspect is why the law passed in the first place. It’s a big part of why Senator Joe Manchin, who has criticized and even directed a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency during his political career, could champion the IRA.But this pat formulation overlooks something important. While it’s true that the IRA itself consists almost only of carrots, that is not true of the broader structure of American climate law. There is, in fact, a big “stick” for tackling carbon pollution already on the books in the United States, as well as an agency tasked with wielding that stick. I’m talking about the Clean Air Act and the EPA. And the IRA, by design, strengthens the government’s ability to wield that stick.It does this in at least two ways. The first is that the IRA confirms that carbon dioxide is a type of air pollution covered by the Clean Air Act, as initially reported by The New York Times earlier this week.This has broader consequences than it might seem. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that carbon dioxide counted as an air pollutant, and that, if the EPA decided that CO2 harmed human health and the environment, it could regulate CO2 under the Clean Air Act. That ruling—and the EPA’s official determination, a few years later, that CO2 is dangerous—has anchored the agency’s climate regulations on cars and trucks, and its proposed rules for the power grid.But then in June, the Court circumscribed some of the EPA’s authority over the power grid. Conservative justices have harped on the fact that Congress has never clearly delegated the power to regulate greenhouse gases to the EPA.Now it has. The IRA repeatedly defines greenhouse gas as a form of air pollution. It amends several sections of the Clean Air Act to define “greenhouse gas” as encompassing “the air pollutants carbon dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.” In another section, it grants money under the Clean Air Act for any project that “reduces or avoids greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution.”Congress has now clearly spoken: Carbon dioxide is a form of air pollution. And though this will not undo this year’s ruling, it buttresses the EPA’s underlying legal authority to regulate climate pollution.But that change is not the only—or even the most important—way that the IRA strengthens the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases. The law will also allow the EPA to pass much stricter rules than it could have previously.The reason has to do with a quirk of American law. Since the 1980s, every major proposed regulation has had to show that it passes a cost-benefit analysis demonstrating that its benefits to the economy as a whole exceed its costs. In the EPA’s case, that means that the cost of complying with a regulation can’t exceed the benefit to society of cleaner air or water. Over the years, this has turned out not to be much of an impediment to the EPA, because even small amounts of air pollution are massively damaging to public health, so preventing any air pollution has very high benefits.But the IRA’s many carrot-like policies, such as its clean-electricity subsidies and carbon-capture incentives, would functionally lower these limitations on the EPA even more by skewing the cost-benefit analysis in the agency’s favor.That will happen in two ways. First, the IRA’s economy-wide tax credits and subsidies will reduce the costs that companies face in complying with broad EPA rules that encourage wind, solar, or electric-vehicle adoption. Second, the IRA contains new grants that will allow the EPA to subsidize the cost of compliance directly by writing checks or issuing loans to oil and gas firms and other regulated companies so that they can meet the terms of the rules. This works in the EPA’s favor because the cost-benefit analysis looks only at the effect of the regulation itself; it does not include any funding from Congress that makes achieving that regulation more feasible. Both of these moves will lower the costs of regulation, allowing the EPA to pass much more expansive rules.This effect is important, but it was not accounted for in the law’s projected 40 percent reduction of U.S. carbon emissions. That was not a mistake—the modelers design their studies to look at what the new law alone will do, and so they assume zero further EPA action—but it means that the IRA’s emissions-cutting power could very well exceed what the models suggest today.The whole point of the IRA is that it brings down the cost of clean energy. It makes renewables cheaper, it makes nuclear power cheaper, and, as I wrote last week, it even makes the technologies that we’ll need to fight climate change in the 2030s cheaper. So far, most commentary on the law has focused on the immediate effects of that shift, and on how the law’s new incentives will reduce emissions simply by driving turnover in the energy system. But in the weeks and years to come, the secondary effects could become more important. Now that the IRA has passed, it will be easier for states and cities to pursue aggressive climate policy, and it will be simpler for companies to cut their emissions faster than would otherwise be economical.That’s why looking at the modeled emissions effects of the IRA—something that, to be clear, I did in this newsletter—is a little silly. The IRA isn’t like an EPA regulation that will modestly bend the curve of U.S. emissions. Instead, it catapults the country into a whole new landscape where the economics of every other climate action are different.We thought the IRA was doling out carrots. It was actually planting an entirely new garden.",

        "description": "Not surprisingly, given that the Rockies are going to finish with their fourth losing season in a row and are in last place in the National League West, I&#8217;m receiving a number of emails about the future of manager Bud Black and the coaching staff. Following are two for the mailbag:\nI&#8217;m not advocating for this, but considering the Rockies&#8217; post-All-Star-break record (10-20) and generally mediocre (at best) overall record for several years, is Bud Black&#8217;s job on the line? Are any coaching or front office jobs on the line? When is enough, enough?\n&#8212; Mark Newton, Denver\nWhy is this franchise so scared to fire the incompetent coaching staff?\n&#8212; Daniel Miller, Denver\nGentlemen, let&#8217;s start off with a basic answer. I do not think that Black will lose his job.\nWill the coaching staff be shuffled? I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if there are some new faces next season, but I&#8217;m not going to speculate on who might, or might not, lose their job. Plus, it&#8217;s way too easy to lay all of the blame on the coaches.\nAs for Black, here&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t think his job is on the line:\n\nHe has a contract through the 2023 season and I sincerely doubt owner Dick Monfort would fire Black unless there is a conflict that I&#8217;m not aware of at this time.\nBlack and general manager Bill Schmidt share a solid working relationship.\nFiring Black would be a public relations disaster for the team because the Rockies would be making Black a scapegoat for the current lack of talent on the team, as well as the team&#8217;s insistence to stay in-house when it comes to hiring front office personnel.\n I have asked a number of players that I know and trust and they tell me that Black has not &#8220;lost the team,&#8221; and that he still has the respect of the players. As one veteran told me: &#8220;This is on us, not on Buddy. We haven&#8217;t performed well enough to win.&#8221;\nOften, a club will fire a manager in order to &#8220;shake things up,&#8221; when the team is underperforming. That was the case back in 2009 when the Rockies fired Clint Hurdle and promoted Jim Tracy. And it certainly was the case in Philadelphia earlier this year when the Phillies fired Joe Girardi and promoted bench coach Rob Thomson. At this point in the season, shaking things up won&#8217;t accomplish anything.\nUnless the Rockies completely implode during the final quarter of the season and lose 100-plus games, Black will be back in 2023.\n\nHi Patrick. Understanding that it&#8217;s virtually impossible to forecast free-agent signings and/or injuries from now until next spring, do you expect to see Elehuris Montero and Ezequiel Tovar on the 2023 opening-day roster? It would seem Michael Toglia and Zac Veen are also positioning themselves for early call-ups if they don&#8217;t break camp with the big-league team.\n&#8212; Jon, California\nJon, that&#8217;s a great question. My answer is yes, I believe that Montero and Tovar will both be on the opening-day roster next season. As long as Tovar is healthy and has a solid spring training, he&#8217;ll be the starting shortstop. Montero, who&#8217;s become a mainstay in the Rockies&#8217; lineup since the All-Star break, will see a lot of time as a DH next season, I predict.\nAs for Veen and Toglia, I think they&#8217;ll debut next season but I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll be on the opening-day, big-league roster. The caveat is that if the Rockies make some trades during the offseason, that situation for Veen and Toglia could change.\nGood day, Patrick. There were a few questionable decisions this weekend, in my opinion. Why wasn&#8217;t Brandon Crawford waved to first base with two outs and a base open, and a man on second? Why even let the count get to 3-1? (Sunday), why did Sam Hilliard tag and attempt third with two outs? What happened to the runner never making the first or third out at third base? Has it become a &#8220;who&#8217;s-on-first&#8221; routine? Thank you.\n&#8212; Robert Emmerling, Limon\nHey Robert, those are two interesting strategy questions.\nThe first one is in regard to the Rockies&#8217; 4-3, 10-inning win over the Giants on Saturday night.\nThis is what I wrote:\n&#8220;(In the ninth inning) Up stepped the dangerous Brandon Crawford, who had homered earlier in the game. He worked Bard to a 3-1 count before ripping an RBI double down the left-field line to tie the game. With first base open, the Rockies chose not to intentionally walk Crawford.\n“We thought about it,” manager Bud Black said. “With two outs, maybe it makes some sense, right? But I trust Daniel and I think Daniel was going to pitch around him. I didn’t see that 3-1 pitch, whether it was a strike or not. … He probably didn’t locate the pitch where he wanted to.&#8221;\nI revisited the decision on Sunday morning with both Black and Bard. Bard said he was confident that he could get Crawford and figured that if he got Crawford in a 3-2 count, he could get him out with a slider. But Bard tipped his cap to Crawford for hitting a 100 mph fastball. Bard also said that if Black had signaled him to walk Crawford, he would have.\nBlack told me he thought about telling Bard to walk Crawford, but trusted Bard to handle the situation. For the record, I would have walked Crawford once the count reached 3-1 because Crawford was in a prime hitter&#8217;s count. But I wouldn&#8217;t have automatically walked him just because first base was open. Putting the go-ahead run on base at Coors Field is asking for trouble.\nAs for Hilliard&#8217;s tagging up and getting thrown out at third, it made no sense to me.\nThe Rockies&#8217; franchise winning percentage is the third-worst of all active MLB teams, leading only the Marlins, who&#8217;ve won two World Series, and the Padres, who&#8217;ve won more games than the Rockies since 1993. From a strictly on-field performance standpoint, are the Rockies the least successful franchise in MLB?\n&#8212; Greg, Estes Park\nGreg, I checked your math and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s correct. According to Baseball Reference, the Rockies&#8217; .469 winning percentage (2,186-2,471) ranks 25th since their inception in 1993. So, they have the sixth-worst record.\nThe worst team since 1993, by winning percentage, is Kansas City (2,076-2,575, .446). The Padres actually rank 24th (2,209-2,449, .474).\nBut to your point, the Rockies have been bad, yes, but they have not been the worst. Keep in mind that Seattle has not been to the playoffs since 2001. The Rockies have been to the playoffs five times in their existence.\nI foresee an incredible window of opportunity for the Rockies to lock in Jose Iglesias to a long-term deal, not only as a player, but as a possible captain and coach. I believe Jose will lead the Rockies &#8220;to the promised land,&#8221; with  timely clutch hitting. This will make for a winning culture.\nAs MLB.com Thomas Harding recently wrote, Jose has exemplified his leadership and courage in escaping Cuba, immediately learning fluent English to enhance his communication skills, and mastering his gifted baseball skills, especially under pressure. He reminds me so much of the popular Luis Aparicio, the Hall of Famer, and longtime shortstop of the Chicago White Sox.\n&#8212; Bruce Hellerstein, Denver\nIglesias has had a solid season, especially with the bat, but I wouldn&#8217;t bet on him returning. He&#8217;s a free agent and I don&#8217;t know if there is mutual interest in him returning. I&#8217;m not saying it couldn&#8217;t happen, but I don&#8217;t think it will. Plus, while Iglesias has a good glove and a decent arm, he lacks range.\nIn my opinion, it&#8217;s time for the Rockies to swing the door wide open for Tovar and the next wave of young players. I don&#8217;t see Iglesias returning to Colorado.\nPatrick, why do the Rockies have such an aversion to analytics? Because of the size of the outfield at Coors, and the effects of the Coors Field hangover, wouldn&#8217;t it make a lot of sense to have a large analytics and R&amp;D department?\n&#8212; Cory, Colorado Springs\nCory, it&#8217;s incorrect to say the Rockies &#8220;have an aversion&#8221; to analytics. It is accurate, and fair, to say that they lag behind most other teams in the majors. It&#8217;s been one of the team&#8217;s major weaknesses.\nCurrently, the Rockies have eight total people in their analytics department, counting developers and researchers. They recently promoted Brian Jones as the new director of analytics. Jones started with the Rockies in 2002 and over the past 16 years has worked as the team’s video coordinator. Jones told me he&#8217;ll be adding &#8220;a few more people soon.&#8221;\nBut to your point, yes the Rockies need a strong R&amp;D department, especially given the challenges of playing at Coors Field.\nHi Patrick! In my last letter you said that Dick Monfort needs to bring in somebody from the outside to help get the Rockies on track. I know Monfort says he is loyal to a (HUGE) fault. So my question is, is Monfort afraid that if he brings somebody in from the outside they will undo everything he did and that if it works it will make him look like he did not know what he was doing? \n&#8212; Del, Lamar\nDel, Monfort rarely talks to the media, so it&#8217;s difficult to gauge what his philosophy is right now. But I honestly don&#8217;t believe he&#8217;s afraid that he&#8217;ll look like he &#8220;didn&#8217;t know what he was doing&#8221; if he hired someone from outside the organization.\nMy theory is that Monfort is very loyal to most of his longtime front-office employees. He&#8217;s cautious by nature and he trusts what he knows. He doesn&#8217;t want to rock the boat, so to speak.\nI also believe that there is a feeling that those who have been around the Rockies for years have a better understanding of the unique challenges of playing baseball at altitude.\nI can understand that, to a certain extent, but I&#8217;ve said my times that the Rockies need to bring in some fresh thinking to the front office.",

        "description": "Photo by Kelsey Grant/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Hayes has similar numbers this year compared to 2021. The Pirates have activated third baseman Ke’Bryan Hayes from the 10-day injured list. \nInfielder Kevin Padlo was optioned to Triple-A Indianapolis to make room for Hayes on the Major League roster. Padlo has bounced around between the San Francisco Giants and Seattle Mariners before arriving in Pittsburgh, hitting .121 in 13 games. \nAppearing in 103 games before landing on the IL with a back issue, Hayes has not been the offensive catalyst the Pirates were hoping he’d be after signing him through the decade at the start of the season. \nHayes has put together a .251/.323/.358 slash line with a poor .681 OPS, failing to consistently drive the ball for extra bases and potential home runs. A premier offensive position at the hot corner, Hayes has hit 18 doubles, three triples, and six homers with 35 RBI in 391 at-bats. \nLuck doesn’t play into hitting a large number of home runs during a 162-game season, but Hayes has fallen victim to poorly placed balls being directly at position players. \nDespite what looks to be an average year, Hayes is in the 92nd percentile in hard-hit percentage, 89th in max exit velocity, and 91st in average exit velocity according to Baseball Savant. The closer you are to the 99th percentile, the better. \nHow bad has his hit placement been? Hayes is in the 99th percentile in outs above average. It also doesn’t help that the 25-year-old Gold Glove candidate is in the 15th percentile in barrel percentage, a key factor in driving the ball to the gaps. \nThere’s no denying the quality of Hayes’ defense and the value he brings within the Pirates infield. He has Gold Glove potential and has shown the ability to single handedly prevent the Bucs from giving up the lead or widening the gap on a potential comeback.\nThe question remains, will Hayes continue to improve at the plate enough to stick in the top four of the lineup?\nIn 96 games last season, Hayes had the same number of home runs with two additional doubles and very similar slash numbers. He dealt with numerous injuries in 2021 that hampered him from reaching the next level of development. \nThis season though, with little protection in the lineup, Hayes has not stood out in the box. \nHayes hit .333 in April, .263 in May, under the Mendoza Line at .198 in June, and .213 in July before heating up at .297 in August.\nAs the dog days of summer heated up, Hayes cooled down midseason and seems to be turning a corner.\nEarning the highest-paying contract in club history at $70 million, expectations and higher standards come as an effect. Hayes has been an exceptional representative off the field and has the tools to be as strong on it.\nThe tide may be turning on the up and down season for one of the Pirates building blocks.\nThere is reason for concern, but with all the procedures around the Pirates these days, it’s taking time to come to fruition.",

        "description": "Researchers have removed Denmark&#8217;s only specimen of a primordial fish, a coelacanth, from its jar of alcohol and gained new insight into how it functions.\nThe new knowledge could contribute to saving this critically endangered deep-sea dweller.\nWhen a South African fisherman came across a coelacanth in his net in 1938, it was like finding a living dinosaur—a catch that sent shockwaves throughout the scientific community. Until then, the coelacanth (SEE-lə-kanth) was believed to have been extinct for 66 million years.\nSince then, only about 300 specimens of this living fossil have been caught worldwide. In Denmark, a single fish, &#8220;specimen number 23,&#8221; has been submersed in alcohol at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen for 60 years. The Danish coelacanth specimen was caught in the Indian Ocean&#8217;s Comoros archipelago in 1960.\nAs many other coelacanth specimens have been dissected, its anatomy is no secret. But very little is known about the fish&#8217;s physiology—the way it functions. Now, researchers have discovered new things about this extraordinarily rare and elusive deep-sea dweller.\nPeter Rask Møller and Henrik Lauridsen with the Copenhagen coelacanth at the CT scanner preparing the specimen for high resolution imaging spanning an entire night. (Credit: Henrik Lauridsen)\n&#8220;This fish is iconic, extremely rare, and remains shrouded in mystery. It is difficult to observe alive because it lives in underwater caves at depths of 150-200 meters (roughly 500-650 feet). And, since a large portion of the few specimens collected over the years have been cut to pieces, new methods were required to find out more about how it lives. We now know a bit more,&#8221; says Peter Rask Møller, an associate professor and curator at the University of Copenhagen&#8217;s Natural History Museum of Denmark. He is a coauthor of the paper in the journal BMC Biology.\nAlong with Henrik Lauridsen of Aarhus University and a group of colleagues, Møller is the first person ever to conduct research on the Danish specimen, which has been preserved intact and only been used for display until now.\nBy putting the fish in CT and MRI scanners at Aarhus University Hospital in Skejby, the research scientists could model the species with more precision than ever while not destroying it.\nHead-down hunting\nThe models show the exact distribution of bone mineral and fat in its body. Among other things, the models help explain the unique &#8220;headstand drift hunting&#8221; technique of the coelacanth, whereby it slowly drifts along a seabed vertically, head and snout downwards, as it uses an electrosensitive organ to scan the bottom for cephalopods and fish to eat.\n&#8220;We discovered that the coelacanth has a special skeleton with a lot of bone mass in the head and tail, while there are almost no vertebrae. It&#8217;s quite unique. The heaviest parts are at either end of the fish, which makes it easy for the fish to stand itself on its head. The balance point is an advantageous mechanism for its way of life,&#8221; explains Lauridsen, associate professor at Aarhus University&#8217;s department of clinical medicine.\nThis CT image shows the bone mineral density of the coelacanth (Credit: Henrik Lauridsen)\nThe researchers also discovered the precise distribution of fatty tissue in the body of the fish, including the amount in its fatty bladder, as coelacanth don&#8217;t have a regular gas swim bladder like modern fish. The numbers show that the fat content correlates with the depths at which the fish live, where fat allows the fish to be neutrally buoyant and spend hardly any energy to remain hundreds of meters deep.\nCoelacanth mystery\nOne peculiar feature about the coelacanth is that females gestate for a full five years before birthing live young. One of the great coelacanth mysteries among researchers is: Where do coelacanth give birth? The Danish researchers hope to shed light on this question soon.\n&#8220;We still have no idea where their fry are born. By analyzing the distribution of bone and fat in a fetus, we can probably find out at what depth fry are adapted to live. This knowledge is also important in terms of preserving this critically endangered species—because when we don&#8217;t know where they are, we can&#8217;t know where to protect them. And, there is cause for concern. Coelacanth have an incredibly slow reproduction rate, which makes them extra vulnerable,&#8221; says Lauridsen.\nThe researchers point out that their models can be applied to all other aquatic organisms and used to determine, among other things, whether organisms are adapted to the ocean depths at which they live. This is relevant knowledge at a time when climate change could cause ocean currents to change and thereby impact marine life.\n&#8220;Instead of going out and catching new coelacanth, which are both rare and protected, the modern scanning techniques have allowed us to perform exciting new analyses, despite the animal having been submersed in alcohol for decades. Having museum collections of rare animals is like entering the world&#8217;s best secondhand store, with the wildest array of recycled things that can no longer be found new,&#8221; concludes Møller.\nSource: University of Copenhagen \nThe post Scanning &#8216;living fossil&#8217; fish explains its odd swimming appeared first on Futurity.",

This is TPM’s Morning Memo.\n\n\n\nSo About That Red Wave  &#8230;\n\n\n\nA lot to pick through from Tuesday&#8217;s primary results. Some good news for Dems. Some bad news for democracy. Data points galore. Resist the urge to make sweeping conclusions about November based on one day in August, BUT a quite a bit to chew on here:\n\n\n\n\nDemocrats have now outperformed Biden&#39;s numbers in each of the four U.S. House special elections since the Dobbs decision in June.#NE01 &#8211; Trump +15 -&gt; R+5#MN01 &#8211; Trump +10 -&gt; R+4#NY19 &#8211; Biden +1.5 -&gt; D+2.2#NY23 &#8211; Trump +11 -&gt; R+6&mdash; Ryan Matsumoto (@ryanmatsumoto1) August 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThe Race With The Biggest Implications For November\n\n\n\nDemocrat Pat Ryan defeated Republican Marc Molinaro in the NY-19, in a special election to fill the empty seat of former Rep. Antonio Delgado (D-NY), who stepped down to become lieutenant governor. \n\n\n\nJosh Marshall: &#8220;The key is that this result is not consistent with a GOP wave election, not even a mid-range one.&#8221;\n\n\n\nWhat A Grudge Match\n\n\n\nIn NY-12, Rep. Jerry Nadler defeated Rep. Carolyn Maloney in the battle of two longtime Democratic incumbents thrown into the same district in the latest redistricting cycle. \n\n\n\nImpeachment Echoes\n\n\n\nImpeachment prosecutor Daniel Goldman won the Democratic primary in NY-10 and is expected to win the general election in November.\n\n\n\nGood For Everyone\n\n\n\nCarl Paladino, the glowering racist with a soft spot for Adolph Hitler, lost in the GOP primary in the NY-23.\n\n\n\nLoomer Loses\n\n\n\nThe extreme right wing candidate Laura Loomer lost in the FL-11 GOP primary.  As Mother Jones noted, Loomer would have been a top contender for most racist member of Congress.\n\n\n\nCan&#8217;t Keep A Good Man Down &#8230;\n\n\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) won his GOP primary despite running for re-election under the specter of a federal sex trafficking investigation.\n\n\n\nIn the general election, Gaetz will square off against Democrat Rebekah Jones, who is facing criminal charges for allegedly illegally accessing a state computer. Jones you may remember as the Florida Department of Health data manager who claimed to have been fired for refusing to suppress COVID data.  \n\n\n\nGen Z Represents\n\n\n\nMaxwell Alejandro Frost, a 25-year-old gun control activist, won the Democratic primary in the FL-10, a heavily Democratic district that he is expected to win in November. Incumbent Rep. Val Demmings (D) won the Democratic nomination to challenge Sen. Marco Rubio (R) and did not seek re-election. \n\n\n\nCrist v. Desantis\n\n\n\nCharlie Crist prevailed in the Democratic priamry for governor, setting up a longshot November challenge to incumbent Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who is expected to run for president if re-elected.\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nStudent Loan Week Is Finally Here!\n\n\n\nAt long last, Biden is set to unveil student loan relief today, including loan forgiveness and extending the pandemic pause on student loan payments. The contours of the loan forgiveness program, details of which are still being finalized, look like $10,000 of forgiveness for those making below an income threshold in the $125,000-$150,000 range. \n\n\n\nFederal Judge Confused By Trump&#8217;s Lawsuit Over Mar-A-Lago Raid\n\n\n\nKinda embarrassing. The Trump-appointed federal judge whom he asked to intervene in the legal battle over the FBI&#8217;s search of Mar-a-Lago responded by asking Trump what exactly he wants her to do and on what legal basis. Good start for Trump. \n\n\n\nTPM: Trump Got Multiple Extensions Before FBI Raid\n\n\n\nWaPo: FBI’s Mar-a-Lago search followed months of resistance, delay by Trump\n\n\n\nWhat The GOP Hath Wrought\n\n\n\nThe IRS is launching a security review of all of its 600 facilities nationwide in response to bogus GOP and right-wing attacks over new funding for the agency. \n\n\n\nThe Crudité Wars\n\n\n\nIf you&#8217;re Mehmet Oz and you&#8217;re still talking about crudités, you&#8217;re losing. \n\n\n\n&#8220;If John Fetterman had ever eaten a vegetable in his life, then maybe he wouldn&#8217;t have had a major stroke and wouldn&#8217;t be in the position of having to lie about it constantly,&#8221; Rachel Tripp, Oz&#8217;s senior communications advisor, told Insider. \n\n\n\nWow &#8230; a crudité reference delicately wrapped inside a stroke joke.  \n\n\n\nThe Rick Scott Award For Epic Cluelessness Goes To &#8230; Rick Scott\n\n\n\nHow it started: \n\n\n\n\nAnother week of President Biden vacationing in Delaware vs. working at the White House.If he loves to travel so much, I&#39;ve got some suggestions as to where he should go next ⬇️&mdash; Rick Scott (@SenRickScott) August 22, 2022\n\n\n\n\nHow it&#8217;s going:\n\n\n\n\nNEW: Sen.

        "description": "After months of isolation and anxious about touring again, Ezra and two friends walk the length of the UK meeting musicians in an uplifting documentaryGeorge Ezra’s reputation as the nicest man in pop emerges intact from this easygoing documentary that follows his 95-day, 1,200 mile walk from Land’s End to John o’Groats. Striding out in box-fresh hiking boots, tent strapped to his rucksack, he’s joined by two old mates from his uni days in Bristol, Adam Scarborough and Christy Tattershall, who direct. (Though we never catch a glimpse of the support vehicle that presumably carried the acoustic guitar and fire pit.)It’s spring 2021. Ezra is anxious about touring again. After months of isolation, he wants to be back out in the world, but he’s nervous about returning to a punishing schedule. Sitting by a river in West Yorkshire, he tells Scarborough and Tattershall how unwell touring left him before the pandemic, emotionally and mentally drained. He describes breaking down in London on a rare day off, crying his eyes out trying to pull on a sock. Ezra is very good on mental health. Still, you won’t learn much about his private life here; he manages to be open about his struggles while guarding his privacy, no mean feat. Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/education/3611324-university-professors-organization-misunderstands-the-nature-of-antisemitism/",
        "description": "The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) is among the most respected and influential college and university teachers’ organizations in the U.S. Founded in 1915, the AAUP’s stated mission is “to advance academic freedom [and] define fundamental professional values and standards for higher education.”\n\n\n\nIt is therefore disheartening that the organization has badly failed to comprehend the nature of antisemitism, which, as just reported by CNN, is a growing problem on many campuses.\n\n\n\nA new “policy document” by the AAUP’s Committee on Academic Freedom acknowledges the “threat of antisemitism” in a perfunctory half-sentence and then spends two full pages – half its length – explaining it away.\n\n\n\nThe report, published in the AAUP’s 2022 Summer Bulletin, addresses the “Legislative Threats to Academic Freedom” found in recent statutes, mostly in red states, restricting subject matter and mandating approaches to history instruction in public schools from kindergarten through college. The opening section of the document is devoted to the committee’s rejection of a Florida statute that codifies the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance (IHRA) working definition of antisemitism, imposing financial penalties on school districts and institutions whose practices are found out of compliance. \n\n\n\nIt is vital for the AAUP to challenge such political interference in curriculum design concerning antisemitism or other subjects, especially when coupled with funding consequences. But the policy document goes further, disparaging the IHRA definition, and actually arguing that antisemitism should not be specifically covered in civil rights legislation.\n\n\n\nThe IHRA’s 2015 “Working Definition of Antisemitism” has been adopted or endorsed by 37 governments, including the U.S., the European Union, the Organization of American States and numerous non-governmental organizations. Comprising an introductory statement and 11 illustrative examples, the definition is explicitly “non-binding” and was never intended to be legally enforceable.\n\n\n\nAs explained by Kenneth Stern, one of the principal drafters, the definition was created for purposes of education and data collection, not as a speech or teaching code. Thus, the AAUP committee was quite right to object to the potential “weaponization” of the definition to punish teachers and schools.\n\n\n\nIt should have stopped there. Instead, the committee went on to mischaracterize the IHRA definition as equating “criticism of the policies of the state of Israel with antisemitism,” intended to protect Israel from “critical examination of [its] history and policies.” This is flatly untrue. Although curiously omitted from the committee’s appraisal, the IHRA unambiguously states that “criticism of Israel similar to that leveled against any other country cannot be regarded as antisemitic.”\n\n\n\nOne of the 11 IHRA examples does note that “applying double standards to Israel” may constitute antisemitism “by requiring of it a behavior not expected or demanded of any other democratic nation.” That should be unobjectionable. A double standard is the essence of discrimination. Is there any question that criticisms of nations and governments may encompass implicit appeals to racism?\n\n\n\nConsider the description of COVID-19 as the “China virus,” complaints about Japan’s aggressive export policy, descriptions of social arrangements in Arab and Muslim countries or condescending references to the economic circumstances of African nations. In each of these cases, and others, racial and religious prejudices have been thinly veiled in superficially political terms. The IHRA points out that the same can be true of Israel, depending on the context.\n\n\n\nMore troubling is the AAUP committee’s gratuitous assertion that antisemitism should not be covered as a “special form of discrimination” in civil rights legislation but addressed only “as religious or race discrimination.” This claim betrays either stunning ignorance or callous disregard for the uniquely protean history of antisemitism, a conspiracy-based ideology that shape-shifts among religious, racial, ethnic, national, cultural, genetic and other hatreds, whichever is most destructive at any particular time.\n\n\n\nMoreover, it is not clear that antisemitism is indeed covered by laws prohibiting religious and racial discrimination, at least regarding America’s million or more non-practicing Jews. The Nazis declared Jews racially distinct; there is surely no reason for the AAUP to follow suit.\n\n\n\nObjections to “special” forms of discrimination have a sordid history. Until 2020, when the U.S. Supreme Court decided the Bostock case, gay and transgender people were not clearly covered by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Many liberal jurisdictions therefore passed legislation specifically protecting the LGBT+ community over the protests of those who claimed that gay people were demanding “special rights.”\n\n\n\nIronically, the AAUP committee members teach at universities that recognize numerous forms of discrimination beyond race and religion. The chair is at San Diego State University, which prohibits discrimination based on “age, disability (physical or mental), gender (or sex), genetic information, gender identity (including transgender), gender expression, marital status, medical condition, nationality, race or ethnicity (including color or ancestry), religion or religious creed, sexual orientation, and veteran or military status.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe other members’ schools have even more protected categories, such as “parental status (including status as a foster parent),” “domestic violence victim status,” “gender transition status” and use of worker’s compensation, among others.\n\n\n\nGiven the range of anti-discrimination policies under which most faculty are already working, the call to exclude antisemitism is tone deaf, or worse.\n\n\n\nThe IHRA definition has its shortcomings; as with most approaches to complex social issues, it may be abused. It should never have been written into law. The AAUP report on “Legislative Threats to Academic Freedom” rightly denounces the Florida legislature’s political interference and statutory weaponization. But the drafting committee had no expertise on defining antisemitism and no competence on writing civil rights laws.\n\n\n\nIntellectual life at American universities would be unrecognizable without the AAUP’s efforts for over 100 years. Nonetheless, the Committee on Academic Freedom has unaccountably ventured far beyond its remit, damaging its own credibility and compromising the AAUP’s historic mission.\n\n\n\nSteven Lubet is Williams Memorial Professor at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law.

That was back in a distant time when Dwight D Eisenhower was just starting his second term as president of the US.Allison, who has died aged 82, was the drummer with the Crickets, who became known around the world in 1957, when their song That’ll Be the Day became one of the defining hits of the first rock’n’roll era. He had co-written it with Buddy Holly, their bespectacled singer and lead guitarist. A year later Holly left the group to pursue a solo career, and in 1959 he was killed in a plane crash, but his name and that of the group remain inextricably linked through such hits as Peggy Sue, Well … All Right and Think It Over, all of which Allison co-wrote.

        "description": "Charlie Crist speaks to a crowd in St. Petersburg, Fla. after winning the Democratic nomination for governor in Florida on Tuesday, Aug. 23, 2022. Crist, a member of congress, will face Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in November.Daylina Miller/WUSFDemocrat and longtime politician Charlie Crist has won the primary for governor in Florida and will face Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis in November, according to a race call by The Associated Press.Crist served as Florida&#x27;s Republican governor more than a decade ago and is now a Democrat in the U.S. House of Representatives.  The primary for governor has highlighted a split within the Democratic Party in the state. Crist&#x27;s challenger, Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, hammered him over his record as governor and for switching his stance on issues like abortion and criminal justice. As Crist claimed victory Tuesday night, he thanked Fried for a spirited campaign, but it was clear his sights were firmly set on DeSantis: &quot;The stakes could not be any higher for this election. Our fundamental freedoms are literally on the ballot, my friends. A woman&#x27;s right to choose - on the ballot. Democracy - on the ballot. Your rights as minorities are on this ballot.&quot;He called DeSantis a &quot;bully&quot; and &quot;dangerous&quot; and made sure to solidify his stance as a candidate who supports abortion rights.  &quot;On day one of my administration, I will sign an executive order protecting a women&#x27;s right to choose.&quot; Crist outraised Fried and has run as a moderate by casting himself as the person most likely to beat DeSantis in November. He has tried to court unaffiliated voters and disaffected Republicans and has earned endorsements from top Democratic-leaning groups like the state&#x27;s teachers&#x27; union. When it comes to winning elections, Crist has a mixed record. He left the Republican party in 2010 to run as an independent against Marco Rubio for the U.S. Senate. He made another run for governor as a Democrat in 2014 but lost by about a percentage point to Republican Rick Scott — now a U.S. senator.Eyes toward NovemberNow that the dust has settled on the Democratic primary, Crist will face DeSantis in November. The powerful governor is rumored to be considering a presidential run in 2024. He&#x27;s raised his national profile and has more than $100 million in the bank. DeSantis has become known for his battles over education, including how teachers talk to students about race, history and LGBTQ people. He&#x27;s pushed new laws that restrict how conversations around those subjects take place in public school classrooms and even businesses.If he&#x27;s to win in November, Crist will have to sway some of the nearly 4 million unaffiliated Florida voters. Registered Republicans now outnumber registered Democrats in the state, but statewide races have often been close. DeSantis, himself, won by about a single percentage point in 2018.WUSF&#x27;s Steve Newborn contributed to this story.   Copyright 2022 WFSU. To see more, visit WFSU.",

        "description": "Rick Reed, a longtime GOP media strategist who famously crafted a series of ads in 2004 attacking then-Democratic presidential candidate John Kerry’s military record in the Vietnam War, died unexpectedly on Aug. 17. He was 69.\n\n\n\nReed was most known for designing multiple ads during the 2004 presidential campaign for Swift Boat Veterans for Truth that accused Kerry, then a U.S. senator from Massachusetts, of not deserving his combat medals and betraying his fellow soldiers.\n\n\n\nThe ads were seen as a smear campaign by many, including the late Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), the 2008 Republican presidential nominee and a prisoner of war in Vietnam, who called the commercials “dishonest and dishonorable.”\n\n\n\nBeyond his involvement in the 2004 presidential race, Reed crafted ads for many Republican candidates during his career and for years served as a partner at Republican media firm Stevens Reed Curcio &amp; Potholm.\n\n\n\nReed also worked for McCain’s 2000 presidential campaign and former President Trump’s 2016 campaign.\n\n\n\nWhen interviewed recently, Reed said he was happiest when he was with his family, being productive at work and helping others, his loved ones wrote in his obituary.\n\n\n\n“I am happiest when I am with my family and know that everyone else is happy,” Reed said, according to his obituary.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Life has its ups and downs so I understand that none of us are happy every single minute of every day,” he added.\n\n\n\nReed also served as the political editor of White House Bulletin and a vice president at Market Opinion Research.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe additionally worked as a deputy director at the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC), where he produced ads on behalf of Sens. Richard Burr (R-N.C.), Jim DeMint (R-S.C.) and Mel Martinez (R-Fla.), according to Reed’s biography page.\n\n\n\nReed, who was born in Wakefield, Mass., and most recently resided in Alexandria, Va., is survived by his wife, Gayla Reed, whom he met at the NRSC, and three children.",

        "description": "When Hurricane Andrew struck South Florida on Aug. 24, 1992, it became — at the time — the costliest and most damaging hurricane to ever hit the U.S. It destroyed 63,000 homes, stripping many down to their concrete foundations, and damaged 124,000 others. It left 65 people dead and spawned at least 28 tornadoes from Georgia to Mississippi. In the years since, we have come to see Andrew for what it really was: a harbinger of things to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClimate change has turned hurricane season into a recurring national nightmare. The intensity, frequency, and duration of North Atlantic hurricanes have increased dramatically since the 1980s. Our changing climate continues to add more fuel for hurricanes in the form of increasing ocean heat content, and the growth along our coasts has expanded the targets for these storms. Andrew’s record as America’s costliest storm has already been surpassed by six subsequent hurricanes — Katrina, Harvey, Maria, Sandy, Ida, and Irma — with doubtless more to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAndrew’s destruction should have been a wake-up call about the way we build our houses and brace our communities. For some, it was. Jurisdictions in South Florida quickly passed the strongest building codes in the country. In 2002, ten years after Andrew, Florida Gov. Jeb Bush enacted a statewide building code, overcoming resistance from inland counties that viewed hurricanes as a coastal concern. It proved prescient. Two years later in 2004, Hurricane Charley unleashed 100-plus mile-per-hour winds far inland across Florida. Homes built under the new codes fared far better across Florida than those built before, during what would become one of the most prolific hurricane seasons of all time for the state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe have seen a similar story play out with other recent hurricanes up and down the Atlantic seaboard — not to mention from increasing extreme weather events in other regions, such as wildfires in the West and tornadoes in the heartland and Southeast. When disasters strike communities with strong and modern building codes, people have homes to come back to. Where codes are weak, we lose lives and livelihoods, especially in low income and minority communities. Storms tear apart the fabric of towns and can decimate local economies for years or even decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese disasters will get worse, and their impact farther reaching, yet most Americans remain woefully unprepared. We know how to build resilient and cost-effective structures to minimize the losses, yet only a dismal 35 percent of jurisdictions in the United States have the most current building codes in effect. There are two primary reasons. One is basic human nature: Jurisdictions don’t take threats seriously until a disaster forces their hand. We think it will never happen to us — not to my town, not to my house — until it does. If it does, it won’t be that bad — until it is that bad.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA second challenge is upfront cost. Most resiliency upgrades are affordable (hurricane straps, stronger bolts, and better shingling) but the overall package of upgrades can raise the cost of a home enough to give local leaders pause. But this concern is shortsighted, as the upfront costs are more than offset by savings on insurance, repairs, and recovery and increased real estate values in the long-term.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHomeowners and taxpayers feel these savings alike. Increasingly, residents of disaster-prone areas struggle to find homeowners insurance at all, which leaves taxpayers to foot the bill for public coverage. Taxpayers also pay dearly for disaster recovery, which is now running into the tens of billions every year. In this way, governments should view resilience expenditures — including subsidies and grants to help low-income residents — as investments rather than outlays. Studies show that for every dollar we spend on resilience, we save six dollars on recovery.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHurricane Andrew’s intensity and its impact shocked the nation, but too few have learned its lessons — even as storm after storm has demonstrated that disaster resilience is an imperative well beyond the Gulf Coast states. By reflecting this week on Andrew’s impact, leaders in states and localities across America can look ahead and plan for the worst. Florida proved in the storm’s aftermath that stronger building codes can save lives, property, and money. We shouldn’t have to lose more lives to learn this lesson.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCraig Fugate was administrator of FEMA from 2009 – 2017 and served as an emergency manager in Florida during Hurricane Andrew.\n\n\n\nRoy Wright, a former FEMA official, is president and CEO of the Insurance Institute for Business &amp; Home Safety, an organization dedicated to disaster resilience.",

Have a wonderful day and please do stay in touch &#x2026;\nBavarian Nordic, which makes the only approved monkeypox vaccine, is exploring the viability of using technically expired doses to help bridge a growing gap between demand and supply due to the current outbreak, Reuters tells us. Bavarian chief executive officer Paul Chaplin says global demand for the shot is &#x201C;exceeding our ability to deliver.&#x201D; More than 40,000 confirmed cases of monkeypox in over 80 countries where the virus is not endemic have been reported since May. About a third of the current global case count is in the U.S. One way to address supply problems is to evaluate whether millions of doses delivered to the U.S. in previous years that have technically expired are still viable.Continue to STAT+ to read the full story&hellip;",

        "description": "Cook Political Report: &#8220;That sound you hear is the crash of expectations of big GOP gains in the House this fall.&#8221;\n&#8220;Democrats notched a huge victory in New York’s 19th CD last night as Democrat Pat Ryan defeated Republican Marc Molinaro 51% to 49% in a Hudson Valley special election both parties had invested in. That’s roughly the same margin President Biden had carried the seat by in 2020. The result shouldn’t be shocking, considering Democrats had outperformed in other recent specials in NE-01 and MN-01. But Molinaro, regarded as a pragmatic executive of blue-leaning Dutchess County, had led in multiple polls throughout the race. Ryan, the younger Ulster County executive and decorated Army veteran, prevailed after a late push to make abortion rights the centerpiece of the campaign.&#8221;\n&#8220;What should be most worrying for Republicans is that NY-19 is the kind of district they need to win to have any chance of rolling up big numbers in November. With few Democrats sitting in Trump districts, Republicans’ success depends on picking off Democrats in CD’s Biden carried by six points or less. Not that long ago, that looked feasible.&#8221;",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Fitbit)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday, Fitbit announced the availability of three new fitness trackers: the Inspire 3, Versa 4, and Sense 2. All successors to previous-generation devices, the three run the gamut from Fitbit’s highest-equipped to most basic fitness wearables.\n“Basic” is a relative term among fitness trackers, as they all continuously edge closer to full-blown smartwatch functionality. The Inspire 3, in particular, adds blood oxygen monitoring during sleep and a full-color AMOLED touchscreen to the entry-level tracker, which already can receive phone alerts, like texts, calls, and app notifications. Setting the display to the optional “always on” setting takes battery life estimates down from 10 days to only three, which is much more in line with full-featured smartwatches, though less than Fitbit’s Sense and Versa watches.\nBy contrast, the Sense 2 and Versa 4 are the two most-capable trackers Fitbit offers. They’re both rated for about six days of use (without the always-on-display enabled) and now feature fast-charging capability that Fitbit claims can give you a day of battery life from only 12 minutes of charging.Read 11 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Getty | picture alliance)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe incubation period for COVID-19—the time between when SARS-CoV-2 first infects a person and when resulting COVID-19 symptoms first appear—has gradually shortened as the pandemic has stretched on and the virus has mutated. That's according to a new meta-analysis published this week in JAMA Network Open by researchers in Beijing, who harvested data on over 8,000 patients from 142 COVID-19 studies.\nWhen the original version of the novel virus mushroomed out of Wuhan, China, the mean incubation period was 6.65 days, according to pooled data from 119 studies. But then, the incubation period got shorter as the variants evolved. The alpha variant had a mean incubation of 5 days, according to one study; beta, 4.5 days, according to another; delta had a mean of 4.41 days, according to pooled data from six studies; and now with omicron, the incubation period has shrunk to 3.42 days, according to data from five studies.\nThe current shortened incubation period now puts SARS-CoV-2 more in line with commonplace respiratory viruses, including the four human coronaviruses that circulate seasonally and cause mild infections similar to the common cold. Their incubation period is 3.2 days. Rhinovirus, the most common cause of the common cold, has a mean incubation period of 1.4 days. For influenza, it can range from 1.43 to 1.64 days, and parainfluenza has a mean of 2.6 days.Read 7 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Uber and the Brussels taxi industry have had a long-running feud since the app opened for business in the Belgian capital in 2014.\n\n\n\nIn June, the Brussels regional parliament approved plans for a unified statute for both taxi drivers and for-hire drivers, which covers Uber&#8217;s service. \n\n\n\n&#8220;This means that traditional taxis can start to drive with apps like Uber,&#8221; Laurent Slits, Uber&#8217;s head of Belgian activities said in a statement shared with POLITICO last Thursday. &#8220;To prepare for this change, starting today these [taxi] drivers can subscribe to a waiting list to start using the Uber app.&#8221; \n\n\n\nOver the last few years, Uber has struck a series of deals with taxi companies around the world to give their drivers access to the platform. The company considers it a win-win: allowing taxi drivers onto the platforms reduces waiting times for passengers, while taxi drivers have more earning opportunities. \n\n\n\nIn Europe, deals are in place in cities in Spain, Austria, Germany and Greece. In May, Uber signed one of its biggest taxi deals up to date with Italian taxi dispatcher IT Taxi, allowing 12,000 drivers in 90 Italian cities access to the platform. Outside of Europe, a deal in New York managed to enlist the famous yellow cabs. \n\n\n\nIt isn&#8217;t clear how keen Brussels taxi drivers are to join the platform. &#8220;To be honest, cooperating with a platform which is constantly violating the rules and totally out of control, for us, it&#8217;s problematic,&#8221; said Abdessamad Sabbani, president of the Brussels Taxi Federation. Some of the city&#8217;s taxi drivers are unhappy that drivers with a Flemish permit were caught picking up rides in the city. \n\n\n\nUber couldn&#8217;t specify when the feature will be available in the app. It&#8217;s also unclear whether it will be part of the current Brussels UberX-model, or whether there will be a separate Uber Taxi-tab. Uber operates both models, depending on local regulation. More details are expected in early September.",

His latest spread in Rolling Stone largely follows suit, dropping such bombshells as “It’s okay to be flawed … I make mistakes sometimes,” “If I have kids at some point, I’ll encourage them to be themselves,” and, on taking up therapy, that “So many of your emotions are so foreign before you start analysing them properly.” Well, if you were Harry Styles, why would you go any deeper than that in a public forum?

        "description": "The Department of Education has announced that it has provided more than $10 billion in student debt relief for public workers 10 months into a new program. \n\n\n\nThe relief covers more than 175,000 people, according to a news release the department put out on Tuesday, and will be provided through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program. \n\n\n\nThe effort comes as the White House is broadly expected to announce a new forgiveness program on Tuesday that would wipe out $10,000 in student debt for eligible borrowers. The program is expected to have income limits. \n\n\n\nThe decision has been hotly anticipated but is likely to set off a political storm, with President Biden potentially coming under criticism both from Republicans opposed to the debt forgiveness over inflation concerns and liberals who do not think it goes far enough. \n\n\n\nThe Education Department announced temporary changes to the PSLF program in October. It allowed borrowers to get credit for payments made on loans from different student loan programs and borrowers who work or worked in the public service field since 2007 to be eligible to receive these benefits. \n\n\n\nIn a statement, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said that the PSLF program will be beneficial for public service workers who have seen previous installments of the program not benefit them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’re committed to helping borrowers who choose to pursue careers in education, public health, social work, law enforcement, and other critical fields receive the benefits to which they’re entitled for leading lives of service,” he said.\n\n\n\nThis comes as Biden is expected to announce on Wednesday the cancellation of student loan debts and an extension of the existing payment pause. \n\n\n\nThe intended measure will include $10,000 in loan forgiveness for borrowers who make less than $125,000 annually, which would be the largest forgiveness of student loans per borrower in history, and an extension of the payment pause for at least four months. \n\n\n\nThe PSLF program is also a part of the $32 billion of student loans already forgiven by the Biden administration through existing federal programs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEligible borrowers have until Oct. 31 to apply to consolidate their loans into a direct consolidation loan and qualify for the PSLF program.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3613202-irans-state-terrorism-and-an-american-policy-of-deterrence/",
        "description": "History tells us that ignoring a pattern of escalating aggression — a failure to deter — courts disaster. We appear to be on that path with Iran.\n\n\n\nFor many years, the foreign policy establishment believed Tehran would only target the U.S. homeland in case of war. This theory collapsed in 2011 when the FBI foiled an Iranian plot to kill the then Saudi Arabia ambassador to the U.S. in an attempt that, if successful, would assuredly have produced mass casualties. The willingness to inflict mass casualties has remained a common theme in Iranian “state” terrorism. In 2018, a failed Iranian scheme to bomb a dissident gathering in Paris would have killed hundreds, including former U.S. officials. While the perpetrators were arrested, tried, and convicted in European courts, no serious action was taken against Tehran.\n\n\n\nRecently, the FBI thwarted an attempted kidnapping and murder of Iranian American activist Masih Alinejad in Brooklyn, intervened to stop an Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps murder plot against former National Security Advisor John Bolton, and disrupted a plan to assassinate former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. There are multiple threats against other American citizens and former U.S. officials, including former Secretary of Defense Mark Esper.\n\n\n\nSalman Rushdie, who is under threat of execution from Iran after the publication of The Satanic Verses, was stabbed repeatedly while speaking in New York this month. The attacker made no secret of his devotion to the Supreme Leader and had been in direct contact with members of the IRGC on social media. Iranian state media loudly applauded the murderous assault.\n\n\n\nIran’s systematic targeting of Americans has grown to an unprecedented level. A recent Washington Institute for Near East Policy study of Iran-related assassinations, abductions, and surveillance operations targeting American and Western interests found at least 105 cases since 1979. A majority of these operations occurred in the past decade. There is no comparable example of another country targeting Americans on American soil. To be clear, this activity isn’t that of an individual terrorist, terrorist group, or a state sponsor of terrorism. This is the action of a “terror state.” While we firmly believe targeting American citizens constitutes an act of war, we ponder how many Americans must be targeted or killed for naysayers to admit such aggression constitutes an act of war. Is it two, five, ten, 100?\n\n\n\nWe see responses to Iranian terror are similar in nature and fecklessness. Compromised Iranian operatives are prosecuted by law enforcement, sanctions are sometimes levied against Iranian interests (with no financial assets in the West), and policymakers issue press statements claiming that a “successful attack” will be met with “serious consequences.” Little to no consequences guarantees Iran’s continued planning of such attacks. Without consequences, Iranian “state” terror continues, its pace dictated by Tehran’s resources and the ability of Western governments to frustrate operations.\n\n\n\nHistorically, U.S. terror policy has been bolder. In 1993, President Clinton authorized an attack on Iraqi intelligence as a “firm and commensurate” response to Iraq's attempt to assassinate former President George Bush. Yet, a military response against Iran is routinely condemned by some who argue that any such military operation will escalate into a conventional conflict. These same voices often describe those who disagree with this position as war mongers, stifling a long-overdue policy debate.\n\n\n\nThe consequences of the current approach reinforce Tehran’s belief that it can act with impunity and undercut U.S. credibility. If Washington won’t respond to “state” terrorist actions constituting an act of war on its homeland and missile attacks on countries that are home to thousands of U.S. citizens, allies and partners inevitably will question Washington’s reliability. A failure to respond to these acts of war makes more of these acts of war more likely and hence war more likely.\n\n\n\nGreat risk comes from a policy that reinforces Tehran’s belief that its attacks may be undertaken at no cost.\n\n\n\nSeveral steps deserve immediate consideration. First, the U.S. should deny the Iranian president and his representatives a visa to the United States for the upcoming UN General Assembly and use this event to rally support against Iranian “state” terrorism. To send a clear message, the U.S. should designate Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei as a terrorist under U.S. and international authorities. Much has been made of our revitalized relationship with Europe and our Arab partners. We should work with these countries to ensure that they reject meetings with senior Iranian diplomats and ensure that Iran understands that its diplomatic isolation is the result of its “state” terrorism. Last, we should advise Iran unequivocally that we consider “state” terrorism against U.S. persons as an act of war. Absent a determined policy response to deter Iran, further attacks may ignite the conventional conflict we all wish to avoid.\n\n\n\nTehran will respond defiantly. We should expect attacks on our forces in Iraq or Syria to test our fortitude. Nevertheless, a serious multipronged approach will ignite debate among Iran’s leadership as to whether “state” terrorism is worth the potential costs, including a military conflict.\n\n\n\nAbsent a different approach to Tehran’s aggression, we risk Iran achieving a catastrophic success that cannot be viewed as anything other than an act of war resulting in war. Our restraint should not be the very cause of such a disastrous outcome.\n\n\n\nMark D. Wallace, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations for Management and Reform, is CEO of United Against Nuclear Iran (UANI).\n\n\n\nNorman Roule is a former National Intelligence Manager For Iran at the Office of the Director of National Intelligence and a senior advisor to UANI.\n\n\n\nFrances F. Townsend served as assistant to President George W. Bush for Homeland Security and Counterterrorism and is a senior advisor to UANI.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/changing-america/sustainability/climate-change/3613755-why-are-populations-of-alpine-bees-declining/",
        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew research underscores the negative impact of climate change on alpine bee populations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccording to 60 years’ worth of data, bees in alpine regions are in an evolutionary rut, unable to adapt to warmer temperatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis means bees from more southern regions can exploit resources alpine bees miss out on, contributing to the species's eventual demise.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEfforts to protect at-risk bumble bee populations are not new, as declining numbers have been reported in several states.\n\n\n\nHowever, new research out of Webster University in Missouri points to climate change as a likely cause for lower rates of bumble bees in alpine regions, or high elevation areas above timberlines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWriting in the journal Global Change Biology, researchers investigated “whether bumble bee responses generate mismatches with floral resources, and whether these mismatches in turn promote community disruption and potential species replacement.”\n\n\n\nBees are essential to both humans and the environment as their work contributes directly to food security. According to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization, one third of the world’s food production depends on bees.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe alpine study began in 2012 and experts assessed bee population data from three peaks in the Rocky Mountains. Researchers also analyzed data on the species collected over 60 years, and found the bees have a low tolerance for warming temperatures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the earth warms, bees from lower elevations thrive and could potentially displace these vulnerable organisms. This phenomenon would lead to extinction of the alpine bee in the near future.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“We predict the local extinction of species in areas where the alpine bees can‘t migrate further upslope, where the weather is cooler and the growing season still remains short,” said study co-author Nicole Miller-Struttmann, an associate professor of biology at Webster University in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They are not responding to the temperature changes fast enough because they are stuck in an evolutionary trap.”\n\n\n\nWarmer spring temperatures also mean earlier flowering of the bees’ preferred resources, authors explained. These temperature range-stable alpine bees might fall behind range-expanding bees when it comes to pollinating, due to a mismatch in timing of these seasonal events.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn addition, because alpine regions are typically cold, summer flower growing seasons are short, while the alpine bees likely adapted to this shorter time by limiting their foraging activity and reproductive phase. Now that longer, warmer seasons are more common, the bees miss out on flowers at later times, researchers explained.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn contrast, lower elevation bees are more flexible with their schedules as they’re accustomed to warmer weather, meaning they can exploit these missed resources.\n\n\n\n“Results suggest that conversion of historic habitats for cold-adapted alpine bumble bee species into refugia for more heat-tolerant congeners is disrupting bumble bee communities at high elevations,” authors wrote, although precise mechanisms behind these shifts remain unknown.\n\n\n\nThe evolutionary history of alpine bees means they’re only able to collect nectar and pollen during a short window — which is the same normal growing season in high elevations recorded half a century ago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As the climate warms and becomes more variable, organisms specialized to past conditions are declining, be it bumble bees or penguins,” said co-author Candace Galen, professor emerita at the University of Missouri at Columbia.\n\n\n\n“We are losing biodiversity at a rapid clip, and with it the ecological services including pollination services that enrich and sustain our lives.”&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3613751-ftc-drops-zuckerberg-from-lawsuit-over-virtual-reality-company-purchase/",
        "description": "The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) entered an agreement with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday to drop him from an ongoing antitrust lawsuit attempting to block the company’s purchase of a virtual reality company.\n\n\n\nA joint court filing stipulates that Zuckerberg will not purchase the company, Within Unlimited, as an individual or through any entity controlled by Zuckerberg in exchange for being removed as a defendant in the suit.\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by the FTC late last month, accuses Meta of a years-long “campaign to conquer VR” that began as early as March 2014, when then-Facebook acquired headset-maker Oculus VR.\n\n\n\nFacebook, which also owns Instagram and WhatsApp, rebranded itself as Meta last year as the company sought to refocus its efforts on the so-called metaverse and virtual reality industry.\n\n\n\nThe suit targets Meta’s attempt to buy Within Unlimited, a virtual reality developer that designed fitness app Supernatural. The app enables users to participate in workout sessions set to music from prominent artists while in a virtual reality environment that mimics destinations across the globe.\n\n\n\nThe FTC alleges Meta “is trying to buy its way to the top” rather than competing on the merits, but Meta has contested the accusations as being “based on ideology and speculation, not evidence.”\n\n\n\n“The idea that this acquisition would lead to anticompetitive outcomes in a dynamic space with as much entry and growth as online and connected fitness is simply not credible,” Meta said in a statement when the suit was filed. “By attacking this deal in a 3-2 vote, the FTC is sending a chilling message to anyone who wishes to innovate in VR.”\n\n\n\nThe three Democratic FTC commissioners voted to sue Meta over its acquisition of Within Unlimited, while the two Republican commissioners voted against the move.\n\n\n\nFTC Chairwoman Lina Khan has taken aim at Big Tech since assuming the post in June 2021, and the lawsuit has been one of her most prominent moves atop the commission.\n\n\n\nMeta, which remains a defendant in the suit, declined to comment on the latest filing. The FTC also declined to comment.\n\n\n\nThe tech giant’s change in focus comes as the company faces hurdles in its social media business.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nApple rolled out a privacy feature allowing users to block their data from being tracked across apps and websites, creating further roadblocks for Facebook’s targeted advertising business as it also faces stiff competition from TikTok and the threat of a recession.\n\n\n\nMeta’s overall revenue dropped to $28.8 billion in the quarter ending in June, and its Facebook platform reported its first-ever user loss at the end of 2021.\n\n\n\nFacebook's rebrand to Meta in October also came as the company faced increased scrutiny following whistleblower Frances Haugen’s leaking of internal company documents.\n\n\n\n— Updated at 10:21 a.m.",

This is an inarguably bad deal for poor countries, which is why the USA didn't respect foreign patents until they became a net patent exporter.\nOne way this can go horribly wrong? Pharmaceuticals. The marginal costs of producing most drugs are very low, but Big Pharma wants to charge all the traffic can bear &#8211; markups of tens of thousands of percent! They say this is to recoup R&amp;D, but R&amp;D costs are largely borne by public institutions, with pharma giants privatizing the gains from those public expenditures.\nOnce a drug is invented and tested, it can be made very cheaply, so poor countries could benefit from it, even given their very modest means, and poor countries can't afford to pay rich world prices. Cheap drug prices for the global south won't cut into full-price sales for the poorest 3 billion people. They're not ever gonna pay US prices.\nBut this still would be bad for pharma's business model, which is predicated on raking in those five-figure margins from people in the rich world, some of whom are quite poor (thanks, inequality!). If there's a low-cost source of pharma's products somewhere else in the world, then desperate people in the rich world will figure out how to import those low-cost drugs, and a giant pharma company's stock buybacks and dividends will be reduced from hella-billions to mere umpty-billions.\nSo if you're a poor country, signing onto the WTO and the TRIPS means that nearly everyone in your country just won't have access to lifesaving drugs. This is such an obvious bad deal that the WTO negotiators from the global south balked at it, so the WTO threw them a bone: IP Waivers.\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/05/25/the-other-shoe-drops/#quid-pro-quo\nHere's how those (are supposed to) work: if there's a terrible emergency, say, a pandemic, then the WTO can grant \"IP Waivers\" to poor countries, which say, \"Since this is such an humanitarian disaster, we're going to temporarily lift your obligation to respect rich, offshore corporations' patents. You can make their drugs, or import them from another poor country that's doing so.\" Sometimes these waivers make it free to use foreign companies' patents, other times, they set a fixed cost (a \"compulsory license\") for practicing a patent.\nIP Waivers are as much as part of the global patent system as patent protections are: they're the quid-pro-quo that justified poor countries' tying their own hands and agreeing not to make drugs that would improve the quality of life for the people who live there.\nBut corporatists and Ayn Rand trufans hate IP Waivers. Back when South Africa and other global south countries were in danger of collapsing under the AIDS pandemic, they petitioned the WTO for an IP Waiver for AIDS drugs, which were otherwise priced beyond their means.\nThey had a real shot at it, too! But then, the Gates Foundation (yes, that Gates Foundation) sent its operatives to Geneva to argue against any such thing, insisting sovereign countries should beg rich foreigners to donate medicine to them, and if the rich foreigners didn't want to, they should just let their people die and their nation fail:\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/04/13/public-interest-pharma/#gates-foundation\nGates and his Foundation epitomize the idea that the only way to organize public health issues is through the whims of unaccountable billionaires, rather than democratically elected governments. When Oxford University announced plans to make its vaccine patent-free, Gates changed their mind, talking them into an exclusive deal with Astrazeneca instead:\nhttps://khn.org/news/rather-than-give-away-its-covid-vaccine-oxford-makes-a-deal-with-drugmaker/\nRather than trusting billions in the global south to decide how to make and distribute vaccines, Gates set up a program called COVAX, whereby rich people and rich countries could donate covid vaccines &#8211; enough to treat just a tiny slice of the world's poorest people.\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/162000/bill-gates-impeded-global-access-covid-vaccines\nMeanwhile, at the WTO, the global south showed up calling for an IP Waiver for covid vaccines. The rich world's pharma companies having laid out plans to delay vaccination until 2025 for 2.5 billion people in 125 countries, the case for a covid vax waiver was very strong.\nBig Pharma went on the offensive. They paid ghoulish \"experts\" &#8211; like Howard Dean, now an unregistered pharma lobbyist &#8211; to spread the racist lie that poor brown people are too stupid to make their own vaccines (the largest vaccine factories are in the global south).\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/05/21/wait-your-turn/#vaccine-apartheid\nThey also promoted the dangerous, medically incoherent theory that poor people should \"wait their turn.\" This isn't merely an inhumane, vicious ideology, it's also a recipe for cooking up lot of covid variants, including those that escape vaccine immunity and re-infect people in the rich world. Leaving 2.5 billion people unvaccinated for years and years, incubating variant after variant, is the gift that keeps on giving&#8230;to the virus.\nThe idea that we can deny vaccines to half the world is like the idea that we can create a swimming pool with a \"pissing\" and \"non-pissing\" end, and doom all the people who can't afford the pay toilets to swim in the pissing end &#8211; without all of us marinating in piss.\nIt's&#8230;ironic? Tragic? Tragironic? Because, of course, the vaccines were made with public money &#8211; direct state intervention in the market, in the form of R&amp;D and production subsidies and purchase guarantees. The people insisting that unfettered markets are the only way to produce vaccines are manifestly wrong.\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/05/16/entrepreneurial-state/#patient-zero-money\nTo its credit, the Biden administration backed the IP Waivers, but they didn't throw a lot of weight behind it, and the corporate lobby outmaneuvered them, killing waivers by arguing that any kind of IP Waiver would be the end of vaccine production forever:\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/05/10/comrade-ustr/#vaccine-diplomacy\nBut now, a trove of Trump administration documents that Knowledge Ecology International (KEI) forced the US government to release shows that these very same pharma companies enjoyed luxuriant, expansive IP Waivers of their own. Writing in The Intercept, Lee Fang details how Moderna, in particular, demanded and received waivers:\nhttps://theintercept.com/2022/08/23/covid-vaccine-patents-moderna-big-pharma-section-1498/\nAll in all, the Trump admin granted IP Waivers to 62 US companies making drugs, PPE, and medical equipment. These waivers allowed their recipients to march into their rivals' patent rights and seize them, without permission, in order to produce the drugs, supplies and equipment needed to fight the virus.\nThese waivers were granted under 28USC§1498 (aka Section 1498), a rule that allows government contractors to demand a compulsory license to their rivals' patents, indemnifying them &#8211; and often, the government &#8211; from patent liability. Beneficiaries of the S1498 waivers include Moderna, but also  Corning, Eli Lilly, Merck, Qiagen, Sanofi and Siemens.\nS1498 dates back to 1910 and came into widespread use in WWI, when the US government expropriated the Wright Brothers' airplane patents to create an air force. S1498 got another lift in WWII, under similar circumstances.\nIt has been quiescent since, and, indeed, the Trump administration kept its use of waivers a secret. KEI was tipped off to their use thanks to a lawsuit filed by two of Moderna's competitors, who complained that Moderna \"simply used the patented technology without paying for it or even asking for a license.\"\nKEI cofounder James Love told Fang that he supports the use of waivers for covid vaccines: \"I'm glad they did it.\" But he pointed out that even as Moderna was relying on these waivers, they were also denouncing the idea of waivers for poor countries as an existential risk to all pharma research.\nMeanwhile, Moderna's vaccine was \"really one of the most profitable biopharmaceutical products of all time.\" The CEO who oversaw its production has liquidated $400m in stock. The company received $2.48b in public subsidy to make the vaccine.\nAnyway, enjoy your variants.

        "description": "Shortly after the FBI executed a search warrant on Mar-a-Lago to investigate whether former President Donald Trump was in possession of certain classified documents, the charges started flying that the move made the U.S. look like a “Banana Republic.”\n“The raid of MAL is another escalation in the weaponization of federal agencies against the Regime’s political opponents, while people like Hunter Biden get treated with kid gloves. Now the Regime is getting another 87k IRS agents to wield against its adversaries? Banana Republic,” Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis tweeted.\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich wrote, “I think we are wavering between restoring the rule of law and the Constitution and decaying into a third-world banana republic system of greed, dishonesty, political power, and law breaking on a grand scale.”\nIt’s true that few American presidents have found themselves on the wrong side of the criminal justice system — just one has ever been arrested (read to the end of this piece to find out who). But plenty of other countries have arrested, indicted or imprisoned their current or former leaders, and it’s not a mark against their health as a democracy. Quite the contrary.\nThe evidence shows that free countries — those that have strong records of protecting political rights and civil liberties — are just as likely to hold their current and former leaders accountable as unfree countries. In fact, such moves are slightly more likely to make countries freer than less free, as well as enable free countries to keep their republic intact.\nThat’s the clear conclusion from a review of 243 cases from 1972 through 2021, where current or former chief executives have been arrested, indicted or imprisoned. These include presidents, premiers and prime ministers, as well as even emperors and monarchs. My students and I looked at a Freedom House dataset to see if the country was considered free, partly free, or not free at the time of the arrest, indictment and imprisonment. We then looked at whether the country’s freedom level designation changed within five years of the arrest (except for cases originating after 2020).\n\nOf the 243 cases since 1972, 74 involved a free state that sought to hold a current or former leader accountable in the judicial system. In 76 other situations, a “not free” state arrested, indicted or imprisoned a former leader or current occupant. In the remaining 93 cases, it was a partly free country whose government pursued an existing or ex-leader on a legal charge. As that breakdown makes clear, legal action has taken place across the board.\nFinally, our data also underscores that holding leaders accountable does not send a country spiraling downward. Within five years of legal action toward a current or former leader, the country kept the same freedom designation in most cases (185 times). In 31 additional examples, the country actually became freer. In the remaining 27 scenarios, the country became less free, with 13 cases resulting in a country temporarily losing its free designation. More than 80 percent of free countries maintained their threshold even after judicially detaining a current or former leader.\nFor perhaps the best comparison to the United States, we can take a more in-depth look at the most developed countries, those that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That offers 27 cases to examine — and of these, only two OECD countries became less democratic within five years of arresting a current or former head of state: Mexico and Turkey.\nHere are a few of the key examples in which OECD countries took legal action against their current or former leaders:\nColombia:&nbsp;Ex-President Álvaro Uribe was ordered by Colombia’s Supreme Court to be placed under house arrest in August 2020 on accusations of witness tampering after he accused a leftist lawmaker of bringing false charges against him in 2012. Uribe was allowed to go free two months later as an investigation continued.\nFrance: France has had two notable cases in recent years. Former President Nicolas Sarkozy was charged with corruption by French prosecutors in two cases after he left office and was ultimately convicted in 2021; he served a year in jail and another year under home confinement. Meanwhile, French Prime Minister Francois Fillon was charged with embezzlement in 2017; he was later convicted of fraud and misuse of funds and was sentenced to five years in prison, though after appeals, he eventually served just one year in prison.\nIceland: Geir Haarde, Iceland’s prime minister from 2006 to 2009, was indicted for his handling of the financial crisis and the collapse of Iceland’s banks. He ultimately was convicted for failing to hold Cabinet meetings during the crisis but was not sentenced to jail.\nIsrael: In 2016, Ehud Olmert, the former prime minister of Israel, was sentenced to eight months in prison over convictions of accepting bribes and obstruction of justice, though Olmert’s bribery conviction was partially overturned. More recently, Benjamin Netanyahu has been indicted for corruption though a trial has not concluded.\nItaly: Silvio Berlusconi, the former prime minister of Italy, was convicted and sentenced to four years in jail for tax fraud in 2013. Because of his old age, Berlusconi was exempt from direct imprisonment and instead served his time by doing community service. But now he’s trying to make a political comeback, with a run for senator.\n\n\n\nJapan: Kakuei Tanaka, a former prime minister of Japan, was arrested in 1976 for allegedly accepting roughly $2 million in bribes from Lockheed Corp. He was found guilty of the charges in 1983 and sentenced to four years in jail but was allowed to remain free and the charges were eventually wiped away in an appeal. He remained one of the most powerful forces in Japanese politics even after the allegations.\nMexico: Luis Echeverría, a former president of Mexico, spent time under house arrest from 2006 to 2009 for his role in allegedly fueling the 1968 massacre of student protesters. Ultimately, the charges of genocide were eventually dismissed.\nPortugal: José Sócrates, the former prime minister of Portugal, went to prison and then spent months under house arrest from 2014-15 on corruption charges. He is now awaiting trial for money laundering and falsifying documents.\nOther OECD countries with former leaders who have faced legal charges include Turkey, South Korea, Poland, Greece and Slovenia.\nAs for the answer to the trivia question up above, the only U.S. president to be arrested was Ulysses S. Grant. In December 1872, Grant was caught speeding in his horse and buggy in the nation’s capital. He paid a $20 bond but didn’t show up in court.\nKarson Troth, Cooper Dolhancyk, Nicole Morales, Tamino Schoeffer, Emaleigh Turner and Katie Gonzalez contributed to this report.",

        "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/24/monkeypox-vaccine-lgbtq-00053410",
        "description": "The Biden administration’s strategy for stretching scarce monkeypox shots is instead leading to fewer vaccinations and could worsen racial health disparities.\nThe federal government last week slashed the number of vials states received in anticipation of each being able to vaccinate up to five people per vial instead of one.\nBut health officials in half a dozen states told POLITICO that they are routinely able to extract only three or four doses per vial, meaning they were able to vaccinate fewer people last week than if the federal government had made no changes at all because of the drastically reduced allocations.\nThese officials have had to scramble to reorganize their vaccination efforts — canceling clinics, rescheduling staff and delaying plans to expand eligibility.\nAnd, even though the federal government made more vaccines available for states to order on Monday, states warn that they still do not have enough doses to contain a rapidly spreading outbreak that has infected nearly 16,000 people to date as public health experts fear the window of opportunity for stopping the virus’s spread is closing.\n\n\n\n“The federal government has patted themselves on the back for how they’re accelerating the delivery of vaccines,” said Patrick Ashley, senior deputy director at Washington, D.C.’s Department of Health. “What they did is they moved numbers around.”\nIn Washington, D.C., which has more monkeypox cases per capita than anywhere in the U.S., health officials anticipated the new dosing strategy — where a smaller amount of vaccine is injected into the outer layer of the skin — would allow them to stretch the 12,000 vials they had been promised to 60,000 doses; instead, they received 2,400 vials, a fifth of the original number. And when the latest vaccine allocation came early this week, they were allotted about 4,000 vials.\nThat’s left D.C. with a little more than half of the vials it was expecting. And providers are only “occasionally” able to get five doses out of a vial, Ashley said.\nIt’s the latest hiccup the administration is facing amid broad criticism over its monkeypox response, its messaging to LGBTQ communities about the virus’s risks and its failure to supply enough vaccines to immunize those most susceptible to contracting it.\n“This week has been frustrating just because you think you’re getting a certain amount, it’s not that much, and then you can’t get as many doses out of the vial,” said Marcus Plescia, chief medical officer at the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials. “This is probably going to result in some chaos out in the field where people are getting turned away because they run out.”\n\nFederal health officials emphasize that this is not a static public health response, and say they are continuously coordinating with states and cities to make sure they have the vaccines they need.\n“We are working very hard to make it clear that if you are in a supply-constrained atmosphere, you will get more supply,” a senior administration official told POLITICO, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive details of the administration’s monkeypox response.\nThough states are being sent vaccines based on a five-doses-per-vial calculation, the administration recognizes that some practitioners are not getting all five doses, and is encouraging states to submit data on the vaccines’ administration so it can adjust its response if needed, the official said.\nNevertheless, some public health experts are criticizing the federal vaccination strategy for forcing state and local health departments to scale back their vaccine outreach when they should be ramping it up. And some fear the approach could widen already stark racial disparities in monkeypox cases because Black and Latino people have higher rates than their white counterparts of a skin condition that makes them ineligible for intradermal administration.\n“The move to intradermal was meant to increase supply so that public health officials could quickly extend protection to as many people as possible,” said Caitlin Rivers, senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. Instead, “state and local health departments and their constituents are getting less.”\n\nIn Seattle, health officials have limited the number of first doses they planned to administer and delayed second doses. In Portland, Ore., the health department is warning that its supply is “still very limited.” And in Philadelphia, city officials scuttled plans they had made to significantly ramp up their vaccine operations in preparation for the switch to intradermal dosing.\n“Our plan was ready to go to do this massive expansion, and we had to call everybody back and say, ‘Put a hold on that. We’re not getting additional doses out of this. We’re getting the same amount of doses, we just have to use them in this split way,’” said James Garrow, a spokesperson for Philadelphia's public health department. “Everybody expected to see this wide expansion of eligibility and now it isn’t happening.”\nAnd while federal health officials made an additional 360,000 vials, or up to 1.8 million doses, available to states to order on Monday — ahead of schedule — states say the allocation represents just a fraction of the vials they were counting on a week ago.\n“The challenge that we’re most concerned about [is] the overall limitations on vaccine supply,” said Jess Nelson, a spokesperson for Washington state’s health department.\nFederal health officials say that they’re trying to nimbly respond to a fast-changing situation. They say the new fractional dosing strategy, and the policy changes that accompany it, are necessary steps to respond to an evolving outbreak with a limited vaccine supply.\nThe plan is partly based on a 2015 study from the National Institutes of Health that showed that administering a two-dose series of one-fifth of a vial of the monkeypox vaccine between layers of skin is at least as effective as a subcutaneous injection with the one-vial dose.\nLast week, the federal government started sending out vaccine orders to states based on the calculation that there should be five viable doses in each vial. At present, a jurisdiction cannot order more vaccines until it has used 85 percent of its current supply.\n\nIn some places, practitioners say the rollout is working as planned.\nAcross Los Angeles, St. John’s Community Health has administered hundreds of vaccine doses per day under the new strategy at clinics in Black and Latino neighborhoods, both communities that are disproportionately impacted by the outbreak.\nJim Mangia, president and CEO of St. John’s, said the clinics’ staff easily pivoted to intradermal administration, as they were already familiar with the technique from a similarly administered TB test. He said they have also consistently extracted five doses per vial, because they have syringes with the right specialized needles on hand. (Some more common types of needles leave a small amount of vaccine behind after each dose, therefore making it harder to get the full five doses from each vial.)\n“It’s a total game changer,” said Mangia. “It allowed us to vaccinate more than 1,500 people in the last week.”\nIn other clinics, where staff hasn’t been trained on intradermal administration, or that don’t have the right needles on hand, catching up with the changing federal guidance has been harder.\nIn North Carolina, which mandated all practitioners switch to intradermal dosing beginning next week, David Wohl, a professor of infectious disease at the UNC School of Medicine, said UNC hospitals are “scrambling” to train staff at clinics to administer the vaccine by the deadline.\n“Is it impossible? No,” Wohl said. “Is it another series of hoops that we have to jump through? Yes.”\nSome local health officials and providers are particularly concerned about the impact of the new federal vaccine allocation strategy on Black and Latino men, who make up the majority of known monkeypox cases in the U.S. but are the least likely to be vaccinated.\nWohl said he thinks the intradermal dosing may work, but the sudden shift has communities of color wondering whether they’re being offered an inferior vaccine.\n“When we change things mid-course — when we move the goalposts or change the rules of the game — people get frustrated,” he said. “People are saying now in some of our outreach efforts, ‘Wait a second, you're now reaching out to Black and Latino communities and you're giving us a fifth of the dose that you gave to the white people? What's up with that?’”\n\nOthers worry that the new federal allocation strategy assumes states will be able to get five doses out of each vial when some people may not be able to receive the vaccine intradermally — including people with a history of keloid scarring. Keloids are more common among dark-skinned people of African, Asian and Hispanic descent, where the incidence of the skin condition ranges from 4.5 to 16 percent.\nPeople with a history of keloid scarring can still receive the monkeypox vaccine, but one-fifth the dose will not suffice. Local health officials said that wouldn’t be a problem if they had received the full allocation they were expecting, but, with limited vaccines, repeated subcutaneous shots could quickly deplete supplies — especially as they work to boost vaccination rates in communities of color.\n“There are internal conversations we’ve had about how best to manage that because in Philadelphia, according to data we just published, the majority of our cases are in Black Philadelphians, and they’re more likely to have keloids,” Garrow said. “We don’t want to say, ‘Well, you just don’t get one now.’”\nThe administration has said it will work with states to adjust vaccine orders if they have to administer a large number of full doses.\nAnd since the Food and Drug Administration’s emergency use authorization for the vaccine earlier this month, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has released information to help states and cities train providers how to administer the new dose, as well as holding training calls with practitioners.\n“I hope as providers get more proficient with the technique, this will improve,” said Claire Hannan, executive director of the Association of Immunization Managers.",

        "description": "The fate of President Joe Biden’s agenda could soon rest with the administrator of a tiny office deep within the White House.\nBut first, Biden needs to decide who that administrator will be.\nAfter leaving the office without a permanent leader for the first 18 months of Biden's presidency, the White House is closer to picking someone to run its Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs. The obscure unit is nonetheless poised to wield outsized influence over the administration’s policy ambitions, especially if Democrats lose control of either congressional chamber this fall.\nThe office serves as a gatekeeper for rulemaking government-wide, coordinating, vetting and approving hundreds of federal regulations each year. It has final say over which agency priorities get fast-tracked and which get put on ice, and it will play a direct role in implementing major elements of Democrats' just-passed climate, health and tax law.\n“The future of the Biden agenda rests on how efficiently large groups of people can edit Word documents,” said one administration official. “When everyone’s aligned, they can move fast. But sometimes, it’s death by a thousand cuts.”\nAbsent full control of Congress, the administration’s only sure path to advancing its goals across a range of top policy issues will be through regulatory action — giving OIRA broad power to shape the final two years of Biden’s term.\nThat lengthy to-do list includes quarterbacking agency efforts to roll out more stringent environmental regulations, deliver on Biden's vow to lower health care costs and alter parts of the tax code.\nIt will need to clear rules bolstering infrastructure programs and review new immigration initiatives underway at the Homeland Security Department — all while coordinating around the dozens more mundane rules required to keep the government running.\n\n“OIRA is always at the center of administrative activity — the joke is it’s the most powerful agency nobody’s ever heard of,” said Sharon Block, who served as its acting chief through Biden’s first year. “Now, it becomes even more important.”\nSince the office’s creation roughly 40 years ago, no recent administration has waited this long to nominate a permanent OIRA administrator. Block, who said she had no interest in the permanent job, left in February and the position has since been filled by another interim leader, Dominic Mancini, a 20-year veteran of the office.\nWhite House officials have waffled for months over selecting a nominee, four people familiar with the process said, distracted by the various crises facing the administration and confounded by an ideological battle over OIRA that’s served as a microcosm of the fissures within the Democratic Party.\nProgressive lawmakers and activists, still fuming over an Obama-era approach to rulemaking they contend was overly conservative and deferential to corporations, have pressed the Biden administration to break with tradition and pick a leader eager to hasten a wide array of regulations into law.\nBut economists and budget experts in the party’s establishment have pushed back, cautioning that Biden’s regulatory czar should serve more as a moderating force who prioritizes efficiency over speed — carefully weighing the merits of major regulations to determine how best to spend the administration’s limited time and resources.\n“There’s a fork in the path,” said Michael Livermore, a University of Virginia law professor who has written extensively about OIRA. “Either return to the Obama/Bush/Clinton mode of moderates or … put someone in place who’s a hardcore ideologue aligned with the more wing-y elements of the party.”\nBiden officials early in the administration signaled support for liberals in the behind-the-scenes battle over OIRA. Block, a veteran of the Obama Labor Department and Biden transition, had argued for revamping the office to minimize private-sector influence over regulations before becoming its top political official in January 2021. The administration appointed K. Sabeel Rahman, who similarly decried “corporate capture” in rulemaking, to a top post at OIRA.\nAnd Biden on his first day in office ordered a report on ideas for updating the government’s evaluation of regulations to consider less quantifiable, non-economic factors backed by progressives like public safety and racial justice.\n\nBut a year-and-a-half later, the administration has yet to finalize any of those regulatory review recommendations. And it still hasn’t nominated — let alone confirmed — a person for the lead post.\nOfficials did begin vetting Vanderbilt University law professor Ganesh Sitaraman for the office’s top job. A former aide to Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Sitaraman is a chief advocate for overhauling the government’s rulemaking process, warning the current system gives industries too much power to delay and water down regulations.\nBut the administration ultimately worried he couldn’t win support from the moderate Democratic lawmakers needed to secure confirmation in the evenly divided Senate, according to two of the people familiar with the process.\nThe White House’s search has more recently swung back toward the moderate end of the party, targeting environmental law expert Richard Revesz, the people familiar with the process said (E&amp;E News first reported he was under consideration).\nRevesz — a New York University law professor who’s been described as “a leading evangelist for rationality in governance” — has taken a more institutionalist view toward OIRA, arguing in favor of the analytical approaches to rulemaking that have frustrated liberals for years.\n“He will satisfy almost no one,” said James Goodwin, a senior policy analyst with the Center for Progressive Reform. “He will find no favor with Republicans … and he will not be supported by progressives.”\nA White House official declined to comment on the specifics of the search process, but said the administration plans to nominate “very soon” someone who it hoped would earn bipartisan support. The person added that in the meantime it has highly qualified people leading OIRA. A spokesperson for the Office of Management and Budget, which houses the 50-person OIRA, similarly said it plans to share an update \"soon\" on any changes to its regulatory review process. \n\nWhoever Biden picks is unlikely to be installed until the end of the year at the earliest, with the prospect that the confirmation process could drag into 2023. And if the Senate flips, some worry, Biden risks missing his window to shape an office tasked with managing the under-the-radar work critical to cementing his policy legacy.\nFor Biden, executing on his regulatory priorities comes with the added challenge of fending off an increasingly conservative judiciary. The Supreme Court earlier this year sharply limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s authority to regulate greenhouse gasses — a decision Democrats sought to blunt in their climate bill by specifically granting the agency the authority to tackle emissions. \nStill, the verdict has cast doubt on the administration’s ability to make ambitious administrative reforms across the board without running into immediate legal challenges, driving a further wedge between Democrats’ liberal and centrist wings. Progressives maintain the administration should go for broke and push out a wave of far-reaching regulations — challenging Republicans to sue on several fronts.\nBut that’s an approach the White House has yet to embrace, wary of getting bogged down in court battles that risk further restricting the power Biden can wield through the executive branch.\n“Frankly, I think progressives are going to be disappointed,” Livermore said of the administration’s approach to its administrative agenda. “I don’t think he has any interest in losing in the Supreme Court on a major regulatory action.”",

        "description": "President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced a new $2.98 billion security assistance package to Ukraine as the country continues to fight for its sovereignty six months after Russia’s full-blown invasion.\nThe package includes a significant amount of ammunition for Ukraine’s artillery and mortars: more than 250,000 rounds, according to a U.S. official. It also includes six National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems; a new counter-drone capability called Vampire; and additional RQ-20 Puma drones, the person said. Another person familiar said the package will include counter-battery radars. Both spoke on condition of anonymity ahead of reporter briefings planned for Wednesday.\nThe massive funding package, announced on Ukraine’s independence day, will go toward weapons and equipment provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, Biden said in a statement. The package marks the United States’ shift to a longer-term strategy to equip Ukraine to fight for years to come — while earlier shipments had focused on more immediate needs for weapons or ammunition.\n“This will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems, and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term,” Biden said in the statement.\nSix months into Russia’s invasion, there are no signs of the war abating. Both Ukraine and Russia have seen thousands of troops killed or wounded, and the United Nations estimates more than 5,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine. The State Department issued a new advisory Monday urging U.S. citizens to leave Ukraine amid fears that Russia would step up attacks on civilian infrastructure.\nThe aid announcement is meant to reaffirm the United States’ continued support for Ukraine, with Biden on Wednesday praising the country for standing “resolute and strong” amid Russia’s invasion. He added that the U.S. stands with the Ukrainian people “today and every day.”\n“The United States, including proud Ukrainian-Americans, looks forward to continuing to celebrate Ukraine as a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous state for decades to come,” Biden said.",

        "description": "The U.S. military said early Wednesday it carried out airstrikes in eastern Syria that targeted areas used by militias backed by Iran’s paramilitary Revolutionary Guard.\nThere was no immediate acknowledgment by Syria’s state-run media of the strikes hitting Deir Ez-Zor. Iran as well did not acknowledge the attack.\nOpposition war monitor the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights and activist collective Deir Ezzor 24 said the airstrikes targeted the Ayash Camp run by the Fatimiyoun group made up of Shiite fighters from Afghanistan. The war monitor reported that at least six Syrian and foreign militants were killed in the airstrikes.\nThe U.S. military’s Central Command said the strikes “took proportionate, deliberate action intended to limit the risk of escalation and minimize the risk of casualties.” It did not identify the targets, nor offer any casualty figures from the strikes, which the military said came at the orders of President Joe Biden.\n“Today’s strikes were necessary to protect and defend U.S. personnel,” Central Command spokesman Col. Joe Buccino said in a statement.\nThe colonel added the attack was in response to an Aug. 15 attack targeting U.S. forces. That attack saw drones allegedly launched by Iranian-backed militias target the al-Tanf Garrison used by American forces. U.S. Central Command described the assault as causing “zero casualties and no damage” at the time.\nDeir Ez-Zor is a strategic province that borders Iraq and contains oil fields. Iran-backed militia groups and Syrian forces control the area and have often been the target of Israeli war planes in previous strikes.\nU.S. forces entered Syria in 2015, backing allied forces in their fight against the Islamic State group.",

Nadhim Zahawi looks like being in the second category.Appointed by Boris Johnson on 5 July as he struggled in vain to remain prime minister, Zahawi is likely to be the shortest-serving chancellor since Iain Macleod died in office in 1970. Macleod was in charge of the Treasury for a month; Zahawi’s tenure will probably last only twice as long. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Known for their riotous shows, the Grammy-nominated US group have also been kicking up dust by singing about subjects from domestic abuse to mass shootings and the BLM movementWhen fiddle player Kimber Ludiker visited Colorado last month, she had just spent 10 days in bed with Covid. “The altitude was really hard on my poor recovering lungs,” says Ludiker, one of the founding members of bluegrass band Della Mae. But the trip was too special to miss: she and Avril Smith, her bandmate and partner, were taking Smith’s 11-year-old daughter to see the Chicks. “And honestly,” says Ludiker, “there would be no Della Mae without the Chicks.”In the same way that the Dallas trio broke new ground to dominate country music, Della Mae have become the most influential all-women band in bluegrass. And as a majority queer, fiercely feminist five-piece acoustic outfit, they also sing fearlessly on topics that might rile the genre’s traditionally conservative audiences. Recent albums have covered everything from domestic violence and fertility issues to the separation of families at the US border with Mexico. They also play barnstorming numbers about motorbikes and bourbon. Continue reading...",

He’s working to model what that role can entail, and being a quiet force for gender equality.\n\n“I always bristle at the idea of men as allies because men are active participants. He avoids the pitfalls many men fall into — ‘I care because I’m a husband, I’m a father, I have a mother,’” Klein told The 19th. “He just cares because he is a human being and a participant in society and is watching a fundamental constitutional right being ripped away.”\n\nHow strange.Link: https://19thnews.org/2022/08/doug-emhoff-second-gentleman-women-gender-equity/",

Republican Molinaro will also be on the ballot in a redrawn 19th district against Democrat Josh Riley. The takeaway is the same as last night. Molinaro was and is a first-rate recruit in what the Cook Report calls a dead-even district.

Ryan, the younger Ulster County executive and decorated Army veteran, prevailed after a late push to make abortion rights the centerpiece of the campaign.&#8221;\n&#8220;What should be most worrying for Republicans is that NY-19 is the kind of district they need to win to have any chance of rolling up big numbers in November.

        "link": "https://realpython.com/python-exec/",
        "description": "Python’s built-in exec() function allows you to execute arbitrary Python code from a string or compiled code input.\nThe exec() function can be handy when you need to run dynamically generated Python code, but it can be pretty dangerous if you use it carelessly. In this tutorial, you’ll learn not only how to use exec(), but just as importantly, when it’s okay to use this function in your code.\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:\n\nWork with Python’s built-in exec() function\nUse exec() to execute code that comes as strings or compiled code objects\nAssess and minimize the security risks associated with using exec() in your code\n\nAdditionally, you’ll write a few examples of using exec() to solve different problems related to dynamic code execution.\nTo get the most out of this tutorial, you should be familiar with Python’s namespaces and scope, and strings. You should also be familiar with some of Python’s built-in functions.\n\nSample Code: Click here to download the free sample code that you’ll use to explore use cases for the exec() function.\n\nGetting to Know Python’s exec()\nPython’s built-in exec() function allows you to execute any piece of Python code. With this function, you can execute dynamically generated code. That’s the code that you read, auto-generate, or obtain during your program’s execution. Normally, it’s a string.\nThe exec() function takes a piece of code and executes it as your Python interpreter would. Python’s exec() is like eval() but even more powerful and prone to security issues. While eval() can only evaluate expressions, exec() can execute sequences of statements, as well as imports, function calls and definitions, class definitions and instantiations, and more. Essentially, exec() can execute an entire fully featured Python program.\nThe signature of exec() has the following form:\nexec(code [, globals [, locals]])\n\nThe function executes code, which can be either a string containing valid Python code or a compiled code object.\n\nNote: Python is an interpreted language instead of a compiled one. However, when you run some Python code, the interpreter translates it into bytecode, which is an internal representation of a Python program in the CPython implementation. This intermediate translation is also referred to as compiled code and is what Python’s virtual machine executes.\n\nIf code is a string, then it’s parsed as a suite of Python statements, which is then internally compiled into bytecode, and finally executed, unless a syntax error occurs during the parsing or compilation step. If code holds a compiled code object, then it’s executed directly, making the process a bit more efficient.\nThe globals and locals arguments allow you to provide dictionaries representing the global and local namespaces in which exec() will run the target code.\nThe exec() function’s return value is None, probably because not every piece of code has a final, unique, and concrete result. It may just have some side effects. This behavior notably differs from eval(), which returns the result of the evaluated expression.\nTo get an initial feeling of how exec() works, you can create a rudimentary Python interpreter with two lines of code:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; while True:\n...     exec(input(\"-&gt;&gt; \"))\n...\n\n-&gt;&gt; print(\"Hello, World!\")\nHello, World!\n\n-&gt;&gt; import this\nThe Zen of Python, by Tim Peters\n\nBeautiful is better than ugly.\nExplicit is better than implicit.\nSimple is better than complex.\n    ...\n\n-&gt;&gt; x = 10\n-&gt;&gt; if 1 &lt;= x &lt;= 10: print(f\"{x} is between 1 and 10\")\n10 is between 1 and 10\n\nIn this example, you use an infinite while loop to mimic the behavior of a Python interpreter or REPL. Inside the loop, you use input() to get the user’s input at the command line. Then you use exec() to process and run the input.\nThis example showcases what’s arguably the main use case of exec(): executing code that comes to you as a string.\n\nNote: You’ve learned that using exec() can imply security risks. Now that you’ve seen the main use case of exec(), what do you think those security risks might be? You’ll find the answer later in this tutorial.\n\nYou’ll commonly use exec() when you need to dynamically run code that comes as a string. For example, you can write a program that generates strings containing valid Python code. You can build these strings from parts that you obtain at different moments in your program’s execution. You can also use the user’s input or any other input source to construct these strings.\nOnce you’ve built the target code as strings, then you can use exec() to execute them as you would execute any Python code.\nIn this situation, you can rarely be certain of what your strings will contain. That’s one reason why exec() implies serious security risks. This is particularly true if you’re using untrusted input sources, like a user’s direct input, in building your code. \nRead the full article at https://realpython.com/python-exec/ »\n        \n        [ Improve Your Python With 🐍 Python Tricks 💌 – Get a short &amp; sweet Python Trick delivered to your inbox every couple of days. &gt;&gt; Click here to learn more and see examples ]",

I tried to be too cool and mature for the instantly popular collectables, born from the blockbusting video game. I hid my starter pack from friends and played with my younger sister and cousins. I was just humouring my relatives – that was the line anyway. But I would watch the animated series or play Pokémon Blue on my Game Boy Color in our council flat, away from the critical eyes of teenage friends.Short for Pocket Monsters, Pokémon was first launched on the Nintendo Game Boy in 1996. Players became Pokémon trainers, tasked with travelling through a fictional world to collect, develop and evolve the 151 original Pokémon, battling them, and competing in eight gyms to earn badges that would give them the right to compete in the Pokémon League and bid to become a Pokémon Champion.

        "description": "Rep. Scott Perry is suing to block the Justice Department from reviewing the contents of his cell phone, which was recently seized as part of an apparent investigation into the Pennsylvania Republican's connections to former President Donald Trump’s effort to overturn the 2020 election.\nFBI agents seized Perry’s phone on Aug. 9 and transported it to the custody of DOJ's inspector general, which has helped lead the inquiry into the push by Trump and his allies to replace department leadership as part of a broader drive to keep Trump in power. Investigators have cited Perry as a key participant in that effort given his help connecting Trump with Jeffrey Clark, a DOJ official whom Trump viewed as an ally in his push.\nBut Perry indicated in his recent filing that DOJ has not yet accessed materials on his phone and is in the process of obtaining a second search warrant that would guide its review, including a process to screen out potentially privileged materials. Perry is objecting to that bid, demanding that the government be blocked from scouring his phone and that it return any data in its possession.\n“[F]ederal agents should not be given carte blanche to root around in Rep. Perry’s phone data looking for evidence that they hope might further their investigation,” Perry’s attorneys John Rowley and John Irving wrote in the 16-page suit&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/f/?id=00000182-cfd8-d145-a1ab-ffdcbeb60000&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d0d5-d881-a5ff-f1d702b90003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d0d5-d881-a5ff-f1d702b90004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">16-page suit, which was filed last week in Washington D.C. federal court but not publicly docketed until late Tuesday.\nThe case has been assigned to Judge Jia Cobb, an appointee of President Joe Biden.\nA similar process has been unfolding in the case of attorney John Eastman, a key architect of Trump’s 2020 election subversion. FBI agents, also operating on behalf of the inspector general, seized Eastman’s phone in June while he was in New Mexico. As with Perry, investigators agreed not to scour the phone’s contents until it obtained a second search warrant setting guardrails on the review. \nEastman quickly sued to force DOJ to return the phone, and he’s expected to appear at a hearing in federal court in New Mexico next month.\nPerry indicated that the warrant to seize his cell phone was authorized by Magistrate Judge Susan Schwab in the Middle District of Pennsylvania’s federal court on Aug. 2, a week before agents approached him while he was vacationing with family in New Jersey and took custody of the phone.\nPerry indicated that after his phone was seized, he and his attorney conferred with DOJ about an alternative solution to litigation. One framework proposed by the department would permit Perry’s attorneys and its investigators to jointly review Perry’s phone and hash out potential privilege issues together. But, according to Perry, DOJ demanded that he waive his immunity under the Constitution's speech and debate clause as part of the process, which Perry says he declined.\nPerry contends that the data on his phone includes material protected by attorney-client privilege, marital privilege and the constitutional provision that limits most legal action against members of Congress related to their official duties.",

        "description": "Michel Foucault talked once about wanting to change and seeing his work as a process inevitably leading to change in himself. Schools, I suspect, rarely talk with young people about that sort of thing, rarely say, \"You'll want something new for yourself, you'll want to become better at something, more skillful, more free to play in an interesting field, more ready to make a life of your own choosing. Let's talk about the kinds of experiences and activities help a young person head out in that direction.\" (And why can't I remember teachers ever talking this way?)\nHere's the Foucault quotation, from an interview in a book called Politics, Philosophy, Culture:\n\nThat’s the reason also why, when people say, “Well, you thought this a few years ago and now you say something else,” my answer is, [Laughter] “Well, do you think I have worked like that all those years to say the same thing and not to be changed?” This transformation of one’s self by one’s own knowledge is, I think, something rather close to the aesthetic experience. Why should a painter work if he is not transformed by his own painting? \n\nInteresting point he makes about the painter, too. No matter what we study, we bring into ourselves a new filter on the world, a new lens for seeing, a new set of terms and perceptions that make a portion of our experience easier to think about. Likely, too, we're making some things newly important and other things less important in our mind, installing better perceptual tools and also prejudices against thinking about this thing or that thing.\nThat's one reason why a diverse education is vital, an education in which the tools of many disciplines and the experiences of many cultures become part of our experience.\nA career-only education makes a person both smarter and dumber.\nI used to ask first-year students something like this: \"At the end of your four years here, do you want to have spent all that tuition money and all that time and energy so you can be just the same as you were when you arrived, or different?\"\nBetter would have been to also ask, \"What do you want to develop in yourself in these years? And why?\"",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3613771-9-reminders-that-despite-the-ira-climate-change-is-still-a-crisis/",
        "description": "How many thousand-year weather disasters does it take to make a crisis?\n\n\n\nJust one if you live in Houston, southern Illinois, St. Louis, eastern Kentucky, or if you visited Death Valley this month. Thousand-year floods hit them all over three recent weeks.\n\n\n\nThey are not alone. \"Rare\" weather disasters are becoming much more common. There were five 1,000-year events, one each in South Carolina, Texas, West Virginia, Maryland and Louisiana, during a one-year period in 2015-2016. Five-hundred and 100-year disasters are more frequent, too.\n\n\n\nDuring the summer of 2021, nearly one in three Americans lived in counties that suffered weather disasters. At least 388 people died in extreme hurricanes, floods, heatwaves and wildfires.\n\n\n\nInterviewed by the Washington Post, Craig Fugate, a former director of the U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), asked a question that should be on every voter's mind this November. He wondered whether the cluster of historic disasters would finally motivate Congress to do something about climate change. \"If not, what will it take?\" he asked.\n\n\n\nAn answer came from Congress at the beginning of this month. It took a Faustian bargain — a deal to make more renewable energy production contingent on more oil and gas production. I don't mean to rain on the celebration over the new law, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), and its unprecedented investment in clean energy. It is a welcome shower after a decades-long legislative drought on the climate crisis.\n\n\n\nNow we will find out whether the IRA was an anomaly or a breakthrough because the new law is the beginning, not the end, of what Congress must do, and quickly. The climate clock is ticking.\n\n\n\nWe already know some things:\n\n\n\n1) The climate's stopwatch does not work on congressional time. Its ticks are the growing parts per million of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. They are increasing at the rate of about two ppm annually. Around 350 ppm is considered safe, but we are closing in rapidly on 420 ppm.\n\n\n\n2) We can't spend our way out of climate change. The IRA's investments in clean energy are historic, exciting and essential. But they must be accompanied by sterner stuff, like a carbon price to mobilize markets and an amendment to the Clean Air Act to give the Environmental Protection Agency the explicit authority to regulate greenhouse gas pollution, whatever the source. In case carrots don't work, we will need sticks.\n\n\n\n3) The IRA demonstrates that Republicans, and some Democrats, still don't get the seriousness of the situation and apparently don't want to. We can't horse-trade our way out of the climate crisis because Nature's terms are non-negotiable. A bill with more oil production for more renewable energy does not come close to the medicine prescribed by the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, calling for \"rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented change in all aspects of society.\"\n\n\n\n4) Most Americans clearly don't understand the seriousness of their situation, either. Natural disasters displaced nearly 10 million of us from 2008 through 2020, yet the National League of Cities reports more people are moving into areas at higher risk of climate-related disasters. For example, in several eastern coastal states, new housing is being built in danger zones two to three times faster than in safer places. So, the number of people who made need federal disaster assistance is rising.\n\n\n\n5) Taxpayers should not be expected to continue underwriting the decisions of people who build their homes in harm's way. Federal spending on disaster response and recovery, along with subsidized flood insurance, make disaster victims of us all. FEMA wisely overhauled federal flood insurance last year so that premiums more accurately reflect each home's risk. Now, hundreds of thousands of floodplain residents have dropped their coverage, \"raising concerns an unprecedented number of households are financially exposed to flood damage.\" A sensible policy would be to prohibit new construction in flood-prone places. Period.\n\n\n\n6) We know that more oil and gas production is a setback. The most direct and effective response to global warming is to replace fossil fuels with carbon-free energy. Yet, to get enough votes to pass the IRA, Democrats agreed to allow oil and gas production on 62 million more acres of federal lands and waters, even though energy companies already own 9,000 approved but unused leases on 24 million acres. Meanwhile, investors are still betting on a fossil future. At mid-year, more than 4,000 miles of new pipelines were under construction, with another 17,800 miles planned.\n\n\n\nPerhaps economies of scale for clean energy technologies funded by the IRA will make the fossil-energy economy as uneconomical as it is unstable.\n\n\n\n7) We clearly have been on the wrong path. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) projected earlier this year that without significant changes in national policy, oil and gas will still be America's dominant energy sources at mid-century when the world is supposed to achieve a net-zero carbon global economy. We will have to wait for EIA’s next analysis to learn how much the IRA has changed our direction.\n\n\n\n8) We know climate change is not, and never has been, an innately partisan issue, but the GOP decided long ago to make it one. With the support of the oil and gas industry, Republicans in Congress have repeatedly blocked legislation to deal with the crisis. Not one Republican voted for the IRA. All the 1,000-year floods in the world apparently will not change this. The American people are beginning to pay the price, and it will grow much higher.\n\n\n\n9) Extreme weather can happen anywhere. We can run, but we can't hide from floods, fires, heat, drought and rising seas.\n\n\n\nAmericans should think about that when they vote this November. To paraphrase an old truism, in a democracy, we get the future we deserve.\n\n\n\nWilliam S.

        "description": "Tesla CEO Elon Musk told a customer not to “complain” about the self-driving bug issues with Tesla vehicles. \n\n\n\nA Tesla customer on Tuesday posted a series of videos on Twitter showing how the company’s new beta version of its Full Self-Driving service, 10.69, has difficulty making signaled turns, changing driving lanes and other basic tasks. \n\n\n\nThe customer also wrote in a tweet that he had to pay more than $32,000 to receive the latest updates for the vehicle’s system. \n\n\n\n“Unfortunately I have to say I'm still having to intervene to correct #FSDBeta 10.69 in my area. Still lots of work to go,” the customer wrote. “I know this is probably not a popular opinion but the focusing on the 'Chuck' complex left is getting ahead of the needs of some more basic control issues.” \n\n\n\nIn response, Musk told the customer not to update his vehicle to new beta releases if the complaints are going to continue. \n\n\n\n“10.69 is in limited release for a reason,” Musk wrote to the customer. “Please do not ask to be included in early beta releases and then complain.” \n\n\n\nMusk has encouraged social media users in the past to share critical feedback on his company’s products. \n\n\n\nMusk recently announced that Tesla will now charge customers $3,000 more for its Full Self-Driving service, Bloomberg News reported. California’s Department of Motor Vehicles has accused the company of misleading customers with its technology, and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration is investigating whether Tesla’s autopilot system is defective.",

        "description": "More changes are coming to NBC's \"Meet the Press\" as the network dedicates a growing number of resources to streaming. \n\n\n\nThe show's current executive producer, John Reiss, will serve as executive producer of&nbsp;\"Meet the Press Reports,\" a political news and talk program on the network's streaming channel NBC News Now, which launched in 2020. \n\n\n\nNBC hired David P. Gelles to replace Reiss as executive producer of the Sunday broadcast on television. Gelles, who had previously worked at NBC, rejoins the network from CNN, where he had overseen all of CNN’s political and special events programming since 2016 and helped launch several shows for that network's now-defunct streaming service CNN+. \n\n\n\nThe news was shared with network staff in a memo on Wednesday from Carrie Budoff Brown, senior vice president of \"Meet the Press.\" \n\n\n\n\"John’s new role is a big step for us as a brand and I take it as an encouraging show of support from leadership that we’re able to dedicate a singular leader to&nbsp;Meet the Press Reports,\" Budoff Brown wrote. \"I know how hard the whole team has worked to make the show a reality, and it’s my hope that this new structure will begin to ease some of the very real constraints around staffing and workload we’ve experienced in recent seasons.\" \n\n\n\nModerator and NBC News Political Director Chuck Todd also praised Reiss's work on the longest-running show in television history. \n\n\n\n\"I can’t imagine a steadier partner to have had on Sundays over during this tumultuous period of politics. John’s sixth sense for what makes a good news broadcast, and an unflappable devotion he has to good storytelling, have kept us a step ahead of our peers for six years now,\" Todd said. \n\n\n\nIn a note of his own to staff, Reiss said he will be \"concentrating on growing and expanding\" \"Meet the Press Reports\" and working on a number of other projects for the network's streaming services. \n\n\n\nNBC, like each of the other major television networks, has invested heavily in streaming over the last several years, moving Todd's daily MSNBC show to NBC News Now earlier this year.",

        "description": "Several states where reproduction rights are at risk are seeing a surge in women registering to vote following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade case, abolishing the constitutional right to abortion.\n\n\n\nAn analysis by TargetSmart Insights, a Democratic political data and data services firm, found that women are out-registering men by significant margins in states where reproductive rights are in danger of being repealed, such as Kansas, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\n\n\nIn Kansas, women out-registered men by 40 percent, making 70 percent of all new registrants women. Earlier this month, voters in the state rejected a proposed amendment that would have paved the way for the Republican-led state legislature to ban the procedure.\n\n\n\nHowever, Kansas was not the only state to see an increase in female voter registration. \n\n\n\nIn Michigan, where legal battles are taking place over abortion rights, women out-registered men by 8.1 percent since the Supreme Court's June 24 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.\n\n\n\nLast week, a state judge blocked county prosecutors from enforcing a 91-year-old law banning abortion in Michigan while courts consider a lawsuit seeking to overturn the law. \n\n\n\nIn Wisconsin, where it is now a felony for virtually any abortion to be performed, except in instances where it is needed to save the mother’s life, women have out-registered men by 15.6 percent since the Supreme Court's decision.\n\n\n\nIn Louisiana, women outpaced men in new registrations by 13 percent since the decision, while in Pennsylvania, women out-registered men by 12 percent.\n\n\n\n\"This isn't just a blue state phenomena. In fact, it is more pronounced in states where choice is more at risk, or has been eliminated by the decision,\" the CEO of TargetSmart tweeted.",

        "description": "The Democrats are riding a wave of successes the past few weeks. Gas prices edging downward, passage of the improbably named Inflation Reduction Act, successful meddling in Republican primaries and improving poll numbers have combined to make Biden and his compatriots believe they can win control of the Senate, and optimism is rising about the House.\n\n\n\nBut when you dig through the numbers, Democrats are getting ahead of themselves.\n\n\n\nIt is true that Democratic candidates are doing better than expected in several states and that Republican candidates, according to even GOP Senate leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.), are not exactly top quality. In fact, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.), Herschel Walker in Georgia and Dr. Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania are Biden-level gaffe machines. But McConnell is likely engaging in more than a little gamesmanship of lowering expectations. He also wants to make sure any blame for not taking the majority gets pinned squarely on Donald Trump.\n\n\n\nThe main ballgame is control of the Senate. Democrats are desperate not just to prevent a GOP majority but to grab two seats and escape the clutches of Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Kyrsten Sinema (D-Ariz.). In addition, it would be extremely improbable to retain control of the House. Outside of the 2002 election in the aftermath of 9/11, since 1994 the president’s party has lost an average of 53 seats in each respective midterm.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have a challenge in that they are defending 21 seats against the Democrats’ 14, although most of the GOP seats are in safe territory. The real battlegrounds are five Republican seats (Florida, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin) and four Democratic seats (Arizona, Georgia, Nevada and New Hampshire).\n\n\n\nAfter a depressing Spring, the Democrats and their backers in the media became bullish on their prospects through July and August. However, that optimism was built on a clutch of partisan polls with suspect results and low sample sizes, and a marked lack of independent polls over the summer.\n\n\n\nFor example, the anti-GOP Center Street PAC in Ohio put Republican J.D. Vance behind Democrat Tim Ryan by 11 points. Even Ryan’s own campaign could not bring itself to be that brazen, releasing a poll that had Ryan leading by just 3 points. But hopes for a Democratic romp are looking rather thin with Emerson College just releasing a poll putting Vance ahead by 3 points and the Trafalgar Group showing Vance with a 5-point lead. Trafalgar is a GOP pollster, but its polling in 2020 and 2021 has a strong track record — and is generally in line with nonpartisan results.\n\n\n\nWhile the Democratic partisan polls have put their candidates ahead in every competitive race, independent and Republican polls have produced numbers that show a mixed bag. Republican candidates are running strongest in Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. In North Carolina, Republican Ted Budd has led Democrat Cheri Beasley, with only one recent GOP poll putting them even. In Florida, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio has been well ahead of Democratic challenger Val Demings, with the sole exception of a recent University of North Florida poll. In Nevada, Suffolk has Democratic Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto ahead 45 percent to 38 percent over Republican challenger Adam Laxalt, while Trafalgar has Laxalt up by 2 points.\n\n\n\nMcConnell’s concerns and Democratic optimism are vindicated in Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In each, the independent polling puts the Democratic candidate ahead. In Arizona, Sen. Mark Kelly (D) has never trailed Republican Blake Masters, with Fox News putting Kelly up 8 points. In Pennsylvania, Dr. Oz is in need of campaign CPR if you believe Fox News, which has him behind Democrat John Fetterman by 11 points, although Trafalgar puts the margin at just 4 points. In Wisconsin, Johnson — the incumbent Republican — lags Democrat Mandela Barnes in both the Marquette Law and Fox News polls.\n\n\n\nThe numbers are not the whole story\n\n\n\nSenate Democrats have two major problems that they simply cannot solve: the disadvantage of holding the White House and a recent history of bad polling.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line for midterm elections is that they are bad for a president’s party. Even with a likely drag from the Supreme Court's Dobbs decision and the unending, unhelpful antics of Trump, Republicans look to get a boost just from being out of power. Undecided voters are more likely than not to move away from the party in power.\n\n\n\nAdding two or three points to each Republican Senate candidate is a good rule-of-thumb. Following that rule, Republicans would take Ohio, North Carolina, Florida and possibly Nevada. Herschel Walker in Georgia would be in a dead heat with incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock, and Donald Bolduc would be right on the heels of New Hampshire’s Democratic Sen. Maggie Hassan. That puts control of the Senate on a razor’s edge.\n\n\n\nEven more concerning for Democrats should be the terrible polling in 2020 and 2021. In both years, the media polls overestimated Democratic strength. And that overestimation was most severe at the state level. As bad as the state-level polling was on Trump’s numbers, it was terrible for Senate races. GOP incumbents assumed to be in trouble or in tight races breezed to reelection. Polling was mixed in 2021 with most of the nonpartisan polls off from three to eight points in New Jersey. The Virginia polling was better, but those results were complicated by Trump’s late endorsement of Glenn Youngkin — an unhelpful intrusion that likely cost Youngkin votes.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line is that control of the Senate is still very much in doubt.\n\n\n\nWhile Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin are looking to be very difficult, only Arizona looks like it is slipping out of reach. Given the tightness of the races and the cyclical advantage Republicans hold, it would not take much to push several of their candidates over the top for a majority.\n\n\n\nThe alternate is also true. The determination of Trump to meddle in races and his continued high unpopularity are a significant drag for Republicans. Given his penchant for self-destruction, he could well end up being a bigger millstone for GOP candidates that Joe Biden is for the Democrats.\n\n\n\nMcConnell could have hardly expected the slow wind-down of his political career to be derailed by an amateur campaign strategist like Donald Trump. Nor could he have imagined that Trump could pick a series of dud candidates in critical races. But the structural advantage of being out of power and the low popularity of Biden could still bail out the Republicans and make him Senate majority leader. But make no mistake: If Republicans fail to gain the majority, McConnell is going to make certain he is not the one to take the fall.\n\n\n\nKeith Naughton, Ph.D., is co-founder of Silent Majority Strategies, a public and regulatory affairs consulting firm.

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/yankees-activate-giancarlo-stanton-zack-britton-rehab.html",
        "description": "The Yankees are expected to reinstate Giancarlo Stanton, who has been on the shelf since late July due to tendinitis in his left Achilles, prior to tomorrow&#8217;s series opener in Oakland. Stanton was on the field going through a full pre-game routine yesterday, per ESPN&#8217;s Marly Rivera (Twitter link with video). The Yankees already announced following last night&#8217;s game that outfielder Estevan Florial has been optioned to Triple-A Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, which seems to further set the stage for Stanton&#8217;s return.\nStanton, 32, has had a productive season at the plate in terms of power output and run production, belting 24 homers and plating 61 runs through just 324 trips to the plate. After an excellent first two months at the plate &#8212; Stanton hit .285/.339/.523 through the end of May &#8212; he&#8217;s been more of a pure &#8220;three true outcomes&#8221; slugger in the summer months of the season.\nSince the calendar flipped to June, a whopping 56% of Stanton&#8217;s hits have been home runs (13 of 23). He&#8217;s batting just .167 in 40 games since June 1, but he&#8217;s still walking at a strong 13.1% clip and obviously flexing his power. Exactly half of his plate appearances have ended in a strikeout, walk or home run in that time. Stanton&#8217;s .167/.277/.471 slash dating back to June has dropped his season-long line to .228/.309/.498. That&#8217;s still 28% better than league average, per both wRC+ and OPS+, but the Yankees and Stanton alike will surely be hoping for a more balanced set of results when he returns.\nStanton will return to the lineup at a time when the Yankees&#8217; offense has been stumbling through one of its driest spells of the year. The Yanks are just 7-14 this month and have plated only 70 runs in those 21 contests &#8212; an average of 3.33 runs per game (all while allowing 89 runs in August). They&#8217;ve been held to four or fewer runs in 13 of their past 15 contests.\nFlorial&#8217;s return to the big leagues will prove quite brief. There was optimism among Yankee fans when he was promoted on the heels of a .286/.368/.490 showing in Scranton, but he wound up starting just three games, going 1-for-9 with four strikeouts in that tiny sample. The former top prospect, like many Yankee farmhands in recent years, has yet to receive an earnest audition at the MLB level, receiving just 50 plate appearances over the past three seasons (and hitting just .186/.302/.300 in those sparse opportunities).\nStanton isn&#8217;t the only veteran reinforcement on the horizon for the Yanks, it should be noted. Lefty Zack Britton, who has yet to pitch in 2022 while rehabbing from last year&#8217;s Tommy John surgery, is set to embark on a minor league rehab assignment today, tweets Meredith Marakovits of the YES Network.\nThe 34-year-old lefty has been a vital part of the Yankees&#8217; late-inning relief corps when healthy, logging 123 2/3 innings of 2.69 ERA ball while brandishing one of the game&#8217;s most notoriously devastating sinkers. It&#8217;ll take a bit of time for Britton to build up to readiness for a big league return, of course, but the commencement of a rehab assignment means that both he and injured closer Clay Holmes could return to the bullpen in the near future. If Holmes is back to form after a brief trip to the injured list, the Yankees can deploy two of the game&#8217;s premier sinker/grounder specialists to help lock things down late in games.",

It now seems quite possible, perhaps even probable, that the outcome of the midterms will come down to high stakes GOP redistricting wins that came right at the end of the cycle in NY, FL and OH. I don&#8217;t say that to bum anyone out or to predict that Democrats can&#8217;t win the House. It is only to note how close it seems likely to be and that those extra seats could well be in the margin. \n\n\n\nI&#8217;ve just seen it noted that it now appears that in all five post-Dobbs special elections to the House Democrats have improved on Biden&#8217;s 2020 performance by at least 2 percentage points. The story from 2020 was that Biden did well enough to beat Trump by a decent margin. But Democratic congressional candidates didn&#8217;t do as well as he did. So they&#8217;re improving on 2020, which suggests a very different midterm environment than we&#8217;ve been hearing about for months.",

        "description": "President Joe Biden on Wednesday announced a new $2.98 billion security assistance package to Ukraine as the country continues to fight for its sovereignty six months after Russia’s invasion.\n\n\n\nThe massive funding package, announced on Ukraine’s independence day, will go toward weapons and equipment provided under the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, Biden said in a statement. The package marks the United States’ shift to a longer-term strategy to equip Ukraine to fight for years to come — while earlier shipments had focused on more immediate needs for weapons or ammunition.\n\n\n\n“This will allow Ukraine to acquire air defense systems, artillery systems and munitions, counter-unmanned aerial systems, and radars to ensure it can continue to defend itself over the long term,” Biden said in the statement.\n\n\n\nSix months into Russia’s invasion, there are no signs of the war abating. Both Ukraine and Russia have seen thousands of troops killed or injured, and the United Nations estimates more than 5,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine. The State Department&nbsp;issued a new advisory&nbsp;Monday urging U.S. citizens to leave Ukraine amid fears that Russia would step up attacks on civilian infrastructure.\n\n\n\nThe aid announcement reaffirms the United States’ continued support for Ukraine, with Biden on Wednesday praising the country for standing “resolute and strong” amid Russia’s invasion. He added that the U.S. stands with the Ukrainian people “today and every day.”\n\n\n\n“The United States, including proud Ukrainian-Americans, looks forward to continuing to celebrate Ukraine as a democratic, independent, sovereign and prosperous state for decades to come,” Biden said.",

        "description": "LONDON — The U.K. will send an extra £54 million in military support to Ukraine, outgoing British prime minister Boris Johnson pledged during a flash trip to Kyiv.\n\n\n\nJohnson met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in the country&#8217;s capital Wednesday, as Ukraine marked the 31st anniversary of its independence from the Soviet Union. The day also marks six months since the second invasion of Ukrainian territory by Russia.\n\n\n\nThe U.K. prime minister, who has been ousted by his own party and is due to leave office next month, took advantage of his third visit to the country to announce a new £54-million package of military aid, which will pay for 2,000 drones — including 850 hand-launched Black Hornet micro-drones — as well as anti-tank loitering munitions requested by the Ukrainian armed forces.\n\n\n\n“Today’s package of support will give the brave and resilient Ukrainian armed forces another boost in capability, allowing them to continue to push back Russian forces and fight for their freedom,” Johnson said.\n\n\n\nThe two leaders discussed the challenges Ukraine will face this winter, and the U.K. premier restated Britain’s “unwavering support” ahead of his planned resignation on September 6, according to a readout from Downing Street.",

        "description": "The passage of time was altered for many people during the COVID-19 pandemic, ranging from difficulty in keeping track of days of the week to feeling that the hours themselves rushed by or slowed down.\nIn prior work, researchers have associated these distortions with persistent negative mental outcomes such as depression and anxiety following trauma, making them an important risk factor to target with early interventions, according to new research.\nThe study, published in the journal Psychological Trauma: Theory, Research, Practice, and Policy, documents how pervasive the experience, known as &#8220;temporal disintegration&#8221; in psychiatric literature, was in the first six months of the pandemic.\nThe researchers also found that pandemic-related secondary stresses such as daily COVID-19-related media exposure, school closures, lockdowns, and financial difficulties were predictors of distortions in perceived time.\n&#8220;Continuity between past experiences, present life, and future hopes is critical to one&#8217;s well-being, and disruption of that synergy presents mental health challenges,&#8221; says corresponding author E. Alison Holman, professor of nursing at the University of California, Irvine.\n&#8220;We were able to measure this in a nationally representative sample of Americans as they were experiencing a protracted collective trauma, which has never been done before.\n&#8220;This study is the first to document the prevalence and early predictors of these time distortions. There are relatively new therapies that can be used to help people regain a more balanced sense of time, but if we don&#8217;t know who is in need of those services, we can&#8217;t provide that support.&#8221;\nResearchers assessed results of responses regarding distorted time perceptions and other pandemic related experiences from a probability-based national sample of 5,661 participants from the National Opinion Online Research Center AmericaSpeak panel. Surveys were conducted from March 18 to April 18, 2020 and September 26 to October 26, 2020 with respondents who had completed a mental and physical health survey prior to the COVID-19 outbreak.\n&#8220;Given that distortions in time perception are a risk factor for mental health problems, our findings have potential implications for public health. We are now looking at temporal disintegration, loneliness, and mental health outcomes over 18 months into the pandemic,&#8221; Holman says.\n&#8220;This will help us gain insight into how these common experiences during the pandemic work together, so we can better understand how to help people struggling with these challenges.&#8221;\nThe National Science Foundation and a National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities Award funded the work.\nSource: UC Irvine\nThe post Many people lost sense of time during COVID pandemic appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Rep. Scott Perry (R-Penn.) has sued the Department of Justice (DOJ) to block it from accessing materials on his phone after the agency seized it earlier this month.\n\n\n\nThe filing indicates that while the government seized and made a digital copy of Perry’s phone, they are in the process of getting a warrant to review its contents.\n\n\n\nPerry’s phone appeared to have been briefly seized in connection with the DOJ’s probe into the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot following the seizure of the phones of two attorneys working closely with former President Trump to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\n\n\nPerry introduced Trump to Jeffrey Clark, then an assistant attorney general at the DOJ. Trump at the time weighed installing Clark, who was willing to forward investigations into Trump's baseless claims of election fraud, as attorney general. \n\n\n\nPerry is claiming his phone contains privileged material, something he says would violate the Constitution's Speech and Debate Clause, which protects members of Congress for actions taken in the course of their job. He also claims his phone contains information covered by attorney-client privilege and marital privilege.\n\n\n\n“Federal agents should not be given carte blanche to root around in Rep. Perry’s phone data looking for evidence that they hope might further their investigation,” his attorneys wrote in the filing, which was first reported by Politico. \n\n\n\nThe filing indicates Perry rejected an offer by the DOJ to review the contents of the phone jointly so long as he waived any Speech or Debate Clause protections.\n\n\n\nThe suit was filed in court last week, a little over a week after his phone was seized, but was not publicly docketed until Tuesday.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe combined effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and inflation have contributed to large gains in U.S. rent prices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new report from Realtor.com found that although still cheaper than urban areas, suburban rents are higher now than they were prior to COVID-19.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, landlords adjusting prices for inflation may signal a future market cool down.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic saw a resurgence in the popularity of suburban living. But a new report from Realtor.com shows the decision to exit city living for a less crowded life is not as cheap as it once was. \n\n\n\nAccording to the company’s July Rental Report, renting in suburbs is less affordable compared with renting in the city now than it was before COVID-19. \n\n\n\n“In July of 2019, urban rent was 12.4% higher than suburban rent nationally, while that premium slipped to 4.9% in the peak of suburban rent growth in July 2021 and has just ticked back up to 5.8% this July,” Realtor.com said. \n\n\n\nThe analysis also revealed renters saw a $160 increase in rent per month on average when renewing leases this year in addition to a $360 increase per month on new leases.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCompared with three years ago, the rental price advantage of suburban living vs urban living decreased by nearly 53 percent, or $68 per month, the report found.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJuly of 2022 also saw the highest U.S. median rental-price of all time at $1,879/month and national rents remain at historic highs, regardless of urban or suburban areas.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, recent survey results suggest the market may be cooling as landlords adjust renter budgets for inflation, which currently stands at 8.5 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Whether in a downtown area or suburb, staying put or making a change, renters are stuck between a rock and a hard place when it comes to affordability,” said Realtor.com chief economist Danielle Hale in a statement. \n\n\n\nHale credits a rise in remote work to the surge in demand for suburban rentals. \n\n\n\n\"At the same time, the days of smaller premiums for downtown rentals are numbered, as a return to in-office work and city life is sparking a relative uptick in urban rent growth. Put simply, renters are feeling it everywhere, but there may be some relief ahead,” she said. \n\n\n\nThe analysis also found vacancy rates in July were low while inflation rates outpaced wage growth. Rent totals in urban areas are slightly outpacing those of suburban regions, at a 12.8 percent increase vs 11.7 percent, respectively.\n\n\n\nIncreases in July rent growth were concentrated in metros throughout the South and Northeast, particularly hubs like Miami, New York, Boston and Chicago.\n\n\n\nTo carry out the analysis, researchers defined urban vs suburban areas based on zip codes within each metro and categorized percentiles of population density within the metro.&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3612836-the-media-myth-of-democratic-momentum/",
        "description": "The euphoric headlines are everywhere this month:\n\n\n\n“Democrats Enter the Fall Armed With Something New: Hope”&nbsp;(New York Times)\n\n\n\n“Democrats Are Starting to See a Path to Victory in November”&nbsp;(Vanity Fair)\n\n\n\n“Jubilant Senate Democrats head home with momentum”&nbsp;(Washington Post)\n\n\n\nMany in the media really,&nbsp;really&nbsp;want you to believe that the Democratic agenda led by President Biden is capturing the hearts and minds of voters. That what was supposed to be a red wave is now becoming a ripple, with the Blue Team instead poised to make gains in November.\n\n\n\nIt’s all wishful thinking, if recent polls — particularly one from NBC News on Sunday — are any indication. Because any objective person who understands political history knows it’s hard to envision how a president who is polling lower than any first-termer in polling history (from Truman to Trump) can possibly galvanize voters to pull the lever for his party.\n\n\n\nAccording to NBC News, Joe Biden is polling at 42 percent approval and 57 disapproval, which is unchanged from May. Reuters has the president at 38 percent approval and 57 percent disapproval. His RealClearPolitics average is hovering around 40 percent approval.\n\n\n\nBut how can that be? The Inflation Reduction Act was given a big thumbs-up by more than a few news outlets and journalists who called it a “health care and climate bill” that would reduce not just inflation but prescription drug prices, too, while saving the world from the impending doom of climate-induced destruction.\n\n\n\nThose surveyed in the NBC poll see things much differently, however.\n\n\n\nWhen asked, for example, if the Inflation Reduction Act would positively impact their lives, 71 percent said it would either have no impact or would negatively impact them. When asked if&nbsp;the country is on the right track, just 21 percent said “yes.”\n\n\n\nAs for inflation, economist Mark Zandi, who is often quoted by the White House, finds that Americans are spending more than $400 dollars per month more for crucial items such as food, gas and clothing than they were a year ago. So much for the president’s claim that the country is experiencing the financial utopia of zero inflation.\n\n\n\nThe high cost of food, in particular, is taking a toll. According to the national charity Feeding America, 45 percent of food banks are seeing&nbsp;an increase in demand, while 25 million adults, per the U.S. Census Bureau, sometimes had not eaten enough in the previous week — the highest numbers since December 2020, when the pandemic was still raging.\n\n\n\nAs for the “The United States economy is not in a recession” argument, also courtesy of Democratic leaders and many media cheerleaders, 68 percent of those polled feel we are, in fact, in a recession. Two straight quarters of negative growth, and with price increases still at a 40-year high, tend to feed that perception.\n\n\n\nLooking ahead to November’s midterm elections, 47 percent of registered voters prefer Republicans winning control of Congress, while 45 percent want Democrats in charge, per NBC.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2010, President Obama, polling higher at the time than Biden is today, lost 63 seats when congressional ballot polling showed a 2-point edge for the GOP in the summer of that year.\n\n\n\nAs for abortion being a huge issue in the coming election, following the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, think again:&nbsp;It ranks sixth, with just 8 percent saying it is the most important issue to them. Climate change, a big part of legislation in the Inflation Reduction Act, clocked in with 9 percent saying it was most important to them.\n\n\n\nSo, given all these numbers from a poll that was weighted more towards Democratic voters than Republican, what’s the source of all the Democratic momentum seen by those who cover this stuff? &nbsp;\n\n\n\nPerhaps it’s something which, in the sales world, is called “hopecasting,” a term applied to those hoping for a result to become true rather than looking at facts and numbers.\n\n\n\nA CNN piece that wasn’t labelled as opinion&nbsp;recently declared: \"Next time you stop at a gas station, think of it as a $100-a-month tax cut. Or a maybe $100-a-month raise. The steady drop in gas prices over the last few months has turned into an unexpected form of economic stimulus, coming at a time when the Federal Reserve is trying to cool the economy and battle rising prices with higher interest rates.\"\n\n\n\nGet that? Because gas prices have fallen from an all-time high in recent weeks, you just earned a $100 raise! Sure, gas prices are still 75 cents higher than they were a year ago, but that doesn't count, apparently. It's like your company cut your pay by $200, only to give you a bonus that equals half of the cut and called it a raise. \n\n\n\nIn the&nbsp;end, the&nbsp;perception of Biden&nbsp;as president is still there: too old, too slow to react to crises, as polls show. And inflation is still there.&nbsp;Gas prices&nbsp;are still where they are and could begin to rise again, according to top analysts. Crime is still a huge issue, and so is the U.S. border. This may be the reason why so many Democratic candidates&nbsp;don't want to campaign with Biden&nbsp;or feature him in ads.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnless conditions on the ground change, don’t expect the president’s poll numbers or his party’s dim prospects to change much as it pertains to control of the House of Representatives. The party in power almost always loses seats.&nbsp;And don’t expect that to change in 2022, despite those euphoric headlines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJoe Concha is a media and politics columnist.",

        "description": "Authorities say they are investigating a 911 call that claimed a shooting was taking place at Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-Ga.) home early Wednesday morning.\n\n\n\nThe Rome Police Department in northwest Georgia said in a statement that officers responded to a 911 call at 1:03 a.m. claiming an individual was shot multiple times at Greene’s house. \n\n\n\n“She assured the officers there was no issue and the call was determined to be a false call commonly known as ‘swatting,’” the statement read.\n\n\n\nOfficials said they received a second call from the suspect, who was using a computer-generated voice, saying they were upset about Greene’s view on transgender youth rights.\n\n\n\nThe lawmaker has been an outspoken opponent of transgender rights and last week introduced a bill to make gender-affirming care a felony.\n\n\n\nThe Rome Police Department said they are investigating the incident alongside the U.S. Capitol Police. Capitol Police did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\n\n\nGreene first revealed the incident in a tweet on Wednesday morning.\n\n\n\n“Last night, I was swatted just after 1 am,” she tweeted. “I can’t express enough gratitude to my local law enforcement here in Rome, Floyd County. More details to come.”\n\n\n\nWhen asked for further comment, Greene’s office called it a “political attack.”\n\n\n\n“Right now, Congresswoman Greene’s safety is our number one concern,” her office said in a statement. “Late last night, she was a victim of a political attack on her family and home. Whoever who committed this violent crime will face the full extent of the law.”Kandiss Taylor, a Georgia Republican who received 3.4 percent of the vote in the state's May gubernatorial primary, also said she was swatted last month.",

        "description": "Dan Cox, the Republican nominee for governor of Maryland, has deleted his account on the social media platform Gab, which is known as a forum for hate speech.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCox expunged more than 1,000 posts when he took down his account, according to The Washington Post. \n\n\n\nThe nominee also deleted a line from his campaign website in which he touted his role in trying to prevent the certification of the 2020 presidential election results.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As one of President Trump’s volunteer lawyers in Philadelphia during the 2020 election, and in the Maryland State House, he has led the fight for election integrity,” the website previously read. \n\n\n\nCox’s campaign did not immediately return a request from The Hill for comment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe changes come as Cox is seeking to be elected governor in a heavily Democratic state. Cox, who serves as a delegate in the Maryland state House, defeated former state Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz in the Republican primary last month. \n\n\n\nCox was backed by former President Trump while Schulz received an endorsement from incumbent Gov. Larry Hogan, a moderate Republican. The race was seen as part of a proxy war between more moderate establishment members of the GOP and Trump-endorsed hard-liners. \n\n\n\nHogan has slammed Cox, saying he is not “mentally stable.” Cox called former Vice President Mike Pence a “traitor” on Jan. 6, 2021, for refusing to reject the certification of the results of the 2020 election, but later apologized for those comments.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGab has emerged as a popular social media platform for conservatives who have criticized more mainstream platforms like Twitter for regulating certain posts for hate speech and disinformation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe gunman who opened fire and killed 11&nbsp;at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh in 2018 made multiple antisemitic posts on Gab.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearch into the potential therapeutic uses of psilocybin has grown in recent years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, new data published in JAMA Psychiatry reveal administration of the hallucinogen paired with psychotherapy was superior to placebo and therapy alone in treating patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly three medications are currently approved for AUD in the United States, while fewer than 9 percent of patients receive them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResults of a new clinical trial show psychotherapy coupled with psilocybin,the active ingredient in “magic mushrooms,” was superior to placebo and psychotherapy alone in treating alcohol use disorder (AUD) among adults.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStudy findings were published today in JAMA Psychiatry and come on the heels of new research that shows many psychiatrists disagree with U.S. federal policy classifying the substance as a Schedule I drug. Currently, only three treatments are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for AUD: disulfiram, naltrexone, and acamprosate.\n\n\n\nThe trial was the largest yet to investigate therapeutic effects of psilocybin, and future research into the drug could yield new clues on mechanisms of its effects, and aid in identifying new treatment targets.\n\n\n\nThe double-blind, randomized clinical trial was carried out among 93 adults with diagnosed AUD who had at least four heavy drinking days during the 30 days prior to screening. Forty-eight patients received 2 administrations of high-dose psilocybin over the course of 12 weeks of manualized psychotherapy, while 45 individuals received diphenhydramine (Benadryl) at the same time periods as a placebo. All study participants underwent therapy.\n\n\n\nDrugs were administered during two-day long medication sessions at weeks four and eight, and outcomes were assessed at 32 weeks following the first dose of each medication. At week four, participants received either&nbsp; 25 mg/70 kg of psilocybin or 50 mg of diphenhydramine. At week eight, doses were increased to 25-40 mg/70 kg of psilocybin or 50-100 mg of the placebo.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThroughout the follow-up period, 9.7 percent of those who received psilocybin reported heavy drinking days compared with 23.6 percent of the placebo group, marking a nearly 14 percent difference.\n\n\n\nHair or fingernail samples assayed for ethylglucuronide (EtG) concentration to confirm self-reported abstinence were only available for 53.8 percent of treated participants, authors noted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMean daily alcohol consumption was also lower in the intervention group while no serious adverse events were reported in this cohort. Headaches, anxiety and nausea were common side effects among those who received psilocybin.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAll participants had not used any hallucinogen drugs within the past year or reported less than 25 uses throughout their lifetimes. Participants were also not currently undergoing any other treatments for their AUD.\n\n\n\n“Although this was, to our knowledge, the first controlled trial of psilocybin for AUD, these findings are consistent with a meta-analysis of trials conducted in the 1960s evaluating LSD as a treatment for AUD,” authors wrote. LSD, or lysergic acid diethylamide, is another hallucinogen.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite the limited adverse effects seen in this trial, researchers emphasize these cannot be generalized to all psilocybin use, as the drug was administered in a controlled setting and medications to treat acute psychiatric reactions were on hand.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn addition, “diphenhydramine was ineffective in maintaining the blind after drug administration, so biased expectancies could have influenced results,” marking a limitation of the study.\n\n\n\nResults might also not be generalizable to individuals with more severe AUD and researchers were unable to study outcomes based on subgroups. Future studies are needed to address these questions and investigate whether results are sustained beyond 32 weeks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAUD remains underdiagnosed and undertreated in the United States, authors wrote in an accompanying editorial, as less than 9 percent of adults with AUD currently take an FDA-approved medication for the condition. Alcohol-related deaths are also the third most common preventable deaths in the United States.\n\n\n\nAnother important question raised by the trial “is the extent to which a hallucinogenic experience is required for psychedelic drugs to have a therapeutic effect,” while the optimal combination of medication and psychotherapy to treat AUD remains unknown.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe intensive psychotherapy included in the trial is also resource intensive and may thus limit the use of hallucinogens in clinical practice.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/house/3613867-connolly-launches-bid-to-replace-maloney-atop-oversight-panel/",
        "description": "Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) wasted no time this week announcing a bid to lead the Democrats on the House Oversight and Reform Committee next year — a seat that's soon to open up following Tuesday's primary defeat of the current chair, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.).\n\n\n\nConnolly, who would enter his eighth term next year, is currently fourth in line behind Maloney on the powerful committee. He's making the case that his long experience on the panel fighting to protect government institutions, like the Postal Service, and defend federal employees — a significant constituency in his Northern Virginia district — make him the best fit for the job.\n\n\n\n\"For more than fourteen years, I have made this Committee my top priority and focused on the issues that define it: Postal reform; defending our proud federal employees; rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse; modernizing the federal government; and holding the Trump administration accountable,\" he said Wednesday morning in a statement.\n\n\n\nMaloney on Tuesday lost a contentious primary to Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), a contest that pitted two powerful committee chairs — Nadler leads the Judiciary Committee — who have represented portions of Manhattan for decades against each other.\n\n\n\nTo win the seat, Connolly would have to leapfrog more senior members of the committee: Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) and Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.). A third lawmaker ranked higher than Connolly, Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), is retiring at the end of the term.\n\n\n\nThe offices of Norton and Lynch did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nUnlike the Republicans, Democrats tend to favor more veteran members when it comes to filling the top seat on committees. Still, seniority provides no guarantee of winning a gavel. Indeed, the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) took over the top spot on the Oversight and Reform Committee in 2011 by hopping over a more veteran Democrat.\n\n\n\nMaloney got the Oversight gavel in 2019, following Cummings's death at the age of 68. At the time, House Democrats were in the midst of impeaching then-President Trump for the first time, and Democratic leaders, behind Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), took pains to fill the vacancy without a protracted internal fight. Although Connolly and Lynch had both expressed interest, Maloney, as second in line, secured the spot.\n\n\n\nThis year's contest might be more spirited. With Democrats expected to lose control of the House in November's midterm elections — and Republicans vowing to use the Oversight panel to launch numerous investigations into the Biden administration — the ranking member position will provide a high-profile perch for a Democrat to cut a national profile defending the party's White House ally.\n\n\n\nConnolly, who has been among the most outspoken critics of Trump's role in last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol, maintains that he's already proven his mettle in that arena. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"We need a tested leader who will not be timid in the face of Republican insurrectionists. One who has a deep understanding of the issues facing our Committee and our country. A collaborator who can be a bridge to our talented and diverse caucus,\" he said. \"I believe I can be that leader, and look forward to earning the support of my colleagues.”",

        "description": "Tim Miller: &#8220;Governor Sununu took a pass on the race, not being particularly keen on jobs where rioters target his office if he doesn’t submit to a game show host’s autocratic delusions, leaving the Republican primary wide open.&#8221;\n&#8220;The man who has filled that vacuum is emblematic of the &#8216;candidate quality&#8217; issues that sad turtle Mitch recently alluded to.&#8221;\n&#8220;The frontrunner is Brigadier General Don Bolduc. He is not, like Sununu, a popular mainstream R with a track record of success; he’s an absolute loon who lost a Senate primary in 2020 and is a favorite in Bannon’s War Room where he is referred to only as &#8216;The General,&#8217; as if he were some kind of exiled Kazak communist who Bannon is demanding be released from prison.&#8221;\n&#8220;Which happens to be exactly the profile Republican primary voters are looking for this year.&#8221;",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Matt Anderson Photography/Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData privacy in the US is, in many ways, a legal void. While there are limited protections for health and financial data, the cradle of the world’s largest tech companies, like Apple, Amazon, Google, and Meta (Facebook), lacks any comprehensive federal data privacy law. This leaves US citizens with minimal data privacy protections compared with citizens of other nations. But that may be about to change.\nWith rare bipartisan support, the American Data and Privacy Protection Act moved out of the US House of Representatives Committee on Energy and Commerce by a vote of 53-2 on July 20, 2022. The bill still needs to pass the full House and the Senate, and negotiations are ongoing. Given the Biden administration’s responsible data practices strategy, White House support is likely if a version of the bill passes.\nAs a legal scholar and attorney who studies and practices technology and data privacy law, I’ve been closely following the act, known as ADPPA. If passed, it will fundamentally alter US data privacy law.Read 22 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "This feature was originally published on June 3, 2022.Ginger Kautz of Quail Ridge Books in Raleigh, North Carolina recommends Joseph Han’s debut novel “Nuclear Family,” which comes out Tuesday, June 7. Kautz calls the stylistically innovative novel “part family drama, part ghost story, part coming-of-age and critique of American imperialism in the Pacific.”  Nuclear Family by Joseph Han.Counterpoint PressThe story is set in 2018, during the time leading up to the false missile alert on Hawaii. The Cho family is horrified when their older son, who is teaching English in South Korea, is caught on viral video trying to cross the demilitarized zone. What his family in Hawaii doesn’t know is that he has been possessed by the ghost of his grandfather, who is trying to reach lost family members.  The sudden infinite infamy threatens the Cho family business, which relies on the local South Korean community. It drives their daughter Grace’s recreational week use into a serious habit. Kautz was struck by the innovative structure of this novel, which includes not only multiple viewpoints but also multiple formats. The words in some places form towers and walls. Words are left off the page as Grace tries to avoid certain thoughts.  “Even though some of the topics and scenes are heavy overall, Kautz says, “it is really a very optimistic book. It&#x27;s got a lot of humor in it. The love the family has for one another as much bigger than their inability to communicate effectively with each other.” ",

        "description": "The transition from Monkeypox Inoculation Plan A to Monkeypox Inoculation Plan B has been a smashing success—at least, if you ask federal officials. Just a few weeks ago, the U.S. had nowhere near enough of the Jynneos vaccine to doubly dose even a quarter of the Americans at highest risk of monkeypox, roughly 1.6 million men who have sex with men. Now that the administration has asked that every dose of Jynneos be split into five and delivered a different way, between the layers of the skin, the party line has changed. “Everyone that wants to get vaccinated within that group is going to have an opportunity to get vaccinated” by September’s end, Robert Fenton, the White House’s monkeypox czar, said on a podcast last week.But this new strategy of intradermal dosing “is a gamble,” says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, and its weaknesses are already beginning to show. It may be high time to start acting on a fallback plan for our fallback plan, should Plan B’s high-stakes wager not pay off.[Read: America’s new monkeypox strategy rests on a single study]The Plan Cs on the table aren’t very palatable—which is probably why they’re Plan Cs. One option, largely dismissed early on, could entail turning to ACAM2000, a hypereffective smallpox shot, with sometimes dangerous side effects, that the U.S. has stockpiled in spades. Already, three jurisdictions, including the state of California, have ordered more than 800 doses of ACAM from the government, according to Timothy Granholm, a spokesperson for HHS.Simply anticipating the possibility of Plan B’s failure might count as atypical for modern American public health—getting ahead of the virus du jour, rather than taking a reactive stance, says Stella Safo, an HIV physician in New York. Too often in the past few years, the institutions of public health have observed rather than acted, allowing SARS-CoV-2, and now monkeypox, to run roughshod over the American populace. “It would be really nice to not be saying, ‘Let’s wait and see,’” Safo told me. ACAM2000 may not be the country’s best or safest option for curtailing monkeypox, but the risk of not considering it may soon outweigh the risks of the shot itself.There’s a world in which the U.S. didn’t even need a Monkeypox Inoculation Plan B. Had U.S. leaders been willing to invest resources in heading off the pathogen, by offering aid to countries where the virus has been endemic for decades or by focusing earlier this year on tests, treatments, vaccines, and public communications, maybe America’s original immunization plan—using the full, subcutaneous Jynneos dose—would have been all the nation needed on the injection front.That didn’t happen, and instead the country adopted intradermal delivery, without real clarity on how well such doses might guard against infection, transmission, or disease. The notion that intradermal shots will work as hoped rests on a “chain of assumptions,” says John Beigel, an immunologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, several of which may not hold during a large, fast-spreading outbreak that’s tightly linked to sex—a poorly studied form of monkeypox transmission. Jynneos’s original approval was based on an antibody analogue of protection, rather than efficacy against bona fide illness. And the FDA’s authorization of intradermal shots rests on a single study, which didn’t directly check the vaccine’s ability to stave off disease, either. The study also enrolled only healthy adults, most of them white—a poor reflection of the population now being hit. It’s a “big leap” to build a nationwide vaccine campaign on just those results, says Sri Edupuganti, a vaccinologist at Emory University and one of the study’s authors. (Beigel is now designing a clinical trial that will reevaluate the intradermal route among participants more relevant to the current outbreak. He and his team will also test one-tenth intradermal doses, which could further stretch supply.)[Read: America should have been able to handle monkeypox]The intradermal plan has logistical challenges, too. Administering in-skin shots requires extra training and special needles, burdening already stressed staff, especially in low-resource regions. Several jurisdictions are struggling to extract more than three or four doses from some vials, rather than the government’s promised five—a shortchanging of those hoping to increase their stocks by a clean 400 percent. Plus, some bottle caps are breaking before all the doses are withdrawn. Intradermal vaccination can also come with grating side effects, including redness and swelling that can stick around for days, potentially deterring people from returning for the essential second shot.Fenton, from the White House, noted in a press briefing last week that the switch to intradermal “increased our supplies significantly without compromising safety or effectiveness.” But that assertion seems “disingenuous at best,” says Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist and AIDS activist at Yale’s School of Public Health. Even the CEO of Bavarian Nordic, the vaccine’s manufacturer, criticized the FDA’s pivot as too hasty. (The FDA attempted to counter the company’s criticisms.)Meanwhile, demand may continue to grow, especially if the epidemic starts to concentrate less among men who have sex with men. “The longer the outbreak lasts, the longer you have for jumping to other populations,” Gonsalves told me. College campuses, reopening now, “seem like the most obvious next stop.” And “if this gets into other networks,” says Ina Park, a sexual-health expert at UC San Francisco, Plan B “just won’t be enough.”Equity, too, is becoming an issue. “If we lived in a world where we had plenty of vaccine, you would go with subcutaneous,” Beigel told me. But in North Carolina, for instance, where 70 percent of monkeypox cases have been among Black men, some two-thirds of the subcutaneous shots administered before August 8 went to people who are white; similar skews have been noted in New York City. Now “Black and brown gay men are really angry,” says Kenyon Farrow, a writer and public-health activist based in Ohio. “They watched white gay men get full doses … and now they feel like they are getting less of a dose.” Farrow has pushed for everyone to get at least one subcutaneous shot—a strategy that advocates in New York City also back—but the Biden administration seems set on moving all jurisdictions onto the intradermal route.Mapping out yet another vaccination strategy won’t address all of these problems. (And no matter what, the administration should keep ordering more Jynneos, stat.) But the forecast for fall is murky. And should the present situation worsen, a fresh tactic could give the U.S. a head start—something the country hasn’t had on the public-health playing field in a while.Already, some experts are mulling the nuclear option: ACAM2000, the smallpox shot that the government has been hoarding to counter a potential bioterrorism attack. Doses of the vaccine are available by the many millions, and thought to be both effective and durable. It’s also, Edupuganti told me, “one of the vaccines with the highest amount of adverse reactions,” occasionally triggering side effects as serious as heart inflammation. The shot contains a replicating virus, and shouldn’t be taken by immunocompromised people, including many of those who are living with HIV. And just about everyone who gets the shot sprouts an oozy lesion at the injection site that can pass the vaccine virus to others. Against something like smallpox—a far more contagious virus that killed up to 30 percent of its victims—ACAM2000 would be “a no-brainer,” says Rafi Ahmed, a vaccinologist at Emory University. With monkeypox, though, Johns Hopkins’s Rivers told me, the risk-benefit calculation “is really hazy.”[Read: What should worry most Americans about our monkeypox response]It’s not time to trot out ACAM yet, Safo, the New York physician, told me. But maybe autumn will bring many more cases. Maybe monkeypox’s symptoms could grow more severe. Maybe the virus will start to surge in new populations. Maybe intradermal Jynneos will fall short in effectiveness or safety. In any case, containment with the current tools isn’t a guarantee. “If things do get out of control,” Ahmed told me, “you want to have some ACAM stocks ready to go.” No clear, perfect threshold can yet denote “out of control.” Still, a trend toward a worse outbreak would inch the country closer to tapping into its ACAM2000 supply, Park told me: “I don’t think we have another choice.” Which means that the FDA and CDC should probably start poring over the ACAM data now, Rivers said.  Resorting to ACAM2000 will also put the onus on officials to explain to the public what they’re getting into. If some are balking at intradermal shots, people further back in line could reasonably wonder why they’ve been stuck with a less-safe vaccine, Farrow pointed out. There could be a middle ground worth testing in a clinical trial: one shot of Jynneos, via either administration route, followed by a dose of ACAM2000, says Stephen Goldstein, a virologist at the University of Utah. One 2019 study hints that this shot, chaser approach could shrink infectious lesions, as well as cut down on ACAM2000’s side effects, while still offering an immunological boost—though that trial used two subcutaneous Jynneos doses first. In any case, the government would do well to pursue more options, even enroll people in trials comparing the different vaccines, Gonsalves told me. And transparency is tantamount. “Back in the days of AIDS,” he said, “many of us were saying, as new drugs were coming online, we wanted access and answers” about the options at hand. Right now, the nation’s short on both.That “we’re even having to ask these questions about ACAM,” Farrow told me, is a sobering reminder that “we didn’t get our shit together” early on. Instead, the U.S. has backed itself into having to reckon with its appetite for risk. Being too cautious with vaccines could allow the outbreak to further balloon; being too reckless with shots could compromise public trust. The administration firmly contends that Jynneos remains “the best available option,” according to Granholm, the HHS spokesman. (That said, ACAM2000 “is available upon request,” he told me.)\r\nSuch a position may feel like the safe one—it potentially sidesteps the gnarliness of ACAM. But perhaps it’s actually dicier, because it’s not properly preparative. “We can’t just say intradermal is going to solve all of our problems,” Park told me. Although the hope is that the country’s ACAM supply can stay stashed away, we need to be ready to use it, and quickly, should the need arise. If the country once again waits until “we’re in a pinch” to act, Rivers told me, “it’s going to be too late.”",

        "description": "A new sensor that passively monitors breathing during sleep can not only detect Parkinson&#8217;s, but also track the progression of the disease over time, researchers report.\nThe researchers used an artificial intelligence tool to sift through mountains of data from study participants to find patterns that identify the disease and determine severity.\n&#8220;I like to compare our understanding of Parkinson&#8217;s to a street lamp in the night; we only get a glimpse of the disease when patients visit clinic. Moreover, the methods we use to track the disease over time are subjective,&#8221; says Ray Dorsey, a professor of neurology at the University of Rochester Medical Center, and a coauthor of the study in Nature Medicine.\n&#8220;As a result, we have a very limited insight into how people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease affect people&#8217;s daily lives. This study shows that remote monitoring has the potential to identify individuals with Parkinson&#8217;s and create an objective measure of severity and progression. This could be a powerful tool to detect the disease early and conduct research more efficiently.&#8221;\nLead author Dina Katabi, a professor of electrical engineering and computer science at MIT, worked closely with researchers at the University of Rochester Medical Center Center for Health + Technology (CHeT), including Dorsey and Chris Tarolli, an assistant professor of neurology at the University of Rochester.\nThe study is one of several research projects exploring new ways to harness remote monitoring, smartphones, smart watches, and other technologies to improve care and advance research in Parkinson&#8217;s and other diseases.\nParkinson&#8217;s is the fastest-growing neurological disorder in the world, outpacing even Alzheimer&#8217;s. More than one million Americans are currently living with the disease. While there are rare genetic forms of the disease, many cases of Parkinson&#8217;s are likely caused by exposure to certain industrial chemicals and pesticides.\nJames Parkinson noted changes in breathing patterns when he first described the disease in the early 19th century. The new research takes inspiration from this 200-year-old observation and targets this symptom of the disease in an effort to see if nocturnal breathing rhythms, and changes to these rhythms over time, can be analyzed to create a digital biomarker of Parkinson&#8217;s. The study used a device that passively emits radio signals that capture breathing patterns, the pulsing of blood vessels, and muscle movement during sleep.\nThe researchers recruited 7,687 participants, including 757 with individuals Parkinson&#8217;s, and recorded 120,000 hours of sleeping. MIT researchers then analyzed the data using a neural network, a series of connected algorithms that can sort through vast qualities of data and search for patterns. The model was able to differentiate between volunteers with Parkinson&#8217;s and those without.\nThere are currently no effective biomarkers to diagnose Parkinson&#8217;s, particularly in the early stages, and track its progression. Often by the time motor symptoms of the disease first emerge and a diagnosis is made, a large percentage of the dopamine-producing neurons targeted by the disease have already died off. An early diagnosis could enable patients to start treatments earlier, potentially forestalling the progression of the disease.\nMore precise measurement of the progression of the disease—which can vary greatly from patient to patient—will also enable scientists to better measure if experimental therapies are working. Proven remote monitoring technologies will also allow researchers to recruit study participants more widely, measure the impact new therapies more quickly and, hopefully, find new effective treatments faster.\nAdditional researchers from the Mayo Clinic, Massachusetts General Hospital, and Boston University contributed to the study.\nSource: University of Rochester\nThe post Sensor detects Parkinson&#8217;s during sleep appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Fierce and fearless, her sheer love of music and unorthodox collaborations saw her respected across musical genresJaimie Branch, jazz composer and trumpeter, dies aged 39Jaimie Branch, who has died at the age of 39, was an internationally acclaimed trumpeter who brought a demotic sensibility to some often very experimental music. Appearing on stage in baggy clothes and a trademark baseball cap, she could be brash, swaggering, hilariously foul-mouthed and profane – all qualities reflected by the sonic sucker punch of her playing. “Playing the trumpet is like singing your soul,” she said. “When you’re improvising your whole body feels like it’s lighting up.”Born in Long Island, New York in June 1983, she started piano lessons at the age of three and trumpet at the age of nine. Her first teacher was a mariachi player in Chicago. “It meant that I learned to play loud, with loads of vibrato,” she said. She later learned to tone down the vibrato, but the forthright, incendiary delivery remained. She was a fan of punk and grunge – Nirvana, the Descendents, NOFX, Minor Threat – throughout her teens, and those hardcore tendencies often spilled into her jazz. Continue reading...",

From DD &#8230;\n\n\n\nReader reaction with some thoughtful nuance about Dem chances on holding the HouseThe recent upswing for Democrats across several metrics has folks, including yourself, feeling hopeful that Democrats could somehow maintain control of the House. Now I know you&#8217;ve said it&#8217;s still a long shot and unlikely but I think that long shot misses the forest for the trees (or actually the&nbsp;trees for the forest).At the macro level there are plenty of reasons to maintain that hope, and the rising, and real, fortunes of Senate Democrats seem to color that perspective. But with the House it&#8217;s a matter of math and race-by-race dynamics. By those measures the House is all but gone for Democrats, although the losses&nbsp;may be low enough that they&#8217;re in the hunt to reclaim the majority in 2024.",

(KOLR) – An old-school discipline method is making its way back into some Missouri schools.\n\n\n\nThe Cassville School District in Southern Missouri is bringing back corporal punishment under a new policy that allows students to be punished with a paddle. Administrators say it would be the last resort if other means of discipline do not work. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe superintendent said the change is the result of a survey sent out last year. Parents who responded said discipline was one of their biggest concerns. \n\n\n\n\"The complaints that we have heard from some of our parents is that they don't want their students suspended. They want another option,\" said Superintendent Meryl Johnson. \"And so, this was just another option that we could use before we get to that point of suspension.\"\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBack to school, with panic buttons: Districts scramble after Uvalde\t\n\n\n\n\n\"I do not think it is appropriate,\" said Miranda Waltrip, who has three kids in Cassville schools. She said she'd like to see the district try different ways of getting through to students. \n\n\n\n“I feel like if they had a different outlet like counseling services in school instead of corporal punishment, that would be the more appropriate answer,\" Waltrip said. \"At the end of the day, they are having to hold the child down and spank them or use whatever means that they can to make the child submissive when that is not the issue, it is the fact that they need to be heard because children act out for varied reasons.\"\n\n\n\nStudents will only receive the new discipline if parents opt their children in, Johnson said. \n\n\n\n\"Corporal punishment will be used only when other means of discipline have failed and then only in reasonable form, when the principal approves it,\" Johnson said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nJohnson said he does not anticipate using this punishment often, but if the principal punishes a child this way it will be done by administrators only and only in the presence of another certified employee.  \n\n\n\nParents can also opt-in or opt-out at any point in the school year. &nbsp;",

        "description": "NASA has released audio it captured from a black hole, sharing sounds waves that it previously identified but have made audible for the first time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNASA’s team that explores space for planets and life outside the solar system tweeted on Sunday that the idea that sound does not exist in space is a misconception. \n\n\n\nMost of outer space is a vacuum that does not provide a way for sound waves to travel, but a galaxy cluster, where hundreds or thousands of galaxies are held together by gravity, has enough gas for sound to be observed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNASA amplified the sound waves it received from the Perseus galaxy cluster, located about 240 million light-years away, and mixed them with other data to allow people to hear a black hole.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBlack holes are parts of space where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. Many of them form when stars collapse at the end of their life cycle.\n\n\n\nAstronomers captured the first image of the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way galaxy in May. Scientists believe almost all galaxies have one at their center.",

        "description": "President Biden officially announced on Wednesday that his administration is forgiving up to $10,000 in student loan debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 annually and $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients, marking the largest forgiveness of federal student loans per individual to date.\n\n\n\nBiden also again extended a payment freeze on federal student loans and interest accrual, butting right up against an Aug. 31 deadline that would have kicked bills back into effect just before November's midterm elections.\n\n\n\nThe payment pause is now in effect until Dec. 31&nbsp;and the White House said the pause is extended “one final time,” indicating that January 2023 will mark the end of the years-long student loan payment freeze.\n\n\n\nThe White House also said that if borrowers have undergraduate loans, they can cap repayment at 5 percent of their monthly income.\n\n\n\nBiden&nbsp;shared&nbsp;the announcement on Twitter and plans to deliver remarks at 2:15 p.m. on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n\"In keeping with my campaign promise, my Administration is announcing a plan to give working and middle class families breathing room as they prepare to resume federal student loan payments in January 2023,\" Biden tweeted.\n\n\n\n\nIn keeping with my campaign promise, my Administration is announcing a plan to give working and middle class families breathing room as they prepare to resume federal student loan payments in January 2023.I&#39;ll have more details this afternoon. pic.twitter.com/kuZNqoMe4I&mdash; President Biden (@POTUS) August 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThe Hill reported on Tuesday that the White House would announce a plan to cancel a chunk of student loan debt and an extension of the existing pause, citing multiple sources. The announcement comes within the smallest window of time borrowers have had to determine when their payments would resume, which has aggravated advocates due to it leaving borrowers in limbo.\n\n\n\nLoan payments were first put on hold in March 2020 under former President Trump, and the freeze has since been extended six times. Trump’s order froze the accrual of interest on federal student loans, effectively putting on hold $1.6 trillion in debt owed by more than 40 million Americans.\n\n\n\nWhile the cancellation will be celebrated as the most far-reaching move to help student loan borrowers, activists and some Democrats will also likely call for more in student loan forgiveness, like forgiving up to $50,000 per borrower, or overhauling federal loan programs. \n\n\n\nThe White House has faced fierce pushback at the idea of means-testing to decide which borrowers are granted student loan forgiveness after reports had surfaced that it would limit relief to people earning below $125,000.\n\n\n\nBiden had kept his next move on student loans payments, including whether to forgive any amount of debt, largely under wraps, though he told reporters last month that \"the end of August\" was his timeline for making a decision.\n\n\n\nEducation Secretary Miguel Cardona said on Sunday that a decision on the matter would come within the week.\n\n\n\nThe Education Department had said that borrowers will be communicated to “directly” about the end of the freeze, following reporting last month that student loan servicing contractors have been told to not send upcoming billing statements.\n\n\n\nBiden has been under pressure from Democrats and advocates to extend the freeze, as well as act on student loan forgiveness.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast month, Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.) led a letter signed by over 100 Democrats in Congress calling for Biden to extend the pause, citing the economic hardship some have faced due to the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the squeeze rising inflation has put on consumers nationwide.\n\n\n\nIn May, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) met with Biden to push for loan forgiveness. Advocates and other Democrats, including Schumer, have pressed for forgiveness of $50,000 per borrower or to cancel debt entirely.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden announced in June that he would cancel billions in student debt for former Corinthian College students, which raised pressure on the White House to offer more extensive relief.\n\n\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Biden supported forgiving at least $10,000 in federal student loans per person. Over a year ago, he requested a memo from the Department of Education to determine his authority to forgive student debt through executive action. Since then, the administration has not publicly announced if the memo is complete.\n\n\n\n--Updated 11:44 a.m.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/civil-rights/3608594-the-talibans-first-year-of-governing-was-a-disaster-for-women-and-an-affront-to-islam/",
        "description": "Last August, after 20 years of war, the Taliban felt vindicated as they drove U.S. troops out of Afghanistan and marched into Kabul, expecting a hero’s welcome. Instead, they witnessed droves of Afghan men and women chaotically fleeing for their lives. Overnight, the Taliban had to give up being warriors and try to embrace their new role as bureaucrats.\n\n\n\nThis year-long experiment of governing has been nothing short of calamitous for all Afghans, especially women and girls. Today, the biggest dream for an Afghan girl is not how she can become an engineer or a pilot but of simply going to school. Professional women with doctorates and businesses fear becoming invisible. With their wings clipped, they can neither explore nor soar.\n\n\n\nThe debate surrounding Afghan girls’ schooling has taken center stage this past year, so it is understandable why the U.S. and European nations, seeing no progress despite regular promises, have refrained from recognizing the Taliban as a legitimate government in Afghanistan. But the more important question is why the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) and its 57 Muslim majority member states have followed suit.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMuslims worldwide watched on TV when the Taliban marched into the presidential palace. Their litany of decrees used “Islam, Islamic or Shariah law” framing. Their initial pronouncements on women were geared to appeal to the West: Women’s rights would be protected if they were within an Islamic framework, and girls’ education is an Islamic right.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs months inched by, it became clear that every announcement was a slogan with no substance. The distressing picture regarding women is one of the foremost reasons the OIC and its member states have not recognized the Taliban. The OIC issued a statement expressing its disappointment over the unexpected decision to maintain an earlier ban on girls’ schools.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith every false promise, the Taliban’s trust deficit intensified. By not keeping their word as the Quran 2.117 instructs, \"Righteous are those who ... keep the pledges they make,” the credentials of the Taliban are tarnished.  \n\n\n\nIn March, I was part of an American Women Peace and Education Delegation that went to Afghanistan to meet with the Ministry of Education about reopening girls’ public high schools. We witnessed fissures among the Taliban. The ones we met said, “If we get the green light, we will open the schools next morning.” But alas, the more powerful faction, which views girls’ education as futile, seems to have won over — for now. This faction believes a girl should be educated up to the sixth grade. Her primary function is to become a mother. By eliminating high school education, advanced studies for women will disappear over time, along with opportunities for professional women.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nApparently this is how some in the Taliban want it. They consider secular education an affront to their rural way of life and a threat to their rural “Afghan custom.” Again, these customs are not found in the Quran or Prophet Muhammad’s teachings. They result from poor-quality religious education and ignorance of women’s rights in Islam, which Sheikh Ahmed al-Tayeb, Grand Imam of Egypt’s Al-Azhar mosque, affirmed in a tweet.\n\n\n\nIslam commands men and women to acquire universal knowledge, sacred and secular, so they can be accountable and attain spiritual maturity. Women are granted the freedom to make choices in the selection of professions that best suit their capabilities, whether in the field of religion or in any other worldly fields such as law, medicine or engineering.\n\n\n\nTherefore, girls’ education is of immense concern for Muslims worldwide. Prophet Muhammad said, “Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave.” Early exemplary Muslim women were never shut behind iron bars or considered worthless creatures and deprived souls. They built impressive educational institutions and served in leadership roles as hadith transmitters, religious teachers, moral guides and political leaders.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToday, Muslims who deny education to women and girls must be challenged. It is a blatant breach of Islamic teachings, because lack of education limits self-actualization and any potential contribution women can make to humanity.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. can play a vital role, starting with releasing tranches of the $9.5 billion of Afghanistan’s frozen assets. Some funds can be earmarked for teacher salaries and school reopenings. When I was in Kabul, a Taliban functionary said, “How are we supposed to do all this work [gender-segregate schools and pay teachers] when the U.S. has frozen all our money?”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSecondly, the U.S. can leverage its soft power centered around diplomatic confidence-building measures. Build a coalition of Muslim interlocutors — an international task force of Afghans in the diaspora who have direct links and a longing to return, members of the OIC, and Muslim women’s groups. Their aim must be to leverage the power of faith to combat this deep-seated social ill, challenge and reject the Taliban’s incorrect narratives, and finally educate the rural base on women’s rights in Islam, a suggestion the Ministry of Education endorses.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe quest for knowledge has propelled Muslim women to make remarkable advancements in all fields of knowledge, including education, mathematics and astronomy. It is time for Afghan women to be supported by the West and by fellow Muslims, so they no longer remain satisfied with the limits of corrupt custom, oppression and injustice but stand on equal footing as human beings.\n\n\n\nDaisy Khan, Ph.D., is the founder of Women’s Islamic Initiative in Spirituality and Equality (WISE), the largest global network of Muslim women committed to peacebuilding, gender equality and human dignity.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/education/3612395-unqualified-gap-fillers-will-only-worsen-the-teacher-shortage/",
        "description": "The Florida legislature passed an act allowing&nbsp;veterans to teach&nbsp;in public schools without a degree. After Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) signed the bill into law, the state Department of Education announced that it would issue a “5-year&nbsp;temporary certificate&nbsp;for military veterans who have not yet earned their bachelor’s degrees” Applicants need only complete 60 credit hours (half the number required for a bachelor’s of arts) with a 2.5 GPA (C+), pass a subject area exam and be assigned a mentor at the school where they teach.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis policy reflects two serious problems: a severe shortage of teachers and a profound distrust of professionals, especially educators among a sizeable portion of the electorate. Neither problem can be fixed by putting unqualified people in the classroom, especially since DeSantis’ motive is political rather than practical.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA survey conducted by the&nbsp;Illinois Department of Education&nbsp;revealed that 88 percent of 663 school districts surveyed had a teacher shortage. The shortage has become&nbsp;chronic&nbsp;in several states. Nevada has approximately 3,000 unfilled positions, Florida 8,000. The five largest districts in the&nbsp;Houston&nbsp;area cannot fill approximately 1,988 vacancies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe shortage results from two factors: a decline in the number of college students pursuing education degrees and experienced teachers leaving the profession. Between 2006 and 2019 the number of students graduating with&nbsp;bachelor’s degrees in education&nbsp;declined by 22 percent. Approximately&nbsp;300,000&nbsp;teachers and other staff left the profession between February 2020 and this May. A recent survey revealed that 55 percent of teachers planned to leave earlier than they planned.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTeachers have good reason to quit. A National Education Association&nbsp;survey&nbsp;found that 67 percent of those polled felt burned out, primarily from the stress of the pandemic, but also from the extra work they had to do because of teacher and staff shortages. Nearly half feel they are underpaid, and 44 percent feel a “lack of respect from parents/the public.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLack of respect stems from historic anti-intellectualism intensified by the right’s distrust of experts. “Those who can, do; those who can’t, teach” has become an American truism since&nbsp;George Bernard Shaw&nbsp;wrote the line in 1905. Now teachers have become a popular target of disgruntled parents, conservative pundits and populist politicians who accuse them of corrupting morals, promoting white guilt and undermining Christianity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe teacher shortage has left school districts scrambling. They have addressed the problem by increasing class sizes and assigning more work to the educators who remain. Some districts have resorted to shortening the school week to&nbsp;four days. These measures adversely affect the quality of education. Several states have relaxed&nbsp;certification requirements, hoping to attract college-educated but uncertified people to the profession.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Florida law, however, is unprecedented and has more to do with politics than staffing classrooms. If DeSantis’ state is so short of teachers, why limit the alternative path to certification to veterans? The answer lies in the governor’s political ideology. He panders to a conservative electorate that distrusts all professionals other than those in uniform (police and military). He has&nbsp;defied Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance&nbsp;throughout the pandemic.&nbsp;“It is very important that we say unequivocally no to lockdowns, no to school closures, no to restrictions and no to mandates,” he declared in late July 2021 as the delta variant was surging in Florida.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDeSantis’s disregard for healthcare professionals is equaled only by his contempt for professional educators. In March, he signed the infamous “don’t say gay” bill prohibiting instruction on gender identity or sexual orientation to children in grades K-3. A month later, the Florida Department of Education with the governor’s blessing rejected&nbsp;54 math books&nbsp;because they allegedly contained lessons&nbsp;“indoctrinating concepts like race essentialism.” Perhaps DeSantis believes veterans will be the sort of patriotic teachers who can be relied upon to teach his conservative values.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOr maybe he has a different motive. In 2019, he signed a bill allowing more Florida teachers to carry&nbsp;firearms in schools. What better way to install a cadre of armed educators than to hire veterans and give them guns?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe do need to address the teacher shortage and making certification easier could help.&nbsp;It takes five years to earn a bachelor’s in education degree with certification at many colleges and universities. Education majors graduate with an extra year of debt that qualifies them for a profession in which they will be underpaid and little appreciated with limited opportunity for advancement. Some requirements should be modified or eliminated. Student teaching could be replaced with a paid apprenticeship under the guidance of an experienced teacher.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTweaking the certification process, however, does not mean throwing out requirements the way the Florida law does. Being in the military does not qualify a person to teach. No one can acquire the knowledge and skills necessary to be an educator in just two years of college. A 2.5 grade point average is a very low bar. Does anyone want their children taught by someone with only an average understanding of math, reading or science?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe best way to address the teaching shortage is not lower standards but better compensation. We need to close the&nbsp;earning gap&nbsp;between educators and other professionals. In 2021, teachers were earning 23.5 percent less than those in comparable fields. In 28 states they earn less than 80 cents for every dollar earned by their peers with a similar college education.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe also need to address the respect gap. Teachers should be held in the same regard as police, firefighters, military personnel and medical professionals. Would you want to be treated by a doctor who had not completed medical school? How about flying on an airplane operated by an under-trained pilot? Our children deserved to be taught by well-educated teachers justly compensated for their important work. The future of the United States depends on it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTom Mockaitis is a professor of history at DePaul University and author of&nbsp;“Violent Extremists: Understanding the Domestic and International Terrorist Threat.”&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/workspace/how-teams-can-collaborate-seamlessly-in-the-hybrid-work-world/",
        "description": "Workplace collaboration continues to evolve as hybrid work expands its footprint. While both “same-time” and “staggered-time” (or asynchronous) collaboration modes each have their place in the hybrid work environment, organizations and teams sometimes overuse one mode over another. That’s probably because in-person meetings or collaborating in real time have been the default for many organizations, leading to a “same-time” bias, even as new tools make working across time zones and locations seamless. Ultimately, the key for making collaboration scalable and to support employee wellbeing is choosing the right method and tool for the task at hand. With that in mind, here are some ways to get the most out of same-time and staggered-time collaboration in your organization.Making same-time collaboration more valuableHistorically, many organizations have valued same-time interactions for the fast, direct exchange of information and feedback. They also bring teams together and build human connections. While all these outcomes are powerful and important, same-time collaboration also has some drawbacks — especially in a hybrid environment. First, same-time interactions can be difficult to arrange. Coordinating schedules requires advanced planning, especially when employees are distributed across time zones or working outside of traditional business hours. Second, back-to-back scheduling can contribute to meeting fatigue. In our recently commissioned global hybrid work survey with Economist Impact, 72% of respondents acknowledged that virtual meetings improve inclusion and participation. At the same time, 68% said there are too many virtual meetings in general, suggesting that even though employees value same-time collaboration, they want it in moderation.To address these challenges, organizations should consider the collaboration scenarios in which same-time interactions can make the greatest impact. It’s particularly useful when consensus or immediate action is needed, as in briefings, decision-making, and crisis management. For effective same-time collaboration in a hybrid environment, your employees need tools that help them coordinate real-time interactions and minimize time spent switching apps and context. With Google Workspace, teams can create and access a shared agenda or Google Doc inside a Google Calendar invite, helping align expectations and goals before, during, and after scheduled same-time work sessions. And, the more integrated your collaboration tools are, the easier it is for employees to get right to work when inspiration strikes or a quick decision is needed. For example, team members can initiate spontaneous work sessions by starting a Google Meet directly from Docs, Sheets, or Slides.Jumping into a Meet call directly from a DocAdditionally, consider how you can bring real-world collaboration activities into virtual environments to enhance same-time collaboration for distributed teams. For instance, digital whiteboard tools, like Jamboard and Miro in Google Meet, allow people to brainstorm, ideate, and problem-solve in real time from anywhere. Interactive solutions like these empower employees to work together in new ways.Expanding what’s possible with staggered-time collaborationWidespread adoption of hybrid work has prompted organizations to turn more frequently to staggered-time collaboration — where team members are free to share and respond to information in their own time. A key benefit of staggered collaboration is improving the experience and wellbeing of employees — specifically, by promoting participation across the team and support for flexible work habits. Allowing team members to engage when they’re most productive, or when it doesn’t interfere with their scheduled focus time, supports their wellbeing. It can also help employees feel heard, valued, and empowered. Staggered-time collaboration can also give team members who may feel uncomfortable or vulnerable speaking up in real time, or who just need time to think about their feedback, a more inviting way to share their perspectives.Staggered-time collaboration can enhance a range of collaboration scenarios, including assigning tasks and action items, knowledge- and resource-sharing, brainstorming, and giving feedback. To make these interactions successful, employees need secure, intuitive tools that give them the information they need to do their jobs from anywhere, at any time. For example, in Spaces, team members can initiate and take part in group chat threads devoted to project- and topic-based discussions, as well as access files and tasks, to stay in the loop whenever they’re able to participate. For people working on a task or project at varied times, creating a dynamic, single source of truth makes all the difference. When collaborating on shared documents, a feature like smart canvas enables teammates to assign tasks, build checklists, and share files using @-mentions for easy information access. Meanwhile, automated, built-in summaries in Docs help the team get up to speed without losing focus. Features like these help everyone stay on the same page (literally), even if they're contributing to a project at different times.Auto-generated summaries in Docs, driven by Google AIFlexibility and collaboration are not mutually exclusive Helping people know which tasks call for real-time collaboration and which tasks are better done on their own time is critical for sustaining productivity and wellbeing in a hybrid work world. Employees who are empowered to work in ways that complement their needs, preferences, and schedules typically reward their organization for that flexibility. As Holger Reisinger, Paul Sephton, and Dane Fetterer wrote for the Harvard Business Review, “When leaders give employees the freedom to choose where and when they work, it signals they trust them to do the job they were hired to do. The data shows that that trust is then paid back…at a very high rate, building a tight-knit culture of inclusivity and belonging.”When you create team norms around same-time and staggered-time collaboration, you can help your employees stay productive and connected — to each other and the broader organization. And by giving them tools that support seamless, secure collaboration experiences from anywhere, the impact on productivity, employee wellbeing, and morale can be transformational.",

        "description": "Artificial intelligence (AI) can automatically learn patterns that humans can’t detect, making it a powerful tool for getting more value out of data. A high-performing model starts with high-quality data, but in many cases, datasets have issues such as incorrect labels or unclear examples that contribute to poor model performance. Data quality is a constant challenge for enterprises—even some datasets used as machine learning (ML) benchmarks suffer from label errors. ML models are thus often notoriously difficult to debug and troubleshoot. Without special tools, it’s difficult to connect model failures to root causes and even harder to know the next step to resolve the problem. Today, we're thrilled to announce the public preview of Vertex AI Example-based Explanations, a novel feature that provides actionable explanations to mitigate data challenges such as mislabeled examples. With Vertex AI Example-based Explanations, data scientists can quickly identify misclassified data, improve datasets, and more efficiently involve stakeholders in the decisions and progress. This new feature takes the guessing games out of model refinement, enabling you to identify problems faster and speed up time to value. How Examples-based Explanations create better modelsVertex AI Example-based Explanations can be used in numerous ways, from supporting users in building better models to closing the loop with stakeholders. Below, we describe some notable capabilities of the feature:Figure 1. Use case overview Example-based ExplanationsTo illustrate the use case of misclassification analysis, we trained an image classification model on a subset of the STL-10 dataset, using only images of birds and planes. We noted some images of birds being misclassified as planes. For one such image, we used Example-based Explanations to retrieve other images in the training data that appeared most similar to this misclassified bird image in the latent space. Examining those, we identified that both the misclassified bird image and the similar images were dark silhouettes. To take a closer look, we expanded the similar example search to show us the 20 nearest neighbors. From this, we identified that 15 examples were images of planes, and only five were images of birds. This signaled a lack of images of birds with dark silhouettes in the training data, as only one of the training data bird images was a dark-silhouetted one. The immediate actionable insight was to improve the model by gathering more data with images of silhouetted birds.Figure 2. Use Example-based Explanations for misclassification analysisBeyond misclassification analysis, Example-based Explanations can enable active learning, so that data can be selectively labeled when its Example-based Explanations come from confounding classes. For instance, if out of 10 total explanations for an image, five are from class “bird” and five are from class “plane,” the image can be a candidate for human annotation, further enriching the data. Example-based Explanations are not limited to images. They can generate embeddings for multiple types of data: image, text, tabular. Let’s look at an illustration of how to use Example-based Explanations with tabular data. Suppose we have a trained model that predicts the duration of a bike ride. When examining the model’s projected duration for a bike ride, Example-based Explanations can help us identify issues with the underlying data points. Looking at row #5 in the below image, the duration seems too long when compared with the distance covered. This bike ride is also very similar to the query ride, which is expected since Example-based Explanations are supposed to find similar examples. Given the distance, time of day, temperature, etc. are all very similar between the query ride and the ride in row #5, the duration label seems suspicious.The immediate next step is to examine this data point more closely and either remove it from the dataset or try to understand if there might be some missing features (say, whether the biker took a snack break) contributing to the difference in durations.Figure 3. Use Example-based Explanations for tabular dataGetting started with Examples-based Explanations in Vertex AIIt takes only three steps to set up Example-based Explanations. First, upload your model and dataset. The service will represent the entire dataset in a latent space (called embeddings). As a concrete example, let’s examine words in a latent space. The below visualizations show such word embeddings, where the position in the vector space encodes meaningful semantics of each word, such as the relation between verbs or between a country and its capital.Next, deploy your index and model, after which the Example-based API will be ready to query. Then, you can query for similar data points and only need to repeat steps 1 and 2 when you retrain the model or change your dataset.Figure 4. Embeddings can capture meaningful semantic informationUnder the hood, the Example-based Explanations API builds on cutting-edge technology developed by Google research organizations, described in this blog post and used at scale across a wide range of Google applications, such as Search, YouTube and Play Store. This technology, ScaNN, enables querying for similar examples significantly faster and with better recall, compared to other vector similarity search techniques.

        "description": "Working to put food on all of our tables, today’s farmers are facing a higher amount of instability from input supply chain issues to weather patterns. Adding to this challenge are problems farmers face when trying to correctly time grain purchases, sales and transport. Farmers have always been stewards of the land, but now the demand for sustainable products has them needing to better prove their regenerative practices. AtBushel, we understand these problems can’t be solved overnight or by a single company. We focus on empowering agribusinesses and farmers to work even more closely together to build a more sustainable agricultural supply chain by rapidly responding to market changes. With Bushel, farmers can track market prices in real time, instantly buy and sell grain, analyze inventory and transactions, and securely share verified information with grain operators and other producers. We provide the digital tools to streamline how farmers buy and sell commodities throughout the agricultural industry’s supply chain to help address market inefficiencies that can lead to waste, and have the information and resources to help them flex and adapt as complexity increases in farming operations. Approximately 40% to 50% of all U.S. grain transactions now pass through the Bushel platform. As we continue to grow, Bushel continues to focus on what digital tools can support each point in the supply chain. Many focus on the first mile at the farm or last mile at the store. But Bushel is focused on modernizing the middle where grain purchasing and processing sit. We aim to help local grain industries and stabilize regional agricultural supply chains.Starting with a simple mobile app; now scaling into an agricultural ecosystem    Bushel began its journey in 2017 as a small-scale platform for farmers that delivered grain contracts, cash bids, and receipts. As Bushel evolved into a comprehensive agricultural ecosystem, we realized we needed knowledgeable technology partners to help us rapidly scale while saving time and administrative costs. That’s why we started partnering with theGoogle for Startups Cloud Program to get support from Google and work with Google Cloud Managed Services partner,DoiT International to help support our use of GKE and create a multi-regional deployment as well as migrate our CUDs to new Compute Engine families and continue to optimize our footprint. We’ll also use DoiT's Flexsave technology to reduce the management overhead of CUDs in the future. In just one year, we expanded to over 1,200 live grain receiving locations and quickly grew our services portfolio with electronic signature capabilities, commodity balances, and web development. Because that relationship between farmer and agribusiness is so important, we provide more than 200 grain companies with white-labled digital experiences so each farmer sees their local grain facility they do business with on both desktop and mobile. To further our extension into the digital infrastructure of agriculture, we subsequently acquiredGrainBridge andFarmLogs to help farmers handle specific jobs and tasks, and provide the needed insights to improve their business operations. Over 2,000 grain receiving locations across the United States and Canada now use Bushel products. We accomplished all this onGoogle Cloud. We leverage thesecure-by-design infrastructure of Google Cloud to protect millions of financial transactions and keep sensitive customer data safe. Our data is processed and stored in Google’s secure data centers, which maintain adherence to a number of compliance frameworks. We utilize Google Kubernetes Engine extensively as it reduces operational overhead and offers auto scaling up to 15,000 nodes. Database provisioning, storage capacity management, and other time-consuming tasks are automated withour Cloud SQL usage.Query Insights for Cloud SQL streamlines database observability and seamlessly integrates with existing apps and Google Cloud services such as GKE andBigQuery. Empowering farmers and agribusinesses in North America The Google Cloud Account Team had been instrumental in helping Bushel build an expansive agricultural platform that powers APIs, apps, websites, and digital solutions. Google’s startup experts are incredibly responsive, with deep technical knowledge that can’t be found elsewhere. Google Cloud also has provided us credits to explore new ways of analyzing the vast amounts of data we generate, verify, and transfer with solutions such as BigQuery andPub/Sub.With BigQuery, we can run analytics at scale with 26%–34% lower three-year TCO than cloud data warehouse alternatives. BigQuery delivers actionable insights on a highly secure and scalable platform, includes built-inmachine learning capabilities, and integrates with Pub/Sub to ingest and stream analytic events viaDataflow.With Bushel, farmers across North America are rapidly responding to sudden market changes by tracking grain prices in real time and instantly buying and selling crops. We see a future where this business information becomes insights - where a farmer can not just know where to sell their grain, but when to sell. The burden right now to engage with carbon markets is high, full of paper-based binders and verification forms. We see a world where farming practices recorded digitally can be permissioned along the supply chain for a better picture of how our food is grown. With the Bushel platform, millions of farmers around the world will have the digital tools to modernize local grain industries, build more sustainable agricultural supply chains, and help to address global food inequity.If you want to learn more about how Google Cloud can help your startup, visit our pagehere to get more information about our program, and sign up for our communications to get a look at our community activities, digital events, special offers, and more.

        "description": "More than two years ago, then-presidential candidate Joe Biden pledged to cancel at least $10,000 in federal student loans. The pledge has followed his administration ever since.Brendan Smialowski/AFP via Getty ImagesUpdated: 3:05 p.m. | Published 11 a.m.On Wednesday, President Biden announced a sweeping effort to forgive up to $20,000 of federal student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients, and up to $10,000 for other qualifying borrowers. Biden also extended the federal student loan payment pause through Dec. 31.&quot;In keeping with my campaign promise, my Administration is announcing a plan to give working and middle class families breathing room as they prepare to resume federal student loan payments in January 2023,&quot; Biden said in a tweet on Wednesday.U.S. Secretary of Education Miguel Cardona said in a statement, &quot;Today, we&#x27;re delivering targeted relief that will help ensure borrowers are not placed in a worse position financially because of the pandemic, and restore trust in a system that should be creating opportunity, not a debt trap.&quot;To qualify for the $10,000 forgiveness, individual borrowers must earn less than $125,000 a year, or less than $250,000 a year for couples. To qualify for the $20,000 forgiveness, borrowers must meet those income requirements and must have received a Pell Grant in college. Pell Grants are designed to help low-income students pay for higher education.The Department of Education estimates that, among borrowers who are no longer in school, nearly 90% of relief dollars will go to those earning less than $75,000 a year.About 43 million borrowers will benefit, and 20 million will have their debt completely canceled, according to a senior administration official. The White House said more than 60% of current federal student loan borrowers also received Pell Grants.According to the White House, Parent PLUS loans will also qualify for cancellation under the new policy.In order to benefit, though, most borrowers will have to submit an application to verify their income. The Education Department said nearly 8 million borrowers already have income information on file, and should qualify to have their debts canceled automatically. The department will announce further details on how borrowers can claim this relief in the weeks ahead.Some borrowers are celebrating, others hoped for moreMany borrowers are celebrating Biden&#x27;s announcement: Giselle Parks of Orlando, Fla., expects to have her $5,000 in student loan debt completely erased.&quot;Holy cow,&quot; she said. &quot;Holy cow... I need to tell my family immediately!&quot;Trianna Downing in D.C. said she was in shock. &quot;I can&#x27;t even process it yet... At first I was, like, dancing, and then I was like, wait, should I log into my account and see if it actually happened?&quot;Downing expects her debts to drop from $16,000 to $6,000.&quot;This is going to change and save lives,&quot; tweeted Rep. Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts, who has long advocated for student loan forgiveness.Sen. Elizabeth Warren, also of Massachusetts, highlighted the ways Biden&#x27;s plan could help address racial inequalities: &quot;Because Black Americans borrow more money to go to school, borrow more money in school and have a harder time paying their debt off after school, the President&#x27;s action will also help narrow the racial wealth gap in the United States among borrowers.&quot;According to a 2016 Brookings analysis, &quot;The moment they earn their bachelor&#x27;s degrees, black college graduates owe $7,400 more on average than their white peers... Differences in interest accrual and graduate school borrowing lead to black graduates holding nearly $53,000 in student loan debt four years after graduation — almost twice as much as their white counterparts.&quot;Some higher-debt borrowers were left disappointed by Wednesday&#x27;s announcement, especially after a group of House and Senate Democrats, including Pressley and Warren, had called on Biden to cancel $50,000 in federal student debt.&quot;It&#x27;s hard to be excited about it,&quot; says Briana Ford of Columbia, S.C. She&#x27;s a Black borrower who owes almost $60,000 in student loans.&quot;I wouldn&#x27;t give it back, but it&#x27;s hard to be excited about it.&quot;Republicans aren&#x27;t too excited either. They&#x27;ve long argued against broad-based loan forgiveness.&quot;This is a slap in the face to those who never went to college, as well as borrowers who upheld their responsibility to taxpayers and paid back their loans,&quot; said Rep. Virginia Foxx of North Carolina, the top Republican on the House Education Committee, in a Tuesday night statement.Many economists and higher education experts also opposed the move, arguing that widespread debt cancellation would do nothing to fix the rising costs of college.In a May analysis, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimated a policy like the one Biden announced would cost at least $230 billion, and warned that even income limits &quot;would do almost nothing to alleviate the central issues with the policy, namely that it is regressive, inflationary, expensive, and would likely do more to increase the cost of higher education going forward than to reduce it.&quot;Can a President even do this without the support of Congress?This question has been at the heart of the debt cancellation debate for several years now. After all, any move that essentially requires the government to spend money (or lose it) generally has to go through Congress. Right?Perhaps anticipating legal pushback, the Biden administration published its legal reasoning in a memorandum at the same time it announced the debt cancellation package.The memo says The HEROES Act, first enacted after the September 11 attacks, gives the Education Secretary the power to grant relief from student loan requirements during specific periods, think: wartime or a national emergency.As such, the memo argues, &quot;in present circumstances, this authority could be used to effectuate a program of categorical debt cancellation directed at addressing the financial harms caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.&quot;The administration made a similar argument in justifying its renovation of the troubled Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.That said, it&#x27;s possible, perhaps likely the move will be challenged in court.Will it make inflation worse?Experts have expressed concern that broad-based student loan forgiveness would exacerbate inflation, which is already one of Biden&#x27;s greatest political weaknesses heading into this fall&#x27;s midterm elections.&quot;Student loan debt relief is spending that raises demand and increases inflation,&quot; tweeted former U.S. Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers earlier this week.&quot;It consumes resources that could be better used helping those who did not, for whatever reason, have the chance to attend college. It will also tend to be inflationary by raising tuitions.&quot;Summers&#x27; opposition stirred considerable dissent.&quot;You have to tell a pretty bizarre story about expectations in order for loan forgiveness to boost inflation,&quot; responded Susan Dynarski, an economist and professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education.&quot;No one has been making student loan payments for two years. Forgiveness will *not* increase cash flow to borrowers right now. That increase in available cash happened *2 years ago* when payments were suspended.&quot;Borrowers have been waiting years for loan forgivenessThe loan forgiveness announcement comes more than two years after then-presidential candidate Joe Biden pledged to cancel at least $10,000 in federal student loans. The pledge has followed the administration since. Wednesday&#x27;s move comes after several extensions to the student loan moratorium, and attempts by some Democrats to expand forgiveness from the original plan to $50,000.In June, an NPR/Ipsos poll found a majority of the general public (55%) supported forgiving up to $10,000 of a person&#x27;s federal student loan debt. But the more generous the relief, the more that support narrowed. Forty-seven percent of all respondents said they supported forgiving up to $50,000 in debt, while 41% expressed support for wiping the slate completely clean for all borrowers.Support for debt relief was, not surprisingly, higher among borrowers themselves. But when asked to choose between debt forgiveness and addressing the high cost of college, an overwhelming majority — borrowers and non-borrowers alike — said addressing the rising cost of college was most important.

        "description": "A roundup of some recent outright assignments for players who cleared waivers following a DFA&#8230;\n\nMets lefty Sam Clay passed through waivers unclaimed and was assigned outright to Syracuse, tweets Michael Mayer of MetsMerized. The ground-ball specialist appeared in just one big league game with the Mets this season and allowed an unearned run on a hit and a walk with two punchouts. Clay carries a 5.90 ERA in 50 1/3 Major League innings but also boasts a mammoth 62.5% ground-ball rate in that time. He also has a career 3.81 ERA with a 24.8% strikeout rate in 59 Triple-A innings, making him a nice depth piece to have on hand in the upper minors, even if he&#8217;s yet to find real success in the big leagues just yet.\nVeteran infielder Deven Marrero also cleared outright waivers and was assigned to Triple-A Syracuse by the Mets after being designated last week. The team didn&#8217;t make a formal announcement on the matter, but Marrero, who could&#8217;ve rejected the assignment in favor of free agency, was back in the Syracuse lineup last night. Marrero, who&#8217;ll turn 32 tomorrow, appeared in three games at the big league level and went hitless in four plate appearances, though he did swipe a base. He&#8217;s a career .192/.247/.280 hitter in parts of seven big league seasons but is a well-regarded defender capable of handling any of shortstop, second base or third  base. He&#8217;s appeared in 33 games with Syracuse and hit .229/.323/.349 in 125 plate appearances.\nLeft-hander Paul Fry cleared waivers after being designated for assignment by the Diamondbacks and was assigned to Triple-A Reno, per the team&#8217;s transactions log at MLB.com. Fry has previously been outrighted and could rejected the assignment in favor of free agency, but he&#8217;d have punted the remainder of this year&#8217;s $850K guarantee in doing so, as he doesn&#8217;t yet have five years of Major Leaguer service time. The 30-year-old pitched just one MLB frame with the Snakes this season, plus another dozen with the Orioles, with whom he&#8217;s spent the prior four years. Fry was a solid lefty in the Baltimore &#8217;pen in 2020 and for much of the 2021 season before a late collapse last year (due primarily to repeat drubbings at the hands of the Rays). Fry hasn&#8217;t regained his form in either the big leagues (6.23 ERA in 13 innings) or Triple-A (5.50 ERA, 18 innings).",

        "description": "The city of Brussels celebrated Ukraine’s 31st independence day Wednesday by dressing the famous Manneken Pis statue in a traditional Kozak costume and unfurling the Ukrainian flag at Grand Place. \n\n\n\nHundreds of people — mainly Ukrainian women and children — gathered for singing, dancing and chanting, in a sea of blue and yellow.&nbsp;European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, also decked out in Ukrainian colors, even made an appearance. \n\n\n\nBut despite all the pomp and ceremony, Ukrainians in attendance found it hard to forget that the day also marks six months since Russia invaded their country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn &#8216;overwhelming day&#8217;\n\n\n\n“It’s an overwhelming day today,” said Svitlana, who has worked for the EU’s Erasmus+ student exchange program for more than 10 years in Kyiv. She had to move to Brussels to flee the war.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, Svitlana said she felt a sense of solidarity, gathering in central Brussels with other Ukrainian refugees. “I’m sure that since we are all so united, victory is coming soon.\n\n\n\n“Everybody is contributing to the victory in their own way, in their own front line, where they can do the most,” she added.\n\n\n\nIn May, estimates said around 78,000 Ukrainian refugees had arrived in Belgium, of which 30 percent went to Brussels.\n\n\n\nAnastasiia, 19, from Kherson, said: “I have wanted to cry the whole time today.” A journalism student in Belgium since April, she added that the sight of people on the train with Ukrainian flags made her &#8220;very emotional&#8221; but also &#8220;really proud of all we have done as a nation.”\n\n\n\nBut the sense of solidarity that came from the rally in Brussels also served to further highlight how tough things now are at home. “People in Ukraine have to stay in their houses and can not celebrate like people here in Brussels,” Ruskin and Alika, young students from Luhansk now living in Brussels, said. \n\n\n\nKyiv banned independence day mass gatherings, as President Volodymyr Zelenskyy warned citizens to be alert to possible Russian strikes.\n\n\n\nWe need more\n\n\n\nAn attendee waves a sign during the celebration of Ukraine&#8217;s Independence Day at the Grand-Place, Brussels | Luanna Muniz/POLITICO\n\n\n\nIn a recent message to the diaspora, Zelenskyy asked them to “remind [the world] of Ukraine, be there with the Ukrainian flag and spread the truth about the crimes of the occupiers” on independence day.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainians in Brussels’ main square delivered a clear message to European leaders: Thanks for the help, but we need more support. \n\n\n\n“We need more, especially when it comes to military aid and weapons deliveries,” said 17-year-old Alika. \n\n\n\nKaterina Kuz, who came with her mother from the central city of Dnipro, also expressed mixed feelings. “Europe has done a lot, but support has to continue.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnastasiia, the young student, pointed out, “the more weapons we have, the less people will die.”\n\n\n\nShe added: “We left our home, my parents left their jobs. Now, with occupation, there are new rules, new people that came from Russia to my hometown. They captured my school, my hospital, my music school.”\n\n\n\nAt the last count, the EU had given a total amount of €2.5 billion in financial support to Ukraine&#8217;s military.\n\n\n\nYearning for home\n\n\n\nAlika Gugnin, from Odesa and Ruskin Fedorenko, from Luhansk, moved to Brussels to study before the war | Wilhelmine Preussen/POLITICO\n\n\n\nWhile the Ukrainians interviewed expressed appreciation for the welcome they had received in Belgium and the efforts to integrate them, they emphasized that their presence is temporary.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Spending independence day here feels like I’m physically here, but my heart and spirit is in Ukraine,” said Svitlana. She stressed she hopes to go back soon.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKaterina shares this sentiment, but said her father had warned her to stay in Belgium for now. “The situation at home in Dnipro is worse than when I left. There are sirens every day and often there are explosions and rockets.”",

        "description": "The Trump administration pressured the Food and Drug Administration, including former FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn, to authorize unproven treatments for Covid-19 and the first Covid-19 vaccines on an accelerated timeline, according to a report released Wednesday by Democrats on the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis.\nSenior Trump administration officials fought for the reauthorization of hydroxychloroquine, a drug normally used to treat malaria and lupus, after the FDA revoked its emergency clearance of the drug because data showed it was ineffective against Covid-19 and could lead to potentially dangerous side effects, the report found. The Democrats' investigation also documents potential influence from former White House officials regarding the FDA’s decision to authorize convalescent plasma, and White House attempts to block the FDA from collecting additional safety data on Covid-19 vaccines in order to get them to the public before the 2020 presidential election.\n“The Select Subcommittee’s findings that Trump White House officials deliberately and repeatedly sought to bend FDA’s scientific work on coronavirus treatments and vaccines to the White House’s political will are yet another example of how the prior Administration prioritized politics over public health,” House Majority Whip Jim Clyburn (D-S.C.), who also chairs the subcommittee, said in a statement. \n“These assaults on our nation’s public health institutions undermined the nation’s coronavirus response,” he added.\nMuch of these pressure campaigns were reported in early 2020 by POLITICO and other outlets and President Donald Trump publicly called out the FDA and its commissioner on multiple occasions. But the committee report offers new color, through emails, texts and official testimony from Hahn about just how persistent some of these efforts inside the White House were throughout the summer and fall of 2020. \nA substantial portion of the report focuses on Peter Navarro, a former trade adviser under Trump, who worked on the administration’s coronavirus response. Navarro collaborated frequently with Steven Hatfill, an adjunct virology professor at George Washington University, who was one of Navarro's advisers and worked on the federal coronavirus response.\nPushing for hydroxychloroquine: According to emails collected over the course of the subcommittee's investigation, Navarro and Hatfill rallied other White House officials to pressure Hahn to reinstate the emergency use authorization for hydroxychloroquine after the agency revoked it in June 2020. At one point, Hatfill characterized the disagreement between White House officials and the FDA as a forthcoming “knife fight” to an unnamed, outside ally over email.\nThe report also found that Navarro tasked Hatfill with coming up with a presentation to get the FDA to reauthorize the drug. At one point, Hatfill wrote to William O’Neill, a cardiologist at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, and suggested conducting a prophylactic study of the medication in a correctional facility experiencing a coronavirus outbreak. O'Neill dismissed the suggestion, saying: \"There are all sort of regulations about enrolling prisoners in randomized trials. Most IRBs [institutional review boards] would never approve. I am not licensed in Indiana.\"\nHatfill and Navarro sought to discredit other prominent health officials who spoke out against the use of hydroxychloroquine, including Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. The two discussed plans to get the Department of Justice and the Health and Human Services Department's inspector general to conduct an investigation into Fauci and his email use. Hatfill, according to the report, pushed for Fauci's removal throughout the fall, telling Navarro in September, “You really need to consider what is likely to happen over the next 2 months if this little idiot and his Covid treatment panel is not fired.” Two weeks later, Hatfill wrote that “[t]here will be a house cleaning after elections. [A] really good cleaning.” \nIn a statement to POLITICO, Navarro maintained that he believed hydroxychloroquine was a valuable treatment for Covid-19, and that he was justified in carrying out Trump's orders to apply pressure to the FDA to make sure the drug was widely accessible. \"The partisan House Select Subcommittee report 'wrongly' perpetuates one of the most deadly lies of the pandemic, namely that the safe and powerful therapeutic to treat COVID, hydroxychloroquine, was somehow dangerous,\" he said. \"I would lose that battle with the FDA and hundreds of thousands of Americans would needlessly die because of Stephen Hahn, Janet Woodcock, Rick Bright, Tony Fauci and the broader FDA bureaucracy. The result will forever be a stain on the FDA and shame on the House Subcommittee for perpetuating the lie.\" \nHatfill also refutes the allegations in the report: \"The committee has squandered the taxpayer dollars in a failed attempt to discredit President Trump, Dr. Peter Navarro and our collective efforts to identify, produce and distribute an efficacious outpatient treatment for Covid-19.\"\nPolitical pressure: In multiple instances, the subcommittee said it found evidence of senior Trump officials planning to take actions that could benefit the administration politically.\nOfficials tried to pressure the FDA into authorizing convalescent plasma around the time of the Republican National Convention, emails reveal. The proposed investigation into Fauci would take place around the time of the 2020 presidential election in an attempt to sway voters in favor of Trump, the report says.\nThe Trump administration also tried to pressure the FDA to authorize the first Covid-19 vaccines ahead of the presidential election. When Hahn testified to the subcommittee in January 2022, he said that White House officials said they would not sign off on emergency use authorization language that required a 60-day safety follow up for late-stage clinical trials. Ultimately, the FDA went ahead with the 60-day follow-up plan without an explicit blessing from the White House, though the White House later cleared it.\nHatfill rejects the notion that his conduct was politically motivated. \"I am a doctor and was called to serve my country in that capacity. Politics had nothing to do with our work to save lives during Covid-19,\" he said.\nAnd their emails: The report also found evidence that Navarro and Hatfill had used a private email server for federal communications. The Department of Justice has sued Navarro get him to turn over other emails sent from his personal email account related to presidential matters, first revealed by a separate report from the the subcommittee.\n\"All my White House records are digitally preserved pending the resolution of a civil suit filed by the National Archives, which increasingly appears to have been unlawfully weaponized by the Department of Justice against both me and President Trump,\" Navarro said.\nThis is the second report in a series of investigations into the way Trump administration officials managed the coronavirus. The first found that the administration leaned heavily on the herd immunity theory around the virus’ spread to delay federal action. The committee is still investigating other aspects of the federal response to the pandemic.",

There is the evangelical upbringing under the strictures of the Seventh-day Adventists. The estrangement from parents and being raised by a grandmother. The childhood flight to the UK as a refugee from Zimbabwe. The physical abuse inflicted by a friend of the family in Glasgow. Being raised as Bridget, a name so British it could be a symbol of colonialism. The change of name to Mandla, which translates as “power”, the rejection of all personal pronouns and the self-identification as “agender”.With such a complex set of identities, Mandla is as British as a watermelon, a fruit that is familiar and delicious but whose provenance lies elsewhere. The minimalist stage is full of them. They are there for Mandla to stab, to prize open, to chop into pieces and try, in vain, to reconstruct.

        "description": "A federal judge in Texas in a Tuesday night ruling blocked guidance issued by the Biden administration that requires doctors to provide abortions in emergency medical situations even if doing so would run afoul of state law.\n\n\n\nIn a&nbsp;67-page ruling, U.S. District Judge James Hendrix halted emergency abortion guidance that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued last month in the wake of the Supreme Court's overruling of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\nThe practical effect of the ruling was to halt HHS from enforcing its guidance in Texas, stopping short of a nationwide injunction. Hendrix also blocked the administration from applying its regulation against two co-plaintiffs in the case, a pair of anti-abortion doctors’ associations.\n\n\n\nThe judge's ruling dealt a blow to the administration, which had urged the court to find that a 1986 federal law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) superseded some restrictive state abortion laws passed in the wake of Roe's demise.\n\n\n\nEMTALA requires a hospital to provide stabilizing care to any patient that presents with an emergency medical condition. HHS says abortion qualifies as stabilizing care under the law.\n\n\n\nThe legal development comes as a patchwork of state abortion laws have emerged as a result of the Supreme Court’s toppling of Roe, which for nearly a half-century recognized a constitutional right to abortion up to the point of fetal viability, around 23 weeks.\n\n\n\nHendrix, a Trump-appointed judge in Lubbock, Texas, ruled that the HHS guidance exceeded the authority that Congress granted to the agency though EMTALA.\n\n\n\n\"That Guidance goes well beyond EMTALA’s text, which protects both mothers and unborn children, is silent as to abortion, and preempts state law only when the two directly conflict,\" Hendrix wrote.\n\n\n\nAttorneys with the Department of Justice who are representing the Biden administration in the case did not immediately respond when asked for comment.\n\n\n\nRyan Bangert, a lawyer with the conservative Christian legal advocacy organization Alliance Defending Freedom, which represents the doctors’ groups, hailed the ruling.\n\n\n\n“We’re pleased to see the court halt the administration’s attempt to flagrantly disregard the legislative and democratic process, and we’ll continue to defend those in the medical profession who wish to respect and save lives, not take them,” Bangert said.\n\n\n\nThe decision by the Texas-based judge comes ahead of a ruling in a similar case in which the Biden administration sued the state of Idaho, arguing that EMTALA preempts the state’s strict abortion ban. A ruling in that case, United States v. State of Idaho, is expected by Wednesday.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 1:09 p.m.",

        "description": "A mayor of a North Carolina town is under investigation by federal authorities after livestreaming the teardown of a Confederate monument. \n\n\n\nIn a Facebook Live video posted on Sunday, Enfield, N.C., Mayor Mondale Robinson livestreamed the teardown of a Confederate monument that had stood in the town for over 90 years, instructing a volunteer driving a tractor to push the main piece of the monument to the ground. \n\n\n\n“Yessir,” Robinson yelled during the live stream. “Death to the Confederacy around here! Not in my town, not on my watch.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the town’s board of commissioners voted 4-1 in favor of removing the 10-foot monument from the town’s Randolph Park area, The Washington Post reported. \n\n\n\nBut Robinson, who was elected as Enfield’s mayor earlier this year, may have violated a state law that outlined initial procedures for monument removal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNorth Carolina’s State Bureau of Investigation (NCSBI) confirmed to The Hill on Wednesday that it has received requests from Enfield Police Department Chief James Ayers and its District Attorney Andrew Murray to launch an investigation into the property damage at the park where the monument had stood.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSBI spokesperson also said that the district attorney’s office will determine whether criminal charges are appropriate in the case after completing its investigation. \n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Ayers for comment and more information.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe monument was built in 1928 to honor service members who fought and died in the Civil War and World War I and honored service members who fought in other wars such as World War II, the Korean War and the Persian Gulf War, according to CBS affiliate WNCN.\n\n\n\nIn a statement to The Hill, Robinson said he has no regrets about the removal of the statue, saying that he did it in the best interest of his town, which has a mostly Black population, and added that he doesn't understand the reasoning to the NCSBI’s investigation into the matter. \n\n\n\nRobinson also mentioned that he has received racist emails and messages about the removal of the 94-year-old Confederate statue. \n\n\n\n“That is about slavery and that's all it is,” Robinson told The Hill. \"So for me, it's a no-brainer why the statute had to fall,  It's a no-brainer why I have no regrets. It's a no-brainer.”",

        "description": "If Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who lost her House primary last week, decides to embark on a presidential run in 2024 as an independent, she could end up hurting President Biden’s chances of reelection more than Trump’s, according to a new Yahoo News/You Gov poll. \n\n\n\nAfter Cheney lost her reelection bid for the House to Trump-backed GOP candidate Harriet Hageman, she said she has political ambitions that go past Congress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That’s a decision that I’m going to make in the coming months, and I’m not going to make any announcements here this morning. But it is something that I am thinking about, and I’ll make a decision in the coming months,” Cheney said after her loss, when asked about a potential White House bid.\n\n\n\nShe later told Politico that she is “not at all focused” on specifics of a 2024 run, keeping open the possibility she could run as an independent. \n\n\n\nThe poll found that in a standoff between Trump and Biden without Cheney, Biden would lead Trump by 4 points among registered voters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, if it is a race among Trump, Biden and Cheney, with Cheney running as an independent, the poll found she would end up pulling more votes away from Biden.\n\n\n\nIn a three-way matchup in the poll, Trump jumped to the lead, beating Biden by more than 8 points.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCheney could also, of course, challenge Trump as a Republican and seek to damage him in a primary to the extent that he cannot survive a general election.\n\n\n\nCheney, the top Republican on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, is Trump's most vocal GOP critic on Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\nShe has said numerous times Trump is unfit for office, while he has painted Cheney as a “RINO,” an acronym meaning Republican in name only, saying she has turned her back on her party. ",

        "description": "How much of America’s $30.7 trillion national debt is a result of fraud? A lot, and it’s growing exponentially.\n\n\n\nEliminating “waste, fraud and abuse” is a standard political campaign mantra. It almost never happens. And while the problem has grown worse over the years, federal COVID-19 relief and the Biden administration have goosed the surge.\n\n\n\nHere’s how New York Times reporter David A. Fahrnethold began a recent news article, “In the midst of the pandemic, the government gave unemployment benefits to the\n\n\n\n&nbsp;incarcerated, the&nbsp;imaginary&nbsp;and the dead. It sent money to “farms” that turned out to be front yards. It paid people who were on the government’s ‘Do Not Pay List.’ It gave loans to 342 people who said their name was ‘N/A.’”\n\n\n\nThe magnitude of the fraud is matched only by the magnitude of government incompetence. Pervasive fraud in government programs has spread from endemic to pandemic. And the feds are well aware of the problem.\n\n\n\nIn April, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) provided its latest update on the extent of the problem: “For fiscal year 2021, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) reported that federal agencies had estimated about $281 billion in improper payments, which was an increase of about $75 billion from the prior fiscal year and approximately double the amount reported in fiscal year 2017.”\n\n\n\nNote the improper payment doubling in just five years, from 2017 to 2021.\n\n\n\nWorse yet, the GAO adds: “[T]his estimate is likely understated since it doesn’t include improper payments related to COVID-19 funding (such as the Small Business Administration’s Paycheck Protection).”\n\n\n\nThe GAO defines “improper payments” as “payments that shouldn’t have been made or were made in the incorrect amount.” In other words, improper payments aren’t all fraud, but a lot of it is.\n\n\n\nThe improper payments estimate may also be low because “the government still doesn’t fully understand the size of federal improper payments, partly because it doesn’t have complete, reliable, or accurate estimates,” explains the GAO.\n\n\n\nWith respect to the COVID relief programs, the fraud is mindboggling, what some prosecutors are calling the largest fraud in U.S. history.\n\n\n\nNBC tallies up some of the known and suspected fraud:\n\n\n\n$80 billion for the COVID relief plan known as the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP);\n\n\n\n$90 billion to $400 billion for the COVID unemployment program; and\n\n\n\n$80 billion from the COVID disaster relief program.\n\n\n\nIn June, House Majority Whip Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.) blamed President Trump for the COVID-19 Economic Injury Disaster Loan program, which was overseen by the Small Business Administration (SBA). That’s a ludicrous accusation.\n\n\n\nBoth Democrats and Republicans were eager to get the first pandemic relief legislation out in a matter of days, and neither party paid attention to the potential for fraud. The subsequent pandemic relief bills that passed in 2020 were also bipartisan. And President Biden’s American Rescue Plan, which passed in February 2021, was a Democratic party-line vote.\n\n\n\nDemocrats controlled the House and Senate in 2020. As majority whip, Clyburn could have demanded appropriate steps to control fraud before passing the bills. He didn’t. Nor did any other Democratic leader.\n\n\n\nMoreover, Democrats have long pushed to expand federal programs that were rife with fraud.\n\n\n\nTake Medicaid, the federal-state health insurance program for the poor. Democrats vastly expanded Medicaid in the Affordable Care Act (i.e., ObamaCare), with little effort to address systemic fraud in the program. And it has grown significantly since the pandemic began.\n\n\n\nLast January, the Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA), a private, nonprofit, conservative-leaning public policy group, released a report on Medicaid’s improper payments. It notes that Medicaid now covers 89 million people at a cost of nearly $700 billion per year. While the national improper payment rate for Medicaid is about 22 percent, FGA says it can reach nearly 50 percent in some fraud-prone states.\n\n\n\nFGA points out that “Virtually all improper payments are due to eligibility errors, administrative oversights, or outright fraud.” And it adds, “because eligibility errors make up more than 80 percent of improper payments, countless individuals are receiving Medicaid benefits for which they are not eligible.” Whether you consider covering ineligible people fraud or abuse, it costs hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have never taken major steps to expel the ineligible from Medicaid. Why would they? If you believe that every American should be in a government-run health care program, and many Democrats do, why would you go to the effort of removing those who aren’t eligible? They’re exactly where Democrats want them.\n\n\n\nCan government limit the fraud? Only at the margins. The federal government is way too big, it hands out way too much money and government is way too inefficient to dramatically reduce fraud. To do that, government programs would have to be radically downsized or eliminated. And as the recent Build Back Better-lite legislation demonstrated, there is no desire to do that.\n\n\n\nMerrill Matthews is a resident scholar with the Institute for Policy Innovation in Dallas, Texas.

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House announced a $10,000 student debt loan forgiveness plan on Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe plan eliminates monthly payments for about 15 million student borrowers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMillions will see their loan balances slightly lowered and those on income-driven repayment plans may not see any changes to their monthly payments. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Biden’s&nbsp;student loan forgiveness&nbsp;plan announced on Wednesday would effectively wipe out federal loan&nbsp;balances for at least a third of student borrowers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe administration’s plan eliminates up to $10,000 per federal borrower earning less than $125,000 per year or families making less than $250,000, making it the largest ever effort toward federal student loan forgiveness. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn extension of the federal moratorium on student loan payments was extended&nbsp;through Dec. 31. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBorrowers who received a federal Pell Grant during college, and meet the income criteria, will be eligible to receive $20 million in loan forgiveness—about 7 million students receive Pell Grants every year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, out of the approximately 45 million borrowers in the U.S., about 15 million have loan debt under $10,000. Millions will likely see their loan balances slightly lowered and little change to monthly payments once they resume. \n\n\n\nBiden’s plan does not address those borrowers who have privately held loans, with a bank or credit union,&nbsp;which accounts for about 13 percent&nbsp;of student borrowers and 8 percent of the nation’s outstanding loan debt — close to $140 billion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData shows the average student borrower owes more than $37,000 in federal student loan debt to be paid off over 20 years.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany borrowers who are on&nbsp;income-driven repayment plans —&nbsp;about one in every three student borrowers — also may not see their monthly payments change, as their payments are dependent on their earnings, not their loan balance.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If the borrower is in an income-driven repayment plan, there will be no impact on the loan payments, since those are based on the borrower's income and not the amount owed. It is possible that it will cause the loan to be paid off in full sooner,” student loan expert&nbsp;Mark Kantrowitz told Changing America in an emailed statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLoan forgiveness will also cost the federal government, according to&nbsp;Kevin Miller, associate director of higher education at the Bipartisan Policy Center, who told Changing America that there will be a loss incurred. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“For some loans, the federal government wasn’t going to recover balances in full anyway. But forgiveness offered to borrowers who were making timely payments will be a real cost for the government,” said Miller.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMiller also noted that the cost of forgiveness for the&nbsp;federal government will also be determined by the guardrails established for eligibility, like limiting the benefit to those who earn less than $125,000 annually.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne analysis by the Brookings Institution estimated that a $10,000 loan forgiveness plan could cost the federal government about $373 billion. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet Biden’s plan falls short for&nbsp;progressives, who pushed the president to cancel&nbsp;$50,000 per borrower, arguing it would help narrow the racial wealth gap, provide immediate relief to millions during a recession and become a massive consumer-driven stimulus to the economy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a vocal advocate of complete student loan forgiveness, wrote on social media before reporting emerged on the administration’s expected announcement that&nbsp;Biden holds the power to eliminate student debt entirely given the federal government’s recent history of corporate bailouts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If we can bail out Wall Street after their greed, recklessness, and illegal behavior drove us into the worst recession in modern history, then YES — we absolutely can cancel every single cent of student debt in this country,” Sanders tweeted.&nbsp;",

        "description": "(NEXSTAR) – A 61-year-old woman has died after being mauled by multiple dogs in Putnam County, Florida, over the weekend.\n\n\n\nPamela Jane Rock, an employee of the U.S. Postal Service, was working in the rural town of Interlachen on Sunday afternoon when the attack occurred. Witnesses contacted the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office shortly before 1 p.m. after hearing Rock’s screams and seeing the victim in the road, being attacked by five dogs belonging to a nearby resident.\n\n\n\nAs neighbors attempted to scare the dogs away by firing a gun, though the attempt was “unsuccessful,” said Colonel Joseph Wells, the Chief Deputy of the Putnam County Sheriff’s Office, at a press conference Wednesday morning.\n\n\n\nDeputies arrived to find Rock bleeding in the street, at which point they administered first aid and applied three tourniquets. By this point, the dogs had already been restrained by their owner and a neighbor, Chief Wells said.\n\n\n\nRock was transported to a local medical center, experiencing cardiac arrest on the way to the medical center. She was later transported to a hospital in Gainesville, where she died Monday evening.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTerrorism experts, dog breeders gather to reverse shortage of domestic bomb sniffing dogs\t\n\n\n\n\nAt Wednesday’s press conference, Chief Wells confirmed that animal control officers and sheriff’s deputies had previously been called to the area at least four times over the past three years. Two of those times, the deputies had responded to the same address where the dogs’ owner lived, but Chief Wells could not confirm whether they had responded to concerns over those same dogs.\n\n\n\nHe added that the dogs had been fenced in, but were able to “move some rocks that the bottom of the fence was lined with” and escape the property.\n\n\n\nThe owner of the dog could also “possibly” face criminal charges, pending an investigation, Chief Wells added.\n\n\n\nThe five dogs, meanwhile, will be euthanized according to Florida state law, he said.\n\n\n\nA representative for the United States Postal Service said the agency was “deeply saddened” by Rock’s death.\n\n\n\n\"A postal family member lost her life in a dog bite attack,” reads a statement shared with Nexstar. “The U.S. Postal Service is deeply saddened at the loss of our employee. Our thoughts and prayers are with her family and her co-workers at this time.”\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tDog tests positive for monkeypox in first suspected human-to-pet transmission\t\n\n\n\n\nUSPS added that employees are instructed to use their mail bags as a “soft shield” and are “equipped to carry pepper spray” in the event of dog attacks, but urged homeowners to be responsible for their pets when mail carriers are nearby, suggesting they move dogs to another room, refrain from taking mail directly from a carrier if the dog is close by, or enroll their dog in obedience training.\n\n\n\nPet owners may also be instructed to pick up their mail at a post office if the mail carrier “feels threatened,” according to USPS.\n\n\n\n“Unfortunately attacks such as this provide the Postal Service an opportunity to remind dog owners that it is their responsibility to restrain their pet in order to avoid attacks against our employees while they are in performance of their duties,” USPS writes.",

But the evidence is mounting that the national political environment right now actually leans toward Democrats.&#8221;\n&#8220;Up until mid-June, special elections for the U.S. House during the Biden presidency were pointing to a national political environment that was neutral or a little bit Republican-leaning. On average, Republicans did 2 points better in those elections than you’d expect based on the districts’ FiveThirtyEight partisan leans.&#8221;\n&#8220;That all changed, though, starting in late June — immediately after the Supreme Court issued its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson, overturning the constitutional right to abortion. There have been four first-past-the-post special House elections since that decision, and Democrats have outperformed their expected margins in those elections by an average of 9 points.&#8221;",

        "description": "An adorable black cat named Aries was born to a feral litter with misshapen joints in his back legs that make him look like a spider when he walks. \n\n\n\nLuckily, a shelter rescued the whole litter.  Aries wound up in a foster home that gave him both love and attention so that when he was adopted into his permanent home, he was able to walk and play with the other cats in his new household. Aries appears to be completely aware of his disability. In fact, he is far more adventurous than many other house cats. He loves to go outside. He doesn&#8217;t mind being put in a carrier and/or harness because it means that he can run on the beach, go to the park or even go for a boat ride. He&#8217;s also very happy to stay at home where he can eat all the shrimp he wants.\n\n\n\nThe adventures of a shrimp-loving kitty with special leggies! Life can be amazing!\n\n\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Aries The Cat Ambassador (@aries.the.cat.ambassador) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Aries The Cat Ambassador (@aries.the.cat.ambassador) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Aries The Cat Ambassador (@aries.the.cat.ambassador) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Aries The Cat Ambassador (@aries.the.cat.ambassador) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Aries The Cat Ambassador (@aries.the.cat.ambassador) \n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by Aries The Cat Ambassador (@aries.the.cat.ambassador) \n\n\n\nvia Miss Cellania",

        "description": "Seventy-nine percent of parents say they became more interested in how their child was being educated during the pandemic, when the process went largely virtual, according to a new survey.\n\n\n\nThe survey, conducted by the Harris Poll on behalf of the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools, similarly found that 84 percent of parents agreed they learned more about how their child was educated during pandemic at-home education, and 78 percent said they became more involved in their child’s education because of what they saw.\n\n\n\n“Things were moving along as usual, and then within a few weeks of being at home all day with their children, parents were able to see first-hand what their students were learning, or not learning,” the National Alliance wrote in its report.\n\n\n\n“Some students were receiving only a few hours of remote-learning instruction per week,” the report continued. “Parents began to talk among themselves, sharing tips with each other.”\n\n\n\nSeventy-one percent of parents worried about learning loss during the pandemic, and concerns heightened about safety and the overall wellbeing of students while they are learning, according to the survey.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe survey also found that more parents appeared to switch their child’s category of school since the pandemic.\n\n\n\nSeventeen percent said they switched their child’s school type since March 2020 — a span of roughly two years — compared to 15 percent who said they switched their child’s school type at any time prior to the pandemic. Three-quarters of parents who made a switch since the pandemic said they made the decision due to COVID-19–related factors.\n\n\n\n“For many parents, this new interest and involvement may have made them highly motivated to make changes to their child’s education,” the report states.\n\n\n\nMore than 4 in 5 parents agreed that education has become a more important political issue to them than in the past. Eighty-two percent said they were willing to cross party lines to vote for a candidate aligned with their education views, the survey found.\n\n\n\nThe survey was conducted online and included interviews with 5,002 parents with school-aged children between May 19 and May 31. The data was weighted on demographic factors like race, region and household income.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House announced an expansive plan to tackle the national student debt crisis on Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt includes loan forgiveness of $10,000 for federal borrowers who earn less than $125,000 annually.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPell Grant recipients are eligible for $20,000 in loan forgiveness, with the same $125,000 income cap.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPresident Biden is directing the Education Department to forgive $10,000 in federal student loan debt for nearly all U.S. borrowers, an unprecedented decision that will impact&nbsp;millions of borrowers with immediate financial relief. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration formally announced its highly anticipated student debt forgiveness plan Wednesday, which will forgive $10,000 for every federal student loan borrower who earns less than $125,000 annually. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe administration is also cancelling up to $20,000 for those student borrowers who received Pell Grants, applying the same income cap.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I’m keeping with my campaign promise, my administration is announcing a plan to give working and middle class families breathing room as they prepare to resume federal student loan payments in January 2023,” Biden said on social media. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere’s what the plan includes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n$10,000 in debt forgiveness for all federal borrowers&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFederal borrowers who earn less than $125,000 and did&nbsp;not receive a Pell Grant will be eligible to have $10,000 of their student loan balances forgiven. This will likely eliminate the balances of at least 15 million borrowers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n$20,000 debt reduction for Pell Grant recipients&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMillions of borrowers who received Pell Grants during college and meet&nbsp;the administration's income requirements will see 20,000 removed from their balances. Data shows around 7 million students receive Pell Grants each year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExtends&nbsp;pandemic-related pause on student loan payments&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe administration is also extending the federal moratorium on student loan payments for a sixth and final time. Payments will resume in January 2023, concluding the pause which has spanned more than two years and two administrations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOverhauls&nbsp;income-driven repayment plans&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Education Department is proposing a new rule that would reduce future monthly payments for lower- and middle-income borrowers from 10 percent to 5 percent of discretionary income. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt would also raise the amount of income that’s considered nondiscretionary, therefore protected from repayment. The proposed rule is also tackling interest, so a borrower’s loan balance will not increase as long as they are making their required monthly payments.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe new rule would forgive loan balances after 10 years of payments, instead of the current 20 years under many income-driven repayment plans for borrowers with original loan balances of $12,000 or less.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf approved, the rule&nbsp;would apply to borrowers with undergraduate degree loans and graduate degree loans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEases loan forgiveness under Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Department is proposing a rule that would allow more payments to qualify for PSLF, including partial, lump sum and late payments and allowing certain kinds of deferments and forbearances. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nTackles college accountability&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe department&nbsp;is proposing to reinstate and improve a rule to hold career programs accountable for leaving their graduates with unaffordable debt — like when DeVry University was found to have defrauded nearly 1,800 students after making widespread, substantial misrepresentations about its job placement rates.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Department also said it intends to act against colleges that have contributed to the student debt crisis, including publishing an annual watch list of the programs with the worse debt levels in the country. This is in addition to requesting institutional improvement plans from colleges concerning debt outcomes that outline how the college intends to bring down debt levels.&nbsp;",

Haha. Hahah. Sniff. Haha. Sniff. Ha--breaks down crying hysterically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBREAKING THIS MORNING \n\n\n\nHey, let me cover $10,000 for you:\n\n\n\nPresident Biden announced on Wednesday that his administration is canceling a chunk of student loan debt — as well as extending the payment pause for existing loans.\n\n\n\nBiden tweeted the announcement\n\n\n\nSpecifically, what will be forgiven?: At least $10,000 for borrowers who make less than $125,000 a year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPlus:&nbsp;Biden is also forgiving $20,000 of debt for those that received a Pell grant&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDetails of the payment pause: Payments can be paused until the end of the year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKeep in mind about the White House’s timing: The student loan pause would have expired on Aug. 31 unless Biden intervened. Biden just returned to the White House this morning from his vacation in Rehoboth Beach, Del.\n\n\n\nJUST ANNOUNCED — BIDEN WILL DELIVER REMARKS AT 2:15 P.M. EDT:&nbsp;From the Roosevelt Room.&nbsp;Livestream\n\n\n\n‘BIDEN STUDENT LOAN PLANS CAUGHT IN INFLATION DEBATE CROSSHAIRS’:&nbsp;Via The Hill’s&nbsp;Aris Folley&nbsp;\n\n\n\n‘MORE THAN $10B IN STUDENT LOANS FOR PUBLIC WORKERS CANCELED AHEAD OF BROADER BIDEN ANNOUNCEMENT’:&nbsp;“The Department of Education has announced that it has provided more than $10 billion in student debt relief for public workers 10 months into a new program. The relief covers more than 175,000 people…”&nbsp;What we know about the new program&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPHOTO OF BIDEN LEAVING THE BEACH AND RETURNING TO WASHINGTON, D.C.:&nbsp;From Reuters’ Nandita Bose&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s Wednesday. I’m Cate Martel with a quick recap of the morning and what’s coming up. Did someone forward this newsletter to you? Sign up here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🗳&nbsp;On the campaign trail&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo House committee chairs entered the ring.:\n\n\n\nHouse Judiciary Committee Chairman&nbsp;Jerrold Nadler&nbsp;(D-N.Y.) won his primary over House Oversight and Reform Committee Chairwoman&nbsp;Carolyn Maloney&nbsp;(D-N.Y.) on Tuesday after redistricting forced the two to run against each other.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKeep in mind: Both Nadler and Maloney have served in Congress since the early 1990s. This will end Maloney’s House career.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWas Nadler’s win a surprise?: Not really. He had strong polling and endorsements from The New York Times and Senate Majority Leader&nbsp;Charles Schumer&nbsp;(D-N.Y.).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow this race recently became contentious&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRon DeSantis’s battle opponent has been determined:&nbsp;Rep.&nbsp;Charlie Crist&nbsp;(D-Fla.)&nbsp;will face off&nbsp;against Florida Gov.&nbsp;Ron DeSantis&nbsp;(R) in the fall after winning his primary on Tuesday night.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTidbit:&nbsp;Crist served as Florida’s *Republican* governor until 2011.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDeSantis got an indirect shoutout in Crist’s victory speech: “Our fundamental freedoms are literally on the ballot, my friends. A woman’s right to choose: on the ballot. Democracy: on the ballot. Your rights as minorities are on this ballot … Make no mistake about it, because this guy wants to be president of the United States of America and everybody knows it. However, when we defeat him on Nov. 8, that show is over.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFIVE TAKEAWAYS FROM TUESDAY’S PRIMARIES:&nbsp;1. “Democrats make safe choice to take on DeSantis.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. “The Democratic establishment held its own.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. “Special elections in New York give Democrats new hope.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n4. “Maloney loss ushers end of political era in Manhattan.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n5. “Particularly contentious primary season gives way to general election.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nContext and details for each, from The Hill’s&nbsp;Max Greenwood&nbsp;\n\n\n\n‘DEMOCRAT RYAN WINS BELLWETHER SPECIAL ELECTION FOR NY HOUSE SEAT’: This special election has been watched closely because it’s a swing district and a predictor for midterm election outcomes. More on that race \n\n\n\nTIDBIT — THERE’S A SURGE IN WOMEN REGISTERING TO VOTE: “Several states where reproduction rights are at risk are seeing a surge in women registering to vote following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade case, abolishing the constitutional right to abortion.” What we know\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🍊&nbsp;In Mar-a-Lago&nbsp;\n\n\n\n700 … pages … of … classified … documents:&nbsp;Via The Hill’s&nbsp;Rebecca Beitsch, “Former&nbsp;President Trump’s resistance to turning over what now appears to be a much larger tranche of documents than previously known could strengthen a potential case from the Justice Department against him and renews questions over whether the delay harmed national security.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNew estimates of what Trump took: “A letter released by the National Archives on Tuesday indicates that an initial batch of 15 boxes of documents taken from Mar-a-Lago in January included 100 classified documents totaling 700 pages.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDid the Trump team know the FBI wanted the docs?: “The letter from the National Archives indicates that Trump’s legal team was aware as early as April that the FBI was eager to obtain the documents so that they could do a damage assessment to determine whether there was any fallout related to their mishandling.”&nbsp;What we know&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the National Archives’ letter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🦠&nbsp;Latest with COVID&nbsp;\n\n\n\n➤&nbsp;THE COVID-19 NUMBERS&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCases to date: 93.5 million&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDeath toll: 1,035,758&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCurrent hospitalizations: 31,429&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShots administered: 607 million&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFully vaccinated: 67.4 percent of Americans&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCDC data here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🐥Notable tweets&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis will never *not* make me squirm:&nbsp;WUSA9’s&nbsp;Reese Waters&nbsp;tweeted a video of a rat walking down the escalator of a D.C. metro stop. Watch the video from @saracplana&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCBS News’s Kathryn Watson astutely pointed out: “At least the rats around here have some manners. Not standing on the left side of the escalator.”  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⏱On tap&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe House and Senate are out.&nbsp;President Biden&nbsp;is in Washington, D.C.&nbsp;Vice President Harris&nbsp;has no public events scheduled.\n\n\n\n10 a.m.: Biden left Rehoboth Beach, Del.&nbsp;10:55 a.m.: Biden arrived at the White House.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n All times Eastern. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📺What to watch&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2:15 p.m.: Biden delivers remarks from the Roosevelt Room.3 p.m.: White House press secretary&nbsp;Karine Jean-Pierre&nbsp;holds a press briefing.&nbsp;Livestream\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🧇 🍑 In lighter news \n\n\n\nToday is&nbsp;National Waffle Day&nbsp;and&nbsp;National Peach Pie Day!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI’ve given too much thought to this family’s family tree:\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post’s Cathy Free writes, “These identical twins married identical twins. Now they have sons.”  \n\n\n\nIf you’re wondering how planned it was: “[W[hen the two sets of siblings met in 2017 at — where else? — the annual Twins Days Festival in Twinsburg, Ohio, they all decided this could be their perfect match. The Deanes and the Salyerses spent a year dating, and when all four were sure they had found their match, they returned to the festival and got married right there, in matching outfits.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd now: “And if that weren’t enough, the two couples — who now live in a house they share in Bedford County, Va. — went back to the twins festival earlier this month, this time with their sons, born about five months apart.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPhotos and the full story&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd because you made it this far,&nbsp;here’s a dog enjoying independent play.&nbsp;",

It made headlines globally, most likely because of the juxtaposition: “It’s a car park and it’s that king,” says Philippa Langley. “So it’s a really great story.”Her agreement surprises me. Langley spent eight years looking for the remains of the king, after trying to restore his reputation for the previous decade. I don’t think it’s unfair to say that she thinks he is objectively the most interesting thing ever – and, from her perspective, this story doesn’t need any frilling up with the bathos of a private car park.

Audio messages poured into our inboxes from around the world, with multiple emails arriving every minute. There was a man who said that he had met Oprah and realized he was an alcoholic, a woman who shared that she had finally found time to finish a scarf after five years and another man who said he had finished his thesis on representations of horsemanship in American cinema. Eventually, we decided to construct the entire show out of these messages.This episode is the result — a Daily holiday card of good news, from our team to you.",

        "description": "State officials and police are offering renewed assurances that this year’s Minnesota State Fair will be safe and uneventful.There&#x27;s a new vehicle barrier at the Como Avenue entrance, plenty of law enforcement officers and even a new neighborhood watch group. They’ll be outside the front gate waiting for State Fair-goers to start walking in on Thursday for the annual 12-day extravaganza in Falcon Heights.“The good news is it&#x27;s a safe fair. It’s going to be a great fair,” Minnesota Public Safety Commissioner and former St. Paul Police Chief John Harrington said at the fairgrounds on Tuesday afternoon.He was standing at the fair&#x27;s transit entrance, where hundreds of thousands of fairgoers will walk in — passing through metal detectors for the second year.Harrington was joined by Gov. Tim Walz and the fair’s new police chief, Ron Knafla, to outline some of the steps they&#x27;re taking to ensure safety at the fair after a reported 20 percent spike in crime last year in the state — and amid persistent reports about a shortage of public safety personnel, particularly in the Twin Cities.A crowd packs onto the street on the opening day of the Minnesota State Fair on Aug 22, 2019.Christine T. Nguyen | MPR News fileKnafla said a full complement of 200 officers will be working on the 300-acre fairgrounds. They&#x27;ll also be patrolling the the fair&#x27;s perimeter — where most of the recent troubles have happened, including a shooting that wounded three people outside the main gate as the fair shut down for the year in 2019.“We have officers from 55 to 60 different agencies working for us,” Knafla said. “We&#x27;ve got a great partnership with a lot of law enforcement agencies that has been historic, for years. We&#x27;ve enhanced some of those relationships, we&#x27;ve built some new ones, we&#x27;re confident we have a good plan to keep this a safe and great state fair.”He noted they&#x27;ve already made plain an important message — that guns don&#x27;t belong at the fair. Fair officials turned back a legal challenge to their firearms ban in federal court earlier this summer, and Knafla said they recovered a gun in a planter outside the fair last year, apparently abandoned by someone as they approached the fair&#x27;s metal detectors.Knafla also said they&#x27;ve been recalibrating their preparations, including a crash-resistant vehicle barrier at one of the main service entrances on Underwood Street. Attacks like the shooting rampage at a Fourth of July parade near Chicago last month are on the minds of officials as they get ready for this year&#x27;s fair.“Unfortunately, that&#x27;s the sign of the times, right?” Knafla said. “You’ve seen it across the country. And that&#x27;s one of the things we prepare and plan for.” Knafla said he can&#x27;t offer too many details, for security reasons. MoreState Fair focused on addressing accessibilityBut it isn’t just the high-profile incidents that will be getting new scrutiny this year. Residents near the fair&#x27;s main gate say that even though attendance was down significantly last year, the pandemic brought a surge of private vehicles to the area — and with it a spike in parking complaints, speeding incidents and disturbances as people came and went from the 2021 fair.“There’s been more assaults, there&#x27;s been more gunfire and more nuisance behaviors, too. And so we decided we needed to become organized,” said Kate McCreight, who lives east of the fairgrounds. McCreight said her neighbors are coordinating with the local police commander. They&#x27;re going to be out on the street watching more and later at night, and even trying to make the experience a little easier for the thousands of people who walk, drive — and sometimes stagger — by.“The idea is to lead them on to their next destination. Which has been our mantra for this fair,” McCreight said.They&#x27;ll be out in distinctive green T-shirts that say “I&#x27;m a neighbor,” to serve as ambassadors, guides and eyes on the street, and maybe remind people that the fair doesn&#x27;t just have pronto pups and grandstand shows, but people living a stone&#x27;s throw away.Jennifer Victor-Larsen lives just two blocks from the fair&#x27;s front door, and says her family does love it there — the music and the fireworks and the activity of the fair. But she hopes fairgoers can step up their manners a little from recent years.“People are working a lot more from home now, babies are trying to sleep and take their naps and go to bed at night — and kids have started school in a lot of cases,” she said. “So just remember there are people here and treat it like you would your own neighborhood. Take a breath before you go in.”",

        "description": "The Giants have placed first baseman Brandon Belt on the 10-day injured list due to discomfort in his bothersome right knee, per a team announcement. Outfielder Bryce Johnson has been recalled from Triple-A Sacramento take his spot on the roster.\nBelt, 34, has been battling chronic knee issues for much of the season and acknowledged in a candid interview with the San Francisco Chronicle&#8217;s Susan Slusser yesterday that the injury could well impact his baseball future. &#8220;I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t thought about what happens if I’m not able to bounce back,&#8221; Belt told Slusser. &#8220;But I don’t like thinking about it, because it’s kind of upsetting.&#8221;\nWith two surgeries on that problematic knee already in the rear-view mirror, Belt added to Slusser that he&#8217;s &#8220;not sure there is anything else that can be done.&#8221; Belt has had his knee drained three times already this season, per Slusser.\nIt&#8217;s been a tough season for Belt, who&#8217;s hitting .213/.326/.350 on the year with just 18 extra-base hits (eight homers, nine doubles, one triple). From 2020-21, Belt was one of the best hitters in all of baseball, logging a combined .285/.393/.595 batting line with 38 home runs in 560 plate appearances. Among qualified hitters in that time, Belt&#8217;s .302/.404/.638 slash and 175 wRC+ against right-handed pitching trailed only Bryce Harper and Juan Soto for tops in Major League Baseball.\nThis year has been another story entirely, as Belt has been prone to prolonged slumps while navigating the ongoing troubles with his knee. He&#8217;s hitting just .150/.269/.200 over his past 25 games and has just two hits and five walks in his past 45 trips to the plate. He&#8217;s maintained a keen eye and knowledge of the strike zone, evidenced by this season&#8217;s 12.4% walk rate, but Belt has also seen his average exit velocity, hard-hit rate and barrel rate all decline noticeably from that 2020-21 peak. A timetable for Belt&#8217;s return hasn&#8217;t been provided, but given the recent struggles, there&#8217;s a clear need to get him some rest and hope that&#8217;ll alleviate some of the discomfort that has contributed heavily this swoon.\nJohnson, 26, made his big league debut earlier this season but was held hitless in a tiny sample of four plate appearances spread across four games. He&#8217;s hitting .287/.358/.398 in 287 Triple-A plate appearances &#8212; a similar but slightly diminished follow-up to last year&#8217;s .286/.377/.433 slash in 407 plate appearances at this same level.\nA 2017 sixth-rounder, Johnson has never ranked among the system&#8217;s very best prospects, but he&#8217;s provided average or better offense at just about every minor league spot while serving as a prolific base thief. The speed that makes him a threat on the bases also led to plus scouting grades on his glove in center dating back to his college days. He&#8217;ll give the Giants a switch-hitting option who can plug in at any of the three outfield spots for the time being.",

        "description": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — If Florida’s Senate race was only about money, Democratic Rep. Val Demings would be way ahead of Sen. Marco Rubio.\nThe 65-year-old former Orlando police chief, a rising star who President Joe Biden considered for his running mate, has raised significantly more money in the race — $48 million to Rubio’s $36 million. Demings has also gained momentum by tapping into the anger surrounding the reversal of Roe v. Wade and can even tout the recent legislative wins by Democrats in Congress.\nBut the race is about much more than money. Republicans say Rubio, 51, is a seasoned politician with a strong campaign operation and knows how to succeed in Florida politics, including winning two statewide races for Senate by wide margins. Most public polls have Rubio ahead, and some Republicans say any boost Democrats got from Roe is canceled out by how energized their voters are after the FBI searched former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago resort in West Palm Beach.\nRubio backers also see Demings’ fundraising lead as temporary, the result of the huge amount she is spending early on digital fundraising firms, which will bring in waves of small dollar contributions but at a very high cost.\n“It’s not that surprising she has raised so much so quickly. She has a lot of qualities attractive to the national Democratic base and raises a ton of money on the internet. That's an expensive way to raise money,” said Republican lobbyist Brian Ballard, who is helping Rubio’s campaign. “Eventually, though, that will stop. They have eaten all their seed corn.”\n“Democrats will lean into this race and think they have a real shot rolling into September,” he added. “Marco will win by 5 to 7 points.”\n \n\nThe election is among a handful likely to decide the fate of the Senate, yet there’s growing significance in the Rubio-Demings contest since some GOP candidates endorsed by Trump are faring poorly, including Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, Herschel Walker in Georgia and Blake Masters in Arizona. Trump has endorsed Rubio, but the two have a difficult relationship stemming in part from their 2016 presidential rivalry when the two openly attacked each other.\nFlorida’s Senate race, however, will likely be affected by local and national issues, including abortion, record-high inflation under Biden and each candidates’ record in Congress. Rubio is seen as a tough-to-beat incumbent who will share the ticket with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis — a big favorite in his race and one of the most popular Republican politicians in the country.\nBoth campaigns did not provide comments for this story.\nDemings' fundraising has gotten much of the early attention in the race, which so far has been less high profile than the gubernatorial race because neither candidate had a viable challenger in Tuesday’s primaries. Though Demings has raised nearly $48 million, she’s spent almost $40 million, including $10 million on “digital advertising” — huge numbers for a race not yet in the general election. Rubio has spent $21 million of his $36 million.\nDemocrats shrug off any suggestion that Demings’ big early haul is anything other than a sign of momentum. Demings has been able to use $12 million for TV ads compared to $6.7 million from Rubio’s campaign and the National Republican Senatorial Committee. Demings' early statewide TV ads for months have highlighted her law enforcement background and amplified her criticism of Rubio over his above-average number of missed Senate votes. Rubio’s campaign on Thursday made a $1.3 million ad buy, an amount Demings' campaign has been spending weekly since mid-June.\n“Val is an inspiring and extraordinary candidate and is getting small dollar donations from across the state and nation,” said Rep. Darren Soto, an Orlando Democrat. “How often do you see a Democrat outraise an incumbent Republican in Florida? It’s quite something.”\nRubio early in the race tried to tether Demings to anti-law enforcement messaging that has been effective for Republicans in the past, even though Demings has three-decades of law enforcement experience. Many former police officers in the state supported Demings in 2020 when Biden was considering her to be his vice president.\nRubio and his allies, however, have also chided her for supporting Speaker Nancy Pelosi, which they claim is a sign she doesn‘t support law enforcement. That National Republican Senatorial Committee has spent nearly $3 million on ads blasting Demings, the first of which featured Florida sheriffs calling her a “rubber stamp” for Democratic leadership.\nRepublicans have specifically targeted Demings for supporting the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, 2021 legislation that aimed to ban the use of chokeholds, limit qualified immunity for police officers and give the Justice Department power to investigate local police departments. The Democratically-led House approved the measure on a party-line vote, but the bill was blocked in the Senate by GOP opposition.\n“I respect her service when she was a police chief, but when she was a policy maker she followed their lead,” Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.) said. “You just can’t change history.”\nSoto, who serves in Congress with Demings and also represents Orlando, where she was once a police chief, said locals respect her law enforcement record and the GOP’s attempts to tie her to anti-law enforcement campaigns like “defund the police” are misguided.\n“She did a great job here,” Soto said. “That’s backed by her continued popularity. ‘Defund the police’ is always what Republicans turn to, but it will hurt them with her. She has a great background and superior finances to get her message out.”\n\nIn her first TV ad in June, Demings directly addressed the attacks, saying, “In the Senate I’ll protect Florida from bad ideas, like de-funding the police.”\nIn a plus for Demings, Democrats have also received a series of positive developments, including falling gas prices and the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act. Democrats have heralded the measure as a historic victory that will address climate change, lower prescription drug prices by allowing the federal government to negotiate prices for Medicare recipients and slow inflation. The Congressional Budget Office, however, has raised questions about the bill’s ability to slow inflation that has long dogged the Biden administration.\n“Obviously, when you look at all the fires, floods and storm threats, it threatens our entire way of life, yet our senators, including Rubio, could not lift a finger to support the boldest climate change bill ever?” Rep. Lois Frankel (D-Fla.) said. “That was just kind of amazing to me.”\nDemocrats have been lauding the bill’s nearly $370 billion in climate change funding, and goals of 40 percent emission reductions by 2030.\n“It seems the national environment for Democratic is getting better, which should lead to the Rubio and Demings race tightening,” said Justin Day, a veteran Democratic fundraiser. “Val is doing the blocking and tackling that she needs to do in order to be successful.”\nRepublicans, however, claim the bill will drag down Democrats during this election cycle, in part, because it spends $80 billion over the next decade to beef up the IRS. That includes hiring thousands of new agents and increasing the number of audits Democrats say are focused on the rich but the GOP claims will affect middle-and-lower income taxpayers.\n“It is not going to be helpful to them,” Donalds said. “It raises taxes on small business owners in a recession. It’s crazy they voted for that. We are in the middle of massive inflation. It’s not going to help Democratic Senate candidates.”\nWhile Republicans acknowledge control of the Senate might be slipping away from them, they are confident Rubio will beat Demings, in no small part because of the popular Florida Republican governor.\n“Demings is a paper tiger. With DeSantis up solidly in the polls and big voter registration gains favoring Republicans in Florida, there’s no universe that exists where Sen. Rubio does not come out on top,” said state Rep. Blaise Ingoglia, one of Rubio’s top allies in the Florida Legislature. “This rhetoric that she has a shot is more wishful thinking from Democrats than anything else.”\nBallard went further, saying Rubio is so safe, he hopes Democrats spend millions of dollars in Florida because it will take cash away from other key Senate races, and he hopes the NRSC doesn’t drain its financial resources in Florida.\n“Without Marco winning, we can’t win back the majority,” he said. “But I hope the national guys don’t put too many resources in this race, Florida will be fine. We should be able to handle our business.”",

        "description": "New research suggests a specific form of dementia could be affecting September 11th responders who also have post-traumatic stress disorder.\nThe researchers found that World Trade Center responders with cognitive impairment (CI) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have a different presentation of the white matter in their brains compared to responders with CI without PTSD.\nCognitive impairment is a possible sign of dementia.\nThe researchers assessed the brains of 99 World Trade Center (WTC) responders using diffusion tractography, a 3D imaging technique.\nAccording to the authors of the study in the Journal of Alzheimer&#8217;s Disease, this is the first study to examine white matter alterations using connectometry in a sample of WTC responders in mid-life (average age: 56) with and without concurrent PTSD.\nThe goal of the study was to examine and elucidate the extent to which white matter tract integrity might be impaired in WTC responders with cognitive impairment (CI) and/or PTSD. Previously, the researchers had identified changes in white matter diffusivity in small numbers of responder patients.\n&#8220;Our findings are by no means conclusive in terms of defining CI or dementia in WTC responders, and if this study provides evidence of a new form of dementia emerging,&#8221; says lead author Sean Clouston, an associate professor in the program in public health, and in the family, population, and preventive medicine department at Stony Brook University.\n&#8220;Overall, the study supports the view that responders with CI have neurological changes consistent with neurodegenerative disease, but they are inconclusive as to the type of disease,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;Our findings do show that dementia due to PTSD is clearly different from non-PTSD dementia in this responder population.&#8221;\nThe researchers matched the subjects in the study by age, gender, occupation, race, and education. Cognitive status was determined by using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment, and PTSD status was determined by using the Diagnostics and Statistics Manual-IV. The researchers used diffusion tensor imaging via a mMR scanner, and they used connectometry to examine whole-brain tract level differences in white matter integrity as reflected by fractional anistrophy (FA) values.\nIn summary, the team found that FA was negatively correlated with CI and PTSD status in the fornix, cingulum, forceps minor of the corpus callosum, and the right uncinate fasciculus. Additionally, FA was negatively correlated with PTSD status, regardless of the CI status in the superior thalamic radiation and the cerebellum.\nThe authors conclude that the brain imaging results &#8220;suggest that WTC responders with early-onset CI may be experiencing an early neurodegenerative process characterized by decreased FA in white matter tracts.&#8221;\nClouston and colleagues used the imaging technique diffusion tractography to examine how healthy axons are in the brain&#8217;s white matter. The technique helped to determine that responders with CI had signatures in their white matter that did not match patterns seen in old-age Alzheimer&#8217;s disease and other related dementias.\nBy using the imaging technique, they also compared responders with PTSD and dementia to those with dementia but without PTSD. The imaging revealed a lot of similarities between the groups but also showed a remarkable difference in the white matter of those with PTSD and dementia—showing evidence of cerebellar atrophy, a finding that is inconsistent with other studies of dementia.\nThe National Institutes of Health&#8217;s National Institute on Aging, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health funded the work.\nSource: Stony Brook University\nThe post Do some 9/11 responders have a new kind of dementia? appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Apple)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple has officially confirmed the date and time for this year's iPhone-centric product launch event: September 7 at 10 am PDT (1 pm EST).\nThis is the same date that was leaked in a Bloomberg report last week, though members of the media are being invited to the Steve Jobs Theater on Apple's campus to cover the event and go hands-on with devices in person (the report suggested it would be entirely livestreamed, as many of Apple's pandemic-era product reveals have been). Apple's invitation was characteristically cryptic, but it's safe to assume that the company plans to announce an updated iPhone lineup and a release date for iOS 16.\nThe Bloomberg report said that Apple would be discontinuing the \"mini\" iPhone size for the iPhone 14 lineup, and it would be launching a less-expensive 6.7-inch iPhone 14 Max for people who want a large screen but don't want to step all the way up to the Pro iPhones. It sounds like the best new features are being reserved for the higher-end phones, including a notchless display with smaller cutouts for the front-facing camera and sensors, an all-new processor, and a new main camera with a 48-megapixel sensor.Read 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Instead, Lopez's complaint says that Pandora considered the comedian a \"cash cow\"—alleging that Lopez is yet another comedian whose copyrighted materials have been illegally streamed to Pandora listeners without the streaming service securing proper licensing or sharing royalties.\n\"Pandora found a cash cow in a new revenue stream, and in a brazen business decision determined that the risk was worth the gain—that is until now,\" Lopez's lawyer, Richard S. Busch of the Los Angeles law firm King &amp; Ballow, wrote in the complaint.\nBusch was already representing other comedians suing Pandora, including Lewis Black, Ron White, and the estates of late comedians George Carlin and Robin Williams. According to The Wrap's exclusive report, all the lawsuits have been consolidated and will be heard in the California Central District Court before the end of August.Read 13 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: David Urbanke)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCanalys' North American smartphone market share numbers are out, and the big mover for Q2 2022 is once again Google, which is seeing huge growth numbers thanks to the Pixel 6. Last quarter, Canalys had Google up 380 percent year over year, and this quarter, the company is up 230 percent.\nThat sounds incredibly successful, but this is Google's tiny hardware division we're talking about, so it's all relative success. The company is now at 2 percent North American market share, having shipped 800,000 devices for Q2 2022. Along with last quarter, Google is now regularly hitting whole-digit market share numbers. That's good enough for fifth place, behind Apple (52 percent), Samsung (26 percent), Lenovo/Motorola (9 percent), and TCL (5 percent).\nCanalys also has a list of the best-selling models. The top five are all iPhones, of course, with the base model iPhone 13 taking the top spot, followed by the super-cheap iPhone SE. The iPhone 13 Mini, which is rumored to be selling so poorly that there won't be an iPhone 14 Mini, took the ninth spot. The first Android phone on the list, the flagship Galaxy S22 Ultra, clocks in at No. 6.Read 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: Samsung)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSamsung's 990 PRO, its latest NVMe PCIe 4.0 SSD, aims to give gamers, 3D-renderers, and 4K/8K video editors a decent ratio of price to performance if this top-of-the-line drive can get close to its promised specs in real-world testing.\nThe 990 PRO is touted as offering \"nearly the highest speed currently available from the new PCIe 4.0 interface\" and a 55 percent increase in random performance over its 980 Pro. Samsung touts sequential read and write speeds of 7,450 megabytes per second (MB/s) and 6,900MB/s, respectively. Random read/write speeds are listed at 1,400K and 1,550K IOPS, respectively, based on IOmeter 1.1.0 performance. DRAM for the 990 PRO drives is 1GB per terabyte of storage, up to 4GB for the 4TB model.\nSamsung suggests the performance bump comes from its own V-NAND and proprietary controller advancements. Power efficiency is improved up to 50 percent over the 980 PRO, the company claims, while a nickel coating and heat-spreading label dissipate heat. The heatsink model gives you more temperature assurance while, of course, adding RGB lights.Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Cheddar News took the streets to talk about how millions of pigeons specifically flock to New York City due to the very many places to perch.  These birds, or so-called &#8220;rats with wings&#8221;, are offensive to some but beloved by others. \n\n\n\nPigeons and New Yorkers: it&#8217;s a relationship that dates back centuries, and, like most New York City relationships…it&#8217;s complicated. Some hate them while others can&#8217;t get enough of them. But who’s right?\n\n\n\nAs it turns out, the typical New York City pigeon is a rock dove brought over by French ships in the 17th Century. The birds were known as faithful navigators who could reliably deliver messages and did so for centuries. But on their own, pigeons prefer to view the world from above. This is why they are more prevalent in urban centers.\n\n\n\nWhy has the pigeon taken to New York and other cities around the world so easily while other animals tend to flee? The answer is the city itself. Tall buildings, ledges, statues, and bodeg overhangs. Pigeons more than a lot of other urban animals because they naturally are cliff dwellers, so they prefer rocks and ledges and concrete to trees. So even if there are trees, they prefer to walk around on the sidewalk.\n\n\n\nThey also spoke with local pigeon experts like Tina Piña Trachtenberg, Michael Scott of Pigeons on Broadway, and workers with Standard Pest Management to learn more about these winged city residents.",

The so-called “Oscars of comedy” have been in cold storage since 2019, but are revived with a 10-strong shortlist which also features, in a rare departure from convention, a show that’s already been a smash hit elsewhere in the UK – Liz Kingsman’s extraordinary spoof on Fleabag-style “messy woman” cliches, One-Woman Show.Nominations have also been announced for the best newcomer award, a list which includes 23-year-old Leo Reich (whose electrifying set Literally Who Cares?! would have justified a place on the main list), the Irish-Italian act Vittorio Angelone and New Jersey’s Emily Wilson, with a winning show about her appearance, aged 15, on The X Factor. At least until the winners are announced on Saturday, this year’s happiest comic will surely be Hull native Amy Gledhill, who unusually features on both shortlists – with her solo show on the newcomer roster, and as one-half of the sketch duo The Delightful Sausage, who are nominated, for the second time, for the main award.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/3614071-as-monkeypox-spreads-we-must-not-repeat-the-failures-of-covid-19-and-hiv/",
        "description": "Monkeypox is a public health emergency in the United States, with some 15,400 cases recorded. The virus has rapidly become a globalized threat, with more than 43,000 cases reported across 95 countries. The World Health Organization (WHO) declared the outbreak “a public health emergency of international concern,” its highest alert level. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut as the alarm and case counts grow, it is increasingly clear that the U.S. and the global communities are repeating some of the hallmark failures of other global health crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the HIV/AIDS epidemic. From mounting stigma and misinformation, to botched testing and vaccine rollouts, to the widening inequities in care, the parallels between Monkeypox, COVID-19 and HIV/AIDS should cause officials to reevaluate and redirect their approach to this latest public health emergency.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor example, many news reports refer to monkeypox as a sexually transmitted disease that only impacts the gay community. Both parts of this statement are false, yet the misinformation continues to reverberate in a disturbing echo of the discrimination against LGBTQ+ communities during the HIV/AIDS epidemic. Monkeypox is spread through close contact including, but not limited to, sexual contact — and anyone can contract the infection regardless of sexual orientation. Cases have also been reported by women, infants and incarcerated people. However, evidence of discrimination is emerging. For example, some commercial lab technicians have reportedly refused to draw blood from people who might have monkeypox.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCurrently, in most states the monkeypox vaccine is allotted to “high-risk populations.” For example, New York City's criteria includes men who have sex with men and who have had \"multiple or anonymous sex partners.\" Ongoing stigmatization of one's personal and intimate sex life could deter people from seeking testing or care for monkeypox. The approximate 21 days of isolation after infection is difficult and demoralizing for anyone, but particularly for those who cannot share or discuss their diagnosis. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nCurrently, 98 percent of monkeypox cases are being reported in men who have sex with men. There is a clear imperative for health officials to develop monkeypox messaging and outreach not just for the LGBTQ+ community, but with the LGBTQ+ community. The early failings of COVID-19 vaccination practices are also appearing. Online portals to schedule monkeypox vaccinations have crashed. We are leaving behind the 21 million people in the United States who lack access to the internet. Offline and multilingual options to secure tests, vaccines and care are essential for any public health outreach.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe must also be vigilant and monitor inequities in access to vaccines, particularly around which communities receive them and whether there is a pattern to who receives the ACAM2000, a vaccine that is more available than JYNNEOS but is effective and has more side effects.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe infrastructure of the public health response to monkeypox is inadequate. Monkeypox testing has been highly inconsistent and subject to huge regional variations, with delayed results and numerous bureaucratic hurdles for clinicians and patients. This is devastatingly similar to the early response to COVID-19 in the United States, in which our early testing failures led to hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, decades of disinvestment in primary care and public health have resulted in missed opportunities for reaching more at-risk individuals and creating pathways to care that are not specifically linked to particular groups.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLastly, one of the most appalling aspects of both HIV/AIDS and COVID-19 has been the global disparities in access to testing, vaccines and care. Monkeypox has spread in East and West Africa for several decades. When the infection started to reach white Europeans and Americans in larger numbers, global attention and mobilization of resources were suddenly given to the issue. News outlets and commentators must not contribute to stigma and xenophobia by painting monkeypox as an \"African\" disease. Even the name “monkeypox” is highly misleading and problematic. Monkeypox does not come from monkeys; the reservoir for it is in rodents. The WHO is rightfully working to rename the disease. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nCOVID-19 vaccines and HIV/AIDS treatment went to high-income, largely white countries and communities first. Wealthy nations hoarded COVID-19 supplies and blocked the technology transfer that would have allowed low- and middle-income countries to produce their own tests, vaccines and treatments. Not providing access to these life-saving resources in low-income countries was largely an oversight, and today only one in five people in low-income countries have received COVID-19 vaccines, as opposed to three out of four people in high-income countries. Similarly, people living with HIV in London or New York had access to high-quality, affordable and life-saving HIV/AIDS medications decades earlier than their counterparts in Kampala or Mumbai. This resulted in tens of millions of deaths and a “lost generation” in many hardest-hit countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe cannot accept the status quo any longer. As high-income countries ramp up vaccine and treatment production, we must ensure that there is global equity and ethical responses. We are now repeating the mistakes of the past, but we have time to change course. Our response to the monkeypox outbreak will be successful and equitable if we heed the lessons from HIV/AIDS and COVID-19. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nDr.&nbsp;Ranit&nbsp;Mishori&nbsp;is a senior medical adviser at Physicians for Human Rights and a professor of family medicine at the Georgetown University School of Medicine.",

        "description": "It’s official: the next Apple event will take place on 7 September 2022 at 10 AM PT. As always, you’ll be able to stream it from Apple’s website or on your Apple TV, and Apple makes it easy to add it to your calendar.\n\nTraditionally, Apple announces new iPhones in September. This year’s rumor mill has focused on the Pro line and the possible addition of a plus-sized regular iPhone model with Pro features. Rumors are swirling about an iPhone 14 Pro that will replace the notch with a pinhole for the front-facing camera, feature an always-on display like recent Apple Watch models, and boast a 48-megapixel rear camera with a larger sensor. Talk surrounding the iPhone 14 suggests that it will be a modest update using the same processor as the iPhone 13. As always, take such predictions with a grain of salt.\nWe also expect Apple will unveil the Apple Watch Series 8, possibly with a temperature sensor that could enable fever detection and fertility tracking. Also expected are a refreshed Apple Watch SE and a ruggedized Apple Watch Pro with a larger screen. Apple may also show the second generation of AirPods Pro with a new industrial design and a case that can play sounds to make it easier to locate with Find My.\nFinally, Apple will almost certainly also announce launch dates for iOS 16 and watchOS 9. I am in the process of putting the finishing touches on the upcoming Take Control of iOS 16 and iPadOS 16, which I’ve been working on all summer.\nHowever, don’t expect iPadOS 16 at the same time. Apple has confirmed that it will delay iPadOS 16’s release until after the release of iOS 16, with the initial iPadOS 16.1 perhaps joining macOS 13 Ventura in October. Apple is reportedly still ironing out wrinkles in the Stage Manager feature (see “First Impressions: Stage Manager on the iPad and Mac,” 18 July 2022).",

Canadian police announced his arrest in November 2021 after he tried to buy a rare gaming username, also writing that they had seized around $5 million of the stolen funds.Now, crypto investigator zachxbt thinks the same individual is indirectly responsible for a slew of compromised Twitter accounts that have then been used to promote crypto scams, including those of Beeple, DeeKay, and others. According to zachxbt, he has been selling access to a Twitter admin panel, which allows employee-level access to Twitter tools. This might explain how many of the accounts were compromised despite being protected by multi-factor authentication. According to zachxbt, \"It’s still unclear as to how Redman gained access to the panel to make elevated requests & reset passwords. As of now it appears the method stopped working\".\n        \n            \n              \n                Tweet thread by zachxbt",

        "description": "The IRS will refund $1.2 billion in penalties to 1.6 million individual and business taxpayers who were fined for not filing tax or information returns on time for 2019 and 2020, as the pandemic disrupted the economy and led to a pileup of unprocessed returns at the agency.\nThe penalty relief — detailed in an IRS notice — is automatic, so taxpayers won’t have to apply for it, and many of the payments will be completed by the end of September, the agency said Wednesday. For those who haven’t paid fines yet, the penalties will be abated.\nStill, to qualify, taxpayers must file by Sept. 30 any returns that are still outstanding for the 2019 and 2020 tax years. There are various other deadlines for information returns that businesses must file.\nRefunds won’t be available to taxpayers who have already accepted a compromise offer or closing agreement with the IRS, where penalties were determined by a court or for fraudulent returns. Fines for failing to pay taxes won’t be automatically refunded either.\nThe relief will cover individuals; banks, employers and individuals required to file information returns; and filers of various international information returns.\n“Besides providing relief to both individuals and businesses impacted by the pandemic, this step is designed to allow the IRS to focus its resources on processing backlogged tax returns and taxpayer correspondence to help return to normal operations for the 2023 filing season,” the agency said in a statement.\nSome background: The IRS has been under pressure by members of Congress from both parties to provide more Covid-related relief to taxpayers. It's also being pressed to clear a backlog of returns and other paperwork that piled up while agency offices were temporarily closed due to the pandemic and most of its employees were working remotely.\n“Penalty relief is a complex issue for the IRS to administer,” IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig said in a statement. “We’ve been working on this initiative for months following concerns we’ve heard from taxpayers, the tax community and others, including Congress. This is another major step to help taxpayers, and we encourage those affected by this to review the guidelines.”",

        "description": "Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) criticized President Biden’s decision to cancel $10,000 of student loan debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 annually, calling it a “wildly unfair redistribution” of wealth in favor of higher-earning Americans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMcConnell said in a statement on Twitter on Wednesday that the move is a “slap in the face” to those in the workforce who made sacrifices to pay off their debt, as well as those who made different career choices to avoid student debt.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said the median American with student loans has a much higher income than the median American overall, and experts who have studied loan forgiveness have found that its benefit mostly goes to higher-earning individuals.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"President Biden's inflation is crushing working families, and his answer is to give away even more government money to elites with higher salaries,\" the GOP leader said. \"Democrats are literally using working Americans' money to try to buy themselves some enthusiasm from their political base.\"\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tBiden cancels up to $10K in student debt for many borrowers, extends payment pause\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tHere’s what’s inside Biden’s historic student debt forgiveness plan\t\n\n\n\n\nThe Brookings Institution reported in October 2020 that the 40 percent of households with the highest incomes, more than $74,000 per year, owe almost 60 percent of outstanding student loan debt. The 40 percent of households with the lowest incomes hold just less than 20 percent of that debt.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s plan will forgive up to $20,000 to Pell Grant recipients, those with the greatest financial need, and limit repayment of undergraduate loans to 5 percent of a borrower’s monthly income. The president also extended the pause on federal student loan repayment until Dec. 31, pushing back a deadline that was set to pass at the end of this month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSenior administration officials have said the president’s action will largely help people who came from working class families and make up the working class now.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMcConnell also said Biden’s decision will make inflation worse just weeks after congressional Democrats approved the Inflation Reduction Act, which Biden signed into law last week. \n\n\n\nMcConnell and other Republicans have been joined by former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers in arguing that student debt forgiveness will make inflation worse.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rise of social media has led to a new type of celebrity — the social media influencer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs the most popular influencers can make up to $1 million per sponsored Instagram post, pursuing the job as a career is enticing to younger, tech-savvy generations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurvey results show more men than women feel becoming an influencer is their only viable career path.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWith the rising popularity of social media came the fame and fortune of young social media influencers such as Addison Rae, Charli D’Amelio and James Charles. \n\n\n\nNow, new survey results from HigherVisibilty show one in four members of Gen Z want to emulate these celebrities, who make millions of dollars through brand sponsorships and advertisements but are also subject to intense public scrutiny on- and off-line. Sixteen percent of those surveyed said they would pay money to become an influencer.\n\n\n\nA total of 1,000 individuals in the United States between the ages 16 and 25 completed the survey in July 2022.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResults varied slightly by region. Just over 40 percent of respondents in the west said they want to become a social media influencer, compared with 33 percent in the midwest, 36 percent in the south and 39 percent in the northeast.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBroken down further, data showed “41% of New York Gen Zs intend on becoming an influencer in the future, whilst 30% from [Los Angeles] also feel the same way.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to authors, “just 7.13% of Gen Z responded that they would not want to be a social media Influencer.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSocial media influencers can find audiences on a variety of platforms like Instagram, TikTok and YouTube. The rise of the industry was so strong that in 2020 creators launched the American Influencer Council.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome super famous celebrities can even make up to $1 million for posting a single sponsored image or video on Instagram.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen queried, the majority of respondents guessed the average yearly income of an influencer was between $75,001 – $100,000, and many pointed to free products, earnings and meeting other influencers as the top perks of the profession.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver a quarter of individuals also said they regularly post on social media with the intent to gain followers, while 35 percent of men report caring about their follower account compared with 31 percent of women.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNotably, the survey revealed more men, at 20 percent, than women, 13 percent, feel being an influencer is the only career option for them, and 49 percent of males said they consider the path a “good career choice.” Almost one in five Gen Z members said they would quit their job to become a social media influencer compared with over 12 percent who said they’d quit college to do so. \n\n\n\nA quarter of respondents also think there should be social media influencer training in high school.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to parents’ responses, more 20 percent of individuals felt older generations didn’t understand social media influencing and only 8 percent reported their parents like them using social media. \n\n\n\nSurvey results showed 26 percent of respondents said they trust influencer product reviews over product page reviews, underscoring the marketing power influencers hold.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It is safe to say that over the years, the line between ‘influencer’ and ‘celebrity’ has blurred. With influencer culture permeating the younger generations and becoming more prominent as time goes on, it is a movement unlikely to falter any time soon,” authors concluded.&nbsp;",

Ron DeSantis (R), who also won his primary Tuesday evening, signed the bill into law later that month, accusing public school teachers during a press conference of pushing their “woke gender ideology” on Florida students and peddling “clearly inappropriate” learning materials.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSince March, copycat legislation has cropped up in Georgia, Ohio, Louisiana and elsewhere. A similar measure in Alabama, introduced in an amendment to another bill barring transgender students from using restrooms or locker rooms consistent with their gender identity, was signed into law in April.\n\n\n\nProponents of such measures have argued that they are necessary to protect the rights of parents, while LGBTQ+ advocates and individuals have said they send a dangerous message to LGBTQ+ children that they do not belong.\n\n\n\n“We need to be proactively electing folks that create diversity so we have laws that protect all of us,” said Adam Gentle, a Florida Democrat who will face off against Rep. Jim Mooney Jr. (R) in November.\n\n\n\nGentle, an openly gay man who received nearly 56 percent of the vote in his primary election on Tuesday, said he fears Florida – and the country – is progressing backwards, crusading against things like LGBTQ+ affirmative supports at school and transgender health care.\n\n\n\n“We were creating places for people to be their authentic selves, we were allowing kids to bring their full selves to school,” Gentle said. “I think what's most frustrating about what we see happening today is that feeling of going backwards when so much progress has been made.”\n\n\n\nFive other openly LGBTQ+ candidates in Florida will advance to November’s general election: Reps. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D) and Michele Rayner (D), Sen. Shevrin Jones (D) and Eunic Ortiz and Janelle Perez, both of whom are running for state Senate seats.\n\n\n\n“Enough about us waiting for allies to go out there and fight for us,” Perez told Changing America on Wednesday. “Now, we're going to take this into our own hands, and we're going to fight for ourselves and for our community.”\n\n\n\nPerez, who if elected would become the state legislature’s first openly gay parent, said measures like the “Don’t Say Gay” law that claim to protect parental rights do not have her, her wife’s or her children’s best interests in mind.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Florida voters also ousted Rep. James Bush III, the only House Democrat that voted to pass the “Don’t Say Gay” bill in February.\n\n\n\nNadine Smith, the executive director of the group Equality Florida, said Tuesday evening in a statement that Bush’s defeat is a “clear warning” from voters that “politicians will pay a price for their anti-LGBTQ agendas.”\n\n\n\nIn a poll released earlier this month by the LGBTQ+ media advocacy organization GLAAD, more than two-thirds of LGBTQ+ voters in Florida said they were “extremely motivated” to vote this election cycle, including more than half who said they were more motivated to vote this year than they were during the 2020 presidential election. Voters cited discriminatory policies backed by the state’s current elected officials, including the “Don’t Say Gay” law.\n\n\n\nIn March, a statewide Morning Consult and POLITICO poll found that a third of Florida voters are opposed to the legislation. Still, more than half said they would support measures to restrict or ban lessons about sexual orientation and gender identity from kindergarten through third grade classrooms.\n\n\n\nBeyond the legislature, Florida officials this year have pursued policies that if enacted would further restrict the rights of LGBTQ+ people in the state, particularly transgender youth.\n\n\n\nIn July, Florida Education Commissioner Manny Diaz Jr. instructed school leaders across the state to ignore guidance issued by the Biden administration that expands Title IX protections for transgender students.\n\n\n\nDiaz, a Republican and former state Senator who voted to pass the “Don’t Say Gay” bill, in a July 28 memo told school officials that they are not required to give transgender students access to facilities that match their gender identity or allow transgender women and girls to compete on female sports teams.\n\n\n\n“To the extent that you do any of these things, you jeopardize the safety and wellbeing of Florida students and risk violating Florida law,” Diaz wrote.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Florida’s Board of Medicine voted to initiate rule-making on a new standard of care for the state’s transgender youth, building on a recommendation from the state Health Department that gender-affirming medical care including puberty blockers and hormones should not be accessible to minors because young people lack the “cognitive or emotional maturity” to understand the risks associated with treatment.\n\n\n\nThe decision of the board – consisting of doctors appointed by DeSantis – clashes with guidance from major medical associations.Florida’s Agency for Health Care Administration (AHCA) this month eliminated Medicaid coverage for gender-affirming health care, affecting an estimated 9,000 Florida Medicaid recipients who are transgender.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Indian Child Welfare Act sets federal standards to prioritize keeping Native American children with their nuclear or extended family, their tribe or a member of another tribe before being placed in non-Native American foster and adoptive homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe law was enacted by Congress in 1978 after the federal government recognized past government programs resulted in the widespread and unwarranted removal of Native American children from their families over the previous century.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut now four different cases – consolidated under Brackeen v. Haaland – are calling the law’s constitutionality into question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court this fall will hear oral arguments in a series of four consolidated cases challenging the constitutionality of a landmark law that aims to prevent the separation of Native American children from their families and tribes in welfare proceedings.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Indian Child Welfare Act sets federal standards to prioritize keeping Native American children with their nuclear or extended family, their tribe or a member of another tribe before being placed in non-Native American foster and adoptive homes. It essentially establishes the right of a Native American child to live with a Native American family and stay connected to their culture.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe law recognizes that tribes have sovereignty and exclusive jurisdiction over their members who live on tribal land, and establishes a process for transferring custody cases to tribal court in other instances.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe law was enacted by Congress in 1978 after the federal government recognized that state child welfare and private adoption agencies separated large numbers of Native American children from their parents, extended families, and communities over the previous century. Such separations also took place during the federal Indian boarding school era, when hundreds of thousands of Native American children were forcibly removed from their homes and placed in boarding schools to assimilate into American culture.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor example, the stated mission of the first boarding school in the 1890s on the Navajo reservation was “to remove the Navajo child from the influence of his savage parents.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nState and private agencies removed as many as 25 to 35 percent of Native children from their families and placed many in non-Native foster homes before the law was enacted.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut now the constitutionality of the law is being called into question through four different cases consolidated under Brackeen v. Haaland. Plaintiffs include several non-Native couples trying to adopt or foster children from tribal nations, a woman who wants her child of Native descent to be adopted by non-Native people, and the states of Texas, Louisiana and Indiana.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt the center of Brackeen v. Haaland is Chad and Jennifer Brackeen, a Texas couple who fostered a baby eligible for membership in both the Navajo and Cherokee tribes. The Brackeens tried to adopt the boy after his parents voluntarily ended their parental rights, but the state denied their request when the Navajo Nation found a potential home with a Navajo family.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter going to the court, the Brackeens successfully adopted the boy in 2018 when the placement with the Navajo family failed, but now the couple is looking to adopt the boy’s younger half-sister.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAttorneys general in Texas, Indiana and Louisiana joined the case against the federal government. The plaintiffs argue the ICWA is unconstitutional and it violates the Equal Protection Clause by discriminating on the basis of race, and ultimately hurts children as it can prevent them from being placed in a permanent home.\n\n\n\nA federal district court judge in 2018 ruled the ICWA was unconstitutional, which was appealed. The Supreme Court agreed to hear the case after the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled some parts of the ICWA are constitutional while others violate the anti-commandeering policy of the Constitution.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nProponents of the ICWA say the law’s protections are not based on race as tribal status is a political distinction rather than a racial one.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresently, Native families are four times more likely to have their children removed and placed in foster care compared to white families, according to the National Indian Child Welfare Association.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHundreds of recognized tribes, dozens of Native organizations, 23 states and the District of Columbia and 87 members of Congress have filed at least 21 amicus briefs to the Supreme Court in favor of the ICWA.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nArguments in the case are scheduled before the high court Nov. 9.&nbsp;",

        "description": "California is expected on Thursday to approve a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars that would begin in 2035.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state’s Air Resources Board on Thursday will vote on the ban, which would also ratchet up the percentage of vehicles sold in the state that are electric leading up to the 2035 date.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCalifornia’s clean car standards are also often adopted by other states, so the impact of this rule could stretch far beyond its borders.\n\n\n\nGas powered cars are a major source of climate-warming emissions and other air pollutants, and the measure has been touted as an attempt to both tackle climate change and improve public health.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) issued an executive order seeking to phase out the sale of gasoline-powered cars by 2035, but Thursday’s action will actually put that goal in motion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe California plan is more ambitious than federal goals. President Biden said last year that he hoped that half of new vehicle sales would be electric by 2030. That year, California’s regulations would mandate 68 percent of vehicle sales in the state are electric.\n\n\n\nAutomakers in recent months have moved toward increasing electric vehicle sales, with several making pledges to increase the proportion of vehicles they sell that are electric.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, this week, some in the industry criticized California’s forthcoming regulation as difficult for companies to comply with. \n\n\n\nJohn Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation trade group, told The New York Times that the requirement would be “extremely challenging” to meet. ",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3614165-an-all-of-the-above-approach-for-permitting-energy-infrastructure/",
        "description": "Ensuring energy abundance in the coming decades will require an extensive expansion of energy infrastructure, including at least doubling American electric transmission capacity and creating pipeline systems for hydrogen and CO2. Yet transmission infrastructure projects are stuck in a state and local regulatory rut that will block these ambitious (and necessary) goals. In July, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) announced they would introduce permitting reform legislation — with transmission as a priority. Luckily, model legislation for permitting transmission already exists in the form of the proposed 2021 Streamlining Interstate Transmission of Electricity (SITE) Act. Congress should include the SITE Act in a permitting reform bill and use it as a framework for regulatory structures for CO2 and hydrogen pipelines.\n\n\n\nIn 1938, Congress passed the Natural Gas Act (NGA) because it recognized that attempts to build interstate pipelines were undercut by states unwilling or unable to permit them within their borders. Some projects needed a different permitting and siting regime that could take a broader view of regional and national needs. The NGA established a federal siting authority for interstate natural gas pipelines at the Federal Power Administration, which later became the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC). Under this authority, FERC permitted hundreds of thousands of miles of pipelines, including more than 13,000 new miles in the last 25 years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTransmission lines experience the same challenges at the hands of state siting authorities that natural gas faced 80 years ago. In 2009, Virginia regulators refused to&nbsp;review an interstate transmission line project until they had more information from the West Virginia and Maryland state commissions. In 2021, Pennsylvania regulators rejected the Independence Energy Connect lines connecting to Maryland due to insufficient benefits for their constituents, leaving Maryland ratepayers in limbo. And until recently, the Grain Belt Express connecting Kansas to Indiana through Missouri and Illinois found itself in a nine-year state regulatory holding pattern.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe NGA demonstrates that a federal system for siting infrastructure can eliminate these problems. Still, the NGA is not without flaws: namely, the overbuilding of unnecessary infrastructure, indifference to environmental consequences, and disregard for private property rights. Considering these design flaws, the SITE Act creates a federal transmission siting authority modeled on natural gas that incorporates four lessons from NGA.\n\n\n\nFirst, one of the most critical components for establishing effective regulatory structures for electricity transmission lines and pipelines is eliminating multi-agency or state-federal handoffs. These handoffs slow development and stifle investment thanks to increased timelines and procedural uncertainty. To speed infrastructure development and entice private capital, Congress should establish an exclusive, single-agency federal siting authority at FERC for relevant energy infrastructure. It should not rely on interagency coordination or await failure in state siting processes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe second lesson is that ensuring respectful and fair treatment of landowners to avoid unnecessary public opposition and litigation is crucial. When conveying eminent domain authority, Congress must provide a process for landowner engagement that guarantees clear communication, fair treatment, and swift compensation.\n\n\n\nNarrow eligibility criteria are the third key for federal siting. The current federal authority for siting transmission lines requires the Department of Energy to determine what lines are in the “national interest”. Congress should define project characteristics where the federal authority is appropriate instead of leaving this to the discretion of agency staff or political appointees. Limiting eligibility to large multi-state projects (e.g., in transmission, only lines that can carry a large amount of power) will ensure that the federal government focuses only on infrastructure with multi-state benefits while maintaining state control of local projects.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFinally, we must eliminate archaic regulatory processes. Streamlining agency proceedings under the NGA and Federal Power Act will make siting fairer and faster. Landowners – or project developers – appealing a decision should not be delayed by an internal rehearing process nor stymied by conflicting rules on how to intervene. Removing these barriers will ensure that impacted landowners can participate in proceedings while speeding up court resolution of contested issues.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe current political landscape presents a rare opportunity to create a system for transmission lines and pipelines that will most effectively get things built, address climate change, and enable energy abundance. Using the lessons learned from NGA, Congress should seize this critical opportunity to establish a consistent permitting process across transmission, hydrogen, and CO2 infrastructure, using the SITE Act as a model.\n\n\n\nLiza Reed is the research manager for low carbon technology policy at the Niskanen Center.

Zatko also said that privacy should become Twitter’s No. 1 priority “in light of the egregious and ongoing misrepresentations to the FTC, French and Irish regulators,” according to the complaint.\n\n\n\nA CNIL spokesperson said the regulator only learned of the allegations on Tuesday with the Washington Post report. Ireland&#8217;s data watchdog also met with Twitter representatives after the reports on Zatko&#8217;s claims.\n\n\n\nOne of Zatko&#8217;s alleged &#8220;misrepresentations&#8221; was an update to the platform late last year to comply with orders from the CNIL, which Zatko said was &#8220;blocked [from] rolling out&#8221; for a month &#8220;in order to extract maximum profit from French users.&#8221;\n\n\n\nTwitter has denied Zatko&#8217;s allegations.",

        "description": "Last month, Google re-launched the ever-popular Google Wallet, and with it, a new way to manage your loyalty cards, debit, credit and gift cards as well as boarding passes. Yes, Google Pay is still available for P2P payments, offers and more, and although you can also manage your cards there, the new Wallet is a much more user-friendly, consumer-focused effort.\n\n\n\nYesterday, the service became available in six new markets so that safer, simpler, more helpful payments can be experienced by more people for their digital purchases. In addition to the existing locations, Wallet can now be installed and used in Azerbaijan, Iceland, Moldova, Qatar, Serbia, and South Africa!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWallet&#8217;s premise of being an all-in-one digital solution that lets you leave your physical wallet home has been popular in India and other countries for years now, and has become a primary means of payment and card management for one&#8217;s digital and financial footprint. Now that it&#8217;s available in the United States it&#8217;s taken off like wild fire. Having the app available in South Africa, Iceland and other markets further solidifies its success and usefulness.\n\n\n\nWhile Google Pay&#8217;s hopes for becoming your new bank provider didn&#8217;t pan out, Wallet itself is still working with states across the U.S. and with international partners to bring digital driver&#8217;s licenses and IDs to the app before this year ends. \n\n\n\nEven still, storing more important documents in Wallet securely will take time to catch on with users since most people are still very privacy-minded (which is great!) New opportunities to digitize our lives and vital statistics must first become a culturally accepted thing and companies must build trust &#8211; something Google and others have historically done both well and poorly in turn.\n\n\nGoogle Wallet (Free, Google Play) &#x2192;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/acer-chromebook-vero-514-unique-chrome-os/",
        "description": "All Chromebooks run the same OS, are generally on the same version of that OS, and come in a reliable number of form factors at this point.  We have clamshell, convertible, and detachable Chromebooks with all-in-one Chromebases and simple Chromeboxes all in the market to varying degrees.  In a landscape that offers little surprise these days, Chromebooks are at the point where we have lots of solid options, but not a whole lot of ground-breaking innovation.  It&#8217;s a mature stage of the Chromebook game and I&#8217;m loving much of the iteration that is happening in the space, but I still enjoy being surprised by something completely new and fresh.\n\n\n\nEnter the Acer Chromebook Vero 514\n\n\n\nThat&#8217;s where Acer&#8217;s brand new Chromebook Vero 514 came along and did just that: it surprised me.  You can read our initial thoughts about it in our unboxing or just watch the video below, but the more I&#8217;ve messed with this new Chromebook from Acer, the more inspired I am by its design.  \n\n\n\nDoes it break molds with the way it presents computing?  Not really, but it does manage to pull off the Earth-friendly vibe in a style that is completely and totally its own.  Where I thought we&#8217;d be looking at a one-trick pony in the Chromebook Vero 514, I&#8217;ve found that it leans into the recycled nature of its parts while also looking great, feeling great, and having all the performance, specs and extras you could ask for in a clamshell Chromebook in 2022.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the reality we are in today where a laptop is a laptop and differentiation is tough, the Chromebook Vero 514 loudly shows up on the scene and feels almost refreshing.  Everyone I&#8217;ve shown it to so far has remarked how cool it looks and how great it feels in the hand.  The embossed logos and punchy accent colors are attractive and tastefully done, the boxy design is classic and modern, and the key frame, trackpad and screen are solid.  \n\n\n\nAll of that makes for a Chromebook that makes me want to use it constantly.  For as nice as the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 and HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook are, there&#8217;s something so appealing about the presentation Acer has put together in the Vero 514 that makes me want to lean towards using it more than other Chromebooks.  While I have to send back our early hands-on unit, I find myself excited for the retail model that will be on the way in the weeks to come.\n\n\n\nAcer&#8217;s main lineups with ChromeOS on board\n\n\n\nFor all those reasons above, the Chromebook Vero 514 is a standout, but there&#8217;s another reason I say it is an important Chromebook for the ChromeOS ecosystem.  While it doesn&#8217;t bring any new features to the table from a software standpoint, it does something notable for Acer in the Chromebook space.  It brings one of their bigger, more-advertised lines to Chromebooks.\n\n\n\nLike the HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook, the Chromebook Vero 514 takes an existing, Windows-only line of laptops and brings ChromeOS into the fold.  While Vero may not be Acer&#8217;s biggest line of laptops, it&#8217;s been front and center in their conservation and eco-friendly efforts for a few years at this point.  When Acer has an event, you can bet sustainability will be talked about, and that means new Vero laptops are in that discussion.\n\n\n\nFor them to now include ChromeOS in that mix is a pretty big deal and lends a ton of legitimacy to the platform moving forward.   Like we saw with Samsung&#8217;s Galaxy-branded Chromebooks, HP&#8217;s Dragonfly and Dell&#8217;s Inspiron, Acer&#8217;s new Chromebook Vero 514 tells the consumer market as a whole that ChromeOS isn&#8217;t just relegated to random Chromebook designs: it is fit for the bigger named lines, too.\n\n\n\nWhen we first heard about Acer making the Vero 514, I was excited for it but a bit skeptical that consumers would actually buy it.  Arriving at Best Buy for $499 in the coming weeks, I can confidently say I was wrong about that.  The Chromebook Vero 514 is fun, attractive, and really great to use.  The price is fantastic and the feeling of contributing to Acer&#8217;s sustainability efforts by choosing it over other Chromebooks is a perk, too, and one that I think might attract more consumers than I originally thought.  There&#8217;s no doubt that this one will stand out on a Best Buy display, and I have little doubt that when it does, quite a few people will choose to pick it up over a more-standard Chromebook when given the option.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

Have we reached peak Daniel Johns?Get our weekend culture and lifestyle emailThere is a theory that critics fresh out of university like to espouse called “the death of the artist”, which suggests all art should be judged separate from its maker; that all pertinent information can be found within the work, and anything outside of it – say, a recent drink-driving charge and a redemptive three-part documentary series – will only colour the art in a detrimental way.Of course, this isn’t at all how it works. Australia’s quarter-century fascination with the personal struggles of Silverchair frontman Daniel Johns shows the art and the life of this particular artist are deeply linked.

        "description": "Photo by Rich Schultz/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Mets are currently still trying to win their first division title since 2015, but it’s never too early to start thinking ahead! The current MLB season is still going strong, but the league today announced the full schedule for the 2023 campaign. This will be the most unique and balanced schedule to date, as all 30 teams will play each other over the course of the 162-game season. Each team will play their division opponents 52 times (13 each), along with 64 games against non-divisional league opponents, and 46 interleague games.\nAs for the Mets, their schedule begins in Miami against the Marlins on Thursday, March 30. Following a four-game set against the Marlins and three with the Brewers, they arrive at Citi Field for the home opener on Thursday, April 6 against Miami. They will embark on their first west coast swing later in the month, as they will face off with the Athletics, the Dodgers, and the Giants.\nJune, which has so often been a nightmarish month for New York, should be equally grueling next year, as they face a number of teams in this year’s postseason picture, including the Jays, the Braves, the Yankees, the Cardinals, the and Astros. Like this season, the Mets will enjoy two long homestands in August/September—one featuring the Cubs, the Braves, and the Pirates, and one featuring the Angels, the Rangers, and the Mariners.\nThe league will break for the All Star game, which will be in Seattle, on July 11 next season. The regular season will conclude on October 1, with the playoffs likely set to begin a couple of days later for those participating in the Wild Card round.\n\n\n  2023 Schedule   pic.twitter.com/C2wm8DPuQJ— New York Mets (@Mets) August 24, 2022",

        "description": "VIENNA — The U.S. and Iran are closing in on an agreement to restore the 2015 nuclear deal after almost 17 months of negotiations.\nThe United States relayed to the EU on Wednesday its much-awaited response to Iran’s comments on the draft proposal to restore the nuclear deal, a U.S. official familiar with the matter told POLITICO.\nThe spokesperson of the Iranian Foreign Ministry Nasser Kanaani confirmed that it had received the U.S. response via EU senior official Enrique Mora, who acts as a mediator and coordinator of the talks. Iran still refuses to talk directly with the U.S. “Iran has started reviewing the US comments, and after the review Tehran will submit its views to the coordinator,” Kanaani said.\nThe U.S. response is expected to focus on final sticking points related to Iranian demands for economic guarantees and sanctions relief. U.S. officials were tight-lipped about the substance of the response. When asked for details, the official familiar with the matter said the response contained \"a bunch of words and sentences and paragraphs.\"\nA person familiar with the U.S. response said it focused on the issue of economic guarantees. The person declined to give details, but said the response “falls short of Iran’s expectations. So now we have to see if they realize this is as good as it gets or decide to push for more.”\nIn recent days, European officials have expressed increasing optimism they could revive the 2015 nuclear deal, which lifted many U.S. sanctions on Iran in exchange for strict but temporary curbs on its nuclear program. Western officials say that a number of technical questions related to economic guarantees and sanctions remain open but that other main sticking points have been resolved, making an agreement more likely. But they still cautioned that it would require tough political decisions both in Washington and Tehran in order to close a deal.\nOn Wednesday, Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, told the Spanish news agency EFE that time was of the essence: “We have only days left, a few days [to conclude the deal], because after the summer we will enter into a new political dynamic,” he said, speaking on the margins of the Quo Vadis Europa conference in Santander, Spain.\nMeanwhile, Israel Prime Minister Yair Lapid on Wednesday urged the Biden administration to abandon the talks with Iran, saying that the emerging deal failed to “meet the standards set by President Biden himself: preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear state.”\nLapid also warned that the frozen funds Iran would receive as part of a restored deal — worth an estimated $100 billion — would enable the regime in Tehran to fund even more malign activities in the region.\n“This money will fund the Revolutionary Guard,” Lapid said. “It will fund more attacks on American bases in the Middle East. It will be used to strengthen Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad.”\n \n\nDiplomats from Britain, France, Germany, Iran, Russia, China and the United States have spent almost 17 months negotiating a revival of the 2015 nuclear accord in Vienna. The talks have been close to collapse several times.\nBut since the last physical meeting of the parties at the beginning of August in Vienna, some of the most complicated stumbling blocks appear to have been resolved. They were related to whether the U.S. would remove the Islamic Revolutionary Guards from the Foreign Terrorist Organization list, as well as to the fate of an investigation by the International Atomic Energy Agency into traces of nuclear material found at three sites in Iran.\nJohn Kirby, spokesperson for the National Security Council, confirmed on Wednesday that Iran dropped some key demands, allowing the two sides to make some progress.\n\"We are closer now than we were even just a couple of weeks ago because Iran made the decision to make some concessions,\" Kirby said. But he cautioned that \"a lot of gaps remain. We're not there yet.\"\nEconomic guarantees\nIran is still seeking further guarantees that a future U.S. administration would not leave the deal again. The Biden administration has stressed on numerous occasions that it will uphold its obligations but cannot provide a legal guarantee for its successors.\nThe prospect of former U.S. President Donald Trump — or a like-minded Republican — returning to power has overshadowed the talks since they began in Vienna in April 2021. Trump, who called the original deal “horrible” and “one-sided,” left the agreement in 2018.\nIran wants assurances built into the new text to cushion the potentially negative effects on the Iranian economy should the deal collapse again.\nOne such guarantee that is built into the draft text, according to Western officials, would allow foreign companies to continue their operations in Iran for two-and-a-half years without fear of being sanctioned, even if this renewed agreement falls apart.\n\nTehran would also receive what it calls an “inherent guarantee” that enables it to ramp up its uranium enrichment capacity fairly quickly in order to discourage Washington from scuttling the agreement once more. This will be achieved in part by allowing Iran to store some centrifuges and electronic equipment inside the country under the seal of the International Atomic Energy Agency instead of destroying them, a Western official with knowledge of the matter said.\nUnder the 2015 deal, Iran is only allowed to enrich uranium up to 3.67 percent purity, maintain a stockpile of 300 kilograms of uranium, and permitted to use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes.\nIt has exceeded those limits dramatically in response to the U.S. exit from the deal.\nIran currently has a stockpile of some 3,800 kilograms of enriched uranium — some of which has been enriched up to 60 percent, which is close to weapons grade. Iran has also installed thousands of advanced centrifuges in breach of the 2015 deal, including IR-6 machines that spin much faster.\nShould the 2015 deal be restored, Iran will be forced back into compliance with the previous limits — but it will be allowed to mothball the advanced centrifuges, including the electronic infrastructure needed to operate them.\nSanctions lifting\nEven if the U.S. lifts nuclear-related sanctions under a new deal, numerous other American sanctions on Iran would remain, targeting the country over its support for terrorist groups and human rights abuses.\nThose additional sanctions are the result of Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran, which entailed not only reimposing nuclear-related sanctions, but also adding new penalties. That has made the Biden team’s job harder as it has tried to figure out which sanctions to lift and which to leave in place.\nNow, Iran wants to make sure those remaining U.S. sanctions will not deter European and other non-American companies from doing business on its soil.\nOne Trump move that infuriated Tehran was the designation of Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a powerful military branch, as a terrorist group. U.S. President Joe Biden has said he would not remove the IRGC from that terrorist list. On Wednesday, the U.S. struck an IRGC compound of bunkers in Syria, as retaliation for a strike by an IRGC-affiliated militia on a U.S. base.\n \n\nComplicating matters is the IRGC’s vast economic footprint throughout Iran, with major economic projects in key industries.\nThe current draft deal, according to Western officials, will allow European and other non-American companies to do business with entities that have “transactions” with companies owned by Iran’s IRGC.\nWhile some critics of the deal see that language as a weak point, allowing Tehran to use proxies to conduct business, other analysts say it’s not a significant change to how the United States currently approaches such situations.\nBrian O’Toole, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council and sanctions expert, said that the language in the draft deal signifies no change from current rules. He says it is “just a restatement of existing rules in a more prominent place.” Similar statements have appeared in various official JCPOA documents from 2015 and 2016, according to O’Toole.\nIAEA safeguards probe\nEarlier in the discussions, Iran also insisted it wanted the International Atomic Energy Agency to close a probe into the origins of multiple traces of nuclear material found at three previously undeclared sites in Iran as a precondition for its return to the nuclear deal.\nWestern officials suspect that conclusive proof into the origins of the nuclear material could establish that Iran had a clandestine nuclear weapons program that ran until at least 2003. Iran, however, insists its nuclear program has always been solely for peaceful purposes.\nEU officials have offered a proposal that would close the IAEA investigation if Iran can offer the agency credible answers about the uranium traces’ origins before the so-called “reimplementation day” — the day the revived nuclear deal would go into effect. But the proposal would also enable Iran to block reimplementation day, should the probe remain open.\nIran seems to have agreed to this EU proposal since it did not raise the issue again in its reply last week to the final EU text, according to three senior Western diplomats.\nBut it also means that even if an agreement on restoring the nuclear deal is reached in the coming days, there may still be pitfalls ahead for its full implementation.\nLara Seligman contributed reporting from Washington, D.C.",

        "description": "First lady Jill Biden on Wednesday tested positive again for Covid-19, a so-called \"rebound\" case of the virus similar to the one her husband dealt with earlier this summer.\n“After testing negative on Tuesday, just now, the First Lady has tested positive for COVID-19 by antigen testing. This represents a ‘rebound’ positivity,” Kelsey Donohue, the first lady’s deputy communications director, said in a statement Wednesday.\nBiden has had no reemergence of symptoms and will remain in Delaware to self-isolate, Donohue said. The White House Medical Unit has identified and contacted close contacts of the first lady, she said. President Joe Biden, who cleared his own case of Covid earlier this month, tested negative for the virus Wednesday morning. Because he is considered a close contact of the first lady's, the president will wear a mask for the next 10 days when indoors and in close proximity with others, a White House official said.\nJill Biden initially tested positive for Covid&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/16/jill-biden-tests-positive-for-covid-00052133&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d5e5-dd8d-a7f2-d5fd028b0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d5e5-dd8d-a7f2-d5fd028b0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">initially tested positive for Covid on Aug. 16, roughly a week after the president ended isolation for his own rebound case. She experienced mild symptoms and was self-isolating in South Carolina — where she and her family had been vacationing — until Sunday, when she tested negative for the virus and joined the president in Rehoboth Beach, Del. Both the president and first lady are among the subset of Covid patients treated with Paxlovid to suffer rebound infections, a recurrence of the virus that occurs relatively shortly after it first appears cleared.\n“After isolating for five days and receiving negative results from two consecutive Covid-19 tests, the first lady will depart South Carolina later today for Delaware,” Elizabeth Alexander, the first lady’s communications director, said in a statement on Sunday.",

Rather than focusing on simplifying the problem, we developed a cooperative distributed algorithm. This approach essentially breaks a complex problem down into smaller sub-problems, and sends those to different processors to solve separately. This process, called parallelization, improves efficiency significantly.&#8221;\nAt this point, the researchers have only tested their approach in simulations, where the sub-problems are shared among different cores in the same computing system. However, if autonomous vehicles ever use the approach on the road, the vehicles would network with each other and share the computing sub-problems.\nIn proof-of-concept testing, the researchers looked at two things: whether their technique allowed autonomous vehicle software to solve merging problems in real time; and how the new &#8220;cooperative&#8221; approach affected traffic and safety compared to an existing model for navigating autonomous vehicles.\nIn terms of computation time, the researchers found their approach allowed autonomous vehicles to navigate complex freeway lane merging scenarios in real time in moderate and heavy traffic, with spottier performance when traffic volumes got particularly high.\nBut when it came to improving traffic and safety, the new technique did exceptionally well. In some scenarios, particularly when traffic volume was lower, the two approaches performed about the same.\nBut in most instances, the new approach outperformed the previous model by a considerable margin. What&#8217;s more, the new technique had zero incidents where vehicles had to come to a stop or where there were &#8220;near crash conditions.&#8221; The other model&#8217;s results included multiple scenarios where there were literally thousands of stoppages and near crash conditions.\n&#8220;For a proof-of-concept test, we&#8217;re very pleased with how this technique has performed,&#8221; Hajbabaie says. &#8220;There is room for improvement, but we&#8217;re off to a great start. The good news is that we&#8217;re developing these tools and tackling these problems now, so that we&#8217;re in a good position to ensure safe autonomous systems as they are adopted more widely.&#8221;\nSource: NC State\nThe post Technique improves autonomous car navigation in tricky traffic appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Black and Hispanic people make up a disproportionately high number of monkeypox cases, according to a new analysis. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation finds that Black people make up 26 percent of monkeypox cases, compared to 12 percent of the population, while Hispanic people make up 28 percent of cases compared to 19 percent of the population.  \n\n\n\nThe data, from May to July, indicates that racial disparities are an issue with monkeypox, as they have been in the COVID-19 pandemic as well.  \n\n\n\n“Underlying structural inequities place people of color at increased risk for public health threats, as was seen in COVID-19 and as is beginning to be observed amid the MPX outbreak,” the analysis states. “Early and intentional efforts will be key to minimizing and preventing disparities going forward amid the MPX outbreak and for future public health threats.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlmost all of the monkeypox cases so far have been reported among men, at 99 percent, and 94 percent reported recent sexual or intimate contact with other men, the analysis noted. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nTherefore, the analysis also noted that in addition to racial disparities, “addressing challenges that include homophobia, stigma, and discrimination will be key given the disproportionate impacts among men who have sex with other men.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDifficulty accessing vaccination has also been an ongoing concern with monkeypox. While data is limited, four states — Georgia, Colorado, New Jersey and North Carolina — and Washington, D.C., are reporting racial data for monkeypox vaccination, showing disparities there as well, the analysis found. It found that in D.C., for example, Black people have received 22 percent of vaccines but make up 36 percent of cases.  ",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3614201-watchdog-trump-interior-head-misled-investigators-in-casino-case/",
        "description": "Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and his chief of staff misled an internal federal watchdog about the department's decision to punt on a proposed Native American casino in Connecticut, the watchdog said in a report released Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe Interior Department's Office of Inspector General (OIG) wrote in the report that in May 2017, an unnamed political consultant texted a casino lobbyist to inform him he would be dining with Zinke. The consultant confirmed to the OIG that he and Zinke regularly dined together and discussed the casino lobby’s arguments against amendments by two tribes to allow them to construct casinos off-reservation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn interviews with OIG personnel, Zinke — who is now the GOP nominee for a new congressional district in western Montana —&nbsp;reportedly said he had not discussed the matter with the lobbyist, who was also unnamed, saying if he had interacted with the lobbyist it was only in a casual social setting. However, in the report, OIG wrote that “extensive evidence” indicated the lobbyist had specifically used the consultant to convey his concerns to Zinke.\n\n\n\nThe consultant told the OIG that in addition to discussing the casino’s arguments against the tribes at multiple dinners, he also asked Zinke if he could send him a one-page summary of those arguments in August 2017, to which Zinke responded, “Sure.” Later that month, both the lobbyist and the consultant dined at Zinke’s house, which the consultant said was specifically to allow the lobbyist to make his case directly to Zinke.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe OIG referred its finding in 2018 to the Justice Department, which declined to take action.\n\n\n\nIn a response included with the OIG report, Zinke denied any wrongdoing and suggested the report's release was improper ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, as he is a candidate for a House seat. Zinke’s attorneys also called the report’s findings inaccurate, noting that he did not outright reject the proposal and thus “did not adopt the position of any lobbyist for or against the project.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“His testimony was, and remains, that the DOI [Department of the Interior] should not have jurisdiction over off-reservation land,” the response states. “In other words, he did not believe Interior had jurisdiction over the issue and therefore refused to opine.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZinke's campaign blasted the report, calling it \"misleading and inaccurate.\" \n\n\n\n\"Secretary Zinke repeatedly told the Inspector General that he was not subject to any influence in that matter because he lacked jurisdiction to act on the application. That should have ended the inquiry. Instead, on the eve of an election, the IG has released a misleading and inaccurate report that suggested Secretary Zinke lacked candor in his interview with IG agents. That is wrong,\" the campaign said.\n\n\n\nThe report does not identify the tribes or the casino lobbying against them by name. However, the timeline and location align with a proposal by the Mashantucket Pequot and Mohegan tribes, which led to intense lobbying from Nevada lawmakers and the Nevada-based MGM Resorts International, which had also eyed a new casino in Bridgeport, Conn. In September 2017, the department declined to approve or deny the proposed tribal amendments allowing a casino on nontribal lands.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state of Connecticut and the Mashantucket tribe sued in 2017, arguing improper influence by Zinke. In March 2019, two months after Zinke left his position at Interior, the department dropped its opposition to the casino. \n\n\n\nHouse Natural Resources Committee Chairman Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), a frequent adversary of Zinke during his time as Interior Secretary, said in a statement that the report illustrated part of a \"long litany of former Secretary Zinke’s lies and coverups.\"\n\n\n\n“The report labels this as ‘lack of candor’, but the plain language word for it is ‘lying.’  Zinke’s difficult relationship with the truth was most recently noted when he lied during the investigation into using taxpayer resources for personal gain.”\n\n\n\n— Updated at 2:44 p.m.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/changing-america/well-being/medical-advances/3614097-is-vaping-vitamins-a-good-idea/",
        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVaping has gotten a lot of attention for the potential harmful effects to the lungs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-nicotine wellness vaping products are on the rise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch is still unknown about these products and the FDA issued a warning against using them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmong the vaping trends of recent years, some people are starting to inhale wellness products without nicotine that are touted to enhance energy levels and deliver more absorbable vitamins like vitamin B12. Some claims include cancer fighting abilities, remedies for conditions like asthma and ADHD, and even prevention of anemia. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a warning in late 2021 about this category of products, stating that “these claims are unproven, and the products may be ineffective, a waste of money, unsafe.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVaping has received negative attention because of its potential health impacts on young people, especially with companies like JUUL producing various flavors that are especially appealing to youth.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith non-nicotine vaping, many of the concerns are similar. There’s not enough information about how these substances interact with our lung tissues when they are taken in this specific form. \"Just because it's safe to take [vitamins] one way doesn't mean that it's going to be safe with another type of absorption,\" says Jorge Mercado, who is a physician specializing in pulmonary medicine at NYU Langone Hospital to Inc. \"The lung is not your greatest organ to actually absorb medications through.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is still a lot unknown about how various substances are absorbed in the lungs and react with the cells there. Studies of e-cigarettes overall have often focused on the potential harmful effects of flavorings in vape products. These health effects include cytotoxicity, or toxicity to cells, oxidative stress and inflammation. In one study of e-cigarette and flavored vape pens, Vitamin Vape B12 produced the highest amount of reactive oxidative stress. The study also observed inflammation in lung epithelial cells and macrophages, the white blood cells that recognize and destroy microorganisms and dead cells.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe maker of Vitamin Vape B12 also makes another vitamin B12 related vape pen: Breathe B12. FDA issued a warning to Vitamin Vape in Dec. 2021, stating that “the use of your ‘B12 VITAMINVAPE’ product raises safety concerns for the agency because the ingredients or the impurities in oral inhalation products may trigger laryngospasm or bronchospasm, may be toxic to the tissues in the upper or lower airways, or may be absorbed and exert undesirable systemic effects or organ toxicity.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany wellness products like supplements and vitamins are unregulated by the FDA in part because they do not count as either food or drugs. “When you have an unregulated industry, you don't really know what type of absorption you have with certain substances and vitamins,\" says Mercado. Being unregulated also allows companies like Vitamin Vape to enter the market without looking for FDA approval first.\n\n\n\nIn its statement, the FDA lists misleading claims the company makes on its website and also states that in this situation this product counts as a “new drug” to be regulated by the FDA, and thus needs to be approved by the FDA.&nbsp;Vitamin Vape could not be reached for comment.\n\n\n\nBut some of the damage may already be done or may continue to grow. Vitamin Vape continues to sell its products and has 18,000 followers on Instagram. The FDA has issued warning letters to other companies with similar products, including VitaCig, Eagle Energy, NV Nutrition and VitaStik. The companies are asked to correct any violations of the law. If they do not comply, the FDA may take enforcement action to prevent the products from getting into the hands of consumers.&nbsp;",

        "description": "\"My name is Maxwell Alejandro Frost and I will be the first Generation-Z member of Congress.\"\n\n\n\nFrost, 25, published his victory tweet shortly after 10 a.m. Wednesday, his first day as the official Democratic nominee for an Orlando House seat.\n\n\n\n\nMy name is Maxwell Alejandro Frost and I will be the first Generation-Z member of Congress. Don’t count out young people.&mdash; Maxwell Alejandro Frost (@MaxwellFrostFL) August 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\nFour hours earlier, at the crack of dawn, Frost retweeted Florida Politics, a local news outlet that said his win \"stuns [the] establishment.\"\n\n\n\n\"Thinking about what I wanted to tweet out this morning or what I wanted to say, I really wanted to harp and focus on the fact that young people are oftentimes counted out. But I really want folks to know that I am unapologetically young,\" Frost told The Hill.\n\n\n\nWhile Frost did stun the Democratic establishment — coming seemingly out of nowhere to best a wide field packed with senior political figures — Frost's win is notable even amid a diversifying national candidate corps.\n\n\n\nFrost has roots in a broad swath of American life: His parents, who adopted Frost at birth, are a Cuban American woman and a white man from Kansas. His birth parents were a Lebanese Puerto Rican woman and a Haitian man.\n\n\n\nFrost, who is Black, spoke both English and Spanish at home, and he capitalized on his multicultural upbringing to campaign in a district that's as diverse as his own origins.\n\n\n\nStill, Frost stands out for a resume that doesn't match his age.\n\n\n\nHe's been politically active for a decade, mainly campaigning against gun violence and for abortion rights in organizations like March for Our Lives and the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\n\n\n\"Maxwell is a very ambitious and incredibly special person, a special candidate. I think he has a very bright future,\" said Victoria McGroary, the executive director of Bold PAC, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus campaign arm.\n\n\n\n\"He is both extremely young and energetic and has a decade of experience doing the work to bring about change,\" added McGroary.\n\n\n\nFrost's primary campaign was one of two top targets for Bold PAC this cycle, with the group betting big on Frost both with involvement at the strategic level and a $250,000 independent expenditure.\n\n\n\nFrost is all but certain to win in November, as the seat he's competing for — a safe blue seat vacated by retiring Rep. Val Demings (D-Fla.) — was redrawn in a way that packed more Democratic voters together.\n\n\n\nBut Democrats see potential in Frost that extends beyond November.\n\n\n\n\"Maxwell is the future of the Democratic Party,\" said McGroary. \"The work Bold PAC has done with Maxwell's campaign embodies the very mission of Bold PAC.\"\n\n\n\nFrost said he will continue to advocate for the issues he's been active in but will also serve as a sort of ambassador for his generation in Congress.\n\n\n\n\"I'm always asked, 'does Gen Z care about different things than other generations?' I actually push back. I don't think we care about different issues. I don't think we care about different things. I think we all care about the same things. About living our lives, having the resources we need, being valued and cared for. But we just see the issues through a different light,\" said Frost. \n\n\n\n\n        View this post on Instagram            A post shared by The Hill (@thehill)\n\n\n\n\n\"Certain folks might say young people are in debt because they've lived beyond their means. But as a young person, I know that that's not true. I know it's because we've been denied the means to live,\" he added. \n\n\n\n\"When we think about health care, we're thinking about it holistically. When we think about climate change, we're thinking about the fact that every year we wait, the bill gets higher and higher to deal with the problem.\"\n\n\n\nFrost's political passions also stem from personal experience — his gun advocacy kicked off in Halloween of 2016, when Frost and his friends were forced to run away from an active shooter in downtown Orlando.\n\n\n\nHis push for reproductive rights is informed by the experience of his birth mother, who didn't have the means to get medical treatment during her pregnancy.\n\n\n\nBut beyond the big political fights, Frost said he wants to advocate for the arts in Congress.\n\n\n\nBefore he found activism at age 15, Frost credits his father's musical education for his discipline and drive.\n\n\n\n\"My dad is a full time musician. My life changed forever when he gave me a drum set in the second grade. And I became a musician and I always grew up hearing music in the house,\" said Frost.\n\n\n\n\"When I was younger, like any other kid, I just didn't really understand where I wanted to go, what I wanted to do, but music and art really changed that for me, my dad was an influence in helping me hone my energy,\" Frost added.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3608576-well-need-hundreds-of-new-critical-metals-mines-to-decarbonize/",
        "description": "Over the past few years, Nevada has become a battleground between mining companies and environmentalists over the development of the state’s lithium deposits, the largest known in the United States. The proposed mines would produce millions of tons of lithium for batteries that will benefit the climate in the long term by deploying more electric vehicles (EVs), but, according to opponents, would come at the expense of fragile local ecosystems, endangered species and sacred Indigenous lands. \n\n\n\nThis same battleground is being replicated all over the world, as countries gear up to transition cars from gasoline to electricity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLithium is one of the critical metals essential for clean energy technologies, along with cobalt and nickel for EV batteries, rare earth elements for wind turbines, and silicon and gallium for solar panels. According to projections by the International Energy Agency, reaching global net zero emissions by 2050 will require expanding the production of energy-relevant metals from 7 million tons per year to 42 million by 2040 — a whopping sixfold increase. In particular, demand for lithium is expected to grow by as much as 40 times over 2020 levels as EV sales in China and the United States take off in the post-2025 period. \n\n\n\nSurging demand and dizzying price hikes have raised concerns that inadequate metal and mineral supplies may impede the clean energy transition. Given the urgency of reducing fossil fuel use, the science and policy worlds must solve two main challenges: how to ensure the availability and affordability of critical metals in the quantities needed, and how to manage the environmental impacts related to mining and processing them. The latter issue is likely to be much trickier than the former.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCritical minerals are commodities that follow the rules of supply and demand. When demand increases, prices rise, providing incentives to find and produce more of whatever mineral is in short supply. Twenty years ago, predictions of uranium shortages sent prices for raw uranium soaring, which in turn stimulated increased prospecting and discovery of new uranium ore deposits. More recently, impending shortages of rare earth elements have triggered a global stampede to find new supplies — which, given recent finds, seem to be more prevalent than previously thought. In almost every case, the growth rate in reserves has kept up with demand and predictions of scarcity have proved to be overly pessimistic.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdmittedly, time lags and geopolitics may slow, but not derail, the rate of new finds and production. Take the example of lithium — the most critical component for today’s batteries. Fueled by explosive growth in the EV market, the price of lithium has increased 1,100 percent in the past two years, a trend that is likely to accelerate because of existing policy incentives and increasing EV technology competitiveness. Long lead times for new mines — three years or more — will keep lithium supplies tight and prices high in the short term, but high prices will attract widespread investment in exploration, extraction and distribution. As a result, we predict that by 2025 lithium supplies will outpace demand and prices will plummet, and similar fluctuations in lithium, cobalt and nickel prices and availability will recur throughout the next decades. \n\n\n\nWe are already seeing this dynamic at play with increased interest in lithium mining in Nevada and elsewhere. But as companies search for reserves to develop, they will continue to run up against opposition founded on legitimate environmental concerns. Mining and refining are difficult, dirty operations that often have devastating impacts on the surrounding environment. On the other hand, hundreds of new mines will be needed if the world is to meet its decarbonization targets.  \n\n\n\nIn our opinion, the primary hurdle to meeting the demand for batteries will not be raw material availability but whether governments and industries can manage the environmental impacts of mining on a time schedule that will be compressed into 25-40 years. Doing so will require substantial investment in prevention of toxic waste leakages from mining, improved options to protect the local ecology, and development of better land reclamation techniques. It will mean investing in safer and cleaner ways to transport and refine minerals. Reforming and streamlining siting processes will help, but without significant improvements to minimize environmental degradation, such reforms will fall short.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nProactively addressing and assuaging public objections to new mines will be essential to securing access to critical metals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHenry Lee is director of the Environment and Natural Resources Program (ENRP) at Harvard Kennedy School’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.

        "description": "Forecasters on Wednesday shifted their rating for a New York district toward the Democrats after Democrat Pat Ryan won a special election Tuesday that was seen as a bellwether.\n\n\n\nRyan beat Republican Marc Molinaro to represent New York’s 19th Congressional District through January, a seat that opened up when former Rep. Antonio Delgado (D) was appointed lieutenant governor earlier this year. The 19th District special election had been touted as a litmus test of swing district voter behavior.\n\n\n\nRyan also won the Democratic primary on Tuesday for the redrawn 18th Congressional District and will compete there in November for his first full term.\n\n\n\nThe nonpartisan Cook Political Report changed its rating for the 18th from “toss-up” to “lean Democrat.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSabato’s Crystal Ball, the election handicapper from the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, noted that “Democrats scored an impressive victory” in Tuesday’s special election, which was “at least somewhat surprising” in the 19th district. \n\n\n\nProjecting that Ryan “should be a small favorite in the bluer district,” Sabato’s Crystal Ball also changed its rating for the 18th District seat from “toss-up” to “leans Democratic.”\n\n\n\nMolinaro will run for a full term in the redrawn 19th District.\n\n\n\nBecause redistricting will cut Republican Molinaro’s home county off the new 19th District map, the forecaster changed ratings for the district from “leans Republican” to “toss-up.”\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political report also left the 19th district in its “Democratic toss-up” column. ",

        "description": "The A&#8217;s claimed right-hander Tyler Cyr off waivers from the Phillies on Wednesday, per announcements from both teams. Cyr was designated for assignment on Monday when Philadelphia selected lefty Michael Plassmeyer&#8217;s contract from Triple-A.\nCyr, 29, made his big league debut with the Phils earlier in the year, though it spanned just one appearance and three hitters. He yielded a pair of hits, including a home run to Brandon Nimmo, and retired the other batter he faced. It was the tiniest of samples, but Cyr flashed a heater that averaged 94.9 mph that day, while also featuring a cutter and changeup.\nIt&#8217;s been an otherwise solid year for Cyr in Triple-A, where he&#8217;s logged a 2.50 ERA with a 24.8% strikeout rate, a 12.1% walk rate and a 51.1% grounder rate in 36 frames of relief work. This is his first season in an organization other than the Giants, who selected him in the tenth round of the 2015 draft and oversaw his development for parts of six seasons.\nCyr has now appeared in parts of three Triple-A seasons, pitching to a 3.62 ERA with a 28.3% strikeout rate and 12.9% walk rate in that time. He&#8217;s in the first of three minor league option seasons, as this marked the first time his contract has been selected to an MLB roster.",

        "description": "The Orioles announced Wednesday that they&#8217;ve claimed righty Phoenix Sanders off waivers from the Rays. Tampa Bay designated Sanders for assignment over the weekend.\nSanders, 27, made his big league debut with Tampa Bay this season, tossing 14 2/3 innings with five runs allowed on a dozen hits and three walks. The former 10th-round pick fanned 21.1% of his opponents, walked 5.3% of them and kept 41.5% of batted balls against him on the ground.\nSolid as those numbers are, Sanders hasn&#8217;t exactly shined with Triple-A Durham this year. While he&#8217;s posted an eye-popping 36-to-2 K/BB ratio there, Sanders and his 89.8 mph average fastball velocity have also been tagged for 39 hits &#8212; six of which cleared the fence for home runs (1.8 HR/9) &#8212; en route to a 5.40 ERA in 30 innings. He yielded plenty of hard contact in his limited big league time as well, evidenced by a sky-high 92.9 mph average exit velocity and a 45.2% hard-hit rate from his opponents.\nThe 2022 season may be a mixed bag of results in some regards, but looking more broadly, Sanders has a solid overall track record in the upper minors and has a full slate of minor league options remaining, as this year marked the first occasion on which his contract has been selected to the 40-man roster. He&#8217;ll give the O&#8217;s a somewhat intriguing, league-minimum arm who can be optioned freely and provide depth in the &#8217;pen moving forward.",

        "description": "An overwhelming majority of California voters have abortion on their minds as the November election approaches, according to a poll released Wednesday that also shows strong support for a ballot measure responding to the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.\nMore than 80 percent of registered voters consider abortion to be important in the upcoming election and 71 percent plan to vote for Proposition 1, an amendment to the California constitution that would prohibit the state from interfering with a woman’s right to an abortion and guarantees access to contraceptives, according to the poll from the U.S. Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies.\nIt's a reflection of the deep support for abortion rights in California as many other states begin to impose restrictions on the practice following the June 24 Supreme Court decision that overturned Roe v. Wade. \nProposition 1 supporters welcomed the polls results but warned that abortion rights activists shouldn’t get complacent.\n“While the numbers released today are encouraging, we cannot leave anything to chance,” said state Senate President pro tem Toni Atkins (D-San Diego), co-chair of the Yes on Prop1 campaign. “More than ever, we need voters to turn out and say yes on Prop 1 to set an example for the rest of the country that abortion is a fundamental right and should be protected as such in our Constitution.”\nAbortion is widely expected to be a major motivating factor in the midterms this year. In California, which has some of the most liberal reproductive rights policies in the nation, the Supreme Court’s decision generated a ferocious backlash and inspired a coordinated campaign to increase abortion access for both Californians and those seeking help from out of state.\nThe decision by state lawmakers to place Prop 1 on the ballot has the potential to drive up turnout for Democrats, and some speculate it could affect the outcome of a handful of tight Congressional races in the Golden State amid the strong feelings on the issue reflected in the poll. \nThe survey, conducted Aug. 9 to Aug. 15 among 9,254 California registered voters, found 68 percent disapprove of the Supreme Court decision that overturned the right to abortion in the U.S. Constitution.\nThe support for Prop 1 had solid majorities of support across all regions, ages, and ethnicities — but splinters along party lines. Democrats support the measure 89 percent to 5 percent, while 35 percent of Republicans were in favor. No party preference voters, who make up nearly a quarter of the state's electorate, back the measure 74 percent to 14 percent. \nThe poll also found robust support for new policies California lawmakers took in the immediate wake of the Supreme Court's decision. Sixty-five percent of respondents said they approve of laws signed by the governor that aim to help out-of-state women obtain abortions in California.",

        "description": "The Interior Department’s internal watchdog said former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke lied to investigators who were probing whether he wrongly blocked two native tribes from opening a casino in Connecticut in 2017 — and that he pressed the office to postpone Wednesday's report until after the November election that he is hoping will return him to Congress. \nThe results of the inspector general’s investigation, which began after POLITICO reported lobbyists and Nevada lawmakers pressured Zinke to reject the casino despite an approval recommendation from agency analysts, comes as Zinke is running for a Montana congressional seat. And it follows an IG report in February that found Zinke had also not been honest in explaining his actions relating to  he was negotiating&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/19/ryan-zinke-halliburton-park-whitefish-montana-647731&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d611-deb4-a9a2-d7d5d8640006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d611-deb4-a9a2-d7d5d8640007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">a personal real estate deal he was negotiating while head of Interior with the then-chairman of oilfield services company Halliburton.\n\"We found that Secretary Zinke and the [Chief of Staff] made statements to [Inspector General] investigators with the overall intent to mislead them,”  in the new report&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://subscriber.politicopro.com/f/?id=00000182-d0e6-d145-a1ab-f2eed6350000&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d611-deb4-a9a2-d7d5d8640008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d611-deb4-a9a2-d7d5d8640009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">the office said in the new report. “We found that both Secretary Zinke and COS made statements that presented an inaccurate version of the circumstances in which the [Department of Interior] made key decisions. As a result, we concluded that Secretary Zinke and COS did not comply with their duty of candor when questioned about their respective involvement in the DOI’s decision.\"\nThe agency noted that Zinke, who served in Congress before joining the Trump administration and narrowly won the Republican primary in June, asked the IG to keep its findings under wraps until after the November election, a request the agency said was not in keeping with its practices. \n“In his comments, Secretary Zinke cited DOJ guidelines and contended that we should postpone release of this report until after the conclusion of the November 2022 election in which he is seeking public office,” the report states.\nA lawyer for Zinke blasted the report and its timing.\n“On the eve of an election, the IG has released a misleading and inaccurate report that suggested Secretary Zinke lacked candor in his interview with IG agents,” Zinke's attorney, Danny C. Onorato, said in an emailed statement. “That is wrong. The content of the IG report and the timing of its release will be seen for what it is, another political smear.”\n Scott Hommel, Zinke’s chief of staff while at Interior, could not be reached for comment.\nThe inspector general’s office said it had forwarded its findings to the Justice Department in 2018, but that the department in 2021 declined to pursue its own investigation. Today’s report doesn’t address whether Interior mishandled the casino permits, saying the matter was still being fought over in federal court at the time of its investigation. \nA federal judge in 2018 dismissed the original lawsuit that one of the tribes and the state of Connecticut filed against Interior over the rejection, but allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaint to add allegations of political tampering in the process. The tribes then dropped the suit in March 2019. \nThe investigation stemmed from tribes’ accusations that Zinke overrode Interior staff recommendations to approve the casinos, and that he instead acted inappropriately to block the project as a favor to lobbyists from MGM Resorts International, which owned a competing casino, and lawmakers from Nevada.\nThe report lays out a series of multiple phone calls, text messages and emails going back and forth between Zinke and MGM representatives, including a political consultant the report describes as having “a close personal relationship” with Zinke. The consultant told the IG’s office he brought up the casino issue with Zinke during a skiing trip the two took together in March 2017, according to the report.\n“The Political Consultant told us that he regularly ate dinner with Secretary Zinke, primarily at the Secretary’s residence in Washington, DC, and that he discussed Casino’s argument against the Tribes’ amendments with Secretary Zinke during one or more of those dinners,” the report states.\nDespite these multiple meetings and communications, Zinke told investigators that he had not discussed the issue with anyone outside the Interior Department.\n“OIG investigators also asked Secretary Zinke about any discussions he may have had with individuals outside the DOI about the Tribes’ ... requests” the report states. “They specifically asked the Secretary, ‘Did ... you discuss, uh, outside of — outside of, say the DOI personnel, did you have these same discussions with — with representatives from the Tribes, the states? Others?’ Secretary Zinke responded, ‘I didn’t — no.’”\nZinke also denied discussing the casino issue with a U.S. senator, despite the senator telling investigators that he spoke to Zinke at length on that very issue. Previous reporting showed the person to be former Nevada Sen. Dean Heller, who called Zinke to urge him to decline the tribes’ applications.\n“The U.S. Senator said he and Secretary Zinke discussed the amendments in detail ... in fact, the Senator reiterated to us that discussing the amendments was the purpose of the call,” the report states. “The U.S. Senator also stated that he was sure he asked the Secretary not to approve the Tribes’ amendments and that his communications to the Secretary were clear.”\nOverall, the agency found that Zinke’s was the only testimony that didn’t fit in with that from multiple other people involved, the report concludes.\n“We drew this conclusion in large part based on the content and extent of the documentary evidence that we reviewed, as well as the interviews we conducted with the U.S. Senator, the Casino lobbyists, the Associate Deputy Secretary, the [Interior] attorneys, and other witnesses,” the report states. “We note that the witnesses’ statements to OIG investigators and their emails and text messages were consistent with each other and generally conflicted with Secretary Zinke’s statements to us.”",

The complaint claimed the policy is “antithetical to the values of public education, which encourages personal growth and debate.”The district said the suit misconstrued the language in the policy.",

        "description": "Tired of stale iPhone designs? Think you can do better? Now is your chance to prove it or just indulge your inner mad scientist. Neal Agarwal has created a Web app that lets you design your own iPhone. Much like the classic Mr. Potato Head toy, you’re given a bare-bones iPhone design to which you can add accessories like a notch, volume buttons, and cameras. Make it as serious or as silly as you want, with options for a headphone jack, Digital Crown, Mac Pro feet, googly eyes, a copter blade, and more. Rotate the iPhone to the desired side and drag an item to the iPhone to attach it. You can’t move an item once you’ve placed it; instead, click the item, click Delete in the lower-right corner, and then replace it. You can even click a Present button to see and download an Apple-esque commercial for your creation. Share screenshots of your best design with us in the comments!\n\nRead original article",

        "description": "The Yanks are coming, plus a lot of other teams that Rockies fans don&#8217;t get a chance to see very often at Coors Field.\nMajor League Baseball released its 2023 schedule Wednesday and it features a balanced schedule for all 30 clubs across the league for the first time since interleague play was introduced in 1997.\nFor the Rockies, that means a rare visit from the Yankees on July 14-16. The last time Colorado hosted the Yankees at Coors Field was in 2016.\nThe Rockies open their 2023 season on March 30 at San Diego to begin a four-game series at Petco Park. They then play two games at Los Angeles against the Dodgers.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKiszla: Waste of money on Kris Bryant is Exhibit A why Bill Schmidt should not be Rockies general manager\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRangers hammer Rockies, 16-4, following Jose Urena&#8217;s disastrous start\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Rockies Mailbag: Manager Bud Black&#8217;s job is not in jeopardy part II\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies ride 3-run homers by C.J.

The schedule includes 13 games against each National League West rival, two series at home and two on the road. It also includes one home and one road series against each NL East and Central team, and at least one series, either home or road, with each American League opponent.\nThe Rockies will play the Red Sox at Boston&#8217;s Fenway Park on June 12-14, while the Toronto Blue Jays come to Coors Field on Sept. 1-3.\nThe Rockies will be celebrating the 30th anniversary of the franchise throughout the season, with special events celebrating the club’s historical milestones, and alumni appearances throughout the 2023 season.\nThe season concludes with a six-game homestand at Coors Field with four games against the Dodgers (Sept. 26-28, including a split doubleheader on Sept. 26) and three games against Minnesota (Sept. 29-Oct. 1).\n\nRockies&#8217; 2023

In his last start, the 25-year-old allowed just two hits and one run in six sterling innings against the Giants. In his three prior starts, he&#8217;d been knocked around for 19 hits and 13 earned runs, earning a 1-1 record. Not once did he get out of the sixth inning, either. His ERA away from Coors Field this season has tipped the scales at 6.26 in six appearances. One of Rockies manager Bud Black&#8217;s favorite pitchers to watch across the league, deGrom has been electric in his four starts so far this season. In deGrom&#8217;s last three starts, he&#8217;s racked up 31 strikeouts to just one walk. He&#8217;s also only yielded six earned runs total across his four starts. Prior to Wednesday&#8217;s game against the Rangers, Black said it would be wise for all of Colorado&#8217;s pitchers to keep tabs on deGrom&#8217;s steady approach.\nTrending: Take &#8217;em where you can get &#8217;em, right? Following Tuesday night&#8217;s win over Texas, the Rockies have gone 8-2 vs. the Rangers since August of 2020. The win also clinched a winning five-game homestand ahead of their upcoming 10-game road trip.\nAt issue: Since June 17, the Rockies have gone 7-21 on the road and have been outscored by 64 runs.\nPitching probables: \nFriday: Rockies RHP Chad Kuhl (6-7, 5.16) at Mets RHP Chris Bassitt (11-7, 3.26), 3:10 p.m., ATTRM\nSaturday: Rockies LHP Kyle Freeland (7-8, 4.93) vs. Mets TBD, 3:10 p.m., ATTRM\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;",

        "description": "Multiple Democrats are already fighting to take Rep. Carolyn Maloney's top spot on the influential House Oversight Committee, less than 24 hours after her primary loss to Rep. Jerry Nadler.\nThe early jockeying, with at least four Democrats either openly announcing a run or being mentioned as a potential successor, previews what could be a heated scramble that will come to a head after the November election.\nRep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), a senior member of the committee, quickly became the first to jump into the ring, touting both his experience on the committee and his willingness to tangle with Republicans.\n“We need a tested leader who will not be timid in the face of Republican insurrectionists. One who has a deep understanding of the issues facing our Committee and our country,” Connolly said in a statement, adding that he believes \"I can be that leader.\"\nBut his announcement didn't clear the field. Rep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) also said in a letter to colleagues on Wednesday that he was seeking the post, and there are signals that Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) is interested in running as well.\nBecause Republicans are expected to flip the chamber in November, whoever succeeds Maloney would likely be the top Democrat and the ranking member on the committee, not the chair. But it would still be a high-profile perch on an influential committee that is expected to be at the center of some of the biggest investigations of the next Congress, including Hunter Biden and the origins of the coronavirus. Democrats would be able to use a series of closely watched hearings to push back on GOP probes or counter their messages.\nThe fight over who will succeed Maloney is the latest sign of the musical chairs Democrats could be forced to play after November. They've faced a wave of retiring members, others leaving due to the realities of redistricting and bigger questions about the potential for a leadership shake-up. Younger members of the caucus have privately grumbled for years about the inability to gain a foothold in leadership or attain plum committee positions because of a tier of long-serving lawmakers.\nLynch, who previously challenged Maloney for the post in 2019 before dropping out, said in the letter to his colleagues that he was “the most senior member of the Oversight Committee seeking this position” and that he is “well prepared to serve at this pivotal moment in our history.”\nMeanwhile, Raskin told POLITICO that he is \"actively exploring it and will have something to say this week.” Raskin is no stranger to the spotlight — Speaker Nancy Pelosi has appointed him to helm some of the most politically sensitive tasks in the current Congress.\nShe named him to lead the second impeachment of Donald Trump, just days after a mob of the then-president’s supporters attacked the Capitol — and only weeks after Raskin experienced his own profound personal tragedy, the death of his son, Tommy. She also put him on the Jan. 6 select committee, where he’s become one of the panel’s most outspoken voices, with a particular focus on the nexus between the extremist groups who helped drive the mob and figures in Trump’s orbit.\nRep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), another member of the Oversight Committee, is also being mentioned as a potential Maloney successor. But Khanna is publicly urging Raskin to run and that he wants “progressives and the Dem Caucus to rally around him. ... He is meant to lead in this moment.” \nA House aide said that Khanna hasn't made a decision on the race if Raskin doesn't run, but that his focus for now is on supporting the Maryland Democrat. \nIt’s not yet clear if additional Democrats would jump in the race.\nMaloney became chair of the Oversight Committee in 2019 following the death of the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.). Lynch and Rep. Jackie Speier (D-Calif.) both expressed interest at the time but ultimately dropped out. Speier is retiring at the end of the term.\nA spokesperson for Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi (D-Ill.), who currently chairs an Oversight subcommittee, didn't immediately respond to a question about whether he would run. Another senior Democrat on the panel, Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), is retiring. D.C. Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton said on Wednesday that she won’t run for the post.\n“While I will have the greatest seniority of any Democrat on [Transportation and Infrastructure] and the Committee on Oversight and Reform next Congress, I am running to be chair or ranking member of T&amp;I next Congress,” Norton said in a statement.",

Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) tweeted after the announcement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe had introduced the idea of loan forgiveness during the 2020 presidential campaign and got Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) on her side to convince administration officials to take the issue seriously. Schumer was on the phone discussing details with the White House up until the final decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLeft-wing lawmakers and activists see the move as a positive, necessary step of action before the midterms. By forgiving large portions of Americans’ loans, Biden moved closer to becoming the progressive leader that he promised to voters, they said, following through on a campaign pledge.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s sweeping plan&nbsp;unveiled&nbsp;officially on Wednesday is the largest forgiveness of federal student loans per person yet. Heeding calls from progressives, he also extended the ongoing federal loan payment freeze and interest accrual until the last day of the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House announced that borrowers&nbsp;with existing&nbsp;undergraduate loans can cap repayment at 5 percent of their monthly income. Under his policy, current students with loans are eligible for this debt relief and dependent students will be allowed relief based on their parents’ income.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill&nbsp;reported&nbsp;the news of the planned executive actions and timing on Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden still didn’t go as far as some wished, but the complaints were relatively muted&nbsp;just before the official rollout.\n\n\n\n“While this isn’t everything that advocates have called for, I think that many of them will recognize the immense difference that this is going to make in the lives of millions,” said one Democratic aide close to the issue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf all eligible borrowers take advantage of the policy, 43 million people will benefit. Of those, 20 million will have their debt completely wiped out, according to an estimate released by the White House.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Department of Education also announced forthcoming changes to its existing Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which allows certain public servants to receive additional assistance, on top of other smaller-scale measures.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome did lament that Biden did not go further than $10,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s a small, small addition,” said Angelo Greco, a progressive campaign strategist. “I just don’t see how anyone who has been pushing for at least $50,000 and citing all the racial equity stats as motivation to do it can be thrilled about something that scratches the surface of a systemic crisis.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbrams, of the Student Debt Crisis Center, said that while the announcement is “a major win for many,” the ceiling will leave others still&nbsp;“crushed&nbsp;by debt.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We think roughly 20 million people will be debt free,”&nbsp;said Thomas Gokey, an organizer with the Debt Collective.&nbsp;“For many others this will do very little. We have more work to do.”\n\n\n\nThe NAACP, which had been pressing for more relief than $10,000, said the proposal took the nation closer to alleviating the burden of student debt.\n\n\n\n“We’ve got a ways to go, but the NAACP is proud that we were able to push President Biden to exceed $10,000, bringing us closer to $50,000 and beyond,” NAACP President Derrick Johnson said. “Monthly payments won’t resume until 2023 and will be more manageable for many borrowers.”\n\n\n\nRepublicans are attacking the move as adding to inflation, and some centrist Democrats have shared those concerns.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRep. Chris Pappas (D-N.H.), who is up for reelection in the fall, bashed the president, saying the plan bypassed lawmakers. He also aired concerns that it will add to the deficit, a talking point echoed by some moderates in recent days.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This announcement by President Biden is no way to make policy and sidesteps Congress and our oversight and fiscal responsibilities,” Pappas said. “Any plan to address student debt should go through the legislative process, and it should be more targeted and paid for so it doesn’t add to the deficit.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, on the left, even those who previously quibbled with certain elements considered the announcement a big deal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMelissa Byrne, a prominent loan forgiveness activist and executive director of We the 45 Million, said Biden made use of his full executive authority.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“President Biden indeed made hope and history rhyme by using the power of his pen to cancel student loan debt,” said Byrne.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe National Education Association, a labor union, noted that including even more relief for Pell Grant recipients will go a long way.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The additional relief for Pell Grant recipients ensures equity, and that the borrowers with the greatest need are not left behind,” said NEA President Becky Pringle. “This will have a positive impact on America's educators and the students they serve. This is an encouraging step toward achieving the goal of broad student loan cancellation of at least $50,000 per borrower without means testing.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor all the enthusiasm among many Democrats, recent polling indicates the issue is decisive. Thirty-four percent of respondents to a new&nbsp;CNBC poll&nbsp;say only those in need should have debt forgiven, while 32 percent say all of those with student loan debt should have it forgiven. Thirty percent say no debt should be forgiven.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe move also adds to a run of policy success for liberals, who&nbsp;had rallied&nbsp;around the recent climate, tax and health care bill signed into law by Biden. While it did not come close to meeting their initial goals, it still represented the biggest step even taken legislatively in the fight against climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nProgressives now want to make gains on other issues — notably voting rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think student forgiveness is great. Good folks will save money. It will sow the idea that government is a place where things can get done,” said Michael Ceraso, a Democratic strategist and campaign veteran.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“But if you want to expand the electorate, you fight for voting rights. Period,” he said. “Student loan forgiveness doesn’t elicit the same response. It’s a static move that won’t make any ripples. But combine it with voting rights? And Biden becomes the president everyone wanted in 2020.”",

A number of coffee shops and restaurants appeared to be closed.&nbsp;Ukrainian flags and graffiti denouncing Moscow were ever-present.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe one place where the crowds seemed to gather en masse was Khreschatyk Street, the main artery of the city. It was open for pedestrian traffic, allowing onlookers to tour a macabre display of&nbsp;heavily damaged&nbsp;tanks, armored personnel carriers, rocket launchers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeople pass former Russian tanks in Kyiv, Ukraine, during the Independence Day of Ukraine on Wednesday, August 24, 2022. Laura Kelly\n\n\n\nAnna Klovak, a mother of three from Kyiv, spoke to The Hill while walking among the parade of destroyed Russian war machines. She’s decided to live in Poland and only returned to the country to set up her apartment to be rented out.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I thank god that my job gives&nbsp;me an opportunity to live and work in Europe — because the biggest [fear] for me is my son come to school here and if some bomb or missiles hit here, it will be the end of my life,” she told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That’s why I should live far away from Ukraine right now. I really love my country and I don’t want to be somewhere else and living in Poland, because Poland is nice country but it’s not mine. Just one wish that the war should end as soon as possible and I hope to come back here with my son and my two kids.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn a war-torn Independence Day, she spoke with pride of free speech in her country while saying she made the decision to live&nbsp;abroad for the safety of her son.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I am Ukrainian, and I feel free to do what I want. I can write anything on Facebook or Instagram and no one will judge me by police by court.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNazar Vorobay, 21, originally from Bucha, was also walking by the tanks and other machinery. He said the war had made him more resilient.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I became much more independent, substantially … being here and living through that whole shit, I’m sorry, but that was just so horrific. I became much more independent and I realize that oh, clearly, nothing worse can happen, I already lived through … I could have died, it wasn’t safe at all.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHis parents have relocated to Spain, but he remains in the country. He describes Bucha before the war as an upscale suburb outside of Kyiv, where upper-middle class families who worked in the city moved to have more space.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThinking about Bucha before the war, he says he gets chills.\n\n\n\nThe burned-out Russian war machines are part of an ever-growing collection of evidence and artifacts of Russia’s attempt to take over Ukraine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a visit to Irpin earlier in the day, the mayor of the city, Oleksandr Markushin, told The Hill that a destroyed bridge over the Irpin river will be preserved as a memorial and a museum, and a new bridge will be built next to it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMayor Oleksandr Markushin stands in front of Irpin's destroyed bridge. A new bridge will be built next to the original, which will be used as a memorial and museum. Laura Kelly\n\n\n\n“This bridge was destroyed by Ukrainian forces to cut off the Russians from entering Kyiv,” he told The Hill. He added that 40,000 people evacuated through this area, despite the destruction, and it also served as a key route to deliver humanitarian aid.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbout 30 percent of Irpin, a suburb only a short drive from Kyiv, was occupied by Russian forces.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“A lot of people were killed. The most terrible story was when one woman and two children, and one volunteer, came here and tried to be evacuated, and the Russian mine hit them. I still see it in my nightmares, even now.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMarking Independence Day, Markushin wore a shirt with the traditional embroidery of Ukraine — called the vyshyvanka pattern. The shirt also was the color of military green, reflecting his position as a war-time mayor.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We don’t have any free days, we are always working to protect our security, especially as Russia seeks to attack us on these days,” he said.&nbsp;",

The Door Christian Fellowship's production also included a sermon at the end of the show listing homosexuality as a “struggle” alongside alcohol and drugs, according to The New York Times. \n\n\n\nGutierrez, who initially said the \"Hamilton\" team had approved “our version” of the musical, said the ministry will see this moment as \"a learning opportunity about protected artistic works and intellectual property.\"\n\n\n\n\"I recognize as the Pastor of the church that I have an obligation and responsibility to follow the law and educate our community about these protocols,\" he wrote.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for \"Hamilton\" said that it will donate all damages to a nonprofit coalition supporting the LGBTQ+ community in South Texas, according to the Times. \n\n\n\n\"On behalf of The Door Christian Fellowship McAllen Church, we agree we will never stage the performance again and will destroy any and all video or sound recordings and images of the unauthorized performances or rehearsals, and request that all our members do the same,\" Gutierrez said. \"Lastly, we will pay damages for our actions.\"\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reach out to the Dramatists Guild of America for comment.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3613859-how-a-long-cold-winter-could-dampen-western-support-for-ukraine/",
        "description": "The 24th of August marks the day Ukraine’s Supreme Council&nbsp;voted&nbsp;to leave the Soviet Union in 1991, and this Independence Day will also mark six months since the beginning of Russia’s expanded invasion of the country. The conflict is far from over and its outcome is no clearer than at the outset of the war.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoth Russia and Ukraine have incurred&nbsp;heavy losses, with the former’s performance far worse than expected, and the latter’s — with extensive Western support — far greater than expected. The West’s support is proving critical for Kyiv’s sustained defense and potential future counter-offensives — and could well be the lynchpin for Ukraine’s long-term prospects.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs it stands, neither Russia nor Ukraine appears capable of achieving a decisive battlefield victory or of creating conditions favorable to Moscow or Kyiv to enter into negotiations at the moment. It would appear, then, that the most likely near-term outcome is that the war in Ukraine will stop, but it will not end. This is a key and important distinction. The ease with which “victory” and “win” are used in popular discussions obfuscates the fact that there is unlikely to be either outcome at an operational or strategic level, certainly not as long as Russia is willing to expend considerable blood and treasure to achieve its objectives and so long as Ukraine is unwilling to surrender its independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt an operational level, both Moscow and Kyiv appear to be driving towards a state of exhaustion. As the winter sets in, the expectation is that both sides will continue to fight, but will do so from a defensive position, seek to rearm and regroup, before looking to resume the conflict in the spring. Here, the most significant issue beyond Western supply and unity was, clearly, personnel. The need to take Ukrainian personnel off the front line, provide them rest and relaxation, train them and send them forward was pressing on the United Kingdom planners. The West can provide all the aid in the world, but cannot create more Ukrainians.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt a political and more strategic level, Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, is unlikely to retract or recant his views that Ukraine is inextricably part of Russia. Ukraine, for its part, will not (nor should it) abandon its political and territorial independence. Russia’s unstoppable force meets Ukraine’s immovable object.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMaintaining European and allied unity in the face of existing conditions is becoming increasingly difficult due to multiple, interrelated factors. Each party appears to have a different definition of a satisfactory outcome. For the United States and the United Kingdom, it is whatever Kyiv defines for itself. For the Baltic States, which have long&nbsp;warned&nbsp;of Russia’s territorial ambitions, nothing less than a catastrophic defeat is acceptable (whatever that looks like in practice). France and Germany appear keen to resolve the situation swiftly and&nbsp;diplomatically&nbsp;and are more inclined to avoid a humiliating defeat for Putin and Russia.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is even before the individual complexities and dynamics emerge. While it is far too early to tell how the winter will manifest itself in Europe, should it prove to be a cold and harsh season, the pressure to reengage Russian energy could become significant.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGermany as a function of its energy decoupling from Moscow has set itself on a course for an&nbsp;economic recession. Berlin’s willingness to incur and sustain such economic pain at a time when it was already skeptical of the West’s support of Ukraine may prove increasingly untenable. Italy’s September&nbsp;election&nbsp;could well be a bellwether for shifting tides within Europe.&nbsp;Turkey, for its part (and notwithstanding President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s recent comments on&nbsp;Crimea), is trying to present itself as a neutral party of sorts, pursuing a diplomatic solution and maintaining relations with Russia (possibly helping Moscow evade sanctions), while supplying Kyiv with arms. Within the United States, the forthcoming midterm elections could see a shift in political power within Congress, sweeping in Republican skeptics of support for Kyiv, and presaging a broader political shift ahead of the 2024 presidential election.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEqually as important, if the conflict does indeed stop, but not end, how sustainable is Western unity? If the conflict adopts a similar appearance to that after Russia’s 2014 annexation of Crimea and Donbas, how willing will the West be to continue supplying arms and munitions? Maintaining this long-haul unity will prove difficult given the internal nation-state dynamics, but also the “frozen” nature of the conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is what some analysts suspect Putin hopes to achieve: dragging the conflict out as long as possible to create and exploit gaps in the West’s support for Ukraine. The longer the conflict drags on, the greater the political and economic cost, and the emergence of other more pressing issues, the greater the likelihood that Russia will achieve its aims (however it shifts to define them in the face of Ukrainian pressure), regardless of the cost. Indeed, Moscow recently&nbsp;ruled out&nbsp;the possibility of a peace deal to end the war.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf anything, these trends should spur greater conversations about the West’s objectives in supporting Ukraine and what an acceptable outcome may well be. This is not a question of “winning” or “victory” in Ukraine, but what a militarily achievable, politically acceptable outcome is for Kyiv and the West. An open-ended conflict will assuredly lead to the erosion of Western support for the war, especially as other pressures emerge. Managing expectations at a political level is a precursor to managing public expectations within the countries providing critical support to Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is even more important as the conflict continues beyond the 240-character attention span of most citizens (and politicians), beyond the six months fought thus far and well into 2023 and beyond. Indeed, if 2014 is anything to go by, will the West be willing to sustain support to Ukraine for the next eight or more years?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJoshua C.

        "title": "Fitbit announces new Inspire 3, Versa 4, and Sense 2 watches",
        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/fitbit-new-2022-watches",
        "description": "As teased yesterday via Twitter, Today Google announced the new lineup of Fitbit smartwatches. The new generation of devices combines what we know and love already from Fitbit, but it incorporates more Google tools, such as Google Maps navigation and Google Wallet. The devices are also thinner this time, which Google states make them more comfortable to wear.\n\n\n\nWe also got some clarity on what OS these watches will run, which will still be Fitbit OS and not Wear OS, except it will be a new flavor of Fitbit OS with more Google smarts sprinkled in. Also, those disappointed with the disappearance of the side button on the Versa 3 will be happy to know that the button is back.\n\n\n\nTo entice buyers, Google/Fitbit is throwing in a free six months of Fitbit Premium with the purchase of any of the three new devices. Fitbit Premium includes more advanced metrics like a &#8220;Daily Readiness Score&#8221; and &#8220;Sleep Profile.&#8221; It also has over 1,000 workout and mindfulness sessions. After the six-month free introduction, the price of Fitbit Premium will set you back $9.99 a month or $79.99 for the whole year.\n\n\n\nFitbit Inspire 3\n\n\n\nThe Fitbit Inspire 3 is the entry-level device in the Fitbit ecosystem. It is considered more of a tracker rather than a smartwatch. Retailing for $99.95, the Inspire 3 is the most economical of the new watches. This is the perfect device if all you want is to track your metrics, like steps, calories burned, heart rate, etc. It also tracks workouts and sleep quality by measuring blood oxygen (SpO2) and duration.\n\n\n\nThe watch is shaped like an elongated black pebble, which makes it comfortable to wear 24/7 while promising ten days of battery life. However, you can personalize it with an assortment of brightly colored and translucent bands, as well as a stainless steel mesh option. Moreover, a clip is available for sale, so you can clip the pebble to your clothes, if that&#8217;s your thing. \n\n\n\nThe Fitbit Inspire 3 is available to pre-order starting today, with shipping beginning on September 15th.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitbit Versa 4\n\n\n\nThe new Fitbit Versa 4 is the more fitness-focused smartwatch of the bunch, which comes complete with over 40 exercise modes and all the fitness features you&#8217;d expect from a Fitbit. This year&#8217;s Versa is thinner and lighter than the last and brings back the side button that we lost with the Versa 3. However, Fitbit says the side button&#8217;s new location will make it easier to access during workouts.\n\n\n\nThe watch will be compatible with iOS and Android and have smarter app integrations, such as extended app and text notifications, glanceable alerts, and smart replies. However, the latter will only be available on Android devices. It will also include access to Google Maps (with built-in GPS + GLONASS) and Google Wallet; however, those two features are advertised as &#8220;coming soon.&#8221;\n\n\n\nThe Fitbit Versa 4 promises a six-day battery life with normal usage and up to five days with continuous GPS. It is available for $229.95 and can be pre-ordered starting today, with shipping beginning on September 23rd. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFitbit Sense 2\n\n\n\nThe Sense 2 is the latest flagship of the lineup, with a new sensor that tracks continuous electrodermal activity (EDA). This sensor can monitor your stress level, providing metrics like your heart rate, heart rate variability, and skin temperature, which are stress indicators. The Sense 2&#8217;s tools can make you aware of these changes in your body to help you identify which are your triggers and thus help you make the necessary adjustments. Stress that is left unchecked can contribute to many health problems, so it&#8217;s great to see Fitbit paying more attention to this metric.\n\n\n\nSimilar to the Versa 4, the Sense 2 will have access to Google Maps (with built-in GPS + GLONASS) and Google Wallet, but that won&#8217;t be available right at launch. It will also have extended app and text notifications, glanceable alerts, and smart replies.\n\n\n\nNew bands are also available that fit both the Versa 4 and the Sense 2, including a collection of woven leather bands from Brother Vellies. The Fitbit Sense 2 promises a six-day battery life with normal usage and up to five days with continuous GPS &#x2014; the same as the Versa 4. You can also charge it for 12 minutes to gain one day of battery life. It is available for $299.95 and can be pre-ordered starting today, with shipping beginning on September 23rd.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGetting ready for the Pixel Watch\n\n\n\nThe Fitbit website also got a subtle redesign with &#8220;Fitbit by Google&#8221; branding and a small but significant Pixel Watch tease where you can sign up to be notified when the watch is available. More notable is how the Pixel Watch is described, offering a window into how Google plans to position the watch compared to the rest of the Fitbit line. Google quite literally called it &#8220;Fitbit for health &amp; fitness + Google apps for getting things done.&#8221; So it&#8217;s basically the best of both worlds in one device.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf any of these options interest you, but you&#8217;re not sure which is the right Fitbit device for you, there is a quiz on their website that can help you narrow down your choices. If you are interested in pre-ordering, you can do so over at fitbit.com. I expect that, unless they&#8217;re all in on Fitbit, most folks will probably want to wait until the Pixel Watch is out so that they can weigh their options before making a decision. I will be waiting until October for the Pixel Watch launch and, obviously, whether it will be affordable compared to the Fitbit devices.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) had a successful night in school board elections Tuesday where a majority of his endorsed candidates won, including in areas where school boards were previously run by liberal members. \n\n\n\nDeSantis posted a list of 30 school board candidates he endorsed before elections last night, saying the candidates were “committed to the student-first principles of the DeSantis Education Agenda.”\n\n\n\nOut of the 30 candidates, 21 of the candidates won, four will be in runoff races and five lost. \n\n\n\nAmong the wins, the DeSantis-backed candidates were able to flip multiple school boards that were previously liberal-leaning to conservative-leaning.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 1776 Project PAC, a conservative education political action committee that helped some of the school board candidates, tweeted that the Miami-Dade school board is now flipped conservative after two DeSantis-endorsed candidates, Roberto Alonso and Monica Colucci, won spots on the school board. \n\n\n\n“Miami Dade is now the LARGEST county in America with a conservative school board majority,” the group said. \n\n\n\nSarasota County saw its school board flip from a three to two liberal majority to a four to one conservative majority. Duval County also now has a conservative-majority school board after the elections.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Congrats to Bridget Ziegler, Robyn Marinelli, and Timothy Enos,” the 1776 Project PAC said of the Sarasota races.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The Community has spoken &amp; it is crystal clear - they are demanding a reset of the School Board. And that’s what they are going to get,” Ziegler tweeted after winning the election. \n\n\n\nSchool board elections have been a central issue in education as Republicans and Democrats have butted heads over masks in schools, critical race theory — a graduate-level legal theory that looks at American institutions, history and policy through a lens of structural racism existing within them — and what ages are appropriate to teach children about LGBTQ topics. \n\n\n\nEducation issues have come to a head in Florida where some school boards, including in Miami-Dade, defied DeSantis when he banned mask wearing in schools last year. \n\n\n\nSchool boards in Florida also face the issue of a teacher shortage, which DeSantis is attempting to resolve by recruiting veterans into teaching roles.",

        "description": "Legislation in California that would limit the use of hip-hop lyrics as criminal evidence in court proceedings has cleared the state's legislature.\n\n\n\nSenate Bill AB 2799 passed the state’s Senate in a 76-0 vote on Tuesday. The bill is now headed to Gov. Gavin Newsom’s (D) desk, where it should be signed into law in the coming days, making it the first such measure to become law, according to ABC News. \n\n\n\nThe legislation, first introduced by state Sen. Reggie Jones-Sawyer (D), seeks to make sure \"an accused person’s creative expression will not be used to introduce stereotypes or activate bias against the defendant, nor as character or propensity evidence.” \n\n\n\nThe bill will also require courts to determine the admissibility of the song lyrics as evidence in the case, and whether the content should be linked to the alleged crime.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“And to recognize that the use of rap lyrics and other creative expression as circumstantial evidence of motive or intent is not a sufficient justification to overcome substantial evidence that the introduction of rap lyrics creates a substantial risk of unfair prejudice,” the text of the bill reads.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe measure comes four months after the high-profile detainments of Atlanta-based rappers Young Thug, whose real name is Jeffery Williams, and Gunna, whose real name is Sergio Kitchens. The two were among more than two dozen individuals arrested by authorities on felony racketeering charges.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nProsecutors allege that Thug formed a street gang and promoted his gang’s lifestyle through its music and social media posts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe indictment unsealed against them in Fulton County, Ga., also included hip-hop lyrics from both artists’ music catalogs. The two have been denied bond and are set to appear in court in January.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nProminent figures such as Atlanta-based rapper and activist Killer Mike and Democratic Georgia gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams have voiced their disapproval of hip-hop lyrics being used as criminal evidence in court cases. ",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/3614358-democrats-scramble-to-replace-maloney-atop-oversight-panel/",
        "description": "The race to replace Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) as the leading Democrat on the Oversight and Reform Committee is already heating up, with at least two senior Democrats vying for the top spot in the next Congress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nReps. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.) and Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) quickly announced their intent to seek the powerful seat on Wednesday, just hours after Maloney lost her primary contest to Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.) in Manhattan. \n\n\n\nMaloney has chaired the committee since the death of Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) almost three years ago. She will keep the gavel until the end of the current term, when House Democrats will vote to replace her. It's unclear if other Democrats will join Lynch and Connolly in the race.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith subpoena power and a broad jurisdiction, the Oversight panel is among the most sought-after committee spots in the lower chamber. And with Democrats expected to lose control of the House in November's midterm elections, the stakes will be high. \n\n\n\nRepublicans are vowing to use the Oversight panel to launch numerous investigations into the Biden administration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn that scenario, the ranking member position will provide a high-profile perch for the senior Democrat to cut a national profile defending the party's White House ally on issues ranging from border immigration policy to the origins of the coronavirus.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLynch, an 11-term lawmaker, is touting his seniority on the panel in his pitch to fellow Democrats, highlighting his current position as chair of the Oversight Committee's subpanel on national security.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"For the past 17 years, I have served as a Chairman or Ranking Member of an Oversight Subcommittee – a record that is unmatched by any Committee member – and I have fought proudly against Republican legislative attacks designed to curb critical safety regulations, abrogate the fundamental employment rights of federal employees, privatize and dismantle the Postal Service, and infringe on D.C. Home Rule,\" Lynch wrote in a letter to Democratic colleagues.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConnolly, a member of the New Democrats in his seventh term, is making a similar case, arguing that his long experience on the panel fighting to protect government institutions like the Postal Service, and defend federal employees — a significant constituency in his Northern Virginia district — make him the best fit for the job.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"For more than fourteen years, I have made this Committee my top priority and focused on the issues that define it: Postal reform; defending our proud federal employees; rooting out waste, fraud, and abuse; modernizing the federal government; and holding the Trump administration accountable,\" he said Wednesday morning in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnlike the Republicans, Democrats tend to favor more veteran members when it comes to filling the top seat on committees. Still, seniority provides no guarantee of winning a gavel. Indeed, Cummings took over the top spot on the Oversight Committee in 2011 by hopping over a more veteran Democrat. More recently, Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) won the Appropriations gavel over the the more senior Rep. Marcy Kaptur (Ohio).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLynch, perhaps with that in mind, is vowing to empower the other members of the committee when it comes to investigative subjects. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"In my experience, the Oversight Committee has been most effective when we allow individual members to showcase their diverse talents and areas of keen interest,\" he wrote. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConnolly, who has been among the most outspoken critics of Trump's role in last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol, maintains that he's already proven his mettle in that arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"We need a tested leader who will not be timid in the face of Republican insurrectionists. One who has a deep understanding of the issues facing our Committee and our country. A collaborator who can be a bridge to our talented and diverse caucus,\" he said.&nbsp;",

        "title": "Five takeaways from Tuesday’s big primaries",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3614242-five-takeaways-from-tuesdays-big-primaries/",
        "description": "The New York Mets played the New York Yankees this week. Loyalties were divided; cross-town rivalries acute. The political equivalent of that series played out yesterday in a hard-fought Democratic primary between Reps. Jerry Nadler and Carolyn Maloney in Manhattan. Here are five key takeaways from that race, as well as others in New York.\n\n\n\nFirst, national Democrats had a huge night in New York, fortifying their sense that a brutal midterm environment has softened, if not turned around.&nbsp;The big news was the victory of Democrat Pat Ryan over Republican Mark Molinaro in a special election in the Hudson Valley to replace former Rep. Antonio Delgado (Delgado left the House to serve as lieutenant governor). No pundit that I know predicted a Democratic victory in that Republican-leaning district.&nbsp;One&nbsp;poll on the verge of Election Day had Molinaro&nbsp;up by eight points.\n\n\n\nMolinaro’s campaign echoed the conventional GOP playbook, which should be entitled “B.I.G.”: Biden, Inflation, Gas. \n\n\n\nAt lunch in early summer, Ryan told me that he intended to “put choice on the ballot.” He decided to spur Democratic turnout and persuade swing voters by turning the race into a referendum on the Supreme Court’s dismantling of Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe strategy worked, and Ryan almost beat Molinaro in the Republican’s home county. But even in the post-election analysis, many pundits have missed another dynamic: Ryan is a West Point graduate and Iraq War combat veteran. The lesson: In purple districts, Democrats with credibility on national security issues perform well. \n\n\n\nSecond, the argument that a far-left progressive candidate is a prerequisite to turning out the base in New York fell flat in at least one district, NY-17. There, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, who chairs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, found himself in a primary by uber-progressive State Senator Alessandra Biaggi. Her campaign believed, understandably, that a low turnout Democratic primary in the dead of August would hinge on progressive energy. Maloney defeated her by over 30 points.\n\n\n\nLesson two: Ideological energy is important but doesn’t guarantee&nbsp;turnout in a primary. You need all the dynamics of a strong campaign, including money and compatibility with constituents.\n\n\n\nThird, the lesson about the energy of the base in Maloney’s district upstate also applied to Republicans downstate. For example, In Long Island’s 2nd congressional district, incumbent Republican Anthony Garbarino trounced a Republican who bashed him for supporting the bipartisan infrastructure bill and to certify President Biden as the winner of the 2020 election.\n\n\n\nFourth, that clash of the titans between Nadler and Maloney (who found themselves drawn into the same district) proved an argument I made in this newspaper several years ago: Beneath the cerebral, often verbose image of Nadler are the survival instincts of a New York streetfighter.&nbsp;He may be one of the most underestimated political operatives on Capitol Hill (at least until last night). The guy grew up in Manhattan’s clubhouse politics, which can be more cutthroat than inside the beltway.&nbsp;Lesson: To survive in a rapidly changing, unpredictable environment, don’t lose your political footing. As House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) often says, you&nbsp;must “own the ground.”\n\n\n\nFifth, don’t cast these takeaways in stone when divining their impact on the November midterms.&nbsp;There are no political earthquakes in midterm elections, but there are tremors.\n\n\n\nThe bottom line is that for both parties, the ground remains shaky and unpredictable. The best strategy for both parties is to hope for the best and plan for the worst. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSteve Israel&nbsp;represented New York in the U.S. House of Representatives over eight terms and was chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee from 2011 to 2015. He is now director of the Cornell Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy Institute of Politics and Global Affairs.&nbsp;Follow him on Twitter&nbsp;@RepSteveIsrael.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Aurich Lawson | Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere's a classic irony with new technology, that adopters are forced to limit themselves to two of the three things everyone wants: fast, cheap, and good. When the tech is batteries, adoption is even more challenging. Cheap and fast (charging) still matter, but \"good\" can mean different things, such as light weight, low volume, or long life span, depending on your needs. Still, the same sorts of trade-offs are involved. If you want really fast charging, you'll probably have to give up some capacity.\nThose trade-offs keep research into alternate battery chemistries going despite the massive lead lithium has in terms of technology and manufacturing capabilities—there's still the hope that some other chemistry could provide a big drop in price or a big boost in some measure of performance.\nToday, a paper is being published that appears to offer a low price combined with a big boost in several of those measures. The aluminum-sulfur batteries it describes offer low-priced raw materials, competitive size, and more capacity per weight than lithium-ion—with the big plus of fully charging cells in far less than a minute. The one obvious problem it has right now is that it needs to be at 90° C (nearly the boiling point of water) to work.Read 16 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStreaming media platform Plex on Wednesday said it was hacked by intruders who managed to access a proprietary database and make off with password data, usernames, and emails belonging to at least half of its 30 million customers.\n“Yesterday, we discovered suspicious activity on one of our databases,” company officials wrote in an email sent to customers. “We immediately began an investigation and it does appear that a third-party was able to access a limited subset of data that includes emails, usernames, and encrypted passwords.”\nThe email said that the passwords were “hashed and secured in accordance with best practices,” meaning the passwords were cryptographically scrambled in a way that requires attackers to devote additional resources to crack the hashes and revert them back to their plaintext state. A Plex spokesperson said that the passwords were hashed using bcrypt, among the strongest algorithms for protecting passwords. bcrypt automatically applies what's known as cryptographic salting and peppering to make cracking harder.Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Today we are pleased to announce that Cloud Certificate Manager is now in general availability. Cloud Certificate Manager enables our users to acquire, manage, and deploy public Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates at scale for use with your Google Cloud workloads. TLS certificates are required to secure browser connections and transactions. Cloud Certificate Manager supports both self-managed and Google-managed certificates, as well as wildcard certificates, and has monitoring capabilities to alert for expiring certificates. Scale to support as many domains as you needSince our public preview announcement supporting the SaaS use cases, we have scaled the solution to serve millions of managed domains. Alon Kochba, head of web performance at Wix, shared how Certificate Manager’s scale and performance helped them lighten their workload.“As a SaaS product, we need to terminate SSL for millions of custom domains and certificates. Google Cloud's Certificate Manager and External HTTPS Load Balancing lets us do this at the edge, close to the clients, without having to deploy our own custom solution for terminating SSL,” Kochba said. Streamline your migrationsYou can now deploy a new certificate globally in minutes and greatly simplify and accelerate the deployment of TLS for SaaS offerings. Coupled with support for DNS Authorizations, you can now streamline your workload migrations without major disruptions. James Hartig, co-founder of GetAdmiral.com, shared this with Google after the migration experience.“I just wanted to say thank you so much for the release of Certificate Manager and its support for SaaS use cases. We just completed our migration to using Google to terminate TLS and everything went really smoothly and we couldn't be happier.” Automate with Kubernetes &amp; self-service ACME certificate enrollmentWe have further introduced a number of automation and observability features including:Kubernetes integration in public preview with Cloud Certificate ManagerSelf-service ACME certificate enrollment, now in public previewThe ability to track Certificate Manager usage in the billing dashboardWe also have started work on incorporating Terraform automation with Cloud Certificate Manager, which will simplify your workload automation.During the certificate manager private preview of the ACME certificate enrollment capability, our users have acquired millions of certificates for their self-managed TLS deployments. Each of these certificates comes from Google Trust Services, which means our users get the same TLS device compatibility and scalability we demand for our own services. Our Cloud users get this benefit even when they manage the certificate and private key themselves–all for free. We look forward to you using Certificate Manager and these new capabilities to improve the reliability of your services and help encourage further adoption of TLS.Related ArticleHow Google Cloud blocked the largest Layer 7 DDoS attack at 46 million rpsBy anticipating a DDOS attack, a Google Cloud customer was able to stop it before it took down their site.

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/nationals-to-promote-cade-cavalli.html",
        "description": "The Nationals are calling up top pitching prospect Cade Cavalli for his Major League debut on Friday, per a club announcement. Grant Paulsen of 106.7 FM The Fan first reported Cavalli would be getting the call to the big leagues. The 2020 first-rounder will need to have his contract formally selected to the Major League roster before Friday&#8217;s game.\n\nCavalli, 24, was the No. 22 overall selection in 2020. The Oklahoma native and former Sooner star has enjoyed a solid season in Triple-A Rochester, where he&#8217;s notched a 3.71 ERA with a 25.9% strikeout rate, a 9.7% walk rate and a 43.1% grounder rate. Cavalli has gotten more comfortable in Triple-A and gotten stronger as the season wears on; after some rocky outings throughout his first 13 trips to the hill, he&#8217;s now rattled off a 1.47 ERA with a 43-to-12 K/BB ratio (29.7 K%, 8.7% BB%) in his past seven starts &#8212; a total of 36 1/3 innings.\nThe 6&#8217;4&#8243;, 240-pound Cavalli, in addition to his lofty draft status, currently ranks as one of the sport&#8217;s top pitching prospects. He checks in at No. 20 on FanGraphs&#8217; most recent prospect rankings and is also featured prominently on the latest leaguewide lists from Baseball Prospectus (No. 29), Baseball America (No. 52) and MLB.com (No. 58).\nCavalli made the Futures Game roster in each of the past two seasons, though he was a late scratch from this year&#8217;s game due to a blister issue on his pitching hand. Fans who tuned into the 2021 game saw Cavalli touch 102 mph on the radar gun with a powerful heater that generally draws 70 grades on the 20-80 scale. Command issues, stemming in part from a violent delivery that gives some scouts concerns he&#8217;ll ultimately move to the bullpen, have been the big knock on Cavalli. He also works with a slider, curveball and changeup, each drawing praise as anywhere from an above-average to potentially plus pitch. Eric Longenhagen of FanGraphs writes in his scouting report that while there&#8217;s relief risk, &#8220;&#8230;if things click, Cavalli is going to be a monster.&#8221;\nFor the Nats, the hope is that Cavalli can achieve that top-of-the-rotation ceiling and join left-hander MacKenzie Gore and righty Josiah Gray as the nucleus of the team&#8217;s rotation for years to come. Because he&#8217;s being called up this late in the season, Cavalli can&#8217;t earn a full year of Major League service time and is also well past the point at which Super Two status is attainable. That means he&#8217;ll be controllable for six more seasons beyond this one &#8212; all the way through 2028 &#8212; and won&#8217;t be eligible to reach arbitration until after 2025 season. Of course, future demotions back to the minors could push back either of those trajectories.",

        "description": "Phalen Will Oversee the Development of HorsePower’s Newest Emerging Brands&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChristopher Phalen has been promoted to vice president of franchise development of HorsePower Brands, an umbrella franchisor of service brands including Mighty Dog Roofing, Franchise Rocket, and Heroes Lawn Care. In his new role, Phalen will oversee the development of emerging brands coming on board in 2023.&nbsp;He was previously HorsePower&#8217;s director of franchise development.\n\n\n\nPhalen looks forward to training and developing “newer franchise development directors on how to be a great tour guide with their candidates and why they should join HorsePower Brands. I love to be a mentor more than an individual contributor.&#8221;\n\n\n\nPhalen was originally attracted to HorsePower because it did something that was very impressive in his view: taking a brand from infancy or one owner and growing it to more than 100 territories in the first 12 months of development. “We have now created that repeatable process with four brands consistently, under Josh Skolnick and Zach Beutler’s leadership,” Phalen adds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChristopher Phalen is the new vice president of franchise development for HorsePower Brands.&nbsp;\n\n\nAdditionally, Phalen was inspired by HorsePower’s vision of owning and operating 25 verticals under one umbrella. These would include 15 home service-based companies that will be franchised across the U.S. and 10 verticals that support those brands, he adds. “It is clear from our founders on down that something special is being built in Omaha, Neb., and I am blessed to be a part of the rocketship.”\n\n\n\nPhalen’s Franchising Journey\n\n\n\nPhalen did not come from franchising and had no prior industry experience before meeting Beutler and Skolnick. “I love this industry because people are my product just like everything I did in the past in the fitness industry and staffing. Franchising is a great platform to help people diversify and get to their why,” Phalen said. He was a club manager at a 24 Hour Fitness location and a senior business development manager at Cornerstone Staffing, Inc.\n\n\n\nFor entrepreneurs considering franchising their brands, Phalen urges them to know why they want to do it. “When you look at franchising, understand the value of the franchise system that is established and seek experts in all the fields you would need to have your brand excel.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“To improve a brand’s development process, the more knowledge on the infrastructure that franchisors can provide up front the better,” says Phalen. “As a candidate, all the concepts you are shown work, which is why they are franchisable. Whoever gives you the best infrastructure to run a playbook and be as successful as possible will likely be the ideal choice.” &nbsp;",

        "description": "If you&#8217;ve ever wondered what version of ChromeOS you have, you&#8217;ll be glad to know that the answer to your query is a mere three clicks away. You can find that information by clicking into the system tray at the bottom right of your screen and then, clicking the gear icon at top of the settings shade. From there, click the &#8220;About ChromeOS&#8221; tab and you&#8217;ll be greeted with a few bits of information including the current software version of your ChromeOS device. \n\n\n\nAbout ChromeOS menu\n\n\nFor the average consumer, this is likely all the information you&#8217;ll ever need or want about ChromeOS software versions. Most of us only check the version when an update rolls out and our device has yet to take the update. Moreover, Google is currently working on a new UI feature that will report your channel and version directly inside the system settings tray. However, those that carry the daunting task of managing fleets of Chrome and ChromeOS devices are burdened with keeping track of releases on multiple channels for countless pieces of hardware. This becomes an even more difficult task when you consider the fact that some hardware gets updates sooner than others and other devices may be pinned to a specific version of Chrome or ChromeOS for various reasons. \n\n\n\nWhatever your reason for keeping track of releases, you&#8217;re likely aware of the fact that Google&#8217;s website for viewing the various channels of Chrome and ChromeOS isn&#8217;t exactly the most user-friendly thing in the world. Granted, the site did get an update recently that made it a bit easier on the eyes but the functionality and its usefulness are still lacking. That has led to one ingenious developer creating his own, third-party tracking website that aggregates multiple databases to report up-to-date releases for every Chrome and ChromeOS channel and more. \n\n\n\nWhen you are running ChromeOS fleet at &#x201C;Enterprise Scale&#x201D; one of the biggest challenges is understanding what versions your devices are on. And while you can control them using Enterprise management controls, knowing exactly what is available for which device is not always easy.Roy Thomas &#8211; flagthis.com\n\n\n\nThe site, flagthis.com, gives the current status of release and rollout for each channel of Chrome and ChromeOS and that includes the builds for LaCrOS and Webview versions of Chrome. (LaCrOS is the Linux version of Chrome that&#8217;s coming to Chromebooks and Webview is the stripped-down version of Chrome that displays webpages inside of Android.) \n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the rollout tracker, you&#8217;ll find an exhaustive list of ChromeOS devices and what version they should be on. This includes versions for the Stable channel as well as Beta, Dev, Canary, and the Extended Stable release. Unlike Google&#8217;s website which includes only device board names, this version tracker lists all of the ChromeOS devices along with their code names so you don&#8217;t have to poke around to figure out which base board you have. \n\n\n\nThis website is a powerful tool and it will even recognize which version of Chrome or ChromeOS you&#8217;re viewing the site with and that&#8217;s very cool. If this wasn&#8217;t robust enough, you&#8217;ll even find AUE(Auto Update Expiration) dates for all of the ChromeOS devices. Another useful tool that&#8217;s a must-have for admins but also very helpful for consumers because OEMs don&#8217;t regularly list that information on retail boxes. (They should. They just don&#8217;t.) \n\n\n\nIf you&#8217;re an IT admin that manages fleets of devices or you&#8217;re just a curious Chromie, this site is one that you should keep in your toolbox at all times. I highly recommend you bookmark this page and while you&#8217;re at it, check out the rest of the site. Flagthis.com is dedicated to Enterprise Chromebooks and we need more sites like these as well as more dedicated Chrome enthusiasts like Mr. Thomas. I tip my hat to you Roy and look forward to hearing more from flagthis.com. \n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "California's air regulator is poised to require all new cars sold in the state by 2035 to have zero emissions — a sweeping rule that could pave the way for other states to adopt the requirement, transforming the nation’s auto market.\nThe ban on new gas-powered vehicle sales — first announced by Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom nearly two years ago — would also require automakers to make sure that 35 percent of all new passenger cars sold by 2026 have no emissions, a threshold that would increase to 68 percent by 2030. About 16 percent of new cars sold in California so far this year have zero emissions, significantly higher than the national average of 6 percent.\n“This regulation is one of the most important efforts we have ever carried out to clean the air,” Liane Randolph, chair of the California Air Resources Board, told reporters on Wednesday.\nCalifornia has a special ability to set clean car rules under federal law, and typically sets more stringent and far-reaching rules than its federal counterpart. More than a dozen states are expected to adopt the zero emissions vehicle mandate soon, meaning the rule will cover roughly a third of the country’s auto market. That has the potential to make a significant dent in the amount of harmful greenhouse gas emissions from transportation, which currently surpass those from electricity.\nThe agency's rule would give teeth to Newsom’s September 2020 executive order, which first set the 2035 target.\nUnder the program, the agency would impose a civil penalty for cars sold in violation of the targets. It would use other means to enforce new requirements for durability or battery warranty, which are designed to keep zero emissions vehicles on the road long enough to make it to the used car market and reach a wider swath of the public.\nAutomakers have been mostly outwardly supportive of the program, with many of them investing in zero-emission vehicles. Toyota acknowledged California’s authority to set stringent vehicle rules in a letter to the air agency yesterday, a letter that Lauren Sanchez, Newsom’s climate adviser, characterized as “old foes coming on board.”\nDemand for zero-emission cars grew as gas prices spiked earlier this year, particularly in California. But even with the uptick in sales, they still remain less than 1 percent of all cars on U.S. roads.\nThe air agency has been refining the proposal for months. The latest changes to be presented to the board Thursday focus on strengthening durability requirements and encouraging automakers to participate in programs designed to reach lower-income Californians. Some environmental justice groups had urged the air agency to make participation mandatory, but it won’t be.",

        "description": "This story first appeared at ProPublica, and was co-published with The Baltimore Banner and Reno Gazette Journal. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.\n\n\n\nAs Nevada lawmakers heard public comment last year on a bill to ban ghost guns and the parts used to make them, a resident of the rural town of Dayton called into the hearing to offer his opinion. The privately made firearms are virtually untraceable because they lack a serial number and can be easily purchased online and assembled by people who otherwise wouldn’t be able to legally buy a gun.\n\n\n\n“I do not care if this bill passes or not,” said the man, who identified himself only as Loran Kelley. “I am just informing you that we, as Americans, just will not comply with it no matter what you do.”\n\n\n\nWhat he didn’t mention to the committee is that he owns a company called Polymer80, one of the country’s most prolific manufacturers of ghost gun kits and parts. His vow to defy such regulations is as much about principle as profit, even as thousands of untraceable guns bearing the P80 stamp have turned up at crime scenes from Los Angeles to Baltimore.\n\n\n\nAccording to court documents, the vast majority of ghost guns recovered by law enforcement nationwide are built from Polymer80 parts. That’s why Nevada lawmakers were debating the bill: Anti-gun violence advocates saw a unique opportunity to shut down the flow of ghost gun parts to the rest of the country by going after the source.\n\n\n\n“You can say you can’t possess an unserialized gun, but you need to be able to go up the supply chain if you want to stop this problem,” said David Pucino, deputy chief counsel for Giffords Law Center, who helped draft the Nevada legislation.\n\n\n\nNevada’s effort came as big city mayors across the country were beginning to grapple with an increase in crimes committed with Polymer80 guns. A handful of states had passed legislation restricting ghost guns. Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles had sued Polymer80, claiming the company was selling a product that violated their local gun control laws. And an additional four cities had sued the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, seeking to compel the agency to require manufacturers like Polymer80 to put serial numbers on core ghost gun components.\n\n\n\nAdvocates viewed the Nevada law as a potentially more effective tactic than the patchwork of efforts brought to bear so far.\n\n\n\nAnd it almost worked.\n\n\n\nThe Legislature passed Assembly Bill 286 on a party-line vote in May 2021. In seven months, when the new law took effect, Polymer80 would be out of the ghost gun kit-making business. At least in Nevada.\n\n\n\nBut thanks to a strategically chosen court venue in rural Nevada and with the help of the New York law firm Greenspoon Marder, Polymer80 won a decision vacating the section of law that would have halted its ghost gun business. While it is now illegal to assemble or possess a ghost gun in Nevada, it remains legal to possess and transport the components of a ghost gun.\n\n\n\nAs a result, the parts that some use to evade gun-control laws and others use to pursue their hobby of homemade gunmaking continue to flow from Polymer80 to the rest of the country.\n\n\n\nAnti-gun violence advocates say their court defeat in Nevada underlines the weakness of a state-by-state approach to closing the ghost gun loophole. They also noted that the bipartisan federal gun bill signed into law in June in response to a spate of mass shootings does nothing to address the problem of ghost guns.\n\n\n\n“The state level laws are really important but can only go so far,” Pucino said. “Really we need a federal solution.”\n\n\n\nKelley, who doesn’t trust the news media, rarely talks to reporters, despite his company’s increasingly high profile. But in an hourlong interview with ProPublica, Kelley described his remarks to lawmakers last year as “political grandstanding” and not a promise to break the ghost gun law. Still, it was a moment that portended Kelley’s victory in court.\n\n\n\n“I was pointing out a simple fact, ‘You can do whatever you want, but it’s not going to work,’” Kelley said. “And I was proven to be right.”\n\n\n\nBut Polymer80’s victory in the Nevada court does not obviate the legal threat it faces elsewhere, including lawsuits from big-city mayors trying to stem gun violence on their streets and a pair of deputies ambushed in their patrol car by an assailant wielding a Polymer80 ghost gun.\n\n\n\nIt’s a position that Kelley both relishes and resents. If it were up to him, he said, he’d focus on building his business and looking after his 50 or so employees. But he doesn’t shy away from a fight over his principles.\n\n\n\n“Polymer80 is on the front lines of protecting the Second Amendment rights of all Americans right now,” Kelley told ProPublica. “That’s not a brag. It’s just the reality because we’ve become the whipping boy for emotionally driven government policy.”\n\n\n\nBaltimore Mayor Brandon Scott is one of the city leaders who has sued Polymer80. The lawsuit is intended to hold the company accountable for the street violence perpetrated by people using Polymer80 kits to circumvent federal and state gun laws that require a background check to purchase a firearm and a license to own a handgun. Maryland law also prohibits the sale and manufacture of guns that aren’t included on the state’s handgun roster, which does not list those built with Polymer80 parts.\n\n\n\nScott said he first heard about ghost guns in 2018, when, as a City Council member, he was chair of the Public Safety Committee. That year, law enforcement confiscated nine unserialized firearms. Within three years, police were confiscating hundreds of the illegal weapons annually.\n\n\n\n“Once they arrived, they became a huge problem for us,” Scott told ProPublica. “They’ve been used in shootings, robberies, carjackings, murder. We’re seeing them run the gamut.”\n\n\n\nBaltimore police recently busted a ghost gun-making operation, arresting a man who had dozens of Polymer80 kits, Scott said. The man was a childhood friend of Scott’s.\n\n\n\nBut another incident made the issue even more personal for Scott. In January 2021, Dante Barksdale, an anti-violence activist beloved in Baltimore was shot nine times with a Polymer80 ghost gun. He died in the courtyard of an apartment building where he had a few weeks earlier delivered winter coats to families who live there.\n\n\n\n“Dante was like a brother to me,” Scott said. “His death really impacts everything that I do in the realm of public safety. If he were here today — he’s probably in the room with me right now — he would say, ‘You gotta go after the gun companies, too.’”\n\n\n\nThe rise of ghost gun crimes on Baltimore’s streets coincides with the growth of Polymer80’s business.\n\n\n\nKelley founded Polymer80 in 2013 with his father, Loran Kelley Sr., and their business partner David Borges, who recently retired from the company. Kelley’s father died in January. Polymer80 got its start in Vacaville, California. But Nevada, with its low taxes and friendly regulatory environment, beckoned, and the company moved here a year later.\n\n\n\nIn 2016, Polymer80 became a licensed firearm manufacturer, allowing it to produce traditional firearms that comply with the Federal Gun Control Act. But the larger part of its business is the production of so-called unfinished frames, the lower part of a handgun, including the pistol grip and trigger guard, onto which the firing mechanism and related components are fitted. The company also makes unfinished receivers, the base component of a rifle, such as an AR-15.\n\n\n\nFederal law requires completed frames and receivers to be stamped with serial numbers. To avoid that requirement, Polymer80 designed “unfinished” frames, which are about 80% complete. The frame and remaining components can easily be assembled into a functioning firearm. In 2015, Polymer80 began sending samples of its unfinished frames to the ATF, which agreed the part did not require a serial number.\n\n\n\n“Our strategy always has been to be very open and candid with the ATF and the government,” Kelley said. “We’ve always been proactive with sending the ATF information on our products and we just operate above board.”\n\n\n\nBusiness took off. Between January 2019 and October 2020, for example, Polymer80 shipped nearly 52,000 items to customers across the country, according to court documents.\n\n\n\nBut as Polymer80 grew, so did the number of privately assembled firearms police were recovering at crime scenes. Just as Baltimore experienced an increase in ghost gun recoveries starting in 2016, so too did Washington, D.C., and Los Angeles. Nationally, according to ATF published numbers, the number of ghost guns recovered by law enforcement jumped to 19,344 in 2021 from 1,758 in 2016. The vast majority of those guns were assembled with Polymer80 parts, according to court documents.\n\n\n\nGhost guns haven’t been involved in the latest high profile mass shootings, such as in Uvalde, Texas; Highland Park, Illinois; or Buffalo, New York, which each involved legally obtained AR-15-style weapons. But mayors in the cities that have either sued Polymer80 or asked the ATF to close its ghost gun loophole — Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Los Angeles, New York — argue they’re increasingly common in street violence. Ghost guns have been used in school shootings by teenagers too young to legally buy firearms in New Mexico, Arizona, Maryland and California. In 2020, two Los Angeles County deputies sitting in their patrol car were shot — one in the face, one in the arm — by a man with a ghost gun. Both survived but sustained grievous injuries. A lawsuit they filed against Polymer80 is pending in Los Angeles County Superior Court, as is the lawsuit filed by the city of Los Angeles on behalf of the people of California.\n\n\n\nAlthough the ATF gave Polymer80 the go-ahead to sell unfinished frames without serial numbers, the company started to market a kit — called Buy, Build, Shoot — that included both the unfinished frame and other parts needed to quickly assemble a complete firearm. The ATF never gave Polymer80 explicit approval to sell these complete kits without complying with serial number and background check requirements.\n\n\n\nPucino, the deputy chief counsel for Giffords Law Center, said Polymer80 is exploiting loopholes to enable its customers to evade gun control laws, including age requirements for gun purchases.\n\n\n\n“Their whole business model, which makes them different from, say, Glock, is they evade restrictions,” he said.\n\n\n\nIn late 2020, investigators with the ATF concluded that Polymer80’s kits likely violated the Federal Gun Control Act and launched a raid on the Dayton manufacturing plant in December 2020. According to the search warrant affidavit, investigators found evidence Polymer80 shipped gun parts to individuals whose criminal backgrounds prohibit them from owning firearms and to individuals in foreign countries. (Polymer80’s website previously said the company has “a strict policy against selling 80% lower receivers to persons known to us to be convicted felons or otherwise prohibited persons.” That language was recently removed.)\n\n\n\nAlthough the affidavit was made public, the federal court has resealed the case, meaning the results of the raid and any subsequent actions aren’t public. ATF spokesperson Ginger Colbrun said she couldn’t comment on the case because the investigation remains active.\n\n\n\nKelley wouldn’t comment on the specifics of the ATF investigation, but he pointed to the fact no one from his company has been arrested following the raid as an indication Polymer80 hasn’t broken the law.\n\n\n\n“We are still talking to them about that,” he said. “We have a positive set of conversations going on.”\n\n\n\nKelley vehemently disagrees with the assertion his company tries to exploit loopholes, saying the company does nothing but comply with the law. He describes his customers as hobbyists and homemade-gun enthusiasts engaging in a centuries-old practice of building their own firearms.\n\n\n\n“Polymer80 has always been a law-abiding company and always will be,” he said, noting it hasn’t sold any ghost gun parts to Nevadans since the 2021 law — which still prohibits possessing a complete ghost gun. “What’s going on is people in power realizing people have always had a right to do this and they don’t like it.”\n\n\n\nPolymer80 wants to succeed through legal means, Kelley said. That wouldn’t be possible if all his customers were criminals.\n\n\n\n“It would be a really, really stupid business model to cater specifically to criminals, and I would find such a practice to be deplorable,” he said.\n\n\n\nIt’s not hobbyists using Polymer80 guns on the streets of Baltimore, Scott said.\n\n\n\n“That is the most ludicrous thing and ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard,” Scott said. “Their business model explicitly targets purchasers seeking to evade law enforcement or who can’t obtain a gun from a licensed dealer.”\n\n\n\nAfter the 2021 ghost gun law passed in Nevada, Polymer80 hired the New York City law firm Greenspoon Marder to file the lawsuit in Yerington, an onion farming town that’s the seat of the county that’s home to Polymer80. One of the firm’s managing partners, James McGuire, traveled to Yerington to argue before Judge John Schlegelmilch that the law was written so vaguely it would be impossible to enforce and would be ripe for abuse.\n\n\n\nMcGuire said in an email he no longer represents Polymer80 and referred questions to another lawyer at the firm, who didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\n\n\nIn court, McGuire argued the law failed to define key terms such as “receiver” and “frame,” and used “murky and undefined terms” to explain what an “unfinished receiver” is. He also argued the law doesn’t specify when in the manufacturing process an unfinished receiver actually becomes a receiver.\n\n\n\nDuring two hearings on the lawsuit, Schlegelmilch seemed to have little patience with the state’s argument that the law relies on industry-specific terms that are well understood by Polymer80. Instead the judge agreed with McGuire that the law didn’t adequately define an unfinished receiver. At one point he asked whether his 5-year-old’s rubber band gun could be considered an unfinished receiver simply because it looks like a gun.\n\n\n\n“What if I’m at home, and I’m machining a piece of wood. OK? And my 5-year-old wants a rubber band gun. OK? So, I take that piece of wood, I turn it, I make it into — you know, I take a band saw, and I cut out what looks like a firearm. And I put a couple of sticks on it so that you can put a rubber band on it when you push it up. You’ve seen a rubber band gun before, right? So, is that mostly completed?”\n\n\n\n“I mean, a rubber band gun’s not a firearm,” responded the state’s attorney, Greg Zunino. “I don&#8217;t think you would ever be prosecuted under that scenario because you still have to have an intent to turn something into a firearm.”\n\n\n\nSchlegelmilch ruled in favor of Polymer80 and enjoined the state from enforcing the section of the law that prohibited the possession and sale of unfinished frames and receivers. Schlegelmilch let stand the rest of the law, which Polymer80 didn’t challenge and prohibits the possession of a completed ghost gun.\n\n\n\nThe state has appealed Schlegelmilch’s ruling to the Nevada Supreme Court.\n\n\n\nSchlegelmilch declined an interview request because the appeal is pending.\n\n\n\nKelley declined to comment on the decision to file the lawsuit on his home turf in Lyon County.\n\n\n\nOther courts have ruled differently.\n\n\n\nA similar lawsuit filed in federal court in Reno the same month was quickly tossed by a judge who decided the law “is a valid exercise of the government’s police power.”\n\n\n\n“What happened here, with the state court being more successful for them, indicates politics and ideology within the judiciary,” Pucino said.\n\n\n\nThis month, a judge in Washington, D.C., found Polymer80 sold illegal firearms in the district and ordered it to pay $4 million in penalties.\n\n\n\nThe ATF is also seeking to impose a new rule that would require unfinished receivers and frames to include a serial number — one of the federal strategies that Pucino said would be more effective than a state-by-state approach. The new rule, seen as a way to close the ghost gun loophole, is set to take effect on Aug. 24, but it faces at least three lawsuits from the ghost gun industry seeking to block its implementation.\n\n\n\nMcGuire, the lawyer who represented Polymer80, authored a 27-page public comment submission on the new rule arguing, in part, that it’s impermissibly vague, the same argument that he used successfully to stop the Nevada law.\n\n\n\nTo some, there’s an easy solution: Polymer80 could stamp serial numbers on the unfinished frames and receivers they sell.\n\n\n\nKelley said putting a serial number on his products wouldn’t hurt his company. But using those numbers to require background checks is a “critical threat” to his business, which he said relies on a growing market of individuals who “value their Fourth Amendment rights” to privacy.\n\n\n\n“There’s a problem when people’s right to privacy is infringed and a government agency is looking at what you bought whenever they want,” he said.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA recent national poll conducted by progressive think tank Data for Progress found 60 percent of 1,425 respondents agreed the federal government should eliminate all or some student loan debt for every borrower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe poll found more than half of past student loan borrowers and voters who never borrowed student loans believed some or all student debt should be eliminated.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrevious polling, however, showed a much narrower majority of Americans support the Biden administration’s plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRecent polling suggests the majority of American voters may be in favor of the Biden administration’s decision to forgive billions of dollars of student loan debt for low to middle-income borrowers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Biden on Wednesday announced his administration is forgiving up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 annually and $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients. The unprecedented decision will provide some financial relief to tens of millions of borrowers while about 15 million borrowers could see their entire balances eliminated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA recent national poll conducted by progressive think tank Data for Progress just before Biden’s announcement found 60 percent of 1,425 respondents agreed the federal government should eliminate all or some student loan debt for every borrower, compared to 34 percent who said the government should not forgive the loans and 6 percent who said they didn’t know. The poll was conducted August 19-21 online and has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlong party lines, 81 percent of Democrats were in favor of canceling at least some student loan debt compared to 45 percent of Republicans who said the same. The poll found more than half of past student loan borrowers and voters who never borrowed student loans believed some or all student debt should be eliminated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration is also extending the pandemic-related pause on student loan payments that was scheduled to expire at the end of August. The federal moratorium will be extended for a sixth and final time. Payments will resume January 2023 after more than two years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen asked about the pause, 63 percent of respondents said they supported it compared to 32 percent who were opposed. Of those who never took out student loans, 58 percent supported the moratorium while 35 percent opposed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrevious polling, however, showed a much narrower majority of Americans support the Biden administration’s plans. An NPR-Ipsos poll in June of 1,022 Americans found 55 percent of Americans support up to $10,000 of relief per borrower, but support dropped as financial relief increased. A YouGov poll and a Morning Consult-Politico poll found 51 percent of respondents were in favor of $10,000 in forgiveness.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA CNBC poll released this week also found 59 percent of Americans worried forgiving student loan debt could make inflation worse.&nbsp;",

None. Zero. Not one single bit,” Biden said in response to a question from reporters following an event on student debt relief. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s remarks are consistent with those of other White House officials, but they are significant because they represent his first public comments on the Mar-a-Lago search since Aug. 8, the date the FBI's warrant was executed. \n\n\n\nThe White House has sought to distance itself from the Department of Justice (DOJ) investigation into Trump and classified documents that were allegedly taken to Mar-a-Lago and kept there after he left office. White House officials have stressed that the Justice Department is conducting its investigation free of any political interference.  \n\n\n\nThe White House also said it did not have advance notice of Attorney General Merrick Garland’s press conference earlier this month during which he disclosed that the DOJ was moving to unseal the search warrant related to the case. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublicans, meanwhile, have attacked the department and accused it of political motivations in the decision to search Trump’s property. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden has kept a low profile in the weeks since the search, in large part because they coincided with his summer vacation to South Carolina and Delaware.

        "description": "Photograph by Scott Etkin.\nBy Scott Etkin and Lisa Kava\nKwame Onwuachi, recipient of the James Beard Award for “Rising Star Chef” in 2019, is opening a new, as yet unnamed restaurant on the ground floor of David Geffen Hall at Lincoln Center this fall, The New York Times reported. “This will be my love letter to NYC with an Afro Caribbean touch,” Onwuachi wrote on Instagram. Onwuachi is known for his time on the TV show “Top Chef” and for his previous Washington, D.C restaurants, Shaw Bijou and Kith/Kin.\nRaised in the Bronx, Onwuachi also spent time in Nigeria growing up. In his autobiography, Notes from a Young Black Chef, he tells the story of how he overcame poverty and racism in his rise through the ranks of fine dining. Though he was expelled from college for selling drugs, he eventually enrolled in the Culinary Institute of America and began working in the top restaurants in NYC, before going on to lead his own kitchens. (Thanks to Julie for the tip.)\nPhotograph by Indhira Ortega.\nPico de Gallo Bar &amp; Kitchen, a Mexican restaurant, opened on August 17 at 768 Amsterdam between 97th and 98th Streets. The space, formerly Guacamole Restaurant, is under new management and has a new menu. One of the three co-owners, Austria Rodriguez, grew up in the neighborhood about 10 blocks away from the restaurant, and the other two, Indhira Ortega and Ingry Rodrigues grew up in Washington Heights. The three women are all originally from the Dominican Republic and have been friends for 15 years. \n“We are still a Mexican restaurant with a full bar (we are waiting on our liquor license) and we revamped the menu as well as the space,” Austria told West Side Rag. “We reimagined the patio with a hanging flowers theme. We kept many of the Guacamole employees, including the chef.” A website will be up and running soon. (Thanks to Emily for the tip.) \nPhotograph by Lisa Kava.\nLululemon, the yoga apparel company, closed its store on the corner of 75th and Broadway on August 21. “Thank you for 10 unforgettable years!” read a sign on the storefront. While the company opened a location nearby on 70th and Columbus in May, it also closed its original Upper West Side Lululemon at 1928 Broadway (at 64th Street) in October 2021. That store and the one on Broadway at 75th were among the earliest Lululemon stores to open in NYC, a clerk at the 70th and Columbus location told WSR. The newest location has an “updated, current vibe,” the clerk said. (Thanks to Gretchen and Mindi for the tips.) \nPhotograph by Scott Etkin.\nCrumbl Cookies, a chain with 300 bakeries in 36 states, is “coming soon” to the corner of 74th and Columbus, taking the place of an HSBC Bank. Crumbl was founded by two cousins in Utah in 2017 when one was attending Utah State University. They started with fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies and then added a rotating menu of other flavors. Featured cookies now include: red velvet cupcake, strawberry shortcake, mallow sandwich, and cinnamon frybread. (Thanks to John for the tip.)\nPhotograph by Scott Etkin.\nTeam 7, a German kitchen furniture store, is moving to make way for the Morton Williams Supermarket being built on Broadway between 68th and 69th Street. “After 12 years of being in the neighborhood, we appreciate you trusting us with your spaces,” read a sign posted on the storefront. Team 7 will be consolidating with the existing German Kitchen Center location around the corner at 191 Amsterdam between 68th and 69th. \nPhotograph by Scott Etkin.\nMega Building Supply, a hardware store, is now open on the west side of Broadway between 87th and 88th Streets. “We are not your typical cluttered hardware store,” Sol Goldberg, the owner, told the Rag. “We are a beautiful space which is ‘shoppable’ and customer friendly.” Their hours are Monday to Friday from 8:30am to 6pm and Sunday from 10am to 5pm. The space was formerly occupied by The Bar Method, an exercise studio. \nExotic Smoke Shop is replacing Matsu Sushi on Columbus and 83rd Street.",

        "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html",
        "description": "Donie O’Sullivan, Clare Duffy and Brian Fung, reporting for CNN Business yesterday:\n\n\n  The disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies,\npaints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a\nmismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the\nplatform’s central controls and most sensitive information without\nadequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company’s\nsenior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter’s\nserious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees\nmay be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is\nPeiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was previously the company’s head of\nsecurity, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges\nthat Twitter’s leadership has misled its own board and government\nregulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that\ncould allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation,\nhacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also\nalleges Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data after they\ncancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost\ntrack of the information, and that it has misled regulators about\nwhether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The\nwhistleblower also says Twitter executives don’t have the\nresources to fully understand the true number of bots on the\nplatform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become\ncentral to Elon Musk’s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal\nto buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk’s claims). [...]\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko’s lawyer, told\nCNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko\nbegan the whistleblower process before there was any indication of\nMusk’s involvement with Twitter.\n\n\nZatko was fired from Twitter in January this year “for ineffective leadership and poor performance”, in the words of a Twitter spokesperson. CNN’s report is very long, and worth reading in full. If even partially true, what Zatko is alleging is extremely alarming.\n\nOne point seems clear: even if Zatko has not been in contact with Elon Musk — and I don’t see any reason to doubt Zatko’s lawyer’s clear statement that he has not — that doesn’t mean Musk hasn’t been made aware of Zatko’s whistleblower report. Anyone inside Twitter aware of Zatko’s concerns could have leaked them to Musk. Jack Dorsey, for example, personally hired Zatko and was CEO until just a few weeks before Zatko’s firing. Musk’s allegations about Twitter misreporting bot activity might be fully legitimate, not an empty pretext for backing out of his acquisition.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "description": "Oh, wow, this ain’t good. | Charles LeClaire-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Yeah, yeah, Cruz’s record-breaking exit velocity, but the swarm began with Josh Vanmeter’s errors I have noted this before, but it bears repeating: Every time someone notes that something’s never happened, it invariably happens.\nThis time, it was Greg Brown invoking that in the long history of Pirates/Braves, going all the way back to when the Pirates were the Alleghenys and the Braves were the Boston Beaneaters, the Braves had never swept a series against the Pirates.\nI was mentally hissing “shut up, Brownie,’ because let’s be honest, we all saw this coming.\nWe really did mean to put up a recap of last night’s game, but things fell through the cracks. You can guess the outcome if you didn’t watch.\nAnd yes, the Braves completed their first-ever sweep of the Pirates at PNC Park to the point that announcers Greg Brown and Matt Capps were talking about everything but the game and even got in what could be perceived as digs on current ownership and management towards the end. That tends to happen when you drop the last game of a series 14-2.\nMitch Keller wasn’t awful; he was just not sharp against a very good team, and they made him pay. Not that current scapegoat Josh Vanmeter helped, with two very dumb errors in the fourth that opened the Braves’ scoring floodgates. I have a theory that management is making sure Bligh Madris is on solid ground at first base before DFAing Vanmeter, and I’m sticking by that.\nThe cherry on the blowout sundae was Matt Olson’s grand slam in the eighth inning off Cam “Dude, I Forgot You Were Still On The Team” Vieux.\nNot that there weren’t any Pirates highlights. This is the one that trended on Twitter:\n\n\nOneil Cruz hit this 122.4 mph  That's the hardest hit ball in the Statcast era!!! pic.twitter.com/soAi7qKaCE— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) August 24, 2022\n\n\n\nThis was only a single, lest you get too excited. Exit velocity really means nothing and I honestly doubt this was the hardest ball ever hit, just the hardest after someone decided that exit velocity should be recorded. I am old, I have the right to think this is a dumb stat. My younger colleagues would undoubtedly—and vociferously—disagree. \nThe only Pirates offense came, as it often has this season, in the ninth. Kevin Newman hit his first homer of the season—and first in nearly a year—to at least ensure the Pirates wouldn’t be shut out. Ben Gamel singled, and Ke’bryan Hayes doubled to bring him home. Fittingly, Vanmeter flied out to end the misery game.\nI don’t know which coach’s head is going to roll first, but if you’re a betting person, you might want to put money on Oscar Marin. You probably wouldn’t go wrong with Andy Haines either.",

        "description": "Analysis of sawfish fossils may help clarify the evolution of teeth.\nDid they evolve from body scales that migrated into the mouths of ancient vertebrates and became adapted for eating—an idea known as the &#8220;outside-in&#8221; hypothesis?\nOr did they evolve independent of scales, originating deep within the oral cavity and ultimately mounting onto the jaws—known as the &#8220;inside-out&#8221; hypothesis? A new study provides evidence for the &#8220;outside-in&#8221; hypothesis.\nAccording to vertebrate paleontologist Todd Cook, associate professor of biology at Penn State Behrend, the team didn&#8217;t set out to contribute to the debate about the origins of teeth. Instead, he and his colleagues were studying the tissue structure of rostral denticles, which are the jagged spikes that run along the elongated snouts of sawsharks and sawfishes. The animals use them in foraging and self-defense.\nCook, lead author of the study in the Journal of Anatomy, notes that sawfishes belong to the same group as skates and rays and are closely related to sharks.\nThe team examined the fossilized rostral denticles of Ischyrhiza mira, a species belonging to an extinct group of sawfishes that lived in North American waters during the late Cretaceous period, around 100 to 65 million years ago. The samples had previously been recovered from a rock formation in New Jersey.\n&#8220;Rostral denticles are believed to be modified scales because of their location on the elongated snout and they have an external morphology and developmental pattern that&#8217;s similar to scales,&#8221; says Cook, who explains that, just like with scales found elsewhere on the body, for a new rostral denticle to form, an old one must first fall off and make a space available.\n&#8220;Yet, very little was known about the organization of the tissues that make up rostral denticles, particularly the hard outermost layer known as enameloid.\nA cross section of a rostral denticle showing the bundled enameloid. (Credit: Todd Cook/Penn State/Wiley Publications)\n&#8220;Given that rostral denticles are likely specialized body scales, we hypothesized that the enameloid of rostral denticles would exhibit a similar structure to the enameloid of body scales, which have simple microcrystal organization.&#8221;\nTo examine the internal microstructure of the fossil rostral denticles, the researchers hand sectioned the samples, both transversely—across the width—and longitudinally—across the length. Next, they used a scanning electron microscope to study the histology—or microscopic anatomy—of the rostral denticles.\n&#8220;Surprisingly, Ischyrhiza mira&#8217;s rostral denticle enameloid was anything but simple; it was considerably more complex than the enameloid of body scales,&#8221; says Cook. &#8220;In fact, the overall organization of the enameloid in this ancient sawfish resembled that of modern shark tooth enameloid, which has been well-characterized.&#8221;\nSpecifically, he notes that both Ischyrhiza mira rostral denticles and modern shark teeth have an enameloid covering that largely consists of fluorapatite microcrystals packed together into distinct bundles. Towards the outer region of the enameloid, these bundles run parallel to the surface of the tooth and are called the &#8220;parallel bundled enameloid.&#8221; Deeper, the bundles become randomly arranged, a region known as the &#8220;tangled bundled enameloid.&#8221; Finally, passing through these layers is the &#8220;radial bundled enameloid,&#8221; which is composed of packed microcrystals oriented perpendicular to the tooth surface.\nIn terms of function, Cook explains that having bundles of microcrystals arranged in various orientations enables shark teeth to resist the mechanical stresses associated with feeding. Similarly, he notes, &#8220;It is likely that the bundled microcrystal arrangement of the enameloid of Ischyrhiza mira&#8217;s rostral denticles also served as a way to withstand mechanical forces.&#8221;\nHowever, the most surprising and consequential outcome of this study is that it makes an important contribution to the long-standing debate regarding the origin of teeth, says Cook. Specifically, he explains, &#8220;This finding provides direct evidence supporting the &#8216;outside-in&#8217; hypothesis, as it shows that scales have the capacity to evolve a complex tooth-like enameloid outside of the mouth. It is more parsimonious to suggest that scales produced a similar bundled microstructure in teeth and rostral denticles than to conclude that both these structures evolved a similar enameloid independently.&#8221;\nA Penn State Behrend Undergraduate Research Grant supported this research.\nSource: Penn State\nThe post Sawfish fossils hold clues to origin of teeth appeared first on Futurity.",

Initiating the AR experience puts a black hole in the\ncenter of the room, which then shows stars in the shape of an\nApple logo as you approach.\n\nThe stars continue to coalesce in and out of an Apple logo\nshape, and you can use pinch gestures to adjust the size of the\nblack hole.\n\nTo view the AR experience, open up the Events website on an\niPhone or iPad and tap on the Apple logo.\n\n\nOne possible reading of the “Far Out” theme is that they’ll be previewing a product — the AR/VR headset — that isn’t coming until next year, like when they pre-announced Apple Watch in September 2014. Or perhaps, as often seems to be the case, the “Far Out” name is just a name and signifies nothing.\n\nUpdate: Also worth noting: the event is scheduled to be held in the Steve Jobs Theater. (To be pedantic, the invitation says at the Steve Jobs Theater, not in, but if they were holding the media event outside, like the WWDC keynote, I’m pretty sure they’d say the event was at Apple Park, not Steve Jobs Theater. WWDC media invitations made no mention of Steve Jobs Theater, even though the hands-on area was held in the theater’s upstairs atrium.) Attendees must provide proof of a negative COVID-19 test, but otherwise, it sounds like Apple’s events are going back to normal. Or perhaps we’re beginning the new “normal” — I wouldn’t be surprised if more of the event is prerecorded than performed live on stage.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://www.cnn.com/2022/08/23/tech/twitter-whistleblower-peiter-zatko-security/index.html",
        "description": "Donie O’Sullivan, Clare Duffy and Brian Fung, reporting for CNN Business yesterday:\n\n\n  The disclosure, sent last month to Congress and federal agencies,\npaints a picture of a chaotic and reckless environment at a\nmismanaged company that allows too many of its staff access to the\nplatform’s central controls and most sensitive information without\nadequate oversight. It also alleges that some of the company’s\nsenior-most executives have been trying to cover up Twitter’s\nserious vulnerabilities, and that one or more current employees\nmay be working for a foreign intelligence service.\n\nThe whistleblower, who has agreed to be publicly identified, is\nPeiter “Mudge” Zatko, who was previously the company’s head of\nsecurity, reporting directly to the CEO. Zatko further alleges\nthat Twitter’s leadership has misled its own board and government\nregulators about its security vulnerabilities, including some that\ncould allegedly open the door to foreign spying or manipulation,\nhacking and disinformation campaigns. The whistleblower also\nalleges Twitter does not reliably delete users’ data after they\ncancel their accounts, in some cases because the company has lost\ntrack of the information, and that it has misled regulators about\nwhether it deletes the data as it is required to do. The\nwhistleblower also says Twitter executives don’t have the\nresources to fully understand the true number of bots on the\nplatform, and were not motivated to. Bots have recently become\ncentral to Elon Musk’s attempts to back out of a $44 billion deal\nto buy the company (although Twitter denies Musk’s claims). [...]\n\nJohn Tye, founder of Whistleblower Aid and Zatko’s lawyer, told\nCNN that Zatko has not been in contact with Musk, and said Zatko\nbegan the whistleblower process before there was any indication of\nMusk’s involvement with Twitter.\n\n\nZatko was fired from Twitter in January this year “for ineffective leadership and poor performance”, in the words of a Twitter spokesperson. CNN’s report is very long, and worth reading in full. If even partially true, what Zatko is alleging is extremely alarming.\n\nOne point seems clear: even if Zatko has not been in contact with Elon Musk — and I don’t see any reason to doubt Zatko’s lawyer’s clear statement that he has not — that doesn’t mean Musk hasn’t been made aware of Zatko’s whistleblower report. Anyone inside Twitter aware of Zatko’s concerns could have leaked them to Musk. Jack Dorsey, for example, personally hired Zatko and was CEO until just a few weeks before Zatko’s firing. Musk’s allegations about Twitter misreporting bot activity might be fully legitimate, not an empty pretext for backing out of his acquisition.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "description": "The Justice Department has released a long-sought legal memo arguing that then-President Donald Trump’s actions during special counsel Robert Mueller’s Trump-Russia investigation did not warrant prosecution for obstruction of justice, even if a president was susceptible to criminal charges while in office.\nIn the nine-page memo disclosed Wednesday, two of the most senior officials in the Justice Department advised then-Attorney General William Barr that Trump’s threats to fire Mueller and his various public and private outbursts against witnesses he viewed as hostile or unhelpful to him didn’t amount to the sort of case prosecutors would bring under their established standards.\n“Having reviewed the Report in light of the governing legal principles, and the Principles of Federal Prosecution, we conclude that none of those instances would warrant a prosecution for obstruction of justice, without regard to the constitutional constraint on bringing such an action against a sitting president,” the assistant attorney general for the Office of Legal Counsel, Steven Engel, and Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Edward O’Callaghan wrote in the March 24, 2019, memo.\nThe Justice Department fought release of the memo for years, arguing that it was part of a deliberative process advising Barr on what to do in response to Mueller’s report. However, judges concluded that at the time the memo was written, Barr had already decided not to charge Trump, so the issues hashed out in the memo were theoretical and not linked to any pending decision.\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal watchdog group, filed suit under the Freedom of Information Act three years ago in an effort to make the memo public.\nThe Justice Department lost the first round in the access case in front of a District Court judge, who ruled that the agency’s claims that the memo was part of some kind of charging decision was “disingenuous” because that decision had already been made.\nOn appeal, department lawyers changed course and argued that the memo helped shape the public statements Barr would give to explain why he concluded the evidence was insufficient to support a criminal charge — even if Trump were not president.\nHowever, a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals panel ruled last week that argument about the memo being part of deliberations around a communications effort was surfaced too belatedly to be considered.\nThe Justice Department had the option to ask the full bench of the D.C. Circuit to rehear the case or to seek review at the Supreme Court, but officials indicated Wednesday that they’d decided to pass up those options.\nIn the memo that triggered the disclosure fight, Engel and O’Callaghan concluded that Trump’s conduct primarily reflected a frustration with the Mueller probe and what he perceived to be the politics behind it, as well as news reports they said Trump genuinely believed were flawed. They also suggested that Trump’s exhortations to some of his top allies against “flipping” were meant to prevent them from delivering false testimony — not to conceal the truth.\nThe officials repeatedly underscored that Mueller had not found sufficient evidence to charge any underlying crime, which they said weighed against the possibility that Trump had violated the obstruction statutes.\n“In the absence of an underlying offense, the most compelling inference in evaluating the President’s conduct is that he reasonably believed that the Special Counsel’s investigation was interfering with his governing agenda,” Engel and O’Callaghan wrote.\nEngel would later become a key point of resistance to Trump’s effort to use the Justice Department to help subvert the 2020 election. Engel was one of three Trump-era Justice Department witnesses to testify at a public hearing of the Jan. 6 select committee and discussed his threat to resign, along with other top department officials, if Trump had gone through with a plan to replace the department’s leadership with figures who would support his attempts to stay in power.\nAn Office of Legal Counsel opinion issued in 1973 — and reaffirmed in 2000 — concluded that federal criminal charges were impermissible while a president is in office.\nHowever, some legal advocates have urged Attorney General Merrick Garland to revisit Barr’s decision not to charge Trump. They note that the Justice Department has generally taken the view that former presidents could be subject to prosecution for acts committed while in office, although it has never happened.",

        "description": "Twitter’s former security chief, who alleged the company has major security deficiencies in a bombshell whistleblower disclosure, will testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee in September, the committee said Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe whistleblower, Peiter “Mudge” Zatko, will participate in a hearing aimed at examining the allegations of security failures at Twitter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Mr. Zatko’s allegations of widespread security failures and foreign state actor interference at Twitter raise serious concerns.&nbsp; If these claims are accurate, they may show dangerous data privacy and security risks for Twitter users around the world,” Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and ranking member Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in&nbsp;a joint statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The Senate Judiciary Committee will investigate this issue further with a full Committee hearing this work period, and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations,” the senators added.\n\n\n\nIn an 84-page disclosure, published by The Washington Post on Tuesday, Zatko alleged Twitter has not been complying with a 2011 consent order from the Federal Trade Commission that called for the company to create and maintain a security program designed to protect privacy and nonpublic consumer information.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZatko also alleged the platform is vulnerable to exploitation by foreign governments.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwitter has pushed back strongly on Zatko’s allegations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“What we’ve seen so far is a false narrative about Twitter and our privacy and data security practices that is riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies and lacks important context,” a Twitter spokesperson said in a statement Tuesday. “Mr. Zatko’s allegations and opportunistic timing appear designed to capture attention and inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders.”\n\n\n\nThe complaint in part references a back-and-forth between Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal and Elon Musk, the Tesla CEO who is trying to back out of his deal to buy Twitter for $44 billion.\n\n\n\nMusk has accused Twitter of not providing information about the number of spam bots on the platform, an accusation the platform has pushed back on.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZatko accused the Twitter CEO of misleading Musk and the public about the number of spam accounts on the platform and how the platform counts them.&nbsp;",

Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost 25 percent of workers between the ages of 35 to 44 said they would likely be quiet quitters in a recent survey from Resume Builder.\n\n\n\n“For a lot of people, it's another way of saying they have health boundaries,” said leadership author and speaker Selena Rezvani in a TikTok video.&nbsp;“It means doing what you are paid to do and not sacrificing your wellbeing in order to do more.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nQuiet quitting can look like not taking on extra responsibilities such as serving on a volunteer committee at work or refusing to work more hours than you are paid for, Rezvani explains in the video.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother example of quiet quitting is choosing to physically distance yourself from work, such as closing a laptop or stepping away from a desk, as soon as a work shift is over, she added.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut what really encapsulates quiet quitting is the rejection of “hustle culture” where people believe that they will be given promotions, better pay, or better benefits for working beyond the confines of their job.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Quiet quitting is the natural evolution of extreme hustle culture,” said self-described “leadership guru” Robyn L Garrett, on TikTok.\n\n\n\n“We all knew the whole time that what we were doing was unsustainable...Everybody knew...people have realized that they are giving and giving and giving without getting in return.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD MORE STORIES FROM CHANGING AMERICA\n\n\n\nENTIRE POLICE DEPARTMENT RESIGNS IN MISSOURI\n\n\n\nUN CALLS FOR US, OTHERS TO END 'IMPUNITY' FOR POLICE VIOLENCE AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE\n\n\n\nRACIAL CONTROVERSY ERUPTS AROUND ROYALS AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE\n\n\n\nPRINCIPAL ESCORTED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION AFTER DELIVERING FIERY SPEECH",

        "description": "The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) announced Wednesday that its new rule going after so-called \"ghost guns\" has gone into effect. \n\n\n\nThe rule is intended to stop the proliferation of ghost guns — firearms privately made or put together through gun kits that are generally hard to trace. \n\n\n\nThe new rule states that firearms made from parts kits that can be readily converted into functional weapons, or the \"frames\" or \"receivers\" of weapons, are subject to the same regulations as other guns. \n\n\n\nThe new rule requires that retailers run background checks before selling parts kits that someone could use to assemble a firearm, clarifies the definition of frame or receiver and identifies which parts of the firearm must be marked with a serial number. \n\n\n\nThe rule also requires that gun retailers and gunsmiths add a serial number to guns printed on 3D printers or any nonserialized firearms they accept for resale or purchase. \n\n\n\nThe time for which gun retailers must retain records has also been increased from two decades to the entire time in which the retailers are licensed. The Justice Department noted that ATF had been unable to trace many firearms that were reportedly used in homicides and violent crime due to the destruction of records after 20 years.\n\n\n\n“This rule will make it harder for criminals and other prohibited persons to obtain untraceable guns. It will help to ensure that law enforcement officers can retrieve the information they need to solve crimes. And it will help reduce the number of untraceable firearms flooding our communities,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. \n\n\n\nJustice Department statistics show that nearly 24,000 ghost guns were recovered by law enforcement at crime scenes and reported to the government from 2016 to 2020. It is hard to say how many are circulating on the streets, in part because in many cases police departments don’t contact the government about the guns because they can’t be traced.\n\n\n\nSome states, like California, have previously enacted laws in recent years to require serial numbers to be stamped on ghost guns.",

Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut Black Americans and Latinos only made up 14 percent and 17 percent of PrEP users.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, white Americans, who represented 26 percent of new HIV diagnoses in 2021, accounted for 65 percent of PrEP users, data show.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere are multiple reasons behind the disparity in PrEP use, according to Carl Schmid, the executive director of the HIV + Hepatitis Policy Institute, but lack of community outreach and issues with having the drugs fully covered by all insurances are part of the problem.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nData from AIDSvu also shows that PrEP use was lower in states that did not expand Medicaid access prior to 2021. In those states, which are mostly concentrated in the southern United States, PrEP use was about 1.5 times lower than in states where Medicaid was expanded.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nData also show that younger people have a greater unmet need for PrEP than older Americans. According to AIDSvu, people between the ages of 13 and 24 years old had the greatest unmet need for the medication making up only 13 percent of PrEP users but 20 percent of new HIV diagnoses.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile data shows that the overall number of PrEP users grew by 100,000 from 2019 to 2021 that rate of growth was much lower than in prior years.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver 700,000 people have died of HIV since the virus was first reported in the United States in 1981 and about 1.2 million people are currently living with the disease, according to the Ending the HIV Epidemic in the U.S initiative. About 13 percent of those living with the virus do not know they have been infected.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile new HIV cases have steadily declined over the last decade, thousands of people are still diagnosed with the illness every year.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2019 alone over 36,000 people received an HIV diagnosis in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n\n\n\nPresident Biden has pledged to work towards ending the HIV epidemic and proposed increasing federal funding towards existing programs by $377 million and creating a 10-year $9.8 billion national PrEP delivery program.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nREAD MORE STORIES FROM CHANGING AMERICA\n\n\n\nENTIRE POLICE DEPARTMENT RESIGNS IN MISSOURI\n\n\n\nUN CALLS FOR US, OTHERS TO END 'IMPUNITY' FOR POLICE VIOLENCE AGAINST BLACK PEOPLE\n\n\n\nRACIAL CONTROVERSY ERUPTS AROUND ROYALS AT BUCKINGHAM PALACE\n\n\n\nPRINCIPAL ESCORTED OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION AFTER DELIVERING FIERY SPEECH",

It helps both current and future borrowers, and it will fix a badly broken system,” Biden said in remarks.\n\n\n\nBiden&nbsp;unveiled&nbsp;a plan earlier on Wednesday to forgive up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 annually and $20,000 in loans for Pell Grant recipients within the same income bracket.\n\n\n\nThe president will also extend a payment freeze on federal student loans and interest accrual until Dec. 31 and stressed that January will finally mark the end of the years-long student loan payment freeze.\n\n\n\n“By resuming student loan payments at the same time as we provide targeted relief, we’re taking an economically responsible course. As a consequence, about $50 billion a year will start coming back into the treasury because the resumption of debt,” Biden said.\n\n\n\nHe acknowledged that critics will argue it is too much, a claim that largely comes from Republicans and moderate Democrats, or too little, which largely comes from&nbsp;progressives and activists.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There’s plenty of deficit reduction to pay for the programs many times over,” Biden said, arguing that his administration has cut the deficit enough to pay for the policies.\n\n\n\nThe White House on Wednesday said that if borrowers have undergraduate loans, they can cap repayment at 5 percent of their monthly income. Current students with loans are also eligible for this debt relief, and dependent students will be eligible for relief based on their parents’ income.\n\n\n\nWhen asked if the newly unveiled plan is unfair to people who have paid back their student loans, Biden shot back and asked, “Is it fair to people who in fact do not own multibillion-dollar businesses to see one of these guys get the tax breaks? Is that fair? What do you think?”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEarlier in his remarks, Biden had bashed Republicans for being critical of forgiving student loan debt, but for voting for Trump-era tax cuts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I will never apologize for helping working Americans in the middle class, especially not to the same folks who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut that mainly benefited the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations, that slowed [the] economy, didn’t do a whole lot for economic growth,” he said.\n\n\n\n“I find it interesting how some of my Republican friends who voted for those tax cuts and others think that we shouldn’t be helping these folks,” he added, referring to borrowers.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have strongly come out against proposals for student debt relief and denounced them as&nbsp;unfair and inflationary.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden compared his plan to the $700 billion in small business loans given out during the pandemic, arguing that there weren’t complaints at the time that those loans caused inflation.\n\n\n\n“No one complained that those loans caused inflation. A lot of these folks in small business are working- and middle-class families. They needed help. It was the right thing to do. So, the outrage over helping working people with student loans I think is just simply wrong. Dead wrong,” he said.\n\n\n\nNinety percent of eligible beneficiaries of the plan make under $75,000, more than 60 percent are Pell Grant recipients, and 45 percent will have their debt fully canceled, according to data from the president. He also noted that it will help Black and Hispanic borrowers who are disproportionately impacted by student loans.\n\n\n\n“No high-income individual or high-income household … will benefit from this action. Period,” he said, adding that he is honoring a commitment made during the campaign to forgive $10,000 in outstanding loans.\n\n\n\nDuring the 2020 campaign, Biden supported forgiving at least $10,000 in federal student loans per person but progressives and fellow Democrats have long pushed him to support forgiving up to $50,000 in loans.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Education also announced on Wednesday that it is making changes to the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, which allows borrowers working in public service to make progress towards their loans. It will retroactively credit public service, allow more payments to qualify for the program and allow various deferments and forbearances, such as for those in the Peace Corps.\n\n\n\nBiden said the program has driven him crazy because it needs to be fixed, calling it “a mess,” and “inefficient and complicated.”\n\n\n\nAdditionally, the department will propose a rule to hold career programs accountable through measures such as publishing an annual “watch list” for those with the worst debt levels.\n\n\n\nBiden hailed the plan for holding colleges accountable for jacking up their costs, while also criticizing former President Trump. Biden had announced in June that he would cancel billions in student debt for former Corinthian College students and earlier this month announced he would discharge billions in student debt for ITT Tech borrowers.\n\n\n\n“We’ve all heard of those schools luring students with a promise of big paychecks when they graduate, only to watch these students being ripped off and left with mounds of debt,” Biden said. “My predecessor looked the other way for some reason … to do anything about this fraud. My administration’s taking it on.”",

        "description": "Everything about student debt is big. There are more than 40 million borrowers and they owe an astronomical $1.6 trillion.&nbsp;By comparison, the major increase in military aid to Ukraine announced this week will cost only $3 billion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Biden’s announcement today forgives $10,000 for millions of borrowers and up to $20,000 for recipients of the Federal Pell Grant program, which provides grants to students who have demonstrated significant financial need. Before the different rates for Pell Recipients was added to the equation, this plan was estimated to cost about $300 billion.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration deserves much credit for targeting debt forgiveness for the neediest students. This is an important step to help those struggling the most with student debt — those in default, 60 percent of whom owe less than $10,000.\n\n\n\nBut our government is on the hook for the student loans forgiven today because it borrowed the money and lent it to the students — and we haven’t done enough to fix the problem for future students.\n\n\n\nWe need to find a better way.\n\n\n\nOne way we can protect borrowers is to address the crippling role interest plays in their debt burden. Due to negative amortization, interest payments are taking up a larger portion of student loan payments than ever before — with nearly one-quarter of all payments made in 2019 going to interest. Interest payments alone skyrocketed from $13.1 billion in 2015 to $22.4 billion in 2019.\n\n\n\nBiden and his team rightfully acknowledge this problem by proposing changes to the Income-Based Repayment loan plans. But these changes are going to be very costly — with the taxpayers shouldering the cost. One solution to ease the debt burden is to stop collecting interest altogether — with a cost offset mechanism embedded to protect taxpayers.\n\n\n\nTo offset the loss of interest payments, we should invest the principal payments students make. It could amount to a lot more than what the government collects in the interest students pay now.\n\n\n\nWhile the plan from the White House takes steps to address the impact of negative amortization, it does not include a cost offset. If we don’t figure out a way to make the student loan system pay for itself, it may collapse and take down with it the hopes of millions of students to earn a college degree.\n\n\n\nThere is no doubt that the debt burden on low-income students has grown too large as evidenced by defaults and late payments. Today’s forgiveness is an important step, but we can do even better.\n\n\n\nRobert Hildreth&nbsp;is a former International Monetary Fund economist whose professional work involved restructuring South American debt and marketing sovereign debt loans. He founded the Hildreth Institute dedicated to restoring the promise of higher education.",

        "description": "Connecting to Cloud SQL using Python is not always straightforward. Depending on the context, sometimes you have to connect to a Unix domain socket, sometimes you have to allow-list IP addresses for TCP connections, or sometimes you have to run the Cloud SQL Auth proxy locally. Making these connections secure is yet another challenge: you might have to manage SSL certificates, firewalls rules, IP addresses, etc. Fortunately, there is an easier way.Enter theCloud SQL Python Connector, a Python package that makes connecting to Cloud SQL both easy and secure for all three supported database engines (Postgres, MySQL, and SQL Server), from anywhere (local machine, Cloud Run, App Engine, Cloud Functions, etc.).The Python Connector is one of the Cloud SQL connector libraries (also available in tasty Java and  Go flavors).What is the big deal? How is a connector different from the other methods mentioned?The Cloud SQL connector libraries provide the following benefits:IAM Authorization: the connectors use IAM permissions to control who and what can connect to your Cloud SQL instances.Improved Security: the connectors use robust, updated TLS 1.3 encryption and identity verification between the client connector and the server-side proxy, independent of the database protocol.Convenience: the connectors remove the requirement to use and distribute SSL certificates, manage firewalls or source/destination IP addresses.IAM Database Authentication(optional): the connectors provide support forCloud SQL’s automatic IAM database authentication feature.How can I try it out?Try it out with demo notebooksWe've created interactive Colab notebooks that show you how to use the Cloud SQL Python Connector – all without needing to write a single line of code yourself! The notebooks will automatically use a supported database driver based on the database engine you are using with Cloud SQL.PostgreSQL Notebook, using pg8000MySQL Notebook, using pymysqlSQL Server Notebook, using pytdsPython Connector NotebookConclusionWith the Cloud SQL Python Connector you can now easily connect to Cloud SQL from Python securely and conveniently. You can even leverage automatic IAM database authentication to access Cloud SQL as your IAM authenticated user or service account!Want to learn even more?

        "description": "Today, with the stroke of a pen, President Joe Biden made millions of Americans up to $20,000 richer by excusing them from repayment of money they had borrowed, costing taxpayers hundreds of billions of dollars.\nThe recipients aren’t the poorest Americans, the neediest, the unluckiest, the most indebted or those serving our nation most nobly. They qualify, rather, because they borrowed money for college.\nPolitically, it may be savvy to deliver on a key campaign promise to the college-educated base of the Democratic Party. Notably, many of those receiving relief borrowed to finance graduate degrees like JDs and MBAs — a group hardly in need of financial help, but one that will remember this giveaway come November. But from afar, this choice looks absurd. As of June, American households held more than $4.5 trillion in consumer debt (excluding home mortgages), most of which was not student loans. According to the Federal Reserve, fewer than 1 in 4 households have student-loan debt, and it is more common among those with higher incomes. By what logic is “borrowed money for college” a sensible standard for selecting the recipients of unprecedented public beneficence?\nThe logic is uniquely American, and incredibly harmful. It is captured well in the familiar Hollywood trope of a teenager, discovering his family’s financial troubles, conceding gloomily that he can abandon his first-choice school and attend the state university nearby, only for a determined parent to insist: No, we will find a way.\nIn America, this is meant to be inspiring. But the statistics suggest it’s more likely to be a tragic mistake.\n \n\nThe narrative goes that the college degree is the sine qua non&nbsp;of economic opportunity, and the college experience a once-in-a-lifetime inflection point for coming of age and launching into adulthood. On this basis, American culture has made it an implicit parental obligation, and American law has made it an explicit public obligation, to facilitate any student attending any school, regardless of cost. Young Americans and their families are encouraged to save as much as possible and then assume whatever debt necessary — by a culture equating the practice with “investing in your future,” by policymakers offering subsidies to promote indebtedness and by colleges that cash the checks upfront while accepting no accountability down the road.\nBut the narrative is wrong. Students who enroll in college are more likely to drop out or graduate into jobs that don’t require their degrees than they are to travel the expected college-to-career path. Research also suggests that what school you attend just doesn’t matter all that much: For men, school selectivity has no effect on future earnings; for women, more selective schools lead to more hours worked and lower marriage rates.\nIndeed, it’s not clear what we’re getting for our money. On average, colleges in America consume more than $25,000 per student per year — second only to Luxembourg among developed economies and more than twice the spending in countries like Denmark, France and Germany. The focus on elite private colleges is especially harmful: While we constantly conflate the cost of the “college experience” with affording an “Ivy League education,” median tuition for an in-state, four-year public university is still only $8,300 per year. Every child in America can pay his or her own way at a perfectly good college for about half the income from a part-time, minimum-wage job.\nThe cognitive dissonance between the unquestioned commitment to extravagant spending on college and the questionable value of that spending is what yields America’s bizarre discourse around student-loan debt — and leads to irrational policy moves like Biden’s. Is there a better way?\n\nThere’s a deep contradiction in our national beliefs about college, and it’s perfectly embodied in the thinking that drove Biden’s decision.\nOn one hand, under the presumption that degrees are precious and consistently produce a high return on investment, American law uniquely excludes student loans from discharge through the traditional bankruptcy process. We are so confident in the wisdom of unconstrained spending on higher education that we create a public guarantee for student loans — a form of credit that would otherwise make little sense to extend — and, to protect the lenders, we eliminate the recourse that borrowers traditionally have when their investments disappoint, or they spend beyond their means.\n \n\nYou can run up tens of thousands of dollars of credit card debt taking vacations and walk out of bankruptcy court owing nothing. But the debt you incurred for the life-changing wonders of time on a college campus? That must stay with you until death.\nOn the other hand, because we knew full well that the social promise underlying the debt is a foolish and fractured one — in fact, college is often a bad bet with a low return on investment — progressive politicians began demanding that the government wipe it away altogether. At the extreme, they equate its very existence with “violence.” No one ever explains what makes the student-loan borrower more deserving of government largesse than the family that took on an auto loan for the car that gets dad to work. Rather, the implicit judgment seems to be that the nation must, having sanctified the borrowing, collectively assume responsibility for the result.\nThe result is a dysfunctional system for financing higher education that has generated more than $1.7 trillion in outstanding student debt, representing many loans that were unwisely offered to and accepted by borrowers who now face untenable burdens and deserve some avenue for relief.\n\nSo what should happen? Biden’s approach of simply erasing the debt treats the obvious symptom — the debt — in the quickest and easiest (and also costliest) way, while doing nothing to address the underlying problem.\nInstead, America should embrace the banality of the student loan as just one form of debt among many — chosen by some for purposes of investment, and by others for what amounts to conspicuous consumption, exploited by sellers of a product with variable quality. As luck would have it, America has a very good legal system for governing regular debt, complete with structures for managing risk on all sides, options for sellers to provide credit themselves if no one else will, and equitable relief for those who make commitments they cannot keep.\nThe keystone is our uniquely lenient bankruptcy system. Unlike in most other countries, the typical American can go to court, declare himself insolvent, hand over some remaining assets, default on his remaining debts and return home to a house exempted from the proceedings. This choice is by no means an easy one — his credit score plummets and borrowing becomes more difficult and costly; friends and neighbors are likely to notice, along with anyone who runs a background check in the future; feelings of failure and accompanying shame are common. Thus, while Americans file for bankruptcy far more frequently than Europeans, the occurrence is sufficiently rare that consumer credit remains widely available and affordable. The cost of bankruptcy is low enough to encourage risk taking and ensure that someone who truly needs a fresh start can get one, but high enough that most who can avoid it will do what they can to steer clear.\nThis is the option that should be available to all student-loan holders.\nContinuing the desacralization of student debt, we should eliminate the labyrinth of government grants, loans, subsidies and guarantees that assert an open-ended public commitment to financing anything a university can think to charge for. Public support should come at the state level through funding of state university systems and at the federal level through a simple, means-tested grant that covers, say, 50 percent of the median state’s four-year public university tuition. Tying the grant value to the median state would prevent individual schools from extracting more money by raising tuition. Costs of room and board would be excluded. Young adults not enrolled in college do not expect the public to pay for their housing or food; neither should those enrolled.\nWhere would students find additional funding for more expensive options? A private loan market would likely exist but, absent the guarantees and subsidies, credit would be scarce and expensive. Borrowers would tend to have limited credit history and few assets. Lenders would be poorly positioned to evaluate the likelihood of successful repayment. The prospect of discharge in bankruptcy would add further risk. These obstacles are features, not bugs. Loaning large amounts of money to teenagers with uncertain prospects and no collateral is a bad idea for lenders because it is a bad idea, period. Finding ways to make it sufficiently attractive to saddle those teenagers with the loans does no one (besides college administrators) any favors.\nFortunately, institutions exist with the capital to finance all the necessary borrowing, the information to assess the wisdom of borrowing to enroll, the resources to help students succeed and the incentives to make the system work. Those institutions, of course, are the colleges themselves. Just as sellers provide financing for cars, capital goods and sometimes real estate, colleges should be expected to finance the education they provide. Instead of cashing tuition checks before freshman orientation has begun, and leaving the student to someday pay back a third-party lender, colleges should receive tuition from their students after the fact, when those students have been launched into careers that allow them to afford the payments.\nThis shift would initially require institutions without large endowments to borrow working capital for providing today an education that would be paid for tomorrow. But most institutions will have sufficient fixed assets to secure the loans, and the federal government could play a role if needed in guaranteeing that financing — with default leading promptly to liquidation.\nMeanwhile, students who made the choice to borrow under the old system would continue to repay those debts if they can, and would have the option to declare bankruptcy if they cannot. Such bankruptcies would cost the federal government much less than Biden’s broad-based loan forgiveness, and would help the transition to a better system and mindset rather than Biden’s doubling down on the broken one.\nColleges dependent on their own alumni’s future earnings to fund their operations would face a radically different set of incentives than today’s. They would have no choice but to structure their programs to be affordable, relative to the value they deliver. They would have no choice but to make admissions decisions on the basis of likely future success, rather than ability to pay upfront. And they would find it suddenly in their vital interest to ensure their students’ successful connection to the labor market and even to provide subsequent training opportunities.\nCollege administrators who say this model would not work are really just admitting that their models do not work, absent a nation entranced by their mystical incantations. Let them, not their students, suffer the consequences.",

        "description": "Rudy GiulianiIn the words of the immortal Jesse Pinkman: &#8220;When the going gets tough, you don&#8217;t want a criminal lawyer, you want a&nbsp;criminal&nbsp;lawyer, know what I&#8217;m sayin&#8217;?&#8221; Rudy Giuliani fits the bill. Giuliani typifies so much about the men and women who&#8217;ve represented the 45th President: a mix of sleaze, incompetence, toadying, conspiracy theories and — most recently — attorneys you expect to hear taking your call at Jacoby and Meyers rather than defending the most powerful man in the world. A one-time U.S. Attorney and two-term mayor of New York City, Giuliani was at the top of the world after 9/11. But in the years since he&#8217;s been better known for sleazy financial dealings and buckraking. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nRudy GiulianiAfter Donald Trump ditched his first crop of Russia probe lawyers, he looked to Rudy Giuliani, who helped him get impeached and worked closely with Trump on trying to overthrow the government. Most recently Mr. Giuliani was in the news when he was informed that he was a target in the election tampering investigation in Atlanta, Georgia. Giuliani also faces various disbarment and disciplinary proceedings in multiple jurisdictions. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nJenna EllisJenna Ellis worked closely with Rudy Giuliani trying to overturn the results of the 2020 election after President Trump lost. Along with Rudy she managed to rack up 63 consecutive losses in the pair&#8217;s desperate effort to keep Trump in office. A newcomer to high profile cases, Ellis claimed she&#8217;d been a &#8220;deputy district attorney&#8221; in Colorado when in fact she worked in traffic court and was fired within a year for poor performance. Like Giuliani, Ellis is now tied up in multiple Big Lie investigations like the one in Atlanta, Georgia as well as various bar disciplinary proceedings. Today she bills herself as &#8220;America&#8217;s lawyer&#8221; and appears regularly on Newsmax. (Photo by Rey Del Rio/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nSidney PowellSidney Powell was the brains behind the various &#8220;Kraken&#8221; lawsuits and conspiracy theories that were supposed to keep President Trump in office. Every lawsuit failed and now she spends her time trying to hold on to her law license in the face of various lawyer disciplinary proceedings. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nAlina HabbaHabba is part of a new crop of Trump lawyers who&#8217;ve taken over since Trump&#8217;s forced departure from the White House. Her experience prior to representing the former President in various investigations around the country included being the general counsel for an auto garage company in New Jersey. Her three person law firm is located near Trump&#8217;s Bedminster resort. (Molly Crane Newman/New York Daily News/Tribune News Service via Getty Images)\n\n\n\nChristine BobbAnother newcomer to the Trump legal team, Trump found Christina Bobb as a commentator on the pro-Trump news channel OAN. According to The Washington Post, Bobb&#8217;s &#8220;prior legal experience at the federal level consists mainly of a handful of trademark infringement cases on behalf of CrossFit during a stint at a San Diego law firm.&#8221; (Credit: Youtube)\n\n\n\nTy CobbTy Cobb is old school and not just because of the fancy moustache. Cobb was part of the early Trump Russia investigation team and has a long resume as a criminal defense lawyer in Washington, DC. After working for Trump, he&#8217;s become less than a fan. Said Cobb: “(Trump) is a disaster for the Republican Party … The Big Lie, and the related violence, election interference and other perceived misconduct, was and is an affront to this nation and its first principles. It has permanently soiled the history pages and deepened the abyss that divides our country.” (Photo By Jerry Cleveland/The Denver Post via Getty Images)\n\n\n\nJohn DowdJohn Dowd was another experienced DC criminal defense attorney who&#8217;d represented various luminaries; he was, among other things, hired by the MLB to investigate disgraced would-be Hall of Famer Pete Rose. Dowd eventually soured on Trump and quit in March 2018 after deciding that Trump was &#8220;a f-cking liar.&#8221; (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nJay SekulowJay Sekulow is a longtime pro-evangelical Christian rights activist who hooked up with Trump after the Dowd and Cobb team bailed. (Photo By Tom Williams/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images)\n\n\n\nJay SekulowSekulow has a strong TV presence and was Trump&#8217;s main TV lawyer for the middle years of his presidency. He was part of Trump&#8217;s defense team for his first impeachment trial. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nAlan DershowitzA retired Harvard Law School professor and one-time respected person, recent years have seen Alan Dershowitz spending his time on Fox News defending various Trump shenanigans. He took a brief star turn defending Trump in his first impeachment trial. (Photo by MANDEL NGAN/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\n\nJohn EastmanMost recent Trump lawyers have been in the Saul Goodman or personal injury attorney mold. But John Eastman is a big exception. A former professor and dean at the Chapman University School of Law, he even clerked for Justice Clarence Thomas. It was Eastman who came up with the idea that Vice President Mike Pence could make Trump be President again even after Trump lost his election. Like many Trump lawyers who didn&#8217;t start off with a rap sheet, Eastman is now facing various legal disciplinary proceedings and appears to be at the center of the Department of Justice&#8217;s investigation into the events surrounding January 6th. The FBI seized Eastman&#8217;s cellphone back in June. (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nPam BondiTrump met Pam Bondi when she was Attorney General of Florida and an early Trump endorser. Since she toadied for Trump so fulsomely she also got to work on Trump&#8217;s defense team for his first impeachment trial. \n\n\n\nPam BondiBondi stuck around after the President&#8217;s first impeachment trial and was there to get in on the Big Lie at the end of Trump&#8217;s term. Unfortunately, she faded as Jenna Ellis rose. (Photo by Bonnie Jo Mount/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\n\n\nPam BondiBondi is pictured attending a rally with Florida&#8217;s then-candidate for governor, Rep. Ron DeSantis (R), and other GOP candidates at the Hillsborough County Republican Party office in Tampa on November 2, 2018.

Kasowitz works out of a respected and successful New York City based firm (Kasowitz, Benson, Torres). Trump at first tried to bring Kasowitz in to represent him in the Russia investigation. But it just didn&#8217;t work out. Trump took advice to get some seasoned DC players and hired John Dowd and Ty Cobb instead. (AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta, File)\n\n\n\nMichael van der VeenBy the time Donald Trump got impeached a second time he was scraping at the bottom of the legal barrel. Trump was deep into his reputation as a &#8220;client from hell.&#8221; It got so bad he had to settle for Michael van der Deen, a personal injury lawyer from Philly, to defend him before the Senate. (Photo by Congress.gov via Getty Images)\n\n\n\nBruce Castor Jr.Also defending Trump during his second impeachment trial was Pennsylvania lawyer and sometimes politician Bruce Castor. Castor&#8217;s star turn was a speech on the Senate floor widely considered confusing, sleep-inducing and hard to follow. Trump himself was reportedly furious at Castor&#8217;s performance. GOP Senator John Cornyn (R-TX) told reporters &#8220;I&#8217;ve seen a lot of lawyers and a lot of arguments, and that was not one of the finest I&#8217;ve seen.&#8221; (Photo by Congress.gov via Getty Images)\n\n\n\nLindsey HalliganJoining the current Trump Dream Team of Christina Bobb and Alina Habba is Lindsey Halligan. She&#8217;s a newcomer not just to the Trump Team but even to being a lawyer. She passed the bar in 2014 and according to her online biography has a practice focusing on insurance claims at residential and commercial properties in Fort Lauderdale.\n\n\n\nMichael CohenMichael Cohen was Trump&#8217;s muscle lawyer before he became President, coaxing the likes of Stormy Daniels into signing NDAs, threatening reporters and generally making problems go away. He was also in the mix in President Trump&#8217;s various liaisons and deals with the entourage of Vladimir Putin. But Trump never gave Cohen a plumb White House position and for Cohen it was generally downhill from there. (Photo by Yana Paskova/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nMichael CohenCohen eventually ended up doing time for tax evasion and miscellaneous other crimes tied to being Trump&#8217;s peccadillo clean-up man. After emerging from prison he became a fierce Trump critic. (Photo by Yana Paskova/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nMichael CohenCohen, here, walks to the Loews Regency hotel on Park Ave on April 13, 2018, in New York City. Following FBI raids on his home, office and hotel room, the Department of Justice had announced that they are placing him under criminal investigation. (Photo by Yana Paskova/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nEvan CorcoranEvan Corcoran is the nominal head of Trump&#8217;s current team dealing with the former President&#8217;s purloining of top secret documents owned by the federal government. But he is generally in the background, leaving public appearances to Bobb, Habba and Halligan. (Photo by Nathan Howard/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nMartin and Jane RaskinMartin and Jane Raskin weren&#8217;t your typical Trump lawyers. From a low profile husband and wife law firm in Florida, the two were neither incompetents nor sleazeballs. They&#8217;re respected criminal defense lawyers. Trump brought them on after John Dowd quit and at the same time he made Rudy Giuliani his lead defense lawyer. The Martins went on to play a role at President Trump&#8217;s first impeachment trial. (Photo by SAUL LOEB / AFP) (Photo by SAUL LOEB/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\n\nJoe DiGenova and Victoria ToensingNot all husband and wife teams are respectable non-sleazeballs. There are also the likes of former US Attorney Joe DiGenova and wife and law partner Victoria Toensing. Longtime fixtures of the DC legal scene, both as lawyers and legal commentators, DiGenova and Toensing have a complicated history with Trump. Trump announced he was hiring the two after Dowd&#8217;s departure only to quickly un-announce them in favor of the Martins. But don&#8217;t fret: they were able to collaborate with Rudy Giuliani and others representing various Kremlin-adjacent oligarchs, businessmen and conmen working with Giuliani on the various schemes that eventually got Trump impeached. They also got in on the Big Lie action, appearing at the famous press conference at which a heated and nervous Giuliani&#8217;s hair dye memorably dripped down his temple.

James Clyburn (D-S.C.), the panel’s chair, said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe efforts by members of the Trump administration, including the former president, to meddle with public health agencies has been well documented. However, the report offers new levels of detail on the pressures put on the FDA in 2020.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClyburn noted the Trump administration's attacks on public health officials helped contribute to a politicization of science, and reduced the public's trust in the government.\n\n\n\n\"These assaults on our nation’s public health institutions undermined the nation’s coronavirus response—and are precisely why we must never again settle for leaders who prioritize politics over keeping Americans safe,\" Clyburn said.\n\n\n\nIn testimony before committee staff, Hahn said he felt pressure because of Navarro's \"persistence\" in insisting that hydroxychloroquine worked and should be reauthorized, despite strong evidence to the contrary.\n\n\n\n“We took a different stance at the FDA,” Hahn said. “So that disagreement, which of course ultimately became somewhat public, was a source of pressure.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn an emailed statement, Navarro said the select subcommittee was “wrongly” perpetuating that hydroxychloroquine “was somehow dangerous.”\n\n\n\nNavarro also cited excerpts from his memoir that chronicled his clashes with what he described as the \"never-Trump FDA.\"\n\n\n\nThe subcommittee report also details how the FDA wanted to advise vaccine manufacturers that the FDA wanted 60 days worth of follow-up patient safety data before applications for emergency use authorization were filed. That request would mean authorization wouldn't occur until after the November 2020 election.\n\n\n\nTrump had repeatedly said the shots would be authorized before Election Day, despite experts and agency scientists signaling it was unlikely.\n\n\n\nHahn told the committee the agency faced “pushback about the issue” from multiple officials, including Trump’s chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Meadows said the White House wouldn't sign off on the guidance, because of the 60-day requirement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe agency eventually circumvented the White House by quietly publishing the 60-day data request as part of a larger set of background documents for industry. Meadows later that day told Hahn the White House had cleared the release of the guidance.\n\n\n\nTrump later attacked the FDA on Twitter.\n\n\n\n\"New FDA Rules make it more difficult for them to speed up vaccines for approval before Election Day. Just another political hit job!” Trump wrote, tagging Hahn.",

The newly unsealed warrant indicates Trump is under investigation for possible violations of the Espionage Act and other laws in relation to the documents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Well, the DOJ, again, they have unfettered resources. They have unfettered power, right? And so, they’ve been trying to get Trump now for six years,” Kushner said Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ex-Trump administration official is the former president’s son-in-law, Ivanka Trump's husband, and the author of a newly-released memoir, “Breaking History.\" \n\n\n\n\"I write about this a lot in my book, what it was like being through what I call investigation number one, where they were accusing us of colluding with Russia, which was totally crazy. We knew it, but it still took us two years to go through it,\" Kushner said. \n\n\n\n\"And what you're seeing here in terms of how it’s playing out is a very similar thing where, you know, people have lost faith in the FBI and the Department of Justice.\"\n\n\n\nThe book, which details Kushner's experience with Trump’s campaign and administration, got a scathing review from The New York Times.",

But it was also only the latest in a series of better-than-expected special election performances for the party and the latest sign that the political tides may be shifting in Democrats’ favor.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s a friendly reminder that every time the narrative counts us out, we know how to change it,” Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist and senior adviser to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), said. “You can’t always predict what defines an election six or seven months out. And the very things that Republicans and the media have considered to define the election, haven’t defined this election.”\n\n\n\n\"I do think we have a hell of a chance of maintaining this majority,\" he added.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, special elections aren’t necessarily the best indicators for how the general elections will shake out.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTurnout tends to be lower, and as political strategists and operatives on both sides of the aisle like to point out, special elections are just that: special. Michael McAdams, the communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee, noted as much on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n“Majorities are won in November not August,” McAdams said in a statement. “We look forward to prosecuting the case against Democrats’ failed one party rule that’s left American families worse off.”\n\n\n\nBut Democrats are nonetheless buoyed as they begin the sprint to the general election, pointing to perhaps the most powerful driving force behind their recent special election performances: the Supreme Court’s decision earlier this summer to overturn Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince then, Democrats have sought to rally voters around the idea that a Republican-controlled Congress could further erode protections for reproductive rights, a strategy that has so far shown signs of paying off.\n\n\n\nIn each of the four special elections decided since the Supreme Court made its ruling — one in Nebraska, one in Minnesota and two in New York — Democrats have outpaced President Biden’s 2020 performance, even in the three they lost. In Alaska, a state former President Trump carried by 10 points in 2020, Democrat Mary Peltola leads the field in the special election for the at-large House seat, though results are still being tabulated.\n\n\n\nThe issue of abortion rights proved particularly pivotal in the special election in New York’s 19th District on Tuesday. In the wake of the Supreme Court’s decision, Ryan centered his campaign around reproductive rights, casting the special election as a chance for voters to register their outrage at efforts to restrict abortion access.\n\n\n\nMolinaro, meanwhile, focused more on issues like crime and inflation. While he has said that he opposes a federal ban on abortions, Ryan still hammered him over his belief that the issue should be decided by the states.\n\n\n\nChris Taylor, a spokesperson for the DCCC, cast Ryan’s victory as the latest sign that voters are poised to reject Republicans this fall over the GOP’s approach to abortion rights, proclaiming that “House Republicans' dream of a red wave has gone up in smoke.”\n\n\n\n“For the fourth time this summer, voters rejected MAGA Republicans’ extreme attempt to rip away women’s freedoms by backing Democrats because they know we’ll protect their freedoms,” Taylor said. “Every day between now and Election Day we’ll make sure voters know Democrats are the party of freedom and MAGA Republicans are the party of extremism.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne national Republican strategist, however, attributed Molinaro’s loss in the Hudson Valley district on Tuesday in part to low turnout among independents, who are unaccustomed to voting in primary elections in New York because of the state’s partisan nominating contests.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Our fear, which turned out to be true, was that independents do not turn out on primary day in New York because New York has a closed primary system,” the strategist said. “What you saw was just partisan turnout. The general election in this district is going to look very different than last night’s special election.”\n\n\n\nAnd Democrats are still facing strong headwinds in their bid to hold their House majority.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe party in power almost always loses ground in Congress in midterm elections, and Biden’s approval ratings have lingered underwater for the past year. What’s more, the GOP needs to gain just five seats to recapture control of the lower chamber, and the party is poised to pick up a handful of those seats thanks to redistricting alone.\n\n\n\nEven Seawright, the DCCC adviser, acknowledged that there are circumstances outside of Democrats’ control and that the party needs “to be able to respond” to the unexpected, especially in the final months before the general elections.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, there are signs that Democrats’ recent burst of momentum isn’t just limited to special elections. Over the past month, the party has regained a narrow lead on the generic ballot — a poll question asking voters which party they would rather see control the House — according to the data website FiveThirtyEight.\n\n\n\nAnd on Wednesday, two election handicappers, the Cook Political Report and Sabato’s Crystal Ball, shifted the November election in New York’s 18th District, where Ryan will seek his first full term in Congress, in Democrats’ direction.\n\n\n\nEven some Republicans concede that the political environment appears to be improving for Democrats.\n\n\n\n“The Dems have had a pretty good run lately,” one GOP strategist familiar with House races said. “It’s getting harder to say that it’s just a fluke. Do I think that they’re going to win the House? No, not at all. But also, what’s happening now doesn’t exactly say ‘red wave’ to me.”",

        "description": "Falling water levels in lakes and rivers across the globe have caused great concern among climate experts, and they have also led people to stumble upon a range of newly uncovered relics, from sunken ships to human remains.\n\n\n\nNearly half of Europe is facing drought warnings, while dry conditions in the American West, the worst in more than 1,000 years, led to water allocation cutbacks last week for states along the Colorado River.\n\n\n\nA European Union-commissioned report from the Global Drought Observatory released this month found that 47 percent of Europe is in drought warning conditions, and 17 percent of the region meets the threshold for alert conditions.\n\n\n\nAs policymakers bring new urgency to addressing droughts in the U.S. and across the globe, here are five of the weirdest things exposed by lakes and rivers that are drying up:\n\n\n\nNazi warships\n\n\n\nThe drought has brought the Danube River, the second-longest in Europe, to some of the lowest water levels seen in nearly a century.\n\n\n\nThe levels have threatened shipping, especially in the Serbian section of the river, where officials have begun dredging to keep vessels moving through the waterway.\n\n\n\nNear the port town of Prahovo, locals have found the hulks of dozens of Nazi warships, raising concerns about potential unexploded ammunition still aboard, Reuters reported last week.\n\n\n\n\"The German flotilla has left behind a big ecological disaster that threatens us, people of Prahovo,\" local resident Velimir Trajilovic told Reuters.The outlet reported the vessels were once operated by Nazi Germany’s fleet in the Black Sea and passed through the Danube River as they were retreating from Soviet forces.\n\n\n\nDinosaur tracks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt Texas’s Dinosaur Valley State Park, 113 million-year-old dinosaur tracks are preserved in the riverbed. They are typically covered by water and sediment, hindering their visibility.\n\n\n\nBut recent dry conditions this summer have lowered water levels at the park, located near Fort Worth, leading visitors last week to see the ancient tracks more exposed than ever.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRecent rains have since improved conditions, but the park wrote on its Facebook page it was not enough to fill the Paluxy River, which runs through the park.\n\n\n\nJeff Davis, the state park’s superintendent, said that employees who have worked at the site for upward of 10 years have never seen the tracks so clearly.\n\n\n\n“You won’t find them anywhere in the world,” Davis told Nexstar Media, The Hill's parent company. “You can actually see their individual toes, their individual claw marks. You can even see where they slipped as they were running.”\n\n\n\nHunger stones\n\n\n\nA so-called Hunger Stone is pictured in Děčín, Czech Republic, revealed by the low water level of the Elbe River. (Photo credit MICHAL CIZEK/AFP via Getty Images)\n\n\n\nThe Guardian reported late last week that low water levels in the Czech Republic section of the Elbe River have revealed a sharp warning inscribed in German centuries ago: “Wenn du mich siehst, dann weine.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe phrase translates to “If you see me, then weep.”\n\n\n\nThe inscription was written as a famine warning to future generations. This particular hunger stone was found near the town of Děčín, located in the northern region of the Czech Republic close to the country’s border with Germany.\n\n\n\nThe recent drought isn’t the first time such inscriptions have been visible in recent years. NPR reported a hunger stone was visible in Děčín in 2018 during a separate drought and heat wave, and many additional hunger stones exist throughout the region.\n\n\n\n'Spanish Stonehenge'\n\n\n\nPeople stand next to the Dolmen of Guadalperal, a megalithic monument that emerged due to drought at the Valdecanas reservoir in El Gordo, western Spain. Spain's drought began early in the year after the country suffered its second driest winter in more than 60 years, according to the government. (AP Photo/Manu Fernandez)\n\n\n\nMany are familiar with Stonehenge in the United Kingdom, but the recent drought has once again revealed the \"Spanish Stonehenge\" in the Valdecanas reservoir, located in western Spain.\n\n\n\nReuters reported the prehistoric stone circle is now visible for the fourth time since the area was flooded in 1963 as part of a rural development project. The arrangement is officially called the Dolmen of Guadalperal and is believed to have been created close to 5,000 BC.\n\n\n\n\"It's a surprise, it's a rare opportunity to be able to access it,\" archaeologist Enrique Cedillo told Reuters.\n\n\n\nUnexploded bomb\n\n\n\nThe dried riverbed of the Po River in Sermide, Italy. An unprecedented drought is afflicting nearly half of the European continent, damaging farm economies, forcing water restrictions and threatening aquatic species. Water levels are falling on major rivers such as the Danube, the Rhine and the Po. (AP Photo/Luigi Navarra, File)\n\n\n\nThe BBC reported that a group of fishermen found an unexploded bomb from World War II on the banks of the Po in Italy last month.\n\n\n\nItalian military officials said the bomb, which weighed roughly 1,000 pounds, contained 530 pounds of explosives, BBC reported.\n\n\n\nThe object was found near Borgo Virgilio, located in the Lombardy province in the northern region of Italy.\n\n\n\nItaly’s executive branch last month declared a state of emergency for five provinces until the end of the year in response to the drought and low water levels in the Po and the Eastern Alps. The move provided 36.5 million euros to the affected areas.“For the Po basin, this is the most serious water crisis of the last seventy years, according to analysis by the Po River District Basin Authority,” Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi said at a press conference in late June.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3613950-stop-the-dangerous-rhetoric-the-truth-about-irs-funding/",
        "description": "The IRS reported yesterday that, in the wake of serious threats that it is receiving, it is launching a&nbsp;safety review&nbsp;for all of its 600 facilities, the first such review since the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995.\n\n\n\nAs a former assistant secretary for management of the U.S. Treasury, with significant oversight responsibilities for the IRS, I was a strong advocate of more funding for the IRS. But I have&nbsp;previously warned&nbsp;that $80 billion of new funding for the IRS over 10 years is twice what it can reasonably and responsibly spend. The group of legislators who created&nbsp;the Bipartisan Infrastructure Framework&nbsp;in the summer of 2021 agreed and settled on $40 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGiven its history, as well as hiring difficulties being experienced across the public and private sectors today, the IRS is unlikely to be able to prudently hire the number of skilled employees or procure the other resources authorized by the bill. However, in the lead-up to last week’s enactment, there were claims made about the funding from both sides of the aisle that are patently false and misleading — and, often, dangerous. Those claims are now leading to credible threats against the IRS and its employees.\n\n\n\nOn the Democratic side, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (N.Y.) recently&nbsp;asserted&nbsp;that \"[t]he Trump administration did a despicable thing. They didn't audit anybody who made over one million dollars, and they said if you made $40,000 we're going to audit you, because there is fraud in the earned income tax credit.\"\n\n\n\nSchumer should know better. In the final year of the Trump administration, 8.6 percent of the highest earners — those making more than $10 million — were audited, as were 5.1 percent of those earning $5 to $10 million and 2.5 percent of those earning $1 to $5 million. These were the highest percentages in more than a decade (including the Obama years). Moreover, these percentages are six to 20 times greater than the percentage of taxpayers earning $25,000 to $500,000 who were audited.\n\n\n\nThe senator should also know that the relatively high number of audits of low-income taxpayers (those making less than $40,000) are of individuals who receive the Earned Income Tax Credit. Why? Because the EITC and other refundable credit programs are among those with the highest instances of taxpayer miscalculation and fraud (the IRS inspector general estimates that 24 percent, $20 billion, of these payments are \"improper”), and these improper payments are a significant source of the “tax gap” attributable to individual taxpayers. In addition, the IRS is mandated annually by Congress to publicize this problem and take action to remediate improper payments. Moreover, all of the “audits” of EITC recipients are “correspondence audits,” that is, letters sent to taxpayers requesting further information and/or indicating discrepancies between what they have reported and what the IRS is able to verify. Unlike audits of higher earning taxpayers, rarely (if ever) are these taxpayers ever meeting with the IRS.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have been no less loose with their facts. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) recently&nbsp;tweeted&nbsp;that the \"Democrats' new army of 87,000 IRS agents will be coming for you — with 710,000 new audits for Americans who earn less than $75k.\" This assertion is patently misleading.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFirst, during the next several years, the IRS will hire 87,000 new employees, but, based on its aging workforce, it is forecasted to&nbsp;lose nearly 50,000; so, net-net, it will hire approximately 37,000 new employees.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSecond, not all of them will be for enforcement. The $45 billion in the legislation earmarked for enforcement over the next nine years will double the IRS's enforcement budget. The IRS’s 2022 budget of $5 billion funds approximately 35,000 enforcement agents and support personnel. In 2021, the IRS audited 659,000 taxpayer returns, representing about .4 percent of the 160 million returns filed. A doubling of the IRS enforcement budget would take that percentage up to .8 percent, which is still less than the percentage of returns audited by the IRS in 2010 (.9 percent), prior to its significant budget reductions. Democrats and Republicans can debate whether that was the end of the world, but they should use real facts.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, an IRS recruitment&nbsp;advertisement&nbsp;for its criminal investigations division stated that new employees would be required to carry a firearm. In response, the right-wing press and some Republican senators made misleading, if not dangerous, assertions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Ron Johnson (Wis.)&nbsp;asked, \"Who do you think they'll weaponize the 87,000 IRS agents against?\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (Texas)&nbsp;tweeted&nbsp;that \"[T]he Biden administration has fully weaponized DOJ &amp; FBI to target their political enemies. And with 87K new IRS agents, they're coming for you too.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs both senators must know, only about 2,000 of the IRS's 75,000 employees carry a firearm — and for good reason.  IRS criminal investigation agents investigate and engage with members of organized crime, gangs, terrorists, drug dealers, traffickers and other bad actors who also happen to launder money and cheat on their taxes. Like FBI agents and border guards, they put their lives on the line every day. They have participated in, and often led, some of the most significant criminal prosecutions in recent decades. It would be irresponsible — and cost the lives of these brave crime-fighters — to disarm them.\n\n\n\nWhile explosive language and twisted facts are harmful in any policy debate, they are especially dangerous when it comes to the IRS. The agency&nbsp;collected&nbsp;nearly $4.2 trillion, 95 percent of all of the federal government’s revenue. The success of our nation in providing benefits and service to every American depends, in part, upon the success of the IRS and its dedicated workforce. Its credibility is essential to our economic and national security.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats should be held accountable for the over-funding of the IRS that is included in the so-called Inflation Reduction Act. But American taxpayers would be  better served if both parties had made their cases for this bill — and future IRS-related issues — responsibly, without reliance upon dangerous class warfare and \"factual distortions.\"\n\n\n\nDavid F.

        "description": "If you’re planning your trip to the Great Get-Together, the data suggests that the crowds will be slightly smaller on the first Thursday of the State Fair.On average, the first Thursday tends to draw about 106,988 people. For the full 12-day run of the State Fair, that day averages the lowest attendance, according to data from the Minnesota State Fair compiled by MPR News.Which day are all the lines are longer? No guarantees, but that tends to be the last Saturday of the fair. It averages about 232,430 visitors. The fair’s record for single-day attendance set in 2018 still stands with 270,426 visitors on the last Saturday of that year.And in 2021, with the delta variant spreading and distribution of vaccines in full swing, (the FDA approved the first vaccine distribution for as young as 18 years at the end of August 2021), fair attendance dropped to significantly lower numbers. That year, attendance was below 100,000 fair-goers for six out of 12 days, when more often the state averages less than one day with sub-100,000 attendees in a year. In 2020 the state fair was canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic — so no data for that year.",

        "description": "Peering down the Memory Hole: Censorship, Digitization, and the Fragility of Our Knowledge Base | The American Historical Review:\n\nAbstract\n\nTechnological and economic forces are radically restructuring our ecosystem of knowledge, and opening our information space increasingly to forms of digital disruption and manipulation that are scalable, difficult to detect, and corrosive of the trust upon which vigorous scholarship and liberal democratic practice depend. Using an illustrative case from China, this article shows how a determined actor can exploit those vulnerabilities to tamper dynamically with the historical record. Briefly, Chinese knowledge platforms comparable to JSTOR are stealthily redacting their holdings, and globalizing historical narratives that have been sanitized to serve present political purposes. Using qualitative and computational methods, this article documents a sample of that censorship, reverse-engineers the logic behind it, and analyzes its discursive impact. Finally, the article demonstrates that machine learning models can now accurately reproduce the choices made by human censors, and warns that we are on the cusp of a new, algorithmic paradigm of information control and censorship that poses an existential threat to the foundations of all empirically grounded disciplines. At a time of ascendant illiberalism around the world, robust, collective safeguards are urgently required to defend the integrity of our source base, and the knowledge we derive from it. \n\nScience must respect the dignity and rights of all humans — Nature: \n\nAdvancing knowledge and understanding is a public good and, as such, a key benefit of research, even when the research in question does not have an obvious, immediate, or direct application. Although the pursuit of knowledge is a fundamental public good, considerations of harm can occasionally supersede the goal of seeking or sharing new knowledge, and a decision not to undertake or not to publish a project may be warranted.\nConsideration of risks and benefits (above and beyond any institutional ethics review) underlies the editorial process of all forms of scholarly communication in our publications. Editors consider harms that might result from the publication of a piece of scholarly communication, may seek external guidance on such potential risks of harm as part of the editorial process, and in cases of substantial risk of harm that outweighs any potential benefits, may decline publication (or correct, retract, remove or otherwise amend already published content). \n\n(N.B.: Nature’s policy does not address misinformation: the journal does not propose to be vigilant against falsehood, but rather to be vigilant against actual knowledge that risks harm to … well, to whatever groups Nature prefers to see unharmed.) ",

They were needed to secure a third round tie with Crystal Palace on an awkward, bruising night at Prenton Park.Elliott Nevitt, a striker who was playing non-league football just over a year ago, swept the League Two strugglers into a stylish lead before Newcastle recovered the tie through Jamal Lascelles and Chris Wood. Both scored from Kieran Trippier corners, with the England international one of several expensive substitutes who injected composure and strength into the visiting display. Lascelles scored while nursing a broken nose sustained early in the contest. Wood, his limited chances at Newcastle threatened even more by the imminent arrival of Alexander Isak for a club record fee, sealed victory with a thumping second-half header. Continue reading...",

Victory for Graham Potter’s side maintained their glistening start to the season and earned them a trip to Arsenal. For the 1,000-plus Brighton supporters housed in the away terrace, this was a look into the future with eight teenagers featuring on the night as Potter gave six players their full debuts.At the final whistle Potter and Ian Burchnall shook hands, hugged and no doubt cast their minds back to their first meeting as rookie managers, when the pair were at the centre of student rivalries coaching university teams part-time in Leeds. Before kick-off Forest Green manager Burchnall gave Potter and his longstanding assistant, Billy Reid, whose apartment Burchnall moved into after succeeding Potter at Ostersund in Sweden, and first-team coach, Bjorn Hamberg, a warm embrace. “I spoke to Graham about Evan Ferguson over the summer and he’s a top player,” Burchnall said.

        "description": "Twitter's former chief security officer is set to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee next month following the public release of his allegations that the company repeatedly failed to protect its users' data.\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee announced a hearing on Sept. 13 featuring the testimony of Peiter Zatko, whose whistleblower complaint made public on Tuesday alleges \"egregious\" privacy and security violations at the company. \nTaking action: The hearing is the first of likely numerous investigations expected by Congress in the coming months, as lawmakers probe the implications of the cybersecurity vulnerability claims Zatko — a renowned cybersecurity expert — made against his former employer. \n\"Mr. Zatko’s allegations of widespread security failures and foreign state actor interference at Twitter raise serious concerns. If these claims are accurate, they may show dangerous data privacy and security risks for Twitter users around the world,” Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) and and ranking member Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in a joint statement. \nTwitter has called the allegations “riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies.\" \nMidterms are looming: The Judiciary Committee's hearing could be the first of many. House Homeland Security Chair Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), for example, said he has concerns about how the security allegations could impact the November midterms.\n“Our adversaries have a history of exploiting social media to disrupt our elections — and with the midterms only three months away, there is no time to waste,” he said Tuesday.\nLax security: Among numerous allegations, Zatko claimed Twitter violated a 2011 settlement agreement with the FTC by exposing users' personal data. The consent agreement remains enforceable by the FTC, with each violation resulting in a fine of up to $16,000.\nZatko filed his complaint in July with congressional committees including Senate Judiciary Committee, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission, Justice Department and Federal Trade Commission.",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Ars Technica)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt's Wednesday, which means it's time for another Dealmaster. Our latest roundup of the best tech deals from around the web includes a new low on HyperX's Cloud Alpha Wireless gaming headset, which is currently down to $140 at Amazon with an on-page coupon. While that's still not quite cheap for a pair of gaming headphones, it is $60 off HyperX's MSRP and $20 below the previous best price we've seen.\nI've had the Cloud Alpha Wireless on hand for the past several weeks. As with most gaming headsets, they are a bit overpriced compared to standard headphones purely in terms of sound quality, as the \"V-shaped\" signature here bumps the bass and, to a slightly lesser extent, treble at the expense of some detail and emphasis in the mid-range frequencies. But what's here is still good, especially next to other gaming headsets, lending bass-heavy songs and in-game explosions a good sense of impact. (It's possible to customize the Cloud Alpha Wireless' sound through a companion app, too, though that is only available on Windows PCs.) For competitive games, it's also fine at locating sounds like footsteps accurately.\nLike the wired Cloud Alpha—which we've also recommended—this is a highly comfortable headset to wear for hours at a time. There's plush padding on the earcups and headband, and the whole build doesn't clamp down too hard on the ears. Just note that it can let in a bit more outside noise than some other closed-back headphones in particularly noisy environments. The included boom mic is perfectly competent for casual gaming chat, too, though a dedicated USB mic will still sound much fuller. It's also worth noting that these headphones can only connect over an included USB dongle, not Bluetooth or a 3.5 mm cable. This won't be an issue if you use them with a PC or a PlayStation console (or a Switch's dock), but for mobile devices or Xbox consoles (which require special wireless tech to work), it's a no-go.Read 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "This show about Sir Cliff Richard and celebs cleared of sexual abuse asks a good question: should their names have been made public? But its answers are far too shallowAh, 2012! Do you remember? The Olympic Games in London – that amazing opening ceremony reminding us, as the Queen jumped out of a plane with James Bond, of all that was good and right about our daft and glorious little country. And then, I think, there were some sporting events afterwards. The diamond jubilee celebrations and Prince Charles calling Her Maj “Mummy” so that we all went: “Aww!” It was even the wettest summer in 100 years, which didn’t seem like something to celebrate at the time, but, in drought-stricken retrospect looks like the planet’s last, dying gift to us.And, it was the year of “paedo bingo” for the tabloids, as the ex-editor of the Daily Star Dawn Neesom puts it. There really was something for everyone. For 2012 was also the beginning of Operation Yewtree, the investigation led by the Metropolitan police into Jimmy Savile that rapidly expanded to include other sexual abuse cases involving celebrities. According to this documentary, by the end of it, three years later, 26 men were charged and 10 of them convicted – including high-profile names such as Gary Glitter, Rolf Harris, Dave Lee Travis and Max Clifford.

        "description": "NEW YORK — Eric Adams emerged from his mayoral election victory last year declaring himself the “face of the new Democratic Party” — a reference to his defeat of progressives he believes are out of step with most voters.\nOn Tuesday night, Adams’ foes blunted that ascent — a setback for the mayor as he feuds with fellow Democrats in Albany who are refusing his demands to further roll back bail reform.\nThree of the eight state legislative candidates Adams backed lost their primaries to left-leaning alternatives, according to a list of the mayor’s endorsements provided by his adviser, Evan Thies.\nAdams aligned himself with the Bronx Democratic machine and billionaire charter school proponents like Dan Loeb in a bid to oust progressive state Sen. Gustavo Rivera with attorney Miguelina Camilo. Despite the forces working against Rivera — who won the coveted backing of Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez — the incumbent declared victory Tuesday night.\n\n\n\n“There is something distant in how the mayor reacts, almost as [if] the bubble he is in doesn’t actually touch what’s happening on the ground,” Camille Rivera, a political consultant who worked on Gustavo Rivera’s campaign, said in an interview. “He cut … our public school budget, endorsed against local elected officials with a history of delivering for their communities [and] last night, voters made clear just how out of step he was — both with his constituents and with reality.”\nRivera, who worked on Scott Stringer's mayoral run against Adams last year, added: “Crypto bros and celebrities just don’t cut it,” referring to the mayor’s well-documented penchant for the high life and his interest in Bitcoin.\nIn his own district in Central Brooklyn, Adams came under fire for backing a reverend with a history of anti-Semitic remarks who expressed opposition to same-sex marriage and abortion — comments the mayor condemned, even as he stuck with his choice. That candidate, Conrad Tillard, was trounced by incumbent state Sen. Jabari Brisport, who is aligned with the Democratic Socialists of America.\n“Incumbent State Senator Jabari Brisport easily beat back an Eric Adams-backed challenger, with an even stronger showing than in his last election, confirming that voters continue to support his commitment to taxing the rich, the Green New Deal, the New York Health Act, and fighting evictions through the empowerment of tenants statewide,” the city’s DSA chapter said in a statement.\n\n\n\nAnd in Queens, Adams supported former City Council Member Elizabeth Crowley in a state Senate race she lost badly to Democratic Socialist Kristen Gonzalez.\nFive of the mayor’s picks, including state Sen. Kevin Parker of Brooklyn and Staten Island Senate hopeful Jessica Scarcella-Spanton, won their races against opponents on their left in a late-summer primary with low turnout.\n“When New Yorkers come out to vote, they elect moderate candidates like the mayor,” Thies said. “He follows his conscience in who he supports and will every time. The lesson of this very low turnout election is something all should agree on: We have to motivate voters to get out and vote.”\nPolling has shown New Yorkers generally support the mayor’s push to reduce crime — an issue that has underscored his division with the left flank of the Democratic party.\nThe mayor was not alone in his picks: He was largely aligned with a Political Action Committee run by his friend and local pastor, Al Cockfield. The mayor spoke at an early fundraiser last year for the PAC — the existence of which was first reported by POLITICO.\nA review of the PAC’s state filing shows its alignment with the mayor’s preferred candidates: The committee gave Tillard’s campaign $7,500 in May, and Parker’s $2,500 in June. That same month, the PAC — called Striving for a Better New York — gave Parker $4,700 in a race for an unpaid district leader position.\nThe PAC also donated money to district leader candidates supported by both Adams and the Brooklyn Democratic machine, including City Hall aide Pinny Ringel, who was reportedly pushed to run to unseat an Adams rival, David Schwartz. It also gave to the district leader campaign of Edu Hermelyn, who worked on Adams’ mayoral race and was then hired into his administration. Hermelyn subsequently left his post after learning he could not hold the job and be a district leader.\nThe PAC regularly pays fundraiser Brianna Suggs, who worked on Adams’ 2021 campaign.\nIn a text message, Cockfield said he opts to give money to “common sense, moderate Democrats,\" but he and the PAC \"do not coordinate\" with Adams or the Brooklyn Democratic Party.\nGabe Tobias, a progressive consultant who worked unsuccessfully to defeat Adams last year, criticized his scorecard after Tuesday’s results.\n“It’s embarrassing for the mayor of New York City to endorse in his own home district and lose by 55 points,” Tobias said, referring to the Brisport margin of victory. “Adams’ endorsement isn’t worth the paper it’s printed on.”",

        "description": "Reality star-turned-criminal justice reform advocate Kim Kardashian bested Hillary Clinton in a legal knowledge trivia contest during filming for \"Gutsy,\" Clinton's forthcoming documentary series on women with her daughter Chelsea Clinton, People reports.\n\n\n\nThe mother-daughter duo sat down with Kardashian, who in December announced she had passed her first \"baby bar\" exam, to discuss her criminal justice work, which the former Democratic presidential nominee and secretary of State called \"impressive.\"\n\n\n\n\"She's very self-aware that her celebrity can make a difference positively, and where it may make a negative difference,\" Clinton said of the mogul. \n\n\n\nClinton added, \"She never wants to make a negative difference, so being judicious and thoughtful about when and where and how she engages was really impressive to us. I want, even beyond this series, to do whatever I can to help her in that work.\"\n\n\n\nKardashian showcased her \"impressive\" knowledge by winning the trivia contest, which consisted of questions on topics such as use of deadly force, 11-4. \n\n\n\nClinton, who has a law degree from Yale, jokingly said her loss was more than just humbling.\n\n\n\n\"Oh, it was heartbreaking!\" she told People.\n\n\n\nChelsea Clinton defended her mother, saying her loss appeared to be a result of reaction time.\n\n\n\n\"Sometimes, I could see my mom knew what the answer was, but she wouldn't hit the buzzer in time,\" the writer and global health advocate said in a video clip published by People.\n\n\n\nClinton said she was also intrigued by how well Kardashian performed.\n\n\n\n\"Mom, you made a good effort,\" Chelsea Clinton said.\n\n\n\nKardashian has used her celebrity status to bring attention to several cases, including pushing for the jailed father of a Uvalde, Texas, school shooting victim to be allowed to attend his child's funeral in June.\n\n\n\n\"Gusty,\" based on the Clintons' 2019 book \"The Book of Gutsy Women: Favorite Stories of Courage and Resilience,\" is set to premiere Sept. 9. on Apple TV+.",

        "description": "The Great Minnesota Get Together will start getting together Thursday, in what&#x27;s shaping up to be the first full-scale state fair since the start of the pandemic. Before COVID, attendance reached a record in 2019, topping 2.1 million. The fair&#x27;s growth had become a veritable end-of-summer ritual. But now — after the fair was canceled in 2020 and returned with pandemic restrictions still in place last year — even fair officials wonder if that growth can resume, as some regular fairgoers are having second thoughts about the tradition.  In other words: Have we already experienced what might be called &quot;peak fair&quot;?There are concerns about recent alarming crimes in the Twin Cities, like a fatal shooting during rush hour at a Minneapolis light rail station and two gunfire incidents at the Mall of America. Some people are exhausted by political discord. And others tell MPR News they consider the ongoing risk from COVID to be too great.Nancy Eicher, a food consultant who lives in Golden Valley, said she loves the fair and doesn&#x27;t consider herself especially at risk, but has gone out of her way to avoid getting sick. She does go to shows at the Guthrie, and out to dinner with friends. But she&#x27;s sitting this fair out.&quot;It&#x27;s not that I live my life completely risk-free,” she said. “But looking at the fair and how close proximity people are on a crowded day, and you&#x27;re in and out of buildings, and thinking about masking up to go in and taking your mask off outside — I just decided it wasn&#x27;t worth it this year.”Crowds pack the streets and the sky ride on the first day of the Minnesota State Fair on Aug. 23.Evan Frost | MPR News 2018Which doesn&#x27;t mean there won&#x27;t be lines for Sweet Martha&#x27;s cookies starting Thursday. Fair officials say grandstand show ticket sales are brisk this year. Last year&#x27;s fair, organizers say, may have had about 40 percent fewer visitors than 2019 — but was still one of the biggest public events in the world. And there&#x27;s this: one of the biggest jumps ever in fair attendance happened, ironically, after a previous pandemic in the wake of World War II. Attendance doubled after a polio outbreak shut down the fair in 1946. But there are some countersignals, as well: Despite record low unemployment in Minnesota, Metro Transit ridership is still only about half what it used to be, and that&#x27;s how nearly half of fairgoers get to the gates — raising questions about whether some people may be uncomfortable about riding crowded buses to reach the fair.Related linksEarlierOfficials, neighbors say they&#x27;re ready to keep this year&#x27;s Minnesota State Fair a safe oneEarlierState Fair focused on addressing accessibilityMore broadly, Los Angeles-based National Research Group says more than one in 10 moviegoers tell pollsters that they still aren&#x27;t ready to go back to a theater. And there&#x27;s this: D.C.-based market-data research firm Morning Consult has been doing weekly surveys of more than 2,000 people throughout the pandemic. &quot;When you look at it as a whole, there&#x27;s been a lot of progress since the start, obviously. But there&#x27;s still two in five Americans saying they are not comfortable going to an amusement park right now,&quot; said Morning Consult editor Wesley Case. &quot;There&#x27;s clearly a ceiling on the public&#x27;s comfort on social activities.&quot; Polarized publicSome experts are even pondering the nature not just of social activities, but of the general public in America right now. Harvard political scientist Robert Putnam, author of the books &quot;Bowling Alone&quot; and most recently &quot;The Upswing,&quot; both studies on social capital, says Americans are in a decidedly non-communal frame of mind following the elections of 2016 and 2020. &quot;Statistically I say, in &#x27;The Upswing,&#x27; America is now polarized more than it has been ever in American history, with the possible — but I emphasize possible — exception of 1860 to &#x27;65,&quot; he said. &quot;I&#x27;m not saying we&#x27;re going to have a breakout civil war in the next two weeks. I&#x27;m not saying that. But I&#x27;m saying we&#x27;re in almost uncharted territory. The whole country is. So Minnesota is, of course. How can Minnesota be immune from that?&quot;Riders throw their arms in the air as they near the end of the Giant Slide at the Minnesota State Fair on Sept. 1.Evan Frost | MPR News 2016The Minnesota State Fair, by the way, has shrunk in times of social strife before. Attendance fell nearly 10 percent in the four years following the national turmoil of 1968.And this is a very different Minnesota than in 1968: much bigger, and much more diverse.  Catherine Squires, the just-retired associate dean of the University of Minnesota&#x27;s Humphrey School of Public Affairs, says the killing of George Floyd, the mass shooting of Black shoppers at a supermarket in Buffalo, New York, and the massacre at an elementary school in Uvalde, Texas, have left communities of color with a heightened sense of unease. Like Putnam, she doesn&#x27;t anticipate a tragedy at the fair — which does have metal detectors at the gates.  But Squires says most people don&#x27;t appreciate the breadth of anxiety about simple safety in public. &quot;If we brought in our sense of, what does public safety mean? And how does it actually feel? And who is left out of my sense of public safety? I think that gets us into different conversations about what it means to have a Minnesota gathering, and what does it mean to be safe in public, or feel more secure, or feel at home? And I don&#x27;t think we&#x27;re having those conversations very much,&quot; she said.And she says she thinks COVID has put people even more on edge. &quot;That&#x27;s a really jarring thing to have happened on a mass scale,&quot; Squires said. ‘The fair is their happy place’Still, hundreds of thousands of people will stream through the fair&#x27;s gates this year. It isn&#x27;t going away. Fair organizers say they think high gas prices and inflation pressures may actually get more people to the fair, as it&#x27;s a relatively inexpensive entry — $17 per person this year, less for kids and seniors — and an affordable alternative to out-of-state trips. And fair manager Jerry Hammer thinks people come to the fair for refuge. Visitors fill the streets at the Minnesota State Fair in Aug.Nikki Tundel | MPR News 2011&quot;The fair has always been the place, where whatever is going on outside, you leave it out there,&quot; he said. &quot;We hear it again and again and again, and it doesn&#x27;t matter where we&#x27;re hearing it from. It&#x27;s people from all over — every place. The fair — this is what they say, I&#x27;ve heard it a lot — the fair is their happy place.&quot; He also says the fair has worked hard to keep it that way — for instance, doubling the public safety budget since 2019, from $2 million to $4 million annually. But Hammer also concedes the fair isn&#x27;t just for Minnesota. It&#x27;s of Minnesota, and there&#x27;s no getting away from the worries that weigh on so many minds, from now three shopping mall gunfire incidents in eight months to the handful of COVID deaths the state still records every week. They&#x27;re legitimate worries, Hammer says, and he won&#x27;t be surprised if some of those two million visitors from previous years stay home — at least for now. &quot;That&#x27;s happening in, right now, at least two broad directions. People are not comfortable about their public safety, and they&#x27;re not going to go anywhere. And also with COVID,&quot; he said. &quot;Those two things will matter to some people, and since our audience is everybody, we don&#x27;t expect those numbers.&quot; But, Hammer says, they&#x27;ll be welcome back when they&#x27;re ready.",

        "description": "Minneapolis Public Schools are being sued over a provision in their new contract with teachers that is designed to retain teachers of color. The provision upends long-standing last-in, first-out hiring practices for teachers.The conservative group Judicial Watch contends the so-called “racial and ethnic preference” provision, along with the use of taxpayer dollars to implement them, are illegal. MPR News host Cathy Wurzer spoke with Beth Hawkins, a Twin Cities-based education journalist who writes for the education news site The 74.The following transcript has been edited for length and clarity. Click the audio player above to listen to their conversation.What&#x27;s the language of the contract that some folks are taking issue with?The specific language says that if a teacher is excessed or laid off and they are a member of a population underrepresented among licensed teachers at that site, or in the district, the district shall excess or lay off the next least-senior teacher who is not a member of an underrepresented population. And it specifically points out that the reason for this is to address past discrimination and further advance diversifying the district&#x27;s workforce.Was this an issue for teachers during the strike?It&#x27;s been an issue going back several years. The district and the union had gone round and round over various years about what language would be fair to the largest number of teachers and yet would meet the district&#x27;s goal of having a teacher core and principal core that more closely reflects the population of students in the district. This year, there were a number of proposals traded back and forth, some of them had to do with the population of neighborhoods around an individual school site. Some of them had to do with teachers from historically Black colleges and universities or tribal colleges. There were a number of attempts to craft language that would stand judicial challenge.So this language basically upends the last-in, first-out hiring practices that we&#x27;ve seen for decades.It does. There are a couple of things that are important to note about that. One is that last-in, first-out still exists for the vast majority of teachers and that this contract provision would go away if the teacher core came to resemble the population of the district as a whole. It&#x27;s also language that&#x27;s very close to language that some other Twin Cities area school districts have used. Robbinsdale, for instance, has had a provision like this for several years. Osseo has a slightly different mechanism. They grant some seniority to brand new teachers so that they are less at risk of being probationary at layoff time. And then the other thing that&#x27;s really important to note is that if you take the idea of demographic representation out of the mix, Minneapolis has long had some what they call memoranda of agreements to the contract that preserve particular types of teachers. For instance, for Montessori teachers, it&#x27;s a very specific kind of teacher training that someone goes through to get that license. And in the service of the fact that teachers are not widgets — and you can&#x27;t take a person without the training and put them into an open position in a Montessori school — there are some long-standing agreements about teachers who will not be laid off in last-in, first-out order. Why is the outrage bubbling up now?It was actually agreed to at the end of March, and there was some there were some new stories at that point about whether it would survive a legal challenge, but no legal challenge emerged. Last week a local right-wing news site called Alpha News published a story about it that didn&#x27;t actually quote or identify anybody complaining about it. The story sort of appeared organically that Minneapolis had done this thing and quoted a lawyer from a law firm regarding large freedom of information requests lodged against districts throughout Minnesota. The suit that was filed yesterday doesn&#x27;t have as its plaintiff a teacher. One argument is that no one has been harmed by this policy or by this contract provision, yet instead, it was filed by Deborah Jane Clapp, who identifies as a Minneapolis resident since 2017. Under a common law provision, her complaint gives her standing to sue because of the unlawful expenditure of public money or illegal action on the part of public officials. It&#x27;s a discrimination claim without a victim.Say more about Judicial Watch, the group that filed the suit.Judicial Watch is based elsewhere and has pursued legal action, for instance, in pursuit of the idea that climate science is what they call fraud science. They&#x27;ve been involved in any number of legal actions involving Hillary Clinton. Just a long, long, long list of things that have been raging controversies in the news.In terms of the legalities, you mentioned that this contract was crafted to withstand legal challenges. What else is Judicial Watch saying about why this is illegal?There&#x27;s not much documentation. What it asserts is that because Ms. Clapp is a taxpayer in Minneapolis in Hennepin County and that her property taxes go to Minneapolis Public Schools — which is of course true — and that as such, she loses when layoffs occur. And what she&#x27;s asserted is that this layoff process is discriminatory. I&#x27;m not a lawyer, and or much less a judge. But I think that&#x27;s a pretty steep hill to climb. If you were to look at the district&#x27;s payroll, I think that if we&#x27;re talking about protecting teachers who are less senior from layoffs, it&#x27;s going to be pretty hard to argue that any Minneapolis resident is losing money under this contract.What is the district saying about the lawsuit?What the district has said about the lawsuit is that they can&#x27;t comment on pending legal actions. What they said during the teacher strike negotiations — and even going back as far as 2017 and 2018 — is that they need various mechanisms to make their Teacher Corps look more like the student population. There&#x27;s just an avalanche, a mountain of evidence that shows that this is something that children of color desperately need to be successful academically and behaviorally in their schools. And that without the ability to protect teachers who are newly hired from the constant churn, it would take decades to have a Teacher Corps that reflects the student population.If you really want to go into the Wayback Machine, the courts ordered Minneapolis Public Schools to desegregate in 1972. And in 1978, the district went to the court and said, “We can&#x27;t achieve this in terms of the segregation of our Teacher Corps if we can&#x27;t make a side agreement protecting some teachers of color.”How far off is the district from achieving its goal? In Minnesota, 5 percent of teachers — it&#x27;s a number that goes up and down by one percent yearly and has for a long time — are non-white, and the rest are white. In Minneapolis it&#x27;s 18 percent. Minneapolis has gone out and intentionally recruited and hired and attempted to improve working conditions for staff of color. However, the percentage of those teachers who are probationary is much higher than white teachers in 2020. For example, 23 percent of the district&#x27;s white Teacher Corps was probationary, and 37 percent of its teachers of color were probationary. And those teachers of course have no protection against excessing and layoffs at all. This last spring, before a second round of budget cuts were announced, 50 BIPOC teachers were excessed in Minneapolis Public Schools. So the protections won&#x27;t kick in until the spring of 2023. It&#x27;s dozens of teachers a year.Click the audio player above to listen to the full episode. Subscribe to the Minnesota Now podcast on Apple Podcasts, Google Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you get your podcasts.  We attempt to make transcripts for Minnesota Now available the next business day after a broadcast.

        "description": "America’s involvement with the war in Ukraine hit a new phase on Wednesday, when the Biden administration kicked off an effort to funnel billions of dollars directly into the U.S. defense industry to support Kyiv’s long-term fight against Russia.\nThe White House is also preparing to send Congress a new plan to restock the warehouses of NATO Baltic allies who have sent their own equipment to help in the fight.\nAs the war in the Donbas and in Ukraine’s south has settled into a punishing artillery duel with only incremental gains by both sides, Kyiv and Moscow are beginning to brace for the coming winter and what promises to be a long, grinding war.\nUkraine’s needs remain urgent, and the immediate military assistance packages will no doubt continue to flow in the coming weeks and months. But as Kyiv looks to continue its struggle against now-entrenched Russian forces across hundreds of miles of front lines, allies are looking at the long game.\nThe Biden administration announced a new $3 billion package on Wednesday that will directly fund contracts with the U.S. defense industry for artillery rounds, mortar rounds, surface-to-air missile systems; a new counter-drone capability; additional drones; and 24 counter-battery radars. The move marks a major shift in how the U.S. has supplied Ukraine, from pulling existing weapons off of shelves to awarding contracts to defense firms for weapons that need to be built.\n\nNone of that equipment will arrive for months, if not years. But officials say the investment will allow Kyiv to begin planning for its own future defense. The hope is that other wealthy European nations, which have at times lagged in their support for Ukraine, might follow suit in the coming months.\n“What needs to happen now is to build that longer-term pipeline,” one Western diplomat told POLITICO on the condition of anonymity to discuss the war. “At some point, particularly for the U.S., U.K., and some of the near neighbors like Estonia and Poland who have been generous with the equipment they have, [donating existing stocks] isn't going to be sustainable forever.”\nSome analysts expressed surprise that Wednesday’s package includes things like artillery and mortar rounds, which the U.S. has been supplying by the tens of thousands out of its own stockpiles.\n\"This might signal that some of these items are getting short in the DoD inventories and that DoD cannot supply them out of existing stocks,\" said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies' international security program. Production delays and cold manufacturing lines mean that some of these items could be slow to arrive, for both the U.S. and Ukraine.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Oleksii Reznikov, the nation’s defense minister, both said on Wednesday that the Ukrainian government is grateful for the $3 billion aid package.\n“The people of Ukraine, all our defenders highly appreciate [the U.S.’s] unwavering support. Together we will win!” Zelenskyy tweeted.\n \n\nThe Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is the Pentagon-managed account the administration drew the latest assistance package from, has been the primary method of arming and equipping Ukraine’s military since the 2014 seizure of Crimea by Russian forces.\nThough lawmakers have typically provided several hundred million dollars annually, Congress supersized the account after Russia’s full invasion this winter. The emergency supplemental package became law in May. The legislation allocated $6 billion to the program, placing it on par with other special programs to beef up U.S. military posture and training in Eastern Europe and the Indo-Pacific region.\nIn all, Congress has set aside $6.3 billion for the Pentagon-administered effort: $6 billion as part of May’s $40 billion supplemental assistance legislation and $300 million in a government-wide funding package that passed in March. As of Aug. 1, just $1.8 billion of that cash had been used, according to Pentagon documentation seen by POLITICO. Wednesday’s announcement leaves roughly $1.5 billion left to be spent.\nThe Pentagon will hand over the remaining aid as part of a flurry of contract awards at the end of the fiscal year, said two people with knowledge of the discussions.\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), a longtime proponent of boosting military aid to Ukraine, said the multibillion-dollar tranche shows an extended U.S. commitment to Kyiv as the war grinds on. \"This new assistance package demonstrates U.S. commitment to Ukraine’s long-term security by investing in capabilities to bolster Ukraine’s defense posture for years to come,\" Shaheen said in a statement. \"The equipment included in this package, and the associated training of Ukrainian forces, will facilitate the continued strengthening of the Ukrainian military as they defend themselves from Putin’s aggression.\"\nThe $40 billion military and humanitarian aid package was intended to last at least through the fall.\nThe package includes $19 billion for immediate military support to Ukraine, $3.9 billion to sustain U.S. forces deployed to Europe and $2 billion for long-term support of NATO allies and U.S. modernization programs.\n\n\n\nThat military support includes the $6 billion for the Pentagon account to arm Ukraine as well as $4 billion in State Department foreign military financing for Ukraine and other NATO countries on the alliance's eastern edge. And roughly $9 billion will be parceled out by the Pentagon for the defense industry to replenish stores of missiles and other weapons and equipment shipped to Ukraine.\nOnce it's empty, further emergency funding would be required later in the year, though whether that will happen is unclear.\nThe uncertain political landscape in the U.S., where funding for another large Ukraine package might run into trouble on Capitol Hill, makes these long-term contracts even more important to put Ukraine on solid footing, proponents say.\nStill more money is on the way, regardless of whether President Joe Biden seeks another supplemental. Both the House and Senate Appropriations committees have proposed granting the Pentagon another $300 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative for fiscal 2023.\nA final deal to fund the federal government, including the military, likely won’t be struck until late this year or early next, however, and the added Ukraine money could increase if lawmakers agree to give the Pentagon even more money.\nAlso included in the $40 billion supplemental was a provision to help NATO front line states Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania refill their arsenals after donating around $600 million worth of equipment to Ukraine this year.\nThe State Department is expected to send Congress its plan for how to spend over $150 million in replenishment contracts by the end of the month, one European diplomat told POLITICO. The U.S. will spend the money in much the same way as the Ukraine package — awarding contracts to the U.S. defense industry to make weapons for the allies.\nAll three Baltic states sent hundreds of their Javelin and Stinger missiles at the start of the war, along with howitzers, small arms, communications equipment and mortars, and are eager to replenish their stocks. The trio has also come out forcefully in favor of cutting off Russian energy imports to Europe and banning tourist visas for Russian citizens, moves that have put them in the Kremlin’s crosshairs.\nThe U.S. pledged the three nations $180 million in military aid as part of the Baltic Security Initiative in the 2022 federal budget, an increase of $10 million over the 2021 package.\nThe U.S. has also pledged $64.5 million to help Estonia acquire the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System that has proved so effective against Russian forces in Ukraine; in July, Congress approved the sale of six HIMARS to Estonia.\nAlexander Ward contributed to this report.",

        "description": "President Joe Biden has appointed Kimberly Cheatle to be the next director of the Secret Service.\nBiden on Wednesday called Cheatle “a distinguished law enforcement professional with exceptional leadership skills,” saying in a statement that she “was easily the best choice to lead the agency at a critical moment for the Secret Service.” In this new role, she will become the second woman to lead the Secret Service, after former President Barack Obama appointed Julia Pierson as the first in 2013.\nCheatle will be taking over at an agency facing a number of issues. On July 13, Congress was notified by Homeland Security’s inspector general that the Secret Service had lost texts related to the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol while erasing employees’ phones as part of a new protocol. The House select committee investigating the attack then subpoenaed the agency for its records, concerned that federal records laws could have been violated if the messages weren’t preserved.\nDHS Inspector General Joseph Cuffari seemed to push back against the increased scrutiny. POLITICO reported at the beginning of August that Cuffari wrote in a work email that “because of the U.S. Attorney General guidelines and quality standards, we cannot always publicly respond to untruths and false information about our work.” He continued: “I am so proud of the resilience I have witnessed in the face of this onslaught of meritless criticism.”\nShortly after, the chair of Jan. 6 committee, Rep. Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), and Oversight chair Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) sent a letter saying they had documents that “raise troubling new concerns that your office not only failed to notify Congress for more than a year that critical evidence in this investigation was missing, but your senior staff deliberately chose not to pursue that evidence and then appear to have taken steps to cover up these failures.”\nTackling these problems will be part of the next phase of Cheatle’s 25-year-plus career with the Secret Service. She has served numerous leadership roles within the agency, including becoming the first woman to serve in the role of assistant director of protective operations, in October 2019.\nBiden “came to trust her judgment and counsel” when she was on his security detail as vice president, he said in his statement. In 2021, Biden awarded her a Presidential Rank Award, “recognizing her among a select group of career members of the Senior Executive Service for exceptional performance over an extended period of time.”\nCheatle is currently a senior director at PepsiCo North America, where she oversees facilities, personnel and business continuity.",

        "description": "California is on track to ban new gas-powered car sales this week. Meanwhile, an Interior Department watchdog says a former secretary lied to investigators, and drought threatens “catastrophe” in the Horn of Africa.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is Overnight Energy &amp; Environment, your source for the latest news focused on energy, the environment and beyond. For The Hill, we’re Rachel Frazin and Zack Budryk. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCalifornia to pass 2035 ban of gas car sales\n\n\n\nCalifornia is expected on Thursday to approve a ban on the sale of new gas-powered cars that would begin in 2035.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state’s Air Resources Board on Thursday will vote on&nbsp;the ban, which would also ratchet up the percentage of vehicles sold in the state that are electric leading up to the 2035 date.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat comes next? California’s clean car standards are also often adopted by other states, so the impact of this rule could stretch far beyond its borders.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGas-powered cars are a major source of climate-warming emissions and other air pollutants, and the measure has been touted as an attempt to both tackle climate change and improve public health.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2020, California Gov.&nbsp;Gavin Newsom&nbsp;(D)&nbsp;issued an executive order&nbsp;seeking to phase out the sale of gasoline-powered cars by 2035, but Thursday’s action will actually put that goal in motion.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow does it compare to the White House target? The California plan is more ambitious than federal goals. President&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;said last year&nbsp;that he hoped that half of new vehicle sales would be electric by 2030. That year, California’s regulations would mandate 68 percent of vehicle sales in the state are electric.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAutomakers in recent months have moved toward increasing electric vehicle sales, with several making pledges to increase the proportion of vehicles they sell that are electric.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the rule here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWatchdog: Trump Interior head misled investigators \n\n\n\nFormer Interior Secretary&nbsp;Ryan Zinke&nbsp;and his chief of staff misled an internal federal watchdog about the department’s decision to punt on a proposed Native American casino in Connecticut, the watchdog said in a report released Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Interior Department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG)&nbsp;wrote in the report that in May 2017, an unnamed political consultant texted a casino lobbyist to inform him he would be dining with Zinke. The consultant confirmed to the OIG that he and Zinke regularly dined together and discussed the casino lobby’s arguments against amendments by two tribes to allow them to construct casinos off-reservation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn interviews with OIG personnel, Zinke — who is now the GOP nominee for a new congressional district in western Montana — reportedly said he had not discussed the matter with the lobbyist, who was also unnamed, saying if he had interacted with the lobbyist it was only in a casual social setting.\n\n\n\nHowever, in the report, OIG wrote that “extensive evidence” indicated the lobbyist had specifically used the consultant to convey his concerns to Zinke.&nbsp;The consultant told the OIG that in addition to discussing the casino’s arguments against the tribes at multiple dinners, he also asked Zinke if he could send him a one-page summary of those arguments in August 2017, to which Zinke responded, “Sure.”Later that month, both the lobbyist and the consultant dined at Zinke’s house, which the consultant said was specifically to allow the lobbyist to make his case directly to Zinke.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe OIG referred its finding in 2018 to the Justice Department, which declined to take action.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZinke responds: In a response included with the OIG report, Zinke denied any wrongdoing and suggested the report’s release was improper ahead of the 2022 midterm elections, as he is a candidate for a House seat. Zinke’s attorneys also called the report’s findings inaccurate, noting that he did not outright reject the proposal and thus “did not adopt the position of any lobbyist for or against the project.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the report here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKids enduring Africa drought close to ‘catastrophe’\n\n\n\nChildren in two vast regions of Africa could die in devastating numbers due to the compounding effects of malnutrition and waterborne illnesses, the United Nations’s International Children’s Emergency Fund (UNICEF) warned on Tuesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe children at particular risk are those who live in the Horn of Africa — Ethiopia, Kenya and Somalia — and several countries in the semi-arid Sahel region, including Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali, Niger and Nigeria, according to the agency.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUNICEF issued the warning in conjunction with the first day of World Water Week — organized annually by the Stockholm International Water Institute —&nbsp;which began on the same morning.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“History shows that when high levels of severe acute malnutrition in children combine with deadly outbreaks of diseases like cholera or diarrhea, child mortality rises dramatically – and tragically,” UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a statement.\n\n\n\n“When water either isn’t available or is unsafe, the risks to children multiply exponentially,” Russell continued. “Across the Horn of Africa and the Sahel, millions of children are just one disease away from catastrophe.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than 2.8 million children across these two regions are already enduring acute malnutrition, meaning that they are at up to 11 times greater risk of dying from waterborne illnesses than their well-nourished peers, according to UNICEF.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more from The Hill’s Sharon Udasin. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nThis massive wind farm could save California — and forever change the American West (The Los Angeles Times) The Gulf's first offshore wind energy zones prompt concerns from Texas, shrugs from Louisiana (NOLA.com) Biden admin eyes funding Canadian mining (E&amp;E News) Beshear calls special session of Kentucky legislature to address flood relief (The Courier-Journal) Solar power is booming in Germany as Russia turns down the gas (CNN)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💒 Lighter click: Swimming down the aisle. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for today, thanks for reading.

        "description": "Dolphins exposed to a massive oil slick released by the 2010 Deepwater Horizon spill have undergone troubling changes to their genomes, a new study has found.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe animals, sampled in Louisiana’s Barataria Bay in 2013, showed damage to the parts of their genomes that control immune response and cellular health, according to the study, published on Wednesday in PLOS One. \n\n\n\nThis discovery tracks with post-spill observations by wildlife veterinarians — who identified dolphins afflicted with conditions from lung disease to reproductive failure, the study noted. \n\n\n\nMany of those conditions seen in the field mirrored those found in laboratory animals exposed to oil, according to a 2013 study in Environmental Science and Technology. \n\n\n\nThe 2013 study also found that Barataria Bay dolphins were five times more likely to experience moderate-to-severe lung disease compared to average dolphins.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe correlation between observed and genomic data could help scientists more accurately assess the damage done to dolphins by future spills, the PLOS paper noted. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFloods elicit disaster declaration, silence on climate\n\n\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) signed a disaster declaration on Tuesday for 23 counties inundated by the previous day’s severe floods, which left at least one person dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYears of fierce weather pile on: But even as meteorologists described the flooding as a “one-in-a-thousand-years” event, Abbott declined to mention the words “climate change,” The Dallas Morning News reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis week’s disaster comes after years of heat and cold extremes, wildfires and tornadoes afflicting North Texas.&nbsp;&nbsp;The declaration allows the state to implement emergency powers to respond to the situation.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIgnoring climate change: “We have constant conversation about what we categorize as extreme weather,” Abbott said at a press briefing, acknowledging that “we are dealing with more extreme weather patterns,” according to the Morning News.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut when a Spectrum News 1 journalist asked the governor specifically about climate change, Abbott refused to respond to the question, the Morning News reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNeed for preparedness: While Abbott refused to acknowledge climate change, officials did urge property owners to recognize the changing weather and boost their preparedness, Fox 7 Austin reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSecuring federal aid depends on damage reports generated by residents.&nbsp;&nbsp;The state is documenting nearly $50 million of uninsured loss to public property across the state — equivalent to about 800 uninsured homes. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow extreme has the weather been? The Dallas-Fort Worth area set a record for its wettest August since 1899, The Wall Street Journal reported, citing the National Weather Service.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAugust rainfall in the region surpassed the 1915 record of 10.3 inches.&nbsp;&nbsp;Yet much of Texas has been experiencing drought: Before this weekend’s event, Dallas-Fort Worth had a rain deficit of more than 16 inches for the past year.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDeadly floodwaters: Motor vehicles ended up stuck on roads, while homes and businesses were flooded during the weekend’s storms, according to the Journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring the nearly 24-hour stretch of rainfall from Sunday through Monday, Dallas’s fire department said it responded to 195 water-related incidents.  A 60-year-old woman died when her car was swept away in the floods, Dallas County Judge Clay Jenkins confirmed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNative communities fight climate invasion \n\n\n\nOn opposite coasts of the United States, two Native American communities are working to restore damage that climate change and invasive species caused to their traditional homes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nReclaiming Plymouth: In the heat of the summer, volunteers cleared thickets of invasive Japanese knotweed from the Wampanoag Common Lands project in coastal Massachusetts, according to The Associated Press.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe project aims to convert a 32-acre plot of coastal Massachusetts back to something like its ecosystem before European colonization, founder Ramona Peters told the AP.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe site is highly symbolic: It’s just 5 miles from where the Pilgrims landed at Plymouth Rock.&nbsp;“This is basically where the first impact of colonization of this country happened,” Peters said. “It’s very significant that it’s been returned to us.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrapping crabs: Meanwhile in Washington State, members of the Shoalwater Bay Indian tribe are racing to stem booming populations of invasive European green crabs, according to a second AP story.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe tribe hopes to deploy federal funds to trap tens of thousands of the crabs this year, the AP reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe crabs consume native shellfish and aquatic life, undermining food webs that the regions’ animal — and human — life depends on. “We’re not seeing a let-up on any of the numbers we’re trapping and there’s no population reduction we’ve seen anywhere,” Shoalwater Bay Indian Tribe Director of Natural Resources Larissa Pfleeger-Ritzman told the AP. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLow-cost batteries made from plentiful materials\n\n\n\nAn international team of scientists say they have innovated a new type of battery made from much more abundant and inexpensive materials than today’s lithium-ion cells.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTheir technology aims to fulfill a gap in a world that has become increasingly hungry for energy storage solutions, according to the researchers, who published their findings in Nature on Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor small-scale storage, cars: “I wanted to invent something that was better, much better, than lithium-ion batteries for small-scale stationary storage,” senior author Donald Sadoway, a professor of materials chemistry at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat’s in the new battery? The new battery uses aluminum and sulfur as its two electrode materials, with a molten salt electrolyte in between them, as detailed in the study.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAluminum is the second-most-abundant metal in the marketplace and the most abundant metal on Earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The researchers chose sulfur, the cheapest of all non-metals, as the second electrode material. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd the electrolyte? For this key component of the battery, Sadoway said he and his colleagues decided that they “were not going to use the volatile flammable organic liquids.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSuch liquids have caused dangerous fires in cars and in other uses of lithium-ion batteries.&nbsp;&nbsp;They settled on molten salts that have relatively low melting points, as the resultant batteries wouldn’t require special insulation and anticorrosion measures. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat’s wrong with lithium? In addition to being expensive, lithium batteries contain a flammable electrolyte, which makes them more hazardous for use in transportation, the authors explained.\n\n\n\nWhat about the charge rate? The researchers demonstrated that their battery cells could endure hundreds of cycles at what they described as “exceptionally high charging rates.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe projected cost per cell was about one-sixth that of similar lithium-ion batteries.&nbsp;&nbsp;Charging rate depended on working temperature, with 110 degrees Celsius (230 degrees Fahrenheit) garnering 25 times faster rates than 25 C (77 F).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIs this scalable? That remains to be seen. Sadoway has co-founded a spinoff company called Avanti, which has licensed the patents to the system.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The first order of business for the company is to demonstrate that it works at scale,” Sadoway said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInsect protein could come to convenience stores \n\n\n\nConvenience store snacks might soon receive a bug-derived boost in protein and flavor.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nScientists from South Korea have formulated seasonings from ground-up mealworms that mimic the flavor of meat — in hopes of sneaking sustainable nutrition into the diets of those reluctant to eat insects.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOvercoming the ‘yuck’: Mealworms harvested at various ages and cooked in various ways produce convincingly “meat-like” flavors and odors, according to the researchers, who presented their findings at the American Chemical Society’s annual fall meeting.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe team identified nearly 100 potential savory flavors in mealworms — 10 of which passed muster with a focus group.&nbsp;“Insects are a nutritious and healthy food source with high amounts of fatty acids, vitamins, minerals, fiber and high-quality protein, which is like that of meat,” lead author In Hee Cho of South Korea’s Wonkwang University said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCan small animals replace big ones? Protein from small animals like insects can help the world escape the trap created by reliance on protein from larger ones like cows and sheep, the scientists explained.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGrowing concerns: These issues will likely be magnified in the future, if population projections are fulfilled. The world population is expected to hit 8.5 billion by 2030, reach nearly 10 billion by 2050 and pass 11 billion by 2100, according to the United Nations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Eating insects has become of interest because of the increasing cost of animal protein, as well as the associated environmental issues,” Cho said.&nbsp;Livestock currently takes up nearly 80 percent of current global farmland, but produces less than 20 percent of its calories and less than 40 percent of its protein, according to science publication Our World in Data. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe growing need for pasture for animals like cattle is a major source of deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWater Wednesday\n\n\n\nIndian scientists work around drought’s impact on dairy, China’s heat wave cripples hydropower and drought reveals an ancient dinosaur “trackway.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmid drought, scientists in India work to preserve dairy industry&nbsp;\n\n\n\nScientists at India’s National Dairy Research Institute are working to maintain the country’s role as a “dairy powerhouse” in a region grappling with climate-induced drought conditions, The New York Times reported. Researchers are exploring everything from testing out shrubs that are higher in protein, running trials on mineral intake of cattle and playing soft flute music to reduce animal stress, according to the Times.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChina’s heat wave cripples hydropower operations&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe unprecedented heat wave scorching China has become so severe that many areas are encountering hydropower shortages, The Washington Post reported. After hydropower in the province of Sichuan plunged below half its normal level, 67 coal plants had to begin “firing on all cylinders” and produce as much power as possible, according to the Post.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDrought reveals Texas dinosaur tracks&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFalling water levels in a north Texas state have revealed enormous dinosaur tracks, according to a video posed by the group Friends of Dinosaur Valley State Park. The 113-million-year-old tracks were left by fast-moving carnivorous Acrocanthosaurs and ponderous long-necked Sauroposeidon, CNN reported. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease visit The Hill’s Sustainability section online for the web version of this newsletter and more stories.

        "description": "Since the first photos debuted from NASA's new James Webb in July, a steady stream of breathtaking images have been released by the groundbreaking telescope.\n\n\n\nThe $10 billion James Webb telescope, which replaced the aging Hubble telescope and launched into space in December 2021, has captured distant galaxies, blazing stars light years away and a new image of Jupiter.\n\n\n\nHere are five of the most stunning photos taken by James Webb to date.\n\n\n\nSouthern Ring Nebula \n\n\n\nNASA and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)\n\n\n\nOne of the most widely circulated across the web is of the Southern Ring Nebula, which was among the first Webb photos released on July 12.\n\n\n\nWebb captured the remains of a white dwarf — the remnant of a star that has burned up all its nuclear fuel and expelled its outer shell into a planetary nebula.\n\n\n\nThe telescope collected the images in infrared light. Compared to Hubble, the James Webb telescope can capture space in the infrared with much more power, \"providing never-before-seen vistas of the universe,\" NASA officials wrote on the agency's website.\n\n\n\nNASA released an image of the Southern Ring Nebula in near-infrared light (NIRcam) and mid-infrared (MIRcam), with the former closer to a visible wavelength the normal human eye can see, making its images more colorful and high-resolution.\n\n\n\nThe MIRcam, however, can pick up objects in more detail. For example, the mid-infrared image of Southern Ring Nebula shows a clearer image of a bright star, gleaming in the background just beyond the white dwarf.\n\n\n\nCosmic Cliffs\n\n\n\nVia NASA and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)\n\n\n\nAnother popular image is the Cosmic Cliffs, the edge of a forming star region that NASA compared to \"craggy mountains on a moonlit evening.\"\n\n\n\nThe young, star-forming region called NGC 3324 is more than 7,000 light years away in the Carina Nebula. NASA's photos of this spot in the universe reveal a massive, gaseous cavity on the edge of NGC 3324 in a collage of orange and blue.\n\n\n\n\"The cavernous area has been carved from the nebula by the intense ultraviolet radiation and stellar winds from extremely massive, hot, young stars located in the center of the bubble,\" officials wrote on the website.\n\n\n\nIn NIRcam, viewers can see hundreds of stars hidden from the normal human eye, as well as numerous galaxies shimmering in the background.\n\n\n\nNGC 3324 was first recorded by astronomer James Dunlop in 1826.\n\n\n\nCartwheel Galaxy \n\n\n\nNASA and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)\n\n\n\nThis Aug. 2 photo of the Cartwheel Galaxy bears similarity to a bright red, galactic ferris wheel in space.\n\n\n\nThe Cartwheel Galaxy formed about 400 million years ago, the result of high-speed collisions. Webb captured it forming in a \"transitory phase,\" because images of the universe light-years away are peering into the past, due to the time it takes to reach and record them.\n\n\n\nThis spiral galaxy is composed of two rings, a brighter inner ring and a colorful outer ring, according to NASA. Inside the cartwheel are spokes, or bright red streaks created by glowing, hydrocarbon-rich dust.\n\n\n\nJupiter\n\n\n\nNASA and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)\n\n\n\nWebb's newest image released this week is a gorgeous image of Earth's neighbor in the solar system.\n\n\n\nA composite of three filters, the image of Jupiter reveals \"hazes swirling around the northern and southern poles\" of the gaseous planetary giant. \n\n\n\nIt also highlights the Great Red Spot, a storm so large that it that would swallow Earth, in a large white band around the gas giant.\n\n\n\nImke de Pater, a professor emerita of the University of California, Berkeley, who co-led the observations of Jupiter, said the team was surprised by the details of the planet.\n\n\n\n\"We hadn't expected it to be this good,\" Pater said in a statement on NASA's blog. \"It’s really remarkable that we can see details on Jupiter together with its rings, tiny satellites,&nbsp;and even galaxies in one image.\"\n\n\n\nGalaxy cluster SMACS 0723\n\n\n\nNASA and the Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI)\n\n\n\nWhile appearing a bit cluttered, this image is stunning because it shows thousands of galaxies in a distant cluster known as SMACS 0723.\n\n\n\nThis image, among the first photos released by Webb on July 12, is the first deep-field image from the telescope.\n\n\n\nIn the center of the image is a bright, white elliptical galaxy that outshines the rest, stretching its pointed arms in five directions. Surrounding it are galaxies of all shapes and sizes, flooding the image and demonstrating just how massive the universe is.\n\n\n\nThis image was landmark, NASA wrote in July, as it showcased how Webb \"will allow future researchers to finely catalog the precise compositions of galaxies in the early universe, which may ultimately reshape our understanding of how galaxies changed and evolved over billions of years.\"",

        "description": "The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released new advice Wednesday on ways critical infrastructure should prepare for potential security risks stemming from quantum computing.\n\n\n\nWhile quantum computing provides greater speed and power than classical computers, the emerging technology comes with potential risks, including data breaches, that could threaten the security of business transactions, secure communications, digital signatures and customer information.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“While post-quantum computing is expected to produce significant benefits, we must take action now to manage potential risks, including the ability to break public key encryption that U.S. networks rely on to secure sensitive information,” Mona Harrington, acting assistant director for CISA's National Risk Management Center, said in a statement.\n\n\n\n“Critical infrastructure and government leaders must be proactive and begin preparing for the transition to post-quantum cryptography now,” Harrington added.\n\n\n\nPost-quantum cryptography refers to the cryptographic algorithms used to secure a system against an attack by a quantum computer.\n\n\n\nUnlike classical computers, quantum computers uses quantum bits rather than binary bits to perform at greater speed and power, allowing them to potentially break through public key encryption used to secure data.\n\n\n\nCISA urged all critical infrastructure owners and operators to follow&nbsp;the&nbsp;Preparing for Post-Quantum Cryptography road map&nbsp;released by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the&nbsp;Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology.\n\n\n\nThe road map guides stakeholders in critical infrastructure on steps they can take to prepare their organizations for the transition to post-quantum cryptography, including&nbsp;identifying, prioritizing and protecting potentially vulnerable data, algorithms, protocols and systems.\n\n\n\n“We must prepare for [the transition] now to protect the confidentiality of data that already exists today and remains sensitive in the future,” said&nbsp;DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas at a&nbsp;March conference.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCISA’s guide follows a cybersecurity bill&nbsp;introduced in the Senate&nbsp;in July that would require federal agencies to improve and update their defenses against data breaches enabled by quantum computing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The development of quantum computers is one of the next frontiers in technology, and with this emerging technology comes new risks as well,” said Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), a co-sponsor of the bill.&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3614571-new-steps-to-protect-consumers-from-salmonella-in-poultry/",
        "description": "As you read this, millions of Americans across the country are preparing meals for their families, friends, or themselves. Some may be racing to pack lunches for their kids, others might be preparing for a large family gathering. Regardless of the purpose of a meal, we can all relate to how food brings us together and that is why we want the safest options for all of us. When it comes to food safety, the United States has one of the strongest system in the world, but foodborne bacteria, including&nbsp;Salmonella,&nbsp;continue to sicken hundreds of thousands of people every year.\n\n\n\nAt USDA, under President Biden’s leadership, keeping all of us safe from foodborne illnesses is not only our duty, but our mission. As secretary of Agriculture, one of my key priorities is ensuring that the American public has access to a safe food supply.&nbsp;Our food safety system is robust, but we recognize that there is always room to improve.\n\n\n\nDespite data showing that&nbsp;Salmonella&nbsp;contamination in poultry has been decreasing since the 1990s, there has not been a reduction in&nbsp;Salmonella illnesses. Every year, we see nearly 1.35 million&nbsp;Salmonella&nbsp;infections. Almost one quarter of those are attributed to poultry consumption.\n\n\n\nWhen we look at these numbers, it is evident that we need to reevaluate our current approach to controlling&nbsp;Salmonellain poultry.&nbsp;Most of us agree that contaminated meat and poultry products that make consumers sick should not be sold to the American public.&nbsp;That is why the USDA’s Food Safety and Inspection Service (FSIS) is developing a new approach to better protect the American public.&nbsp;Recently, we announced a significant action that USDA is taking related to&nbsp;Salmonella&nbsp;in raw poultry.\n\n\n\nThis fall, USDA will take the critical step of declaring&nbsp;Salmonella&nbsp;as an&nbsp;adulterant&nbsp;— or substance that can compromise the safety of a product — in breaded and stuffed raw chicken products, a decision that will enable us to stop their sale when we find contamination. When a food product is adulterated, it cannot be sold to the public.\n\n\n\nBreaded and stuffed raw chicken products have been a consistent source of&nbsp;Salmonella&nbsp;infections for decades and have been associated with 14 illness outbreaks. The most recent outbreak was just last year and resulted in illnesses across 11 states. At the root of these outbreaks is the fact that people often do not realize these items are raw because the outside of the product may appear browned and cooked. This misleads consumers to believe that what they are about to eat has already been cooked to a safe temperature, leading some to ignore cooking instructions. Efforts to improve labeling of these products have not led to a reduction in outbreaks.\n\n\n\nThis announcement is important because it is the first time that Salmonellais being declared an adulterant in a class of raw poultry products. But it is just the first step in our efforts. We know that to move closer to our&nbsp;national public health targets,&nbsp;we must continue taking decisive action to control&nbsp;Salmonella&nbsp;in all poultry products. In the fall, FSIS will be presenting a proposed framework for a new comprehensive strategy to reduce&nbsp;Salmonellaillnesses linked to poultry and convening a public meeting to discuss it. The main components of our proposed framework include: enforceable final product standards aimed at ensuring that poultry products with levels or types of&nbsp;Salmonellacontamination that make people sick are not sold to consumers; modifications to our slaughter and processing regulations to better ensure that&nbsp;Salmonella&nbsp;contamination is reduced throughout the slaughter and production process; and a requirement that&nbsp;Salmonella&nbsp;test results accompany each flock as it enters the establishment.\n\n\n\nAs we have done throughout this process, USDA will continue to collaborate extensively with all stakeholders on&nbsp;this new strategy that better protects consumers from foodborne illness. We will devote the necessary resources to advancing this effort and will continue listening to thoughtful feedback along the way.\n\n\n\nWhen it comes to feeding Americans, even one foodborne illness is one too many. If that one illness involves your loved one — particularly a young child or older relative who can suffer serious infections, this problem ceases to be one of merely science and becomes something very personal. By addressing the dangers of&nbsp;Salmonella&nbsp;head on, we can make meaningful improvements to food safety and take one step closer to an America where this microscopic threat is reduced.\n\n\n\nTom Vilsack is U.S. Department of Agriculture secretary.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/3614594-senate-report-blasts-irs-for-handling-of-foreign-bank-registration/",
        "description": "A Senate report released Thursday on a form of tax evasion was highly critical of the IRS for the way it handles foreign bank registration as part of the laws that govern how U.S. citizens and business entities can own foreign assets.\n\n\n\nThe report said that it was “shockingly easy” to obtain a certain kind of registration number from the IRS that signifies its holder to be a valid foreign financial institution. The registration process was mandated as part of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) passed in 2010, which requires Americans to report assets held outside the U.S. to the IRS.\n\n\n\n“An entity must simply fill out a Form 8957 with the IRS, or register via an online portal. Applications are almost always approved without meaningful investigation or due diligence from IRS personnel,” the report found.\n\n\n\nA write-up of the report from the Senate Finance Committee described the process of obtaining registration numbers — known as Global Intermediary Identification Numbers (GIIN) — as “alarmingly simple.” \n\n\n\n“Applications to obtain a GIIN number and become a foreign financial institution under FATCA are nearly always approved without meaningful review by IRS personnel,” it added. \n\n\n\nIRS representatives told committee staff the IRS does not adhere to the financial institution’s FATCA compliance protocol prior to issuance of the GIIN.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In addition, the IRS does not ask questions about the entity’s assets, source of funds or wealth, beneficial ownership, or business and investment activities,” the Senate Finance Committee’s write-up said.\n\n\n\nThe report may be a sign that the 2010 FATCA legislation will be the subject of some reinvigorated attention from the IRS, which received a major funding boost in Democrats’ tax, climate and health care bill recently signed by President Biden.\n\n\n\nAn April report from the Treasury inspector general for tax administration found that in 2018, “despite spending almost $380 million on FATCA compliance, the IRS had taken limited or no action on a majority of the planned activities outlined in the FATCA Compliance Roadmap.”\n\n\n\nRepublicans have railed against the funding boost for the IRS in the Democrats' Inflation Reduction Act, arguing that it will result in an increased number of audits against the middle class and small-business owners.\n\n\n\n“My colleagues claim this massive funding boost will allow the IRS to go after millionaires, billionaires and so-called rich ‘tax cheats,’ but the reality is a significant portion raised from their IRS funding bloat would come from taxpayers with income below $400,000,” Senate Finance Committee ranking member Mike Crapo (R-Idaho) said in a statement earlier this month.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic lawmakers and members of the Biden administration have said that increased enforcement efforts from the IRS will be directed at corporations and richer Americans.\n\n\n\n“These investments will not result in households earning $400,000 per year or lessor small businesses seeing an increase in the chances that they are audited relative to historical levels. Instead, they will allow the IRS to work to end the two-tiered tax system, where most Americans pay what they owe, but those at the top of the distribution often do not,” Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrote to IRS Commissioner Charles Rettig in an Aug. 17 memo.",

        "description": "President Biden on Wednesday tapped a 27-year veteran of the Secret Service to serve as the agency’s next director.\n\n\n\nKimberly Cheatle will take over for retiring Director James Murray, who briefly delayed his exit for the private sector amid questions about the conduct of Secret Service agents related to Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\n\n“Jill and I know firsthand Kim’s commitment to her job and to the Secret Service’s people and mission,” Biden said in a statement. “When Kim served on my security detail when I was Vice President, we came to trust her judgement and counsel.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“She is a distinguished law enforcement professional with exceptional leadership skills, and was easily the best choice to lead the agency at a critical moment for the Secret Service,” Biden added. “She has my complete trust, and I look forward to working with her.”\n\n\n\nCheatle served for 27 years in the Secret Service, including as part of Biden’s detail while he was vice president. She also served in various other leadership roles, including as assistant to the special agent in charge for the Vice Presidential Protective Division and as resident agent in charge for the Secret Service’s office in Grand Rapids, Mich.\n\n\n\nBiden previously awarded her with a Presidential Rank Award in 2021 for her service.\n\n\n\nCheatle will rejoin the Secret Service from her current role as senior director at PepsiCo North America, where she manages facilities, personnel and business continuity.\n\n\n\nMurray, who has led the agency since 2019, announced in July he would retire. Multiple reports indicated he was leaving to take a job with Snapchat.\n\n\n\nLater that month, however, Murray announced he was delaying his departure as the agency came under scrutiny for its actions as part of the investigation being conducted by a special House committee into the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\n\n\nOne witness, Cassidy Hutchinson, testified that she heard secondhand that then-President Trump physically confronted Secret Service agents when he was told he could not go to the Capitol with supporters that day.\n\n\n\nThe House committee is also looking into how text messages among agents from that day were deleted.",

        "description": "The 2022 Minnesota State Fair is almost here so MPR News reached out to Minnesota celebrities for their must eat, must drink and must see of the Minnesota State Fair. Here’s what they said. Keith Marler, Fox 9 meteorologistEat: Since I&#x27;m out there almost every day, I hold pretty strong to my &quot;take a bite and move on&quot; mantra. With all the old favorites and new stuff I&#x27;m exposed to on a daily basis, I&#x27;d need to be rolled out of there by Labor Day every year if I finished everything I try. But, I always am a sucker for Al&#x27;s Subs’ biscuits and gravy a few mornings and Bayou Bob&#x27;s alligator sauté at least two or three times. Drink: Several years ago I was introduced by a friend to the wonderful concept of a Fair breakfast beer so at least once during the Fair, when the morning show is done, he and I will meet up and toast the morning at the Ballpark Cafe (but only on a day I don&#x27;t have to do the 11 a.m. show) See: I think the &quot;must sees&quot; are just making the rounds visiting the tons of friends I&#x27;ve made at different vendors, booths and exhibits over the last 19 years. I only see most of these folks once a year, and so the Fair truly has evolved into a crazy 12-day family reunion for me. Minnesota Governor Tim WalzEat: Pork chop on a stick.Drink: Not only do I love visiting the all-you-can-drink milk booth, I’ll be chipping in as a volunteer this year.See: I’ll miss butter carving hall-of-famer Linda Christensen, but I can’t wait to see Gerry Kulzer take over the butter! Kate DiCamillo, author Eat: I love to get to the fair very, very early in the morning. I get a breakfast burrito. Drink: A cup of coffee. See: The animal barns. there is something utterly heavenly about being down there in the early morning. Let me quote E.B. White (“Charlotte&#x27;s Web”):  &quot;The barn was very large.  It was very old.  It smelled of hay and it smelled of manure.  It smelled of the perspiration of tired horses and the wonderful sweet breath of patient cows. It often had a very peaceful smell — as though nothing bad could happen ever again in the world.&quot;Bad Bad Hats, local band Eat: Sweet Martha&#x27;s Cookies and an ear of roasted corn.Drink: The first and most-interesting sounding beer we find. See: The giant prize-winning vegetables. Jana Shortal, KARE 11 journalist and anchor Eat: Danielson and Sons onion ringsDrink: The coldest or freshest local IPA. I’ll wander near and far on the fairgrounds to find it. See: Easy — amateur talent show. Fairborn and Fairchild, Minnesota State Fair mascotsEat: We love ALL the food at the fair, but as gophers, we’re natural herbivores – so, don’t tell, but we like to get our snack fix at the crops planted near Little Farm Hands.Drink: We are naturally partial to the malts from the Gopher Dairy Bar. The name says it all!See: The daily parade of course! It features two of our absolute favorite mascots … US!State Fair mascot Fairchild in 1998Courtesy of Minnesota State Fair ArchivesBenjamin Percy, author and screenwriterEat: Eating is the reason I go to the fair. The hot chicken sandwich at Blue Barn is a favorite, but I&#x27;m also going to shove a few pronto pups (not corndogs!) and cream puffs and cheese curds and buttered cobs in my mouth. We always review the food listings in advance and hit up some of the new and gourmet offerings as well. I will definitely be wearing the stretchy pants and medicating with a Costco-sized helping of Tums.Drink: It is a truth universally acknowledged that whatever day I attend the fair turns out to be the hottest of the year. Which means I&#x27;m always in the mood for a cold beer. I like the idea of being adventurous and trying some of the more experimental brews, but ... I tend to stick to my local IPAs: Surly, Summit and Mad Butcher to name a few.See: My wife was a 4-H kid, so she has a long history with the fair and might be its ultimate fan. She likes to go multiple times and map out the entire day in advance. I have my favorites, like the haunted house, but I defer to her. And her ultimate site — which she regards with an almost holy reverence — is the giant slide. She even has a T-shirt. And she claims she&#x27;ll be going down it until she&#x27;s 100. So we always shout and whoop our way down it.Sven Sundgaard, MPR news meteorologistEat: I love to hit the turkey stand near the DNR area. I try to be reasonably healthy and the plain hot turkey sandwich is a must for me: TONS of protein and it’s delicious! Then I feel less guilty about other things like fried pickles and mini donuts, which are also a must of mine. They’re simple, but the Tiny Tim donuts are nostalgia for me, I always got them with my late grandpa. Drink:  If it’s midday and hot, nothing sounds good like an ice cold Diet Coke, but we’ve become a fan of that new mini donut beer. It sounds weird, but it was great.See: All of the animals. I think a lot of people forget what the fair is about. Having grown up on a hobby farm with horses and goats, I always wanted to see what everyone else’s goats and horses looked like and my favorite animal: the pigs. I always wanted a pig but my parents never got me one … I’m still bitter … but I do like to visit them. Kelly Barnhill, author Eat: The corn on the cob, or maybe Martha’s Cookies, or maybe those spicy walleye cakes I had one time at a booth I can’t remember and have been looking for ever since. Drink: The bottomless cups of milk, how does it taste so much better there than at home?The new babies at the Miracle of Life Center obviously, and maybe the MPR booth, just because. Two girls sit in the hay with their cows inside the cow barn at the Minnesota State Fair in Falcon Heights, Minn.

Drink: Malt or shake at the Dairy building.See: The massive amount of fanny packs.Yia Vang, chef of Union Hmong KitchenEat: This year it&#x27;s our food at the Union Hmong Kitchen booth in the International Bazaar, but I also love the smoked turkey leg from Turkey To Go. Drink: 1919 Root Beer, of course.See: It&#x27;s great to get up high on the Ferris wheel and see the full view of the fair and all of the people.Angela Davis, MPR News hostEat: Roasted corn on the cob, pork chop on a stick, pronto pup and Sweet Martha’s cookiesDrink: Root beerSee: Babies in strollersJoe Schmit, KSTP sports directorEat: Turkey sandwich.Drink: Try out the craft beers.See: It’s a great place for people watchers.Ed Schumacher looks over a cup of Schell&#x27;s Octoberfest and blueberry beers, topped with frozen beer foam.Tim Nelson | MPR NewsLori and Julia, myTalk 107.1Eat: Cheeseburger at the Midways men’s club ($3.50!), tied with a slice of pizza at the pizza wagon ($2!), notice a trend? We know where the good cheap eats are.Drink: Beer at the Frontier Saloon. See: Music, on any stage.Jennie Clark, Minnesota Aurora assistant coachEat: The Minnesota corn dog. Drink: S’mores Beer at Giggles Campfire GrillSee: Giant karaoke. Leif Enger, former MPR News correspondent and local authorI hate to admit it, but the last time I went to the State Fair was in the early 90s when my brother Lin and I were writing mysteries together. I don’t recall what I ate, but my wife Robin says I smelled of garlic after so maybe a gyro. Sorry, I’m a bad person to ask.Alex Goligoski, Minnesota Wild defenseman Eat: I have to have the cheese curds and vanilla milkshake from the Dairy building. Drink: Mini donut beer is great too, so is the dill pickle beer. See: We try to get a concert every year if we can and I love doing the big yellow slide with the kids.This sketch depicts the Giant Slide and the crowds of fairgoers walking by one of the fair&#x27;s oldest attractions.Courtesy of Amber SausenAlec Soth, photographer Eat: Liquid nitrogen ice cream at Nitro Ice Cream.Drink: Kombucha at the Produce Exchange.See: The Miracle of Birth Center, always (though not while drinking kombucha). Chris Carr, K102 morning show hostEat: The porkchop on a stick.

        "description": "Republican gubernatorial candidate Scott Jensen left a GOP media event Wednesday afternoon before reporters could ask him about his comments comparing government masking mandates during the COVID-19 pandemic to the rise of Nazi Germany in the 1930s.Jensen originally made the comments back in April and a video of the remarks surfaced this week.He stood by them on Tuesday in a video posted to Facebook, which he called a “point of clarification.”“So when I make a comparison that says that I saw government policies intruding on American freedoms incrementally, one piece at a time, and compare that to what happened in the 1930s, I think it&#x27;s a legitimate comparison,” Jensen said. “It may not strike your fancy — that&#x27;s fine. But this is how I think, and you don&#x27;t get to be my thought police person.”Jensen’s running mate Matt Birk was asked whether the focus on the comments was a distraction to the campaign.&quot;We know the game. I&#x27;ve been a victim of it. Scott&#x27;s been the victim of it for a long time,” Birk said. “You take a 10 second clips and then everybody — it&#x27;s the age of outrage on Twitter.&quot;While Jensen didn&#x27;t want to expand on the comments Wednesday, his DFL opponent, incumbent Gov. Tim Walz, did answer a question about them.&quot;The idea of using common sense public safety measures that saved lives as well as any state in the country, comparing that to a systematic killing of over 6 million individuals, it&#x27;s just simply unacceptable,&quot; Walz told MPR News.The website TC Jewfolk originally reported on Jensen&#x27;s comments. &quot;The little things grew into something bigger. Then there was a night called Kristallnacht, the night of the breaking glass,&quot; Jensen said at the April event with the group Mask Off Minnesota. &quot;Then there was the book burning, and it kept growing and growing, and a guy named Hitler kept growing in power. In a way, I think that&#x27;s why you&#x27;re here today, is you sense that something is happening, and it&#x27;s growing little by little.&quot;The website quoted the Anti-Defamation League saying that comparisons like Jensen’s are “generally not indications of antisemitic animus; however, they are often used to further a political agenda. Such references are outrageous and may be profoundly hurtful to Jews, many of whom lost family members or carry memories of the trauma suffered by their parents, grandparents and great-grandparents during the destruction of European Jewry.”",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/royals-place-zack-greinke-josh-staumont-on-injured-list.html",
        "description": "The Royals announced that starter Zack Greinke is headed to the 15-day injured list, retroactive to August 21, with forearm tightness. Reliever Josh Staumont is also going on the 15-day IL with biceps tendinitis. Collin Snider and Anthony Misiewicz were recalled from Triple-A Omaha to take the vacated active roster spots.\nGreinke last took the mound on Sunday but came out of his start against the Rays after four innings due to forearm discomfort. How severe the issue is remains unclear, but it&#8217;s worrisome enough the Royals will keep him out of action for at least the next two weeks. It comes at an unfortunate time, as Greinke had allowed only three earned runs in 16 1/3 innings over his most recent three starts. Of course, with the Royals near the bottom of the American League standings and looking ahead to 2023, there&#8217;s little reason for Greinke and the club not to exercise caution with any arm issues.\nSigned to a one-year, $13MM guarantee over the offseason, Greinke has made 21 starts during his second stint in Kansas City. He owns a 4.14 ERA through 108 2/3 innings despite a career-low 13.7% strikeout rate. The 38-year-old no longer throws hard or misses many bats, but he retains elite command and has provided the club with generally solid back-of-the-rotation production. He&#8217;ll again hit the free agent market this winter.\nStaumont has had a very inconsistent 2022 campaign. Long considered one of the organization&#8217;s top pitching prospects, Staumont looked to have settled in as a quality late-game reliever over the prior two seasons. Between 2020-21, he tossed 90 1/3 innings of 2.76 ERA ball while striking out 29% of batters faced. As he had throughout his minor league career, he struggled to throw strikes at times, but his power arsenal was on full display.\nHe&#8217;d remained generally effective through the first few months of this season, working to a 3.67 ERA with a 27.1% strikeout percentage through the All-Star Break. Things have gone completely off the rails in the second half, however, as he&#8217;s been tagged for 16 runs with 11 strikeouts and walks apiece in 10 2/3 innings over his past 12 outings. Staumont will be eligible for arbitration for the first time this winter and is controllable through 2025.\nMisiewicz is now in position to make his team debut. Acquired from the Mariners at the start of the month, he was promptly optioned to Omaha. He&#8217;s allowed three runs in 6 2/3 innings there since the trade, striking out seven with just one walk. The left-hander had made 104 MLB appearances with Seattle over the past three seasons, working to a 4.48 ERA over 88 1/3 frames.",

It would be rare for federal prosecutors to bring an obstruction prosecution that did not itself arise out of a proceeding relating to a separate crime,” Steven Engle, head of OLC, and his deputy Edward O’Callaghan wrote in the memo.\n\n\n\nIt goes on to describe Trump's “potentially obstructive conduct” as “an attempt to modify the process under which the special counsel investigation progressed.”\n\n\n\nCREW President Noah Bookbinder called the memo “a breathtakingly generous view of the law and facts for Donald Trump.”\n\n\n\n“It twists the facts and the law to benefit Trump and does not comport with a serious reading of the law of obstruction of justice or the facts as found by Special Counsel Mueller,” Bookbinder wrote on Twitter.\n\n\n\n“The memo is premised in large part on the argument that there was no underlying criminal conduct and that it’s hard to charge obstruction without an underlying crime. Of course that’s not what Mueller actually found. … Mueller found there was not sufficient evidence to charge Trump and others with conspiring with Russia. He didn’t find no crime, just not enough evidence for charges,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe 448-page Mueller report, which was released in April 2019 almost a month after Barr’s letter to Congress, examined multiple episodes of possible obstruction of justice, including Trump’s firing of then-FBI director James Comey and his efforts to pressure then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions to pull back on his decision to recuse himself from the Russia investigation. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nUltimately, Mueller’s team wrote that they were unable to say definitively that Trump did not obstruct justice. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“While this report does not conclude that the President committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him,” the report stated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAttorney General Merrick Garland has faced pressure from some legal analysts and others on the left to revisit the obstruction of justice case against Trump. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe unredacted memo’s release comes as a result of a ruling last week by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in the long-running lawsuit initiated by CREW in May 2019. The ruling, by a unanimous three-judge appellate court panel, affirmed a federal judge’s conclusion that the DOJ had improperly redacted the memorandum, and ordered its full disclosure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe legal development amounted to a sharp rebuke of the department’s claim that the memo should be shielded under an exemption to the Freedom of Information Act that protects internal government deliberations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe appeals court ruling affirmed a finding by the lower court that the memo did not reflect a deliberative process in part because Barr had already decided against charging Trump before the memo was finalized.\n\n\n\n“Because the Department did not tie the memorandum to deliberations about the relevant decision, the Department failed to justify its reliance on the deliberative-process privilege,” Chief Judge Sri Srinivasan wrote for the panel.\n\n\n\nMorgan Chalfant contributed.\n\n\n\nUpdated: 7:01 p.m.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new report from the Pew Research Center shows that more Americans are considering abortion to be an important issue in this year’s midterm elections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn March, 43 percent of registered voters that responded to a Pew survey considered abortion to be a “very important” issue for the upcoming Congressional elections.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat number jumped to 56 percent in August.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore voters are considering abortion to be a “very important” issue in the upcoming midterm elections, a new study from the Pew Research Center shows.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn March, 43 percent of registered voters considered abortion to be an important issue ahead of the midterms, and now that number has jumped to 56 percent, Pew researchers found.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe issue of abortion has increased in importance among Democratic voters since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, the landmark legislation granting women the right to a legal abortion in the United States, researchers believe.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlmost all of this increase in support has come from Democratic voters, the study shows, with 71 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning registered voters who took part in the study rating abortion as “very important.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, there has been almost no change in the number of Republican voters' attitudes toward abortion.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPew Research Center researchers surveyed 7,647 adults, including 5,681 registered voters, during the first two weeks of August for the new report.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOut of Republican and Republican-leaning voters who responded to the Pew Research Center’s survey, 41 percent said they considered abortion to be “very important” in the decision for the vote in this year’s Congressional elections, only one percentage point higher than what respondents said in a survey in March.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe midterm election will take place on Nov. 8 and all 435 seats in the United States House of Representatives and a third of seats in the Senate are up for grabs.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTIKTOKERS ATTACK TEXAS ABORTION WHISTLEBLOWER WEBSITE\n\n\n\nSOCCER STAR MEGAN RAPINOE TAKES ON NBA STAR DRAYMOND GREEN OVER WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT\n\n\n\nTHESE 10 INSPIRATIONAL WOMEN SHOULD BE HOUSEHOLD NAMES—HERE’S WHY THEY ARE NOT\n\n\n\nWHO SAYS ONE-THIRD OF ALL WOMEN ENCOUNTER PHYSICAL OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE\n\n\n\nThe survey also shows that more Republican than Democratic voters have given “a lot” of thought to this November election.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn August, 72 percent of Republican and Republican-leaning survey respondents said they believed partisan control of Congress really matters while 69 percent of Democratic and Democratic-leaning respondents said the same.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe number of Democrats saying the outcome of the midterm elections really matters have increased by 9 percentage points since March, the survey findings show.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

Yet, we need Congress to pass legislation that provides an enduring solution for the young Dreamers who have known no country other than the United States as their own,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe final regulation, which went through a public comment period, will formally replace the memo on Oct. 31.\n\n\n\nIn its decadelong history, the policy has been subject to extensive litigation, often targeting the validity of implementing a deferral program through a memo.\n\n\n\nIn July 2021, U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen of Texas ruled that DACA was illegal, largely based on the fact that it was created by a memo, rather than a formal rule.\n\n\n\nThat ruling, under appeal in the 5th Circuit, did not strip the 600,000 or so DACA recipients of their benefits, but it did prevent the Biden administration from signing on new applicants.\n\n\n\nOnce the new DACA rule is in place, the Biden administration will be able to accept new applicants.\n\n\n\nBut states like Texas, which filed the lawsuit that led to Hanen's ruling, are certain to open up new litigation that's likely to succeed in delaying enforcement of the new rule.\n\n\n\nAnd the rule maintained the cutoff dates from the original memo, meaning that only Dreamers who arrived in the United States by 2007 are eligible to apply.\n\n\n\nAccording to a new report by FWD.us, a tech industry-linked immigration advocacy group, only about a quarter of the 100,000 Dreamers graduating U.S. high schools this year are eligible for DACA under the current cutoff dates.",

        "description": "Pennsylvania's Senate race has taken a new turn, with GOP nominee&nbsp;Mehmet Oz&nbsp;attacking his Democratic rival&nbsp;John Fetterman's personal health several months after Fetterman suffered a stroke that sidelined him from in-person campaigning.\n\n\n\nOz — who has mostly played defense the past few months amid a slew of online jabs aimed at the former celebrity doctor, including mockery for calling a vegetable tray a crudité — went on the offensive this week while citing the Democrat's health.\n\n\n\n“If John Fetterman had ever eaten a vegetable in his life, then maybe he wouldn’t have had a major stroke and wouldn’t be in the position of having to lie about it constantly,” Rachel Tripp, Oz’s senior communications adviser, said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe Trump-backed candidate quickly drew&nbsp;backlash&nbsp;over his team's remark.\n\n\n\n“I know politics can be nasty, but even then, I could *never* imagine ridiculing someone for their health challenges,” Fetterman tweeted.\n\n\n\n\"The problem for Oz is that voters might very well be concerned about the health and fitness of a candidate after a major stroke, but putting out an attack on that rightly makes you look like a ghoul,” Lakshya Jain, a partner at elections website Split Ticket, told NotedDC.\n\n\n\nSome have defended the move.\n\n\n\nChris Pack, a GOP strategist, said Fetterman needs to “man up” and answer questions surrounding his stroke if he is going to “dish it out” to Oz online, a strategy that he argues falls flat with most voters in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\n“It’s background noise from staffers,” another GOP consultant said of the attack line from Oz's camp. “But I do think it is fair [point] to make. It’s a basic tenant of the job.”\n\n\n\nIn recent weeks, some Republicans,&nbsp;including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell&nbsp;(R-Ky.), have alluded to their doubts of keeping retiring Sen.&nbsp;Pat Toomey’s (R-Pa.) seat, along with others in Georgia and Ohio, because of “candidate quality.”\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report shifted the Keystone State race from a “toss up” to “leaning Democrat” last week.\n\n\n\nRead more from The Hill's campaign team about escalating Senate feud.\n\n\n\nWelcome to&nbsp;NotedDC: Your guide to politics, policy and people of consequence in D.C.

Pell Grant recipients will qualify for up to $20,000.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden also extended the pandemic-prompted pause on loan repayments through Dec. 31 but signaled that payments would resume at the start of 2023 after being on hold for more than two years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill's&nbsp;Alex Gangitano&nbsp;has more from the White House&nbsp;about the plan, which was part of Biden's campaign platform.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd The Hill's Shirin Ali and Adam Barnes have the full breakdown of what's all in the package. \n\n\n\nGOP RIPS RELIEF PLAN\n\n\n\nRepublicans quickly condemned Biden's move, with House Minority Leader&nbsp;Kevin McCarthy&nbsp;(R-Calif.) likening it to a \"debt transfer scam\" and Sen.&nbsp;Ted Cruz&nbsp;(R-Texas) calling it \"a Hail Mary before midterms.\"\n\n\n\n\"Democrats' student loan socialism is a slap in the face to working Americans who sacrificed to pay their debt or made different career choices to avoid debt. A wildly unfair redistribution of wealth toward higher-earning people,\"&nbsp;Senate Minority Leader&nbsp;Mitch McConnell&nbsp;(R-Ky.) said.\n\n\n\nOther Republicans invoked class divides in blasting the relief plan.\n\n\n\n\"[W]elders, plumbers, laborers, &amp; other Mississippians (black, white, Hispanic, etc.) will be forced to pay off the debts of Harvard doctorate degree gender studies majors living in California. Why does the Democrat Party hate working people so much?\"&nbsp;Mississippi Gov.&nbsp;Tate Reeves&nbsp;(R) said.\n\n\n\nDemocrats, including progressives who have pressured the White House for months to take action on the issue, hailed the move as an historic effort to address burgeoning debt for millions of Americans.\n\n\n\n\"President Biden’s action to cancel student debt is life-changing for millions of working people. This is transformative relief for the middle class,\" said Sen.&nbsp;Elizabeth Warren&nbsp;(D-Mass.).\n\n\n\n\"President Biden is canceling up to $20,000 of federal student loan debt. This will undoubtedly transform lives,\" stated Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.). \"Grateful for the organizers, activists, and advocates who never let up in the push for student debt cancellation. This victory is because of you.\" \n\n\n\nDemocrats scramble for top Oversight position\n\n\n\nDemocrats are racing to throw their names into the ring to succeed&nbsp;Rep.&nbsp;Carolyn Maloney&nbsp;(D-N.Y.) as the top Democrat on the House Oversight and Reform Committee after she lost her primary on Tuesday to Rep.&nbsp;Jerry Nadler&nbsp;(D-N.Y.).\n\n\n\nRep.&nbsp;Gerry Connolly&nbsp;(D-Va.), currently fourth in line behind Maloney on the committee, was the first to offer up his name as a possible successor Wednesday.&nbsp;Our colleague Mike Lillis&nbsp;reports that Connolly says his long experience on the panel protecting federal employees makes him the best fit.\n\n\n\nRep.&nbsp;Stephen Lynch&nbsp;(D-Mass.), who ranks above Connolly, also put his bid in on Wednesday to succeed Maloney, per a letter to his colleagues. He currently serves as chair of the committee’s subpanel on national security.\n\n\n\nAnother top Democrat on the panel, Del.&nbsp;Eleanor Holmes Norton&nbsp;(D.C.), said she is instead aiming to replace Rep.&nbsp;Peter DeFazio&nbsp;(D-Ore.) as the top member on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n\n\n\nDemocrats typically value seniority when picking committee leadership, though it's not a guarantee. The party will&nbsp;likely want to replace Maloney with a prominent fighter should they be in the minority in the new Congress, as&nbsp;Republicans are threatening to use the committee to investigate the Department of Justice and put a stop to the probes of former&nbsp;President Trump&nbsp;if they take back the House in November.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more from our colleague Mike Lillis on the unfolding contest. \n\n\n\nGoldman's star rises\n\n\n\nThe attorney who served as the lead counsel in the first impeachment trial against then-President Trump is poised to make his way back to Washington in January — but this time as a congressman.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDan Goldman&nbsp;beat out over a dozen candidates, including incumbent Rep.&nbsp;Mondaire Jones&nbsp;(D),&nbsp;in New York’s newly-created 10th District, centering his campaign platform on how he would be able to use his prosecutorial and investigative experience to take on GOP members.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs heir to the Levi Strauss &amp; Co. fortune, he poured more than $4 million into his own campaign, giving him a significant boost against his opponents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat we’re watching:&nbsp;Goldman told Axios that he wants to join committees focused on oversight and investigations. If Democrats keep control of the House, their probes into former&nbsp;President Trump&nbsp;and his allies will almost certainly continue, making Goldman a member with key experience.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead about Goldman’s victory from our colleague Caroline Vakil.\n\n\n\nTHE COUNTDOWN:\n\n\n\n75\n\n\n\nNumber of days until the November election.\n\n\n\nThe Hill on the ground in Ukraine\n\n\n\nThe Hill's foreign policy correspondent&nbsp;Laura Kelly&nbsp;is in Ukraine as it celebrates its national Independence Day in the shadows of the six-month mark of Russia’s invasion.\n\n\n\nIn Kyiv on Wednesday, Kelly reported that Ukraine celebrated the holiday with a parade of Russian military vehicles that the Ukrainian military destroyed and took off the battlefield.\n\n\n\n“For the majority of the country, it’s this very strong will to push Russia out of all the occupied territories…and that is what Ukrainian officials say their end goal is,” Kelly reported on The Hill TV's \"Rising.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo mark the occasion,&nbsp;President Biden&nbsp;announced a nearly $3 billion security assistance package to bolster Kyiv, which comes from the $40 billion package Congress approved in the spring,&nbsp;our colleague Morgan Chalfant reports.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The fate of Europe rests on 25 HIMARS, and 200 extra Howitzers,” Oleksii Arestovych, an adviser to the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky,&nbsp;said in an interview&nbsp;with The Hill in Kyiv on Tuesday.\n\n\n\nWatch the rest of Kelly’s on-the-ground footage here. \n\n\n\nWASHINGTON MOVES \n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Karl Evers-Hillstrom has&nbsp;a weekly roundup&nbsp;of where people are moving in the lobbying world (and you can send us your professional updates, too!).

        "description": "The federal student aid website received a flood of visitors Wednesday in the aftermath of President Biden announcing he will forgive up to $10,000 of student loans for certain borrowers, causing the site to slow.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe website is where borrowers can determine if they are eligible for the forgiveness measures that Biden announced. The president said in his remarks on Wednesday that the federal government will forgive $10,000 for individuals making less than $125,000 annually and will clear up to $20,000 for recipients of Pell Grants, which are reserved for those with the largest financial need. \n\n\n\n“A lot of people are interested in our website. As a result, some pages may take longer to display than usual. Thank you for your patience,” a&nbsp;message at the top of the website’s page reads upon opening.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome users were also sent to a waiting room page before gaining access to the site shortly after.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House and Education Department did not immediately return requests from The Hill for comment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden also said his administration will allow borrowers to limit the amount they repay monthly for their undergraduate loans to 5 percent of their monthly income. He extended the freeze on repayment, which has been in effect since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, one more time to Dec. 31.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNelnet, a financial services company that processes federal student loans, also reported technical issues because of high traffic following Biden’s announcement. The company said in a tweet that the Education Department determines eligibility and the federal student aid website’s page on Biden’s forgiveness plan is the best source of information.",

        "link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/interactive/2022/twitter-whistleblower-sec-spam/",
        "description": "Joseph Menn, Elizabeth Dwoskin and Cat Zakrzewski, reporting for The Washington Post, which received the same redacted copy of Zatko’s whistleblower report that CNN did. The Post has published copies of the original redacted documents as webpage-embedded PDFs, too. From their story:\n\n\n  Overall, Zatko wrote in a February analysis for the company\nattached as an exhibit to the SEC complaint, “Twitter is grossly\nnegligent in several areas of information security. If these\nproblems are not corrected, regulators, media and users of the\nplatform will be shocked when they inevitably learn about\nTwitter’s severe lack of security basics.”\n\nZatko’s complaint says strong security should have been much more\nimportant to Twitter, which holds vast amounts of sensitive\npersonal data about users. Twitter has the email addresses and\nphone numbers of many public figures, as well as dissidents who\ncommunicate over the service at great personal risk.\n\n\nRemember too that Twitter DMs are not end-to-end encrypted. They are stored on Twitter’s servers in a form that Twitter can read. The phone numbers and email addresses of anonymous dissidents are very sensitive, but I’d argue that the contents of DMs are the most sensitive information Twitter holds.\n\nYou should never put anything in a Twitter DM that you wouldn’t print on a postcard sent in the mail. But we all do it, to some extent. But without question, many Twitter users put incredibly sensitive information into DMs. (I welcome DMs on Twitter, but if the contents are truly sensitive, I encourage readers to contact me via Signal.)\n\n\n  This month, an ex-Twitter employee was convicted of using\nhis position at the company to spy on Saudi dissidents and\ngovernment critics, passing their information to a close aide of\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in exchange for cash and gifts.\n\nZatko’s complaint says he believed the Indian government had\nforced Twitter to put one of its agents on the payroll, with\naccess to user data at a time of intense protests in the\ncountry. The complaint said supporting information for that\nclaim has gone to the National Security Division of the Justice\nDepartment and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\nAnother person familiar with the matter agreed that the employee\nwas probably an agent.\n\n\nI don’t think there’s any way to overstate how damning Zatko’s allegations are. He describes a criminally corrupt company and board.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

It provided some dark comedic relief as an absurd storyline to chase during an otherwise very bleak and scary time. (Hydroxychloroquine, you&#8217;ll recall, would eventually be replaced in the vaccine-skeptic imagination by an actual livestock pill, ivermectin.)",

        "description": "Joseph Menn, Elizabeth Dwoskin and Cat Zakrzewski, reporting for The Washington Post, which received the same redacted copy of Zatko’s whistleblower report that CNN did. The Post has published copies of the original redacted documents as webpage-embedded PDFs, too. From their story:\n\n\n  Overall, Zatko wrote in a February analysis for the company\nattached as an exhibit to the SEC complaint, “Twitter is grossly\nnegligent in several areas of information security. If these\nproblems are not corrected, regulators, media and users of the\nplatform will be shocked when they inevitably learn about\nTwitter’s severe lack of security basics.”\n\nZatko’s complaint says strong security should have been much more\nimportant to Twitter, which holds vast amounts of sensitive\npersonal data about users. Twitter has the email addresses and\nphone numbers of many public figures, as well as dissidents who\ncommunicate over the service at great personal risk.\n\n\nRemember too that Twitter DMs are not end-to-end encrypted. They are stored on Twitter’s servers in a form that Twitter can read. The phone numbers and email addresses of anonymous dissidents are very sensitive, but I’d argue that the contents of DMs are the most sensitive information Twitter holds.\n\nYou should never put anything in a Twitter DM that you wouldn’t print on a postcard sent in the mail. But we all do it, to some extent. But without question, many Twitter users put incredibly sensitive information into DMs. (I welcome DMs on Twitter, but if the contents are truly sensitive, I encourage readers to contact me via Signal.)\n\n\n  This month, an ex-Twitter employee was convicted of using\nhis position at the company to spy on Saudi dissidents and\ngovernment critics, passing their information to a close aide of\nCrown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in exchange for cash and gifts.\n\nZatko’s complaint says he believed the Indian government had\nforced Twitter to put one of its agents on the payroll, with\naccess to user data at a time of intense protests in the\ncountry. The complaint said supporting information for that\nclaim has gone to the National Security Division of the Justice\nDepartment and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence.\nAnother person familiar with the matter agreed that the employee\nwas probably an agent.\n\n\nI don’t think there’s any way to overstate how damning Zatko’s allegations are. He describes a criminally corrupt company and board.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "description": "What is “faith”, anyhow?  The answers can become abstract, but concretely it’s what gets Salman Rushdie stabbed in the face.\n    Oh wait, is that statement anti-Islamic? Guilty as charged; but then I’m also anti-Christian, anti-Hindu, anti-Buddhist, and,\n    well, there are too many organized religions to list them all. Herewith too many words on Faith and Truth, albeit with pretty\n    pictures.  I do find positive things to say, but at the end of the day, well, no.\n    I’m not a moderate on this issue. I don’t believe, in general, that any supernatural event has ever occurred or, in\n    particular, that any prayer has ever been answered.  In my lifetime the outputs of organized religion have been mostly war,\n    sexual abuse, and political support for venal rightist hypocrites.\n    Does it even matter?\n    Maybe religion has become irrelevant to your life, a common experience these days.  It’s worth studying anyhow, as an example\n    of the human propensity to believe things that are not just untrue, but wildly unlikely. Things that entirely lack supporting\n    evidence.  Things that make you shake your head.\n    \n    I may not partake in faith but I’m a keen amateur student of religions. Perhaps it comes of having grown up in Lebanon, where\n    a whole lot of ‘em run up against each other with a mostly disastrous impact on the civic fabric. I’ve visited Jerusalem and\n    Damascus and Chartres and Stonehenge and Avebury and Carnac and Kamakura and Izumo and Beijing’s Temple of Heaven, and some of the world’s\n    great forests.  \n    Faith is real\n    I think that in my youth I maybe knew a saint. No, really; Father Leonard Guay, a Jesuit architect and astronomer. He built a\n    university in Baghdad which was taken over by the Ba’ath, so he built another in Aleppo; the same thing happened. He\n    offered no regrets. An American Midwesterner, he was in a combination monastery, winery, and observatory in rural Lebanon when we knew him. He\n    loved coming over to talk English, eat corn-on-the-cob, and swap crossword-puzzle books; he took regular puzzles and did them\n    diagramless, with just the clues. He loved kids, knew a million utterly lame jokes, and enjoyed telling us about the current research\n    in the observatory, apologizing for using pagan language, as in the names of constellations and Zodiac signs. His faith glowed\n    within him and around him. \n    This is the challenge to my personal aversion to the supernatural. I observe empirically that faith exists and that it’s real\n    and that it appears to be good for some people. But my mind recoils at all the crazily baroque apparatus that is inextricably\n    attached to every organized religion.  I believe in belief and have no faith in faith. \n    But I went to Sunday School and my Dad even taught it in his youth. Once, when I boarded for a semester with family friends,\n    I attended a Southern Baptist congregation which even at the age of twelve struck me as pretty looney-tunes. In my own\n    mainstream-Protestant scientist family, the religious pressure was more or less zero. \n    \n    Jodo Buddhist Mission in Lahaina, Maui\n    What I’m not buying\n    So I understand pretty well what it is. I’m not buying a deity who hardens Pharaoh’s heart, provoking plague\n    and child slaughter across a whole population. Nor, in general, gods that purport to exhibit gender. Nor any who thrive on\n    praise and consider it essential from their devotees.  Hindutva smells to me like old-fashioned ethnofascism with Pujas.  I\n    scoff at a putative Savior who lectures that lust is morally equivalent to adultery.  I’m not down with Wahhabi support for\n    autocratic murdering princes nor with Crusading nor with throwing settler garbage down into lower Hebron.  And the phrase\n    “blasphemy law” makes me shiver with anger. \n    Faith and humans\n    But religion comes naturally to Homo sapiens. Perhaps the first big reason is that for much of humanity’s passage across time\n    we were manifestly not in control of our destiny, just ephemeral sparks of life blown about by whims of climate and disease and\n    geography and the population dynamics of our prey and predators, those sparks often snuffed out with no warning. It would have\n    been comforting to think that Someone was in control. Maybe the improved ability to steer one’s own life, enjoyed today by those\n    in developed societies and with an education, is partly responsible for the fading of faith? \n    Second, worship is a human built-in. We are small after all, regularly confronted by things much greater than ourselves: Our\n    starfield, away from light pollution. The meeting of the Eastern Pacific with the Western Americas. Canyons and waterfalls and\n    great ancient trees. \n    \n    Candles in Chartres cathedral.\n    Of course, we build some of the things we worship. I know of two people who say they acquired faith following on a visit to\n    Chartres, and I believe them. If you can enter that great stone poem without your sense of worship activating, I think you’re\n    weird. The first time I walked in, it felt like a giant hand round my chest, interfering with my breathing. \n    But I dunno, I’ve had the same feeling at concerts by Laurie Anderson and Slava Rostropovich and The Clash and a host of\n    other artists. Is my gratitude for being alive at the same time as these exceptional people “worship”?   \n    \n    Trees\n    My family has the great good fortune to own a cabin on a small island in Howe Sound near Vancouver, where I regularly\n    experience worship of that Pacific perimeter, and especially the island’s great evergreens and bigleaf maples that tower into\n    the filtered forest light, never still, wind never entirely absent in the greenery. I keep telling my kids they should shut up\n    and listen to the damn trees and they’ll learn things and I’m right but they don’t, usually. \n    Feeling reverent around trees has the advantage that they’re not avatars of anything that is said to be twitchily concerned\n    about how and with whom you deploy your genitals, or whose intercedents will require your cash to support their lifestyles.  \n    Positives\n    I think it probable that religion will continue to decline, to the extent that its concerns are absent from public\n    discourse. In my own civic landscape it already has. \n    That’s not entirely a good thing; you can admire aspects of religion without actually believing it.  One of them is ritual,\n    prescribed and choreographed public actions. It’s a thing that a high proportion of humans once experienced on a weekly basis;\n    but no longer.  I think we miss it. Military services retain rituals, as do the centers of government – consider America’s State\n    of the Union address, or the opening of various nations’ parliaments. Weddings and funerals retain a ritual dimension but are\n    infrequent. While I have no patience for Catholic dogma I often tune in their midnight Christmas mass for its own sake – the\n    singing and chanting, the inner space of St Peter’s basilica, and priestly processions carrying the Host.  I love the opening\n    and closing of each Olympic games. \n    Sacred texts\n    Every faith has them.  While I decline to honor their claims, it’s good to believe\n    that written-down words are important, because they are. The use of language defines what’s special about our species as much as\n    anything else does and I believe the single greatest cultural shift in humanity’s story came when it could be written, and\n    lessons could outlast the storage provided by a human skull.   \n    \n    Shinto shrine at Izumo\n    The worlds of sci-fi, fantasy, and computer games are full of powerful and magical texts; obviously this notion speaks to\n    many people. Religious texts are also historically important because they were replicated a lot and are thus well-represented\n    among the fragments of language that have survived the ravages of centuries. Some of the books and the verses and words are very\n    beautiful.  \n    In fact, the Christian Bible, particularly in its seventeenth-century “King James” embodiment, has been at the center of the\n    cultural experience of my own ethnic group to the extent that I think it probably deserves routine study at some point in the\n    standard curriculum. A whole lot of our ancestral history and much wonderful literature and art is going to elude understanding\n    without at least a basic grasp of its scriptural embedding. \n    If you want\n    to get inside the head of someone who really held close to those values, go listen to Hildegard von Bingen’s\n    O vis aeternitatis\n    (“The Power of Eternity), probably written around 1150. It’s wonderful music! The world Hildegard inhabited, of faith made real\n    in cloisters and their communities, is as remote from mine as that lived by the characters in the sci-fi I enjoy reading.  \n    \n    At the Abbey of Montserrat, near Barcelona\n    The flavor of truth\n    Of course, since sacred texts are said to express eternal absolutes, they must necessarily be immutable.\n    Which seems boring and just wrong. It is a core value of scientists and engineers and philosophers and\n    reference publishers that truth is contingent and dynamic; always capable of being better-expressed or deepened or falsified. On\n    top of which, the language we use to express truths grows and mutates across the centuries. I’m not holding my breath waiting\n    for Christendom to convene a Third Council of Nicaea and revise the doctrine of the Trinity. Still, we should respect and\n    preserve and study the sacred texts because they are full of lessons about the people who wrote them and believe them. \n    Exegesis\n    Around those scriptural mountains are the rolling hills of exegesis; works of commentary and analysis, for example the Hadith\n    and the Talmud. Christian exegesis is unimaginably vast in scale although it lacks a single named center.  \n    I got lost in the exegetical maze during a failed youthful attempt to write a novel about the rise and wreck of the Tower of\n    Babel, when I tried to understand what that crazy story might really be about. \n    Exegesis is fun to read! Intellectually challenging on its own terms, and if you have any familiarity at all with the Bible,\n    the depth of meaning apparently waiting to be uncovered in the crevasses between adjacent words is astonishing.  Next time\n    you’re in a good library, I recommend looking up “Anchor Bible” in the catalog and poking around the stacks where the\n    call-number takes you.  If you’re like me your mind will be boggled at the vastness and complexity of the collection. \n    On this subject, if you ever find yourself in a colloquy of theologians or bibliophiles or antiquarians, even a brief mention\n    of “The Church Fathers” will get you nods and smiles. They constitute the first few waves of Christian theological writing,\n    there were really a lot of them (no Church Mothers, though), and they wrote an incredible number of books, many beautiful in\n    form and content.  \n    \n    At Jing’an Temple in Shanghai\n    What a certain number of these theologians are trying to do is very similar to the goals of Physics theorists: An explanation\n    of the universe from pure logical principles, showing how it really couldn’t possibly be any way other than the way it\n    is. Christian theologians assert that this must be the Best of All Possible Worlds because what else could God have made?  \n    They want the necessary outcome, via pure logical reasoning, to include an omnipotent omniscient male-gendered Creator and\n    also a Savior, a single instance of God-made-flesh, plus a really hard to understand “Holy Spirit”. Which is to say, they have a\n    heavier lift than physicists do. But to this day, Proofs of the Existence of God remain an amusing sub-sub-domain of theology\n    and exegesis.  \n    [I think you were supposed to be writing about the redeeming features? -Ed.] [Oh, right, thanks. -T.] Finally, it would be\n    unfair to consider religion without acknowledging its leading role in philanthropy across the generations and continents.  \n    Faith why?\n    None of which means we need to believe what the religiosos claim is true. But why, in the 21st century, do they still believe\n    it?  I really don’t have much to add to the two points I made above: The feeling that Someone must be in charge, and our\n    built-in capacity for worship. \n    Let me offer an incredibly cynical but kind of entertaining take on the subject from Edward Gibbon, in his monumental Decline\n    and Fall of the Roman Empire, six massive volumes dating from the late 1700s.\n    [You didn’t actually buy it and read it, did you?\n    -Ed.] [Sometime around 1984 I joined the “Book of the Month Club” and these great-looking books were the sign-up bonus. I read a\n    lot of it, but got bored around 1000AD in Vol. 5, all that endless Byzantine treachery. -T.] \n    \n    In a garden across the street from a Catholic school\n    Gibbon is discussing the rise of Christianity in the Empire, which he argues contributed to its fall, but that’s neither here\n    nor there. He includes a sprawling survey of the religious landscape and, while discussing the Jews, notes that unlike many\n    other faiths of the time, they weren’t prepared to go along and get along, host an occasional sacrifice to one Caesar or another\n    in their temple; they resisted militantly and to the death. So, quoting from Chapter XV, Part I:\n    \n    But the devout and even scrupulous attachment to the Mosaic religion, so conspicuous among the Jews who lived under the\n    second temple, becomes still more surprising, if it is compared with the stubborn incredulity of their forefathers. When the law\n    was given in thunder from Mount Sinai, when the tides of the ocean and the course of the planets were suspended for the\n    convenience of the Israelites, and when temporal rewards and punishments were the immediate consequences of their piety or\n    disobedience, they perpetually relapsed into rebellion against the visible majesty of their Divine King, placed the idols of the\n    nations in the sanctuary of Jehovah, and imitated every fantastic ceremony that was practised in the tents of the Arabs, or in\n    the cities of Phœnicia.10 As the protection of Heaven was deservedly withdrawn from the ungrateful race, their faith acquired a\n    proportionable degree of vigor and purity. The contemporaries of Moses and Joshua had beheld with careless indifference the most\n    amazing miracles. Under the pressure of every calamity, the belief of those miracles has preserved the Jews of a later period\n    from the universal contagion of idolatry; and in contradiction to every known principle of the human mind, that singular people\n    seems to have yielded a stronger and more ready assent to the traditions of their remote ancestors, than to the evidence of\n    their own senses.11 \n    10 For the enumeration of the Syrian and Arabian deities, it may be observed that Milton has comprised, in one hundred and\n    thirty very beautiful lines, the two large and learned syntagmas which Selden had composed on that abstruse subject. \n    11 “How long will this people provoke me? And how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs which I have shewn\n    among them?” (Numbers xiv 11). It would be easy, but it would be unbecoming, to justify the complaint of the Deity, from the\n    whole tenor of the Mosaic history. \n    (Gibbons’ footnotes, included just for fun.)\n    \n    Um, is that anti-Semitic? Maybe… and some other things Gibbon said definitely were. But he was also anti-Muslim and arguably\n    anti-Christian. And his scoffing seems more aimed at theologies than ethnicities. In fact, the only religion to get many kind\n    words was Rome’s indigenous paganism, because of its tolerance.  \n    While his text is loaded with nods to Christianity being The Right Answer because of Its Divine Provenance, those passages\n    glisten with cynicism (see above) and he was frequently attacked as an enemy of the faith. Gibbon is fun to read. \n    A miracle\n    Finally, let’s consider what miracles are: Things that happen for which there is no conventional explanation in our physical\n    understanding of the universe. At least one miracle has happened. The universe, including its cosmic background radiation, its\n    galaxy clusters, its black holes, me and my thread of consciousness, you and yours, and the text I’m writing and you’re reading: They all exist.\n    There’s no explanation at hand as to why anything at all should.  Miraculous!\n    However, check out Why Does the World Exist?: An Existential Detective Story, by Jim Holt (Norton, 2012), a serious but\n    entertaining tour through metaphysics and religion looking for an answer to the question in the title. Spoiler alert: While\n    Holt’s best attempts are stimulating, I was still left thinking of the existence of anything and everything as a miracle. \n    \n    Former Lutheran church,property soon to be filled with condos.\n    Future?\n    You could think of religion as a pathology of society as a whole, consequent on ignorance, fear, and certain built-in\n    features of the human mind.  I don’t think it’s going away, although a faith-free world would probably be a kinder, more humane\n    place.\n    With these words, I may have offended some who partake in faith. I can’t honestly apologize, because an apology is at\n    some level a promise to Stop Doing That.\n    I really, really just don’t buy it.",

        "description": "Pursuant to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, today the Biden administration released an unredacted version of the memo Bill Barr received recommending against obstruction of justice charges tied to President Trump&#8217;s actions detailed in volume two of the Mueller Report. That was the part of the Report that made the case about obstruction of justice. \n\n\n\nTo understand the context, these were two Trump appointees (Steven A. Engel and Edward C. O&#8217;Callaghan) working under Barr, who had made clear publicly prior to his nomination as attorney general that he did not think the Mueller investigation was merited or proper. So this is essentially two of Barr&#8217;s subordinates preparing a memo for Barr containing what all involved knew Barr wanted to hear. \n\n\n\nStill, it is a notable document for understanding the internal reasoning and justifications. Also important: We know there is a longstanding DOJ policy that holds that a sitting President cannot be prosecuted at all. This memo sets that question aside and simply looks at whether prosecution would be merited in any case. Worth a read.",

        "description": "America’s involvement with the war in Ukraine hit a new phase on Wednesday, when the Biden administration kicked off an effort to funnel billions of dollars directly into the U.S. defense industry to support Kyiv’s long-term fight against Russia.\n\n\n\nThe White House is also preparing to send Congress a new plan to restock the warehouses of NATO Baltic allies who have sent their own equipment to help in the fight.\n\n\n\nAs the war in the Donbas and in Ukraine’s south has settled into a punishing artillery duel with only incremental gains by both sides, Kyiv and Moscow are beginning to brace for the coming winter and what promises to be a long, grinding war.\n\n\n\nUkraine’s needs remain urgent, and the immediate military assistance packages will no doubt continue to flow in the coming weeks and months. But as Kyiv looks to continue its struggle against now-entrenched Russian forces across hundreds of miles of front lines, allies are looking at the long game.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration announced a new $3 billion package on Wednesday that will directly fund contracts with the U.S. defense industry for artillery rounds, mortar rounds, surface-to-air missile systems; a new counter-drone capability; additional drones; and 24 counter-battery radars. The move marks a major shift in how the U.S. has supplied Ukraine, from pulling existing weapons off of shelves to awarding contracts to defense firms for weapons that need to be built.\n\n\n\nNone of that equipment will arrive for months, if not years. But officials say the investment will allow Kyiv to begin planning for its own future defense. The hope is that other wealthy European nations, which have at times lagged in their support for Ukraine, might follow suit in the coming months.\n\n\n\n“What needs to happen now is to build that longer-term pipeline,” one Western diplomat told POLITICO on the condition of anonymity to discuss the war. “At some point, particularly for the U.S., U.K., and some of the near neighbors like Estonia and Poland who have been generous with the equipment they have, [donating existing stocks] isn’t going to be sustainable forever.”\n\n\n\nSome analysts expressed surprise that Wednesday’s package includes things like artillery and mortar rounds, which the U.S. has been supplying by the tens of thousands out of its own stockpiles.\n\n\n\n“This might signal that some of these items are getting short in the DoD inventories and that DoD cannot supply them out of existing stocks,” said Mark Cancian, a senior adviser with the Center for Strategic and International Studies’ international security program. Production delays and cold manufacturing lines mean that some of these items could be slow to arrive, for both the U.S. and Ukraine.\n\n\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Oleksii Reznikov, the nation’s defense minister, both said on Wednesday that the Ukrainian government is grateful for the $3 billion aid package.\n\n\n\n“The people of Ukraine, all our defenders highly appreciate [the U.S.’s] unwavering support. Together we will win!” Zelenskyy tweeted.\n\n\n\nThe Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, which is the Pentagon-managed account the administration drew the latest assistance package from, has been the primary method of arming and equipping Ukraine’s military since the 2014 seizure of Crimea by Russian forces.\n\n\n\nThough lawmakers have typically provided several hundred million dollars annually, Congress supersized the account after Russia’s full invasion this winter. The emergency supplemental package became law in May. The legislation allocated $6 billion to the program, placing it on par with other special programs to beef up U.S. military posture and training in Eastern Europe and the Indo-Pacific region.\n\n\n\nIn all, Congress has set aside $6.3 billion for the Pentagon-administered effort: $6 billion as part of May’s $40 billion supplemental assistance legislation and $300 million in a government-wide funding package that passed in March. As of Aug. 1, just $1.8 billion of that cash had been used,&nbsp;according to Pentagon documentation seen by POLITICO. Wednesday’s announcement leaves roughly $1.5 billion left to be spent.\n\n\n\nThe Pentagon will hand over the remaining aid as part of a flurry of contract awards at the end of the fiscal year, said two people with knowledge of the discussions.\n\n\n\nSen.&nbsp;Jeanne Shaheen&nbsp;(D-N.H.), a longtime proponent of boosting military aid to Ukraine, said the multibillion-dollar tranche shows an extended U.S. commitment to Kyiv as the war grinds on. “This new assistance package demonstrates U.S. commitment to Ukraine’s long-term security by investing in capabilities to bolster Ukraine’s defense posture for years to come,” Shaheen said in a statement. “The equipment included in this package, and the associated training of Ukrainian forces, will facilitate the continued strengthening of the Ukrainian military as they defend themselves from Putin’s aggression.”\n\n\n\nThe $40 billion military and humanitarian aid package was intended to last at least through the fall.\n\n\n\nThe package includes $19 billion for immediate military support to Ukraine, $3.9 billion to sustain U.S. forces deployed to Europe and $2 billion for long-term support of NATO allies and U.S. modernization programs.\n\n\n\nThat military support includes the $6 billion for the Pentagon account to arm Ukraine as well as $4 billion in State Department foreign military financing for Ukraine and other NATO countries on the alliance’s eastern edge. And roughly $9 billion will be parceled out by the Pentagon for the defense industry to replenish stores of missiles and other weapons and equipment shipped to Ukraine.\n\n\n\nOnce it’s empty, further emergency funding would be required later in the year, though whether that will happen is unclear.\n\n\n\nThe uncertain political landscape in the U.S., where funding for another large Ukraine package might run into trouble on Capitol Hill, makes these long-term contracts even more important to put Ukraine on solid footing, proponents say.\n\n\n\nStill more money is on the way, regardless of whether President Joe Biden seeks another supplemental. Both the House and Senate Appropriations committees have proposed granting the Pentagon another $300 million for the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative for fiscal 2023.\n\n\n\nA final deal to fund the federal government, including the military, likely won’t be struck until late this year or early next, however, and the added Ukraine money could increase if lawmakers agree to give the Pentagon even more money.\n\n\n\nAlso included in the $40 billion supplemental was a provision to help NATO front line states Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania refill their arsenals after donating around $600 million worth of equipment to Ukraine this year.\n\n\n\nThe State Department is expected to send Congress its plan for how to spend over $150 million in replenishment contracts by the end of the month, one European diplomat told POLITICO. The U.S. will spend the money in much the same way as the Ukraine package — awarding contracts to the U.S. defense industry to make weapons for the allies.\n\n\n\nAll three Baltic states sent hundreds of their Javelin and Stinger missiles at the start of the war, along with howitzers, small arms, communications equipment and mortars, and are eager to replenish their stocks. The trio has also come out forcefully in favor of cutting off Russian energy imports to Europe and banning tourist visas for Russian citizens, moves that have put them in the Kremlin’s crosshairs.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. pledged the three nations $180 million in military aid as part of the Baltic Security Initiative in the 2022 federal budget, an increase of $10 million over the 2021 package.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. has also pledged $64.5 million to help Estonia acquire the High Mobility Artillery Rocket System that has proved so effective against Russian forces in Ukraine; in July, Congress approved the sale of six HIMARS to Estonia.\n\n\n\nAlexander Ward contributed to this report.",

        "description": "Boo birds and sarcastic claps littered Coors Field on Wednesday, marking a fitting soundtrack for a miserable Rockies performance.\nThe Rockies were blasted, 16-4, on an otherwise sunny afternoon after starting pitcher Jose Urena failed to get out of the second inning. He was erratic (three walks), ineffective (nine hits), and bore the brunt of responsibility while the Rangers sprayed his pitches all over Coors Field.\n&#8220;Yeah, it is frustrating, but you gotta keep your mind right,&#8221; Urena said.\nApplause came rarely, and sometimes only in the event that Urena found the strike zone. The game was effectively over about eight innings before it formally ended.\n&#8220;When Jose&#8217;s right, like he was last start, everything&#8217;s down at the knees with action,&#8221; manager Bud Black said. &#8220;&#8230; He was off today.&#8221;\nBy the time Black mercifully pulled Urena, 1 1/3 innings officially in the books, he’d thrown 60 pitches and Texas had already plated nine runs. The biggest blow of the Rangers’ seven-run second inning came via Mark Mathias’ bases-loaded, bases-clearing double to left centerfield. That prompted scattered boos. Black emerged from the first-base dugout shortly thereafter.\nRelief pitcher Austin Gomber was as valuable as Urena was awful. Had he not gobbled up 4 2/3 innings, allowing only one hit, Wednesday’s result would’ve gotten even uglier.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m definitely aware of the situation, coming in in the second inning &#8230; I just have to eat innings,&#8221; Gomber said.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKiszla: Waste of money on Kris Bryant is Exhibit A why Bill Schmidt should not be Rockies general manager\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; 2023 schedule includes Yankees at Coors Field\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Rockies Mailbag: Manager Bud Black&#8217;s job is not in jeopardy part II\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies ride 3-run homers by C.J.

The Rockies got their first run off Ryan McMahon’s sacrifice fly to deep center. Feel-good center fielder Wynton Bernard legged out an infield single that helped score another. After an RBI single from Connor Joe, Bernard came around on a wild pitch. For one half of an inning, Coors Field had juice. But that was it.\nOutside of two spectacular defensive plays, one from McMahon on a pop-up in foul territory, and another on a diving catch from Randal Grichuk in right, the Rockies&#8217; defense misplayed several balls that would&#8217;ve saved them runs. Not that it much mattered with the early nine-run deficit and their meager bats.\nThe loss dropped the Rockies to 54-71 and marred what had been a promising (3-2) homestand. Thursday, they’ll head east for the start of their longest road trip of the season: an 11-day, 10-game odyssey that will see stops in New York and Atlanta, two likely playoff-bound teams.\nIf the Rockies thought Rangers starting pitcher Martin Perez was a bear, they’ll get no reprieve as they take on Mets ace Jacob deGrom on Thursday. Perez pitched six innings of sparkling baseball, scattering four hits and striking out seven.",

        "description": "Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel rallied major donors Wednesday to get behind the GOP’s efforts to flip the Senate — a plea that comes amid rising concerns in the party over its candidates’ lagging fundraising totals and its overall prospects.\nDuring a 36-minute conference call, a recording of which was obtained by POLITICO, McDaniel argued that the party has strong Senate candidates and a favorable political environment. But she went on to say that Republican candidates are being swamped by Democrats in the chase for campaign cash. The Supreme Court’s June decision nixing Roe v. Wade, McDaniel said, triggered a gusher of online donations for the opposition.\nMcDaniel – who was joined by former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the architect of the party’s House takeover in the 1994 midterm election – also said Republican small donors had been “decimated” by the lagging economy. That’s made the GOP more dependent on large contributors, such as those on the call, to compete against Democrats on the air in the final weeks before the election, she said.\n“We absolutely have better candidates and a better message,” McDaniel said, pushing back on what she described as a false, media-driven narrative that the GOP’s prospects in Senate races are waning. “But,” she said, “we do need financial firepower to drive our effort.”\n“Newt and I were just talking, in this environment, our candidates can win if they’re outspent two-to-one, but if it gets four, five, six to one, it becomes more difficult, and we’re seeing that specifically on the Senate side. So my call to action today,” McDaniel added, “is to please help us invest in these Senate races specifically. Give to any of these Senate candidates, all of these Senate candidates if you can, so all of them can be on TV.”\nRepublican officials say the RNC hosts such calls every few months to provide updates to major givers. The call comes as Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and other top Republicans are mobilizing to close the financial gap. McConnell has spent August working the phones to raise money from major donors, according to a person familiar with the conversation.\nSome senior Republicans have privately grown bearish on the party’s hopes of winning the majority, particularly in light of its growing fundraising woes. An array of candidates in key races — from Arizona’s Blake Masters to Ohio’s J.D. Vance to Pennsylvania’s Mehmet Oz — have found themselves badly outraised by their Democratic opponents. (At one point in the call, an Arizona donor noted that Masters’ rival, Democratic Sen. Mark Kelly, is flooding the airwaves and made an appeal for other participants to help Masters.)\n \n\nAdding to the concern is the National Republican Senatorial Committee’s recent decision to slash more than $10 million in planned TV ad spending. The Senate GOP campaign arm trails its Democratic counterpart in cash on hand by roughly $31 million, according to the most recent filings.\nThat move has forced the Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC closely aligned with McConnell, to fill the void with large investments in states like Pennsylvania and Ohio. During the call, McDaniel said the RNC was creating a joint-fundraising account with 10 state parties to help fund voter turnout programs.\nThe fundraising struggles have fueled broader worries about the strength of the party’s candidates. McConnell last week appeared to lower expectations for a Senate takeover, saying “there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate.”\n“Senate races are just different — they're statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” said McConnell, adding that after the election “we’re likely to have an extremely close Senate, either our side up slightly or their side up slightly.”\nDuring Wednesday’s call, one donor asked Gingrich to respond to McConnell’s remark, prompting the former House speaker to say he “suspects” the GOP leader “regrets having said that,” and that it wasn’t “useful.”\nBut Gingrich also lavished praise on McConnell, saying the Senate GOP leader is working aggressively to help Republican candidates compete financially. Gingrich also noted that McConnell had been “burned” in past election years, when the party fielded candidates “who were, to put it mildly, strange.”\n“Mitch has always been more cautious, and I’ve always been very optimistic, so you can maybe draw the line in the middle,” said Gingrich, who said he also believes the party’s candidates are strong. \nDuring a question-and-answer session, Republican mega-donor Steve Wynn asked whether there are any dark-money nonprofits that contributors could give to. Unlike political action committees, those groups aren’t required to disclose their donors.\nSome donors, Wynn said, “are self-conscious for reasons that are personal to them, business people and folks like that” and would rather give anonymously.\nThe billionaire also offered up some messaging advice. Republican candidates, he said, should run aggressive TV ads casting Democrats as advocates of tax policies that would hurt lower-wage earners and small businesses.\n“Hard-hitting kind of spots with a man’s voice, no soft pedal,” Wynn suggested, before giving a sample script: “‘They’re coming after you if you’re a waiter, if you’re a bartender, if you’re anybody with a cash business … they’re coming after you.'”",

        "description": "Biden has finally announced his plan to cancel hundreds of billions of dollars in student debt and we have the details. We’ll also look at the Fed’s upcoming inflation summit, a new Senate report on foreign tax evasion and the biggest Ukraine aid package to date.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut first, find out if you are a Pell Grant recipient.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelcome to On The Money, your nightly guide to everything affecting your bills, bank account and bottom line. For The Hill, we’re Sylvan Lane, Aris Folley and Karl Evers-Hillstrom. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden announces student loan action \n\n\n\nPresident Biden officially announced on Wednesday that his administration is forgiving up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 annually and $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients, marking the largest forgiveness of the loans per individual to date.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden also again extended a payment freeze on federal student loans and interest accrual, butting right up against an Aug. 31 deadline that would have kicked bills back into effect just before November’s midterm elections.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe payment pause is extended “one final time” until Dec. 31, with borrowers expected to resume payments next year.&nbsp;Current students with loans are eligible for the debt relief, and dependent students will be eligible for relief based on their parents’ income.&nbsp;The plan also aims to cut the loan repayment cap in half for low-income undergraduate borrowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more from Alex Gangitano here, and check out The Hill’s extensive coverage of Biden’s student debt plan:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere’s what’s inside Biden’s historic student debt forgiveness order Progressives hail Biden for action on student loans Biden sells his student loan plan, calls it economically responsible Biden student loan plans caught in inflation debate crosshairs \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNO PAUSE FOR POWELL  \n\n\n\nDip in inflation will likely be a cold comfort to Fed at Jackson Hole summit&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTop Federal Reserve officials will spend three days plotting the next moves in their fight against inflation from a Wyoming ski resort as millions of Americans struggle with the rising cost of basic goods.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Fed’s annual summer policy summit in Jackson Hole, Wyo., kicks off Wednesday as the bank attempts to steer the U.S. out of high inflation and away from a recession.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe event, which is closed to the public, begins with two days of panels and paper presentations focused on a central theme and concludes with a speech from Fed Chairman Jerome Powell.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While only a few dozen attendees will witness Powell’s remarks, the text of his speech could give financial markets, Fed analysts and the American people a closer look at his views.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“He can reference whatever he thinks is important and kind of guide readers to see how he views the world,” Englander said, comparing the Jackson Hole speech to the president’s annual State of the Union Address.  \n\n\n\n“There’s a feeling that it gives them greater insights,” he continued. \n\n\n\nSylvan has more here.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe nitty gritty: Like his predecessors, Powell has used his past Jackson Hole speeches to frame his vision on the Fed’s approach to its biggest challenge of the moment, beyond the month-to-month speculation of what the bank will do to interest rates.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFed watchers generally don’t expect Powell to hint at what the Fed will do in September during its next monetary policy meeting — particularly with so much uncertainty facing the bank in its fight against inflation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We are seeing some green shoots, but they don’t want to declare victory prematurely,” said Derek Tang, co-founder and economist at research firm Monetary Policy Analytics, in a Monday interview.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n‘SHOCKINGLY EASY’  \n\n\n\nSenate report blasts IRS for handling of foreign bank registration&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Senate report released Wednesday on a form of tax evasion was highly critical of the IRS for the way it handles foreign bank registration as part of the laws that govern how U.S. citizens and business entities can own foreign assets. \n\n\n\nThe report said that it was “shockingly easy” to obtain a certain kind of registration number from the IRS that signifies its holder to be a valid foreign financial institution.&nbsp;The registration process was mandated as part of the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) passed in 2010, which requires Americans to report assets held outside the U.S. to the IRS.&nbsp;A write-up of the report from the Senate Finance Committee described the process of obtaining registration numbers — known as Global Intermediary Identification Numbers, or GIIN numbers — as “alarmingly simple.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Tobias Burns breaks it down here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUKRAINE AID\n\n\n\nBiden pledges $3B weapons package to Ukraine to mark Kyiv’s Independence Day&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Biden marked Ukraine’s Independence Day on Wednesday by announcing a nearly $3 billion security assistance package to bolster Kyiv as it battles the Russian invasion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House announcement came as Ukraine braced for stepped-up attacks from Russia on the holiday, which also coincided with the six-month mark of the start of Moscow’s military campaign.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s the single largest tranche of U.S. assistance to Ukraine since the start of the Russian invasion earlier this year.&nbsp;The new assistance is being provided through the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative, meaning that the equipment will not come from existing U.S. weapons stockpiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMorgan Chalfant has more here\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood to Know\n\n\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) entered an agreement with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday to drop him from an ongoing antitrust lawsuit attempting to block the company’s purchase of a virtual reality company.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA joint court filing stipulates that Zuckerberg will not purchase the company, Within Unlimited, as an individual or through any entity controlled by Zuckerberg in exchange for being removed as a defendant in the suit.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere’s what else we have our eye on:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA bombshell Twitter whistleblower complaint alleging the company has major security deficiencies is adding fuel to Elon Musk’s core argument in his case against Twitter as he tries to back out of his $44 billion deal to buy the platform.  Former Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke and his chief of staff misled an internal federal watchdog about the department’s decision to punt on a proposed Native American casino in Connecticut,

        "description": "The state of Utah is suing the Biden administration over its decision to restore the size of two national monuments that were shrunk by then-President Trump.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe size of the Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears monuments, both located in Utah, were cut by nearly half and about 85 percent, respectively, during the Trump administration. \n\n\n\nThese monuments were initially designated under the Clinton and Obama administrations.\n\n\n\nIn deciding to restore the monuments’ original sizes, Biden invoked tribal rights, calling Bears Ears “a place of healing … a place of reverence, a sacred homeland to hundreds of generations of native peoples.”\n\n\n\nBut, the state of Utah and two of its counties argued in court that the monuments are too big, and a violation of the Antiquities Act, which gives presidents the right to protect historic landmarks and other areas of significance.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey specifically argued that Biden’s move was not compatible with the part of the law that says parcels put aside for protections “shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.”\n\n\n\nAnd they said that Biden’s move would “stifle local economic activity, impact local culture and tradition, lock up potentially critical minerals, destroy jobs, and impose exasperating and costly burdens on local and state governments.”\n\n\n\n“The vast size of the new monuments draws unmanageable visitation levels without providing the tools necessary to adequately conserve and protect them,” Utah Gov. Spencer Cox (R) said in a Twitter thread supporting the suit. \n\n\n\nThe White House and Interior Department declined to comment, and a Justice Department spokesperson did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment.\n\n\n\nBut, groups allied with the administration argue that Utah is wrong, and that the landscapes need to be preserved.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“By filing a lawsuit against the federal government over these monuments, the State of Utah is wasting taxpayer money trying to undermine something that is evident to anyone who spends time in these remarkable landscapes—that Bears Ears and Grand Staircase deserve protection,” Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities, said in a written statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Both legal and historical precedent support the creation of these landscape-scale monuments,” Rokala added.",

Oil and gas extraction and production leaks methane and other air pollutants, such as volatile organic compounds (VOCs). Some VOCs can cause cancer, affect the nervous system, or cause birth defects. Burning methane also emits nitrogen oxides, which can also cause health harm. Additionally, when VOCs mix with nitrogen oxides, they contribute to the formation of ground-level ozone pollution. \n\n\n\nExposure to ground-level ozone can cause damage to the lungs and increases the chances of premature death. It causes asthma attacks, aggravates other chronic lung diseases and pre-existing heart problems, as well as contributing to premature birth. Children are particularly vulnerable to both ozone and VOC pollution.\n\n\n\nExposure to dangerous levels of ground-level ozone isn’t limited to one particular part of the country. It affects people everywhere, from Southern California to Texas to North Dakota to Pennsylvania. A 2022 report on air pollution from the American Lung Association found that 122 million Americans — including almost 28 million children and over 18 million seniors — live in a county that has received a failing grade for ozone pollution.\n\n\n\nIn addition to emitting VOCs and contributing to ground-level ozone pollution, oil and gas production also leaks methane directly into the air. Methane is a major climate pollutant; it is 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat. Methane leaks contribute significantly to climate change, which in turn impacts the health and lives of all Americans, especially children, older adults, low-income communities, communities of color and people living with chronic diseases. From more frequent and intense wildfires and floods, to worsening air pollution and increasing risks from vector-borne diseases like Lyme Disease, climate change harms our health in many ways.\n\n\n\nGiven the health risks that result from oil and gas extraction and production, we were extremely encouraged to see that the Inflation Reduction Act, which President Biden signed into law on Aug. 16, includes a program aimed at incentivizing companies to take additional steps to reduce emissions across their operations. The Methane Emissions Reduction Program, which is designed to be complementary to any federal regulations, will charge specific types of facilities for the amount of methane they release into the atmosphere, and it is the first direct federal charge, fee or tax on greenhouse gas emissions. The program will help drive the cleanup of methane emissions from the atmosphere, slowing the acceleration of climate change.\n\n\n\nThe Methane Emissions Reduction Program is an exciting and necessary step in the fight to clean up air pollution — but in order to further reduce health consequences from air pollution, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) must also enact stronger regulations on methane.\n\n\n\nFor years, leading national health organizations, medical professionals and public health experts like us have been calling for strong federal pollution limits on oil and gas operations to protect Americans’ health, particularly the health of fenceline communities — the people who live directly next to these facilities and are most at risk of experiencing health issues either caused or exacerbated by air pollution. \n\n\n\nIn November 2021, EPA proposed a rule to cut methane and other harmful pollution from new and existing oil and gas operations. While the proposal is a good start, it must go further. To better protect fenceline communities and prevent the worst impacts of climate change, EPA must require the oil and gas industry to take the strongest steps possible to prevent methane emissions. Those steps include:\n\n\n\nEliminating the practice of routine flaring (burning oil or gas as a waste product), which emits harmful air pollution.Requiring regular monitoring at smaller, high polluting wells. These smaller wells generate just a trickle of usable gas but leak an unusually large amount of methane given their size. Under EPA’s current proposal, some of these high polluting wells wouldn’t be regularly monitored for leaks.&nbsp;Eliminating loopholes that allow any wells to skip regular leak inspections.\n\n\n\nOftentimes, oil and gas facilities — which are disproportionately sited in marginalized neighborhoods — are located near schools, parks, homes and childcare facilities, making it near-impossible to prevent children from breathing in dangerous levels of air pollution. In many places near oil and gas operations, children are exposed to higher levels of air pollution and therefore are more likely to experience coughing and wheezing, asthma attacks, and respiratory and cardiovascular harm. By reducing emissions from oil and gas operations, including from methane pollution, we will help protect the health of children and take significant steps to clean up the air that they breathe.\n\n\n\nEPA’s decision to implement (or not implement) strong emissions standards for new and existing oil and gas operations will have a tangible impact on your health, my health, as well as the health of our children and grandchildren. We urge them to prioritize vulnerable children and fenceline communities and swiftly strengthen their proposed rule — we have no time to waste.\n\n\n\nDeborah P.

(credit: Getty | Bloomberg)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, Mehmet Oz—aka Dr. Oz—repeatedly emailed top-level Trump administration officials, urging them to push the ineffective malaria drug, hydroxychloroquine, to treat COVID-19 based on scant, sketchy data from a now-disgraced French researcher.\nEmails from the notorious celebrity doctor were revealed for the first time Wednesday in a report from the House select subcommittee on the coronavirus crisis. The report, titled \"A 'Knife Fight' with the FDA,\" delved into how the Trump administration worked to undermine, pressure, and bully the Food and Drug Administration during the pandemic.\nSpecifically, it unearthed how the Trump White House pressured the FDA to bend safety standards so that COVID-19 vaccines could be released before election day. It also revealed the tenacious efforts and subterfuge by top Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro and adviser Steven Hatfill to pressure the FDA into supporting the use of the debunked malaria drug. The report's title stems from a direct quote from Hatfill that the White House had a \"knife fight scheduled with the FDA\" over hydroxychloroquine.Read 9 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

(credit: Pleonr /CC BY-SA 4.0)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLast week we told you about the flurry of recent coverage resurfacing 2018 news stories about the re-emergence of so-called \"hunger stones\" due to extreme drought conditions in Europe. We also noted that Europe is once again in the midst of a historically severe drought. Now an ancient site known as the \"Spanish Stonehenge\"—submerged underwater by a reservoir for decades—has been fully exposed for the second time since 2019 due to low water levels in the reservoir.\nThe site is also known as the Dolmen of Guadalperal, a circular grouping of 150 large vertical granite stones (called orthostats) dating back to between 2000 and 3000 BCE. However, Roman artifacts recovered at the site—a coin, ceramic fragments, and a grinding stone—suggest it might have been used even earlier. A team led by German archaeologist Hugo Obermaier discovered the monument in 1926 near a town called Peraleda de la Mata.\nAmong the recovered artifacts were 11 axes, flint knives, ceramics, and a copper punch. A nearby settlement likely housed the people who built the monument, given the presence of houses, charcoal and ash stains, pottery, and stones to hone axes. Obermaier restored some of the granite stones to their rightful places and made reproductions of the engravings, which were published in 1960.  Read 7 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "A Minneapolis Police Department plan to create a drone program drew criticism from most residents testifying at a public hearing on Wednesday afternoon.Police told members of the Minneapolis City Council that the drones would not be used in surveillance, but would be used to help coordinate law enforcement responses during emergencies.Minneapolis Police Department Commander Jonathan Kingsbury said policies the department is proposing would ensure the drones wouldn’t be used to violate residents’ rights.“[They] can not be deployed unless the commander of special operations, or deputy chief or above authorizes it. So currently that’s only six people in the police department that can authorize its use,” Kingsbury said, “Not just any officer out on the street deciding to fly a drone.”Kingsbury said city leaders have met with critics of drones including the American Civil Liberties Union and adjusted their policies. Minneapolis police said they’ll require a full police report every time the drones are used. He said that they’ve established policies to delete video from the drones and that they won’t deploy facial recognition technology or weapons on the airborne devices.The Minneapolis police say they plan to spend about $40,000 dollars on drones and train between six and ten officers to pilot them. There’s no exact timeline for the department to launch the program.Some members of the public who spoke at the hearing said the police department hadn’t respected resident privacy in the past.Minneapolis resident Marika Pfefferkorn, who represents a group called the Safety Not Surveillance Coalition, said the potential for the police to surveil people without oversight is dangerous.”The human impact has been demonstrated by lived experience and research that Black and brown communities are impacted more greatly than others,” Pfefferkorn said. “The human impact is that lives are changed when surveillance happens and mistakes have been made.”In an interview with MPR News, Council Member LaTrisha Vetaw said the drone program is needed.“We&#x27;re down in officers, a few 100 officers,” Vetaw said. “This technology can be used to assist with a lot of the pushback we&#x27;re getting from people about what officers do at the scene of crime.”The Minneapolis City Council hosted the meeting but doesn’t have direct authority over the police department, which is ultimately controlled by Mayor Jacob Frey.State law requires police departments to hold public hearings before instituting drone programs. Public comments on the drone plan can also be submitted on the city&#x27;s website.In a report to the Minnesota Legislature last year, the state Bureau of Criminal Apprehension disclosed that 93 law enforcement agencies around the state use drones. Together they spent almost $1 million dollars in 2020 on the programs. ",

        "description": "The Brewers announced that reliever J.C. Mejía has cleared waivers and been sent outright to Triple-A Nashville. The club hadn&#8217;t previously announced he&#8217;d been designated for assignment, but they apparently quietly placed him on waivers in recent days. The move opens a spot on the 40-man roster for Jake Cousins, who has been reinstated from the 60-day injured list and optioned to Nashville. Milwaukee also activated starter Adrian Houser from the 15-day IL to take the ball tonight against the Dodgers, optioning Trevor Kelley to clear a spot on the active roster.\nMejía made his big league debut with Cleveland last season. The right-hander logged 52 1/3 innings across 17 appearances (11 starts), but only managed an 8.24 ERA during his initial MLB action. He also struggled quite a bit in Triple-A, but he&#8217;d previously had strong minor league production. When the Guardians designated him for assignment after the 2021 season, the Brewers added him in a trade for a player to be named later (eventually announced as David Fry) with an eye towards converting him to relief.\nThat experiment never really got off the ground, as Mejía has pitched in just two big league games with Milwaukee. He tested positive for the performance-enhancing substance Stanozolol and was hit with an 80-game suspension in May. He returned from that ban last week, but the club evidently no longer felt they wanted to carry him on the 40-man roster.\nHaving never previously been outrighted nor not having eclipsed three years of major league service time, Mejía doesn&#8217;t have the right to refuse an outright assignment. He&#8217;ll remain in Nashville &#8212; where he&#8217;s only allowed four runs in 14 2/3 innings &#8212; and try to pitch his way back to the big leagues before the season is out. The 25-year-old (26 on Friday) would qualify for minor league free agency at the end of the season if Milwaukee doesn&#8217;t add him back to the 40-man roster before then.\nCousins hasn&#8217;t pitched since April, as he&#8217;s missed nearly four months with an elbow effusion. The right-hander has been on a rehab assignment since late July and fared quite well, allowing only three runs over nine innings in Nashville with 13 strikeouts against five walks. The club will give him a bit more time in the minors with his allowed 30-day rehab window wrapping up, but it seems likely he&#8217;ll be back in the MLB bullpen before too long. Cousins debuted in the majors last year and impressed, striking out a whopping 35.2% of opponents while working to a 2.70 ERA in 30 games.\nHouser, meanwhile, is back after nearly two months on the shelf. The righty suffered a flexor strain in his forearm in late June, but he managed to rehab without requiring surgery. The veteran ground-ball specialist owns just a 4.72 ERA through 15 starts this season, but he worked to a 3.22 mark in 28 outings last year. He&#8217;ll reassume his rotation role for the stretch run as Milwaukee looks to erase a one-game deficit in the National League Wild Card standings.",

        "description": "The Biden administration on Wednesday released a final rule to fortify the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, a move that comes as the immigration program remains in legal limbo.\nThe regulation&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2022-18401.pdf&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d5f0-db5b-ab9b-f7f1238c0000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d5f0-db5b-ab9b-f7f1238c0001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">The regulation, which takes effect on Oct. 31, is meant to protect DACA by codifying the program and replacing a 2012 memo that first created it. The Obama-era program currently offers work permits and protection from deportation to more than 600,000 undocumented immigrants.\n“Today, we are fulfilling our commitment to preserve and strengthen DACA by finalizing a rule that will reinforce protections, like work authorization, that allow Dreamers to live more freely and to invest in their communities more fully,” President Joe Biden said in a statement, referring to young people who were brought into the U.S. and have remained without legal status.\nBiden went on to directly call on Republicans on Capitol Hill to move for a legislative solution.\n“I will do everything within my power to protect Dreamers, but Congressional Republicans should stop blocking a bill that provides a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers,” Biden said. “It is not only the right thing to do, it is also the smart thing to do for our economy and our communities.”\nCongress has long been unable to reach any kind of immigration deal that would garner enough bipartisan support to pass the Senate. Last year, the Senate parliamentarian rejected&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2021/12/16/senate-parliamentarian-rejects-latest-dem-proposal-on-immigration-525195&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d5f0-db5b-ab9b-f7f1238c0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d5f0-db5b-ab9b-f7f1238c0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Senate parliamentarian rejected multiple efforts by Democrats to include immigration changes in their party-line social spending bill. And Republican leaders have expressed little interest in Democrats’ attempts at overhauling immigration policy.\nSen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who has long pushed for a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers, was quick to applaud the Department of Homeland Security’s issuing the rule. He noted that it provides “some stability to DACA recipients and make[s] it more difficult for a future administration to rescind DACA, which is a lawful exercise of prosecutorial discretion.”\n“However, this rule cannot provide permanent legal status or fully protect DACA recipients from relentless Republican legal challenges to the program,” Durbin said. “Only Congress can protect them.”\nBut some immigrant advocates expressed frustration that the Biden administration did not go further in its final rule, opting to keep the same criteria from when the program was created in 2012.\n“This final DACA rule fails to strengthen the program by not expanding it to include the majority of undocumented immigrant youth who are graduating from high school this year and not eligible for the program because of arbitrary cut-off dates,” said Juliana Macedo do Nascimento, deputy director of federal advocacy for United We Dream.\n“While Congress must pass permanent protections for all, President Biden cannot hide behind the courts or Congress. He can take bold action now,” she added.\nMeanwhile, the future of DACA remains uncertain after years of legal challenges.\nThe Trump administration tried to end the program for years but was eventually rebuffed by the Supreme Court&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2020/06/18/supreme-court-daca-decision-328255&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d5f0-db5b-ab9b-f7f1238c0004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-d5f0-db5b-ab9b-f7f1238c0005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">rebuffed by the Supreme Court.

The 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals could rule on the program’s legality any day now.\nHomeland Security specified that the final regulation would apply only to DACA renewal requests as the current injunction still blocks the administration from approving new DACA applications.",

        "description": "When reporters asked whether his plan to cancel student loan debt is unfair to those who have already paid off or chose not to take out loans, President Biden on Wednesday parried with a hit at tax cuts on the rich.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Is it fair to people who, in fact, do not own multibillion-dollar businesses, if they see one of these guys getting all the tax cuts? Is that fair? What do you think?” Biden told reporters after his remarks introducing the plan.\n\n\n\nThe president had earlier announced that the administration is forgiving up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for Americans earning less than $125,000 a year. Pell Grant recipients are eligible for forgiveness of up to $20,000 in debt. \n\n\n\nA pandemic freeze on federal student loan repayments and interest accrual was extended for a sixth time, just ahead of the Aug. 31 expiration date set when the deadline was last pushed back.\n\n\n\nThe controversial debt relief move has been lauded by Democrats, while Republicans have knocked the plan as economically irresponsible and cautioned that it will burden Americans at large with the canceled debt.\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Wednesday called the decision a “wildly unfair redistribution of wealth” and a “slap in the face” to those who have already paid off their debt or worked to avoid taking out student loans. \n\n\n\nBy contrast, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said in a joint statement on Twitter that \"the positive impacts of this will be felt by working families across America—particularly in communities of color.\"\n\n\n\nSome recent polling indicates most Americans support student loan forgiveness, though other data shows a majority are worried that the move could worsen inflation.",

        "description": "This is what&nbsp;space sounds like. Or at least the sound a supermassive black hole makes. It’s cool, in a terrifying kind of way.\n\n\n\nToday in health news, a House panel report details the pressure put on the FDA by the Trump administration to reauthorize hydroxychloroquine and speed up authorization of the first COVID-19 vaccines, in time for the 2020 election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelcome to Overnight Health Care, where we’re following the latest moves on policy and news affecting your health. For The Hill, we’re Peter Sullivan and Nathaniel Weixel. Subscribe here.\n\n\n\nFDA faced pressure on vaccines, treatment: panel\n\n\n\nTop Trump administration officials pressured the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to reauthorize the discredited COVID-19 treatment hydroxychloroquine and to speed up the release of the first COVID-19 vaccines, according to a new report Democrats on the House select coronavirus subcommittee released Wednesday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEmails, text messages and testimony obtained by the committee show the Trump White House “exerted extreme and inappropriate pressure” on FDA to reauthorize hydroxychloroquine even after it was shown to be ineffective and potentially dangerous.&nbsp;The report found administration officials like trade advisor Peter Navarro enlisted outside allies like Fox News host Laura Ingraham and daytime TV talk show host Dr. Mehmet Oz — now the GOP nominee for Senate in Pennsylvania — to amplify pressure on the FDA to authorize hydroxychloroquine, a drug normally used to treat malaria and lupus.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The Select Subcommittee’s findings that Trump White House officials deliberately and repeatedly sought to bend FDA’s scientific work on coronavirus treatments and vaccines to the White House’s political will are yet another example of how the prior Administration prioritized politics over public health,” Rep. James Clyburn (D-S.C.), the panel’s chair, said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCoordinated pressure:&nbsp;The efforts by members of the Trump administration, including the former president, to meddle with public health agencies has been well documented. However, the report offers new levels of detail of the pressures put on the FDA in 2020. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer President Trump attacked then-FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn and claimed without evidence that his agency was deliberately slowing down the authorizations of the vaccine and convalescent plasma because of politics.\n\n\n\n“The deep state, or whoever, over at the FDA is making it very difficult for drug companies to get people in order to test the vaccines and therapeutics,” Trump tweeted in August 2020. “Obviously, they are hoping to delay the answer until after November 3rd. Must focus on speed, and saving lives!”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nJudge blocks admin's emergency abortion guidance\n\n\n\nA federal judge in Texas in a Tuesday night ruling blocked guidance issued by the&nbsp;Biden&nbsp;administration that requires doctors to provide abortions in emergency medical situations even if doing so would run afoul of state law.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a&nbsp;67-page ruling, U.S. District Judge James Hendrix halted emergency abortion guidance that the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) issued last month in the wake of the Supreme Court’s overruling of Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\nThe practical effect of the ruling was to halt HHS from enforcing its guidance in Texas, stopping short of a nationwide injunction. Hendrix also blocked the administration from applying its regulation against two co-plaintiffs in the case, a pair of anti-abortion doctors’ associations.\n\n\n\nBlow to Biden abortion strategy: The judge’s ruling dealt a blow to the administration, which had urged the court to find that a 1986 federal law known as the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA) superseded some restrictive state abortion laws passed in the wake of Roe’s demise.\n\n\n\nEMTALA requires a hospital to provide stabilizing care to any patient that presents with an emergency medical condition. HHS says abortion qualifies as stabilizing care under the law.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nBLACK AND HISPANIC PEOPLE BEARING BRUNT OF MONKEYPOX\n\n\n\nBlack and Hispanic people make up a disproportionately high number of monkeypox cases, according to a new analysis. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;analysis from the Kaiser Family Foundation&nbsp;finds that Black people make up 26 percent of monkeypox cases, compared to 12 percent of the population, while Hispanic people make up 28 percent of cases compared to 19 percent of the population.\n\n\n\nThe data, from May to July, indicates that racial disparities are an issue with monkeypox, as they have been in the COVID-19 pandemic as well. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Underlying structural inequities place people of color at increased risk for public health threats, as was seen in COVID-19 and as is beginning to be observed amid the MPX outbreak,” the analysis states. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nVaccination disparities: While data is limited, four states — Georgia, Colorado, New Jersey and North Carolina — and Washington, D.C., are reporting racial data for monkeypox vaccination, showing disparities there as well, the analysis found. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt found that in D.C., for example, Black people have received 22 percent of vaccines but make up 36 percent of cases. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nFIRST LADY TESTS POSITIVE IN ‘REBOUND’ COVID CASE\n\n\n\nFirst lady&nbsp;Jill Biden&nbsp;has tested positive for COVID-19 days after receiving a negative test in a “rebound” case of the virus.\n\n\n\nThe first lady tested negative on Tuesday before receiving the positive test result on an antigen test on Wednesday afternoon, her office said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The First Lady has experienced no reemergence of symptoms, and will remain in Delaware where she has reinitiated isolation procedures,” Kelsey Donohue, the deputy communications director for the first lady, said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA White House official said President Biden had tested negative for COVID-19 earlier Wednesday. The president is considered a close contact of the first lady, so he will mask for 10 days when indoors and close to others, the official said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat is rebound?&nbsp;Rebound cases can happen in patients who take Paxlovid when a patient tests negative for the virus, only to test positive again a few days later.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe president had a similar rebound case after taking Paxlovid for his own COVID-19 infection late last month. He remained in isolation for another week because of the rebound case.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\nA surge in women registering to vote after Roe ruling\n\n\n\nSeveral states where reproduction rights are at risk are seeing a surge in women registering to vote following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn the landmark Roe v. Wade case, abolishing the constitutional right to abortion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn&nbsp;analysis by TargetSmart Insights, a Democratic political data and data services firm, found that women are out-registering men by significant margins in states where reproductive rights are in danger of being repealed, such as Kansas, Wisconsin and Michigan.\n\n\n\nIn Kansas, women out-registered men by 40 percent, making 70 percent of all new registrants women. Earlier this month, voters in the state rejected a proposed amendment that would have paved the way for the Republican-led state legislature to ban the procedure.In Michigan, where legal battles are taking place over abortion rights, women out-registered men by 8.1 percent since the Supreme Court’s June 24 decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization.In Wisconsin, where&nbsp;it is now a felony&nbsp;for virtually any abortion to be performed, except in instances where it is needed to save the mother’s life, women have out-registered men by 15.6 percent since the Supreme Court’s decision.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This isn’t just a blue state phenomena. In fact, it is more pronounced in states where choice is more at risk, or has been eliminated by the decision,” the&nbsp;CEO of TargetSmart tweeted.\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nWhat Fauci’s exit tells us about the ongoing fight against Covid (Stat) White House strategy for monkeypox vaccines causing ‘chaos out in the field’ (Politico) Study: Pfizer COVID pill showed no benefit in younger adults (AP) \n\n\n\nSTATE BY STATE\n\n\n\nCalifornia ballot measure to guarantee right to abortion has strong support among voters, poll finds (Politico)Congressman’s wife died after taking herbal remedy marketed for diabetes and weight loss (Kaiser Health News) Abortion-rights groups sue Texas AG, prosecutors to protect ability to help pregnant Texans seek legal abortions in other states (Texas Tribune) \n\n\n\nOP-EDS IN THE HILL\n\n\n\nAs monkeypox spreads, we must not repeat the failures of COVID-19 and HIV\n\n\n\nThat's it for today, thanks for reading.

        "description": "The 2022 Minnesota State Fair is almost here so MPR News reached out to Minnesota celebrities for their must eat, must drink and must see of the Minnesota State Fair. Here’s what they said. Keith Marler, Fox 9 meteorologistEat: Since I&#x27;m out there almost every day, I hold pretty strong to my &quot;take a bite and move on&quot; mantra. With all the old favorites and new stuff I&#x27;m exposed to on a daily basis, I&#x27;d need to be rolled out of there by Labor Day every year if I finished everything I try. But, I always am a sucker for Al&#x27;s Subs’ biscuits and gravy a few mornings and Bayou Bob&#x27;s alligator sauté at least two or three times. Drink: Several years ago I was introduced by a friend to the wonderful concept of a Fair breakfast beer so at least once during the Fair, when the morning show is done, he and I will meet up and toast the morning at the Ballpark Cafe (but only on a day I don&#x27;t have to do the 11 a.m. show) See: I think the &quot;must sees&quot; are just making the rounds visiting the tons of friends I&#x27;ve made at different vendors, booths and exhibits over the last 19 years. I only see most of these folks once a year, and so the Fair truly has evolved into a crazy 12-day family reunion for me. Minnesota Governor Tim WalzEat: Pork chop on a stick.Drink: Not only do I love visiting the all-you-can-drink milk booth, I’ll be chipping in as a volunteer this year.See: I’ll miss butter carving hall-of-famer Linda Christensen, but I can’t wait to see Gerry Kulzer take over the butter! Kate DiCamillo, author Eat: I love to get to the fair very, very early in the morning. I get a breakfast burrito. Drink: A cup of coffee. See: The animal barns. there is something utterly heavenly about being down there in the early morning. Let me quote E.B. White (“Charlotte&#x27;s Web”):  &quot;The barn was very large.  It was very old.  It smelled of hay and it smelled of manure.  It smelled of the perspiration of tired horses and the wonderful sweet breath of patient cows. It often had a very peaceful smell — as though nothing bad could happen ever again in the world.&quot;Bad Bad Hats, local band Eat: Sweet Martha&#x27;s Cookies and an ear of roasted corn.Drink: The first and most-interesting sounding beer we find. See: The giant prize-winning vegetables. Jana Shortal, KARE 11 journalist and anchor Eat: Danielson and Sons onion ringsDrink: The coldest or freshest local IPA. I’ll wander near and far on the fairgrounds to find it. See: Easy — amateur talent show. Fairborn and Fairchild, Minnesota State Fair mascotsEat: We love ALL the food at the fair, but as gophers, we’re natural herbivores – so, don’t tell, but we like to get our snack fix at the crops planted near Little Farm Hands.Drink: We are naturally partial to the malts from the Gopher Dairy Bar. The name says it all!See: The daily parade of course! It features two of our absolute favorite mascots … US!State Fair mascot Fairchild in 1998Courtesy of Minnesota State Fair ArchivesBenjamin Percy, author and screenwriterEat: Eating is the reason I go to the fair. The hot chicken sandwich at Blue Barn is a favorite, but I&#x27;m also going to shove a few pronto pups (not corndogs!) and cream puffs and cheese curds and buttered cobs in my mouth. We always review the food listings in advance and hit up some of the new and gourmet offerings as well. I will definitely be wearing the stretchy pants and medicating with a Costco-sized helping of Tums.Drink: It is a truth universally acknowledged that whatever day I attend the fair turns out to be the hottest of the year. Which means I&#x27;m always in the mood for a cold beer. I like the idea of being adventurous and trying some of the more experimental brews, but ... I tend to stick to my local IPAs: Surly, Summit and Mad Butcher to name a few.See: My wife was a 4-H kid, so she has a long history with the fair and might be its ultimate fan. She likes to go multiple times and map out the entire day in advance. I have my favorites, like the haunted house, but I defer to her. And her ultimate site — which she regards with an almost holy reverence — is the giant slide. She even has a T-shirt. And she claims she&#x27;ll be going down it until she&#x27;s 100. So we always shout and whoop our way down it.Sven Sundgaard, MPR news meteorologistEat: I love to hit the turkey stand near the DNR area. I try to be reasonably healthy and the plain hot turkey sandwich is a must for me: TONS of protein and it’s delicious! Then I feel less guilty about other things like fried pickles and mini donuts, which are also a must of mine. They’re simple, but the Tiny Tim donuts are nostalgia for me, I always got them with my late grandpa. Drink:  If it’s midday and hot, nothing sounds good like an ice cold Diet Coke, but we’ve become a fan of that new mini donut beer. It sounds weird, but it was great.See: All of the animals. I think a lot of people forget what the fair is about. Having grown up on a hobby farm with horses and goats, I always wanted to see what everyone else’s goats and horses looked like and my favorite animal: the pigs. I always wanted a pig but my parents never got me one … I’m still bitter … but I do like to visit them. Kelly Barnhill, author Eat: The corn on the cob, or maybe Martha’s Cookies, or maybe those spicy walleye cakes I had one time at a booth I can’t remember and have been looking for ever since. Drink: The bottomless cups of milk, how does it taste so much better there than at home?The new babies at the Miracle of Life Center obviously, and maybe the MPR booth, just because. Two girls sit in the hay with their cows inside the cow barn at the Minnesota State Fair in Falcon Heights, Minn.

Drink: Malt or shake at the Dairy building.See: The massive amount of fanny packs.Yia Vang, chef of Union Hmong KitchenEat: This year it&#x27;s our food at the Union Hmong Kitchen booth in the International Bazaar, but I also love the smoked turkey leg from Turkey To Go. Drink: 1919 Root Beer, of course.See: It&#x27;s great to get up high on the Ferris wheel and see the full view of the fair and all of the people.Angela Davis, MPR News hostEat: Roasted corn on the cob, pork chop on a stick, pronto pup and Sweet Martha’s cookiesDrink: Root beerSee: Babies in strollersJoe Schmit, KSTP sports directorEat: Turkey sandwich.Drink: Try out the craft beers.See: It’s a great place for people watchers.Ed Schumacher looks over a cup of Schell&#x27;s Octoberfest and blueberry beers, topped with frozen beer foam.Tim Nelson | MPR NewsLori and Julia, myTalk 107.1Eat: Cheeseburger at the Midways men’s club ($3.50!), tied with a slice of pizza at the pizza wagon ($2!), notice a trend? We know where the good cheap eats are.Drink: Beer at the Frontier Saloon. See: Music, on any stage.Jennie Clark, Minnesota Aurora assistant coachEat: The Minnesota corn dog. Drink: S’mores Beer at Giggles Campfire GrillSee: Giant karaoke. Leif Enger, former MPR News correspondent and local authorI hate to admit it, but the last time I went to the State Fair was in the early 90s when my brother Lin and I were writing mysteries together. I don’t recall what I ate, but my wife Robin says I smelled of garlic after so maybe a gyro. Sorry, I’m a bad person to ask.Alex Goligoski, Minnesota Wild defenseman Eat: I have to have the cheese curds and vanilla milkshake from the Dairy building. Drink: Mini donut beer is great too, so is the dill pickle beer. See: We try to get a concert every year if we can and I love doing the big yellow slide with the kids.This sketch depicts the Giant Slide and the crowds of fairgoers walking by one of the fair&#x27;s oldest attractions.Courtesy of Amber SausenAlec Soth, photographer Eat: Liquid nitrogen ice cream at Nitro Ice Cream.Drink: Kombucha at the Produce Exchange.See: The Miracle of Birth Center, always (though not while drinking kombucha). Chris Carr, K102 morning show hostEat: The porkchop on a stick.

        "description": "LOS ANGELES (AP) — A federal jury found Wednesday that Los Angeles County must pay Kobe Bryant’s widow $16 million for emotional distress caused by deputies and firefighters sharing photos of the bodies of the NBA star and his daughter taken at the site of the 2020 helicopter crash that killed them.\n\n\n\nThe nine jurors who returned the unanimous verdict agreed with Vanessa Bryant and her attorneys that the photos of the remains of Kobe Bryant and their 13-year-old daughter Gianna invaded her privacy and brought her emotional distress.\n\n\n\nThe jury deliberated for 4 1/2 hours before reaching the verdict. Vanessa Bryant cried quietly as it was read.\n\n\n\nAn attorney for the county declined comment on the verdict outside the courtroom.\n\n\n\nThe pictures were shared mostly between employees of the LA County sheriff’s and fire departments including by some who were playing video games and attending an awards banquet. They were also seen by some of their spouses and in one case by a bartender at a bar where a deputy was drinking.\n\n\n\nVanessa Bryant tearfully testified during the 11-day trial that news of the photos compounded her still-raw grief a month after losing her husband and daughter, and that she still has panic attacks at the thought that they might still be out there.\n\n\n\n“I live in fear every day of being on social media and these popping up,” she testified. “I live in fear of my daughters being on social media and these popping up.”\n\n\n\nHer co-plaintiff Chris Chester, whose wife and daughter were also among the nine people killed in the crash, was awarded $15 million.\n\n\n\nVanessa Bryant’s attorneys did not give jurors a dollar amount they thought their client deserved, but Chester’s attorney gave them suggested guidelines that would have meant tens of millions for each plaintiff.\n\n\n\nVanessa Bryant’s lawyer Luis Li told jurors that the close-up photos had no official or investigative purpose, and were mere “visual gossip” shared out of a gruesome curiosity.\n\n\n\nCounty attorney J. Mira Hashmall argued during the trial that the photos were a necessary tool for assessing the situation.\n\n\n\nShe acknowledged that they should not have been shared with everyone who saw them. But she emphasized that the photos had never appeared publicly, and had never even been seen by the plaintiffs. She said that meant that Sheriff Alex Villanueva and other officials had taken decisive and effective action when they ordered those who had the photos to delete them.\n\n\n\nKobe Bryant, the former Lakers star, five-time NBA champion and member of the Basketball Hall of Fame, was traveling with Gianna and seven others to a youth basketball game when the helicopter they were aboard crashed into hills in Calabasas west of Los Angeles on Jan. 26, 2020.\n\n\n\nFederal safety officials blamed pilot error for the crash.\n\n\n\nThe jury returned its verdict on Kobe Bryant Day, which is celebrated on Aug. 24 because it uses both of his jersey numbers -- 8 and 24 -- and is the day after his birthday. Tuesday would have been Kobe’s 44th birthday.",

Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) said in&nbsp;a joint statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The Senate Judiciary Committee will investigate this issue further with a full Committee hearing this work period, and take further steps as needed to get to the bottom of these alarming allegations,” the senators added.\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Musk factor\n\n\n\nA bombshell Twitter whistleblower complaint alleging the company has major security deficiencies is adding fuel to Elon Musk’s core argument in his case against Twitter as he tries to back out of his&nbsp;$44 billion deal&nbsp;to buy the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer Twitter security chief Peiter Zatko’s complaint, made public Tuesday, complicates the legal challenge for the social media platform.&nbsp;Twitter is suing in an effort to force Musk to complete his acquisition of the company after he walked away from his binding offer over accusations that Twitter breached the agreement by failing to provide him with sufficient data about spam accounts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZatko has had no contact with Musk, and the drafting of the complaint predates Musk’s involvement with Twitter, according to Whistleblower Aid, the group representing Zatko.&nbsp;&nbsp;Nonetheless, key portions of the redacted 84-page complaint,&nbsp;published by The Washington Post, appear to bolster Musk’s accusations, even referencing tweets from Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal to Musk about the number of bots on the platform as a “recent example of misrepresentations.”&nbsp;Musk’s legal team is already leaning into using Zatko’s complaint as the Musk-Twitter case heads to an October trial.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDON’T COMPLAIN TO MUSK  \n\n\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk told a customer not to “complain” about the self-driving bug issues with Tesla vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Tesla customer on Tuesday&nbsp;posted a series of videos on Twitter showing how the company’s new beta version of its Full Self-Driving service, 10.69, has difficulty making signaled turns, changing driving lanes and other basic tasks.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe customer also&nbsp;wrote in a tweet&nbsp;that he had to pay more than $32,000 to receive the latest updates for the vehicle’s system.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Unfortunately I have to say I’m still having to intervene to correct #FSDBeta 10.69 in my area. Still lots of work to go,” the customer wrote. “I know this is probably not a popular opinion but the focusing on the ‘Chuck’ complex left is getting ahead of the needs of some more basic control issues.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZUCKERBERG DROPPED FROM FTC VR SUIT \n\n\n\nFederal Trade Commission (FTC) entered an agreement with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Tuesday to drop him from an ongoing antitrust lawsuit attempting to block the company’s purchase of a virtual reality company.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA joint court filing&nbsp;stipulates that Zuckerberg will not purchase the company, Within Unlimited, as an individual or through any entity controlled by Zuckerberg in exchange for being removed as a defendant in the suit.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit,&nbsp;filed by the FTC late last month, accuses Meta of a years-long “campaign to conquer VR” that began as early as March 2014, when then-Facebook acquired headset-maker Oculus VR.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe suit targets Meta’s attempt to buy Within Unlimited, a virtual reality developer that designed fitness app Supernatural. The app enables users to participate in workout sessions set to music from prominent artists while in a virtual reality environment that mimics destinations across the globe.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCISA HIGHLIGHTS THREATS FROM QUANTUM COMPUTING \n\n\n\nThe Cybersecurity&nbsp;and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA)&nbsp;released&nbsp;new advice Wednesday&nbsp;on ways critical infrastructure should prepare for potential security risks stemming from quantum computing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile quantum computing provides greater speed and power than classical computers, the emerging technology comes with potential risks, including data breaches, that could threaten the security of business transactions, secure communications, digital signatures and customer information.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“While post-quantum computing is expected to produce significant benefits, we must take action now to manage potential risks, including the ability to break public key encryption that U.S. networks rely on to secure sensitive information,” Mona Harrington, acting assistant director for CISA’s National Risk Management Center, said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Critical infrastructure and government leaders must be proactive and begin preparing for the transition to post-quantum cryptography now,” Harrington added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBITS &amp; PIECES\n\n\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: More than networks, America needs better cybersecurity&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNotable links from around the web:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeta Learned Via a Tweet of FTC’s Suit to Block VR Deal (Bloomberg / Alex Barinka, Leah Nylen and Sarah Frier)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow Ukraine used Russia’s digital playbook against the Kremlin (Politico / Mark Scott)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGoogle is launching an experiment to curb anti-Ukraine misinformation in Europe.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3614778-a-new-challenge-for-schools-and-teachers-school-prayer/",
        "description": "As&nbsp;public school&nbsp;teachers return to their classrooms this fall, they will have to manage the ongoing challenges gripping today’s educational landscape: a workforce facing high rates of burnout, students’ learning and wellbeing affected by the pandemic and safety concerns amid rising gun violence in many communities. Yet after a landmark Supreme Court decision handed down this summer, America’s educators will be contending with another issue that is sure to inject more uncertainty into an already tough teaching environment: when and where prayer can happen on public school grounds.\n\n\n\nThis June, the Supreme Court decided in favor of Joseph Kennedy, a high school coach who prayed with students in the middle of the football field after their games. Kennedy sued the Bremerton School District in Washington state for violating his constitutional rights after the district did not renew his contract due to Kennedy’s refusal to stop praying with students on the field. Ultimately, the court found that the school district violated the coach’s First Amendment rights; his public prayer did not violate the establishment clause, which prohibits government entities, like public schools, from endorsing a particular religion.\n\n\n\nWhile the merits of the court’s decision can be argued by scholars and legal experts, there is one clear result: Teachers and other&nbsp;public school&nbsp;employees are now left more confused than ever about what is permissible when it comes to praying in schools.\n\n\n\nAlready since the court’s decision, religious activists, school officials and social media provocateurs have pushed wildly different — and&nbsp;sometimes blatantly unconstitutional&nbsp;— interpretations of the case and its impact on the American education system. In the wake of this incredibly nuanced decision, public school districts must now fill this information void by providing their employees with guidelines on when and where prayer in school is appropriate.\n\n\n\nThe trouble grows when some mistakenly consider the court’s decision as a blanket victory for religious freedom. In fact, there are many who believe this decision addresses the growing public concern that religious liberties are in danger. According to a&nbsp;recent survey&nbsp;on the First Amendment from the Freedom Forum, more than half of Americans say religious freedoms are under threat, with almost as many saying Christianity is especially threatened.\n\n\n\nThe reality is that teachers do not lose their First Amendment rights when they walk through the school doors, but there are some limits to how they can express themselves. The court’s ruling affirms a teacher’s right to bring their whole selves to the workplace, though this does not necessarily apply to the classroom.\n\n\n\nFor example, if a group of teachers want to pray together before, after or during the school day, that should be permitted&nbsp;as long as&nbsp;students are not present. Teachers can pray alone or even around students,&nbsp;as long as&nbsp;it is silent and non-disruptive.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the Supreme Court has long held that school-sponsored prayer,&nbsp;delivered by a teacher or a student, is unconstitutional,&nbsp;and that has not changed. Public school teachers, bound by the First Amendment as employees of the government, cannot use their position to promote their private religious beliefs. That means they cannot actively participate in religious activities with or in the immediate presence of students while on duty. Coach Kennedy’s prayer was ruled constitutional because “Mr. Kennedy did not seek to direct any prayers to students or require anyone else to participate.”\n\n\n\nWhen teachers lead students in prayer, they not only violate the establishment clause but more important, they violate the religious freedom rights of students. Those students who do not share their teachers’ beliefs may feel coerced to participate to secure a good grade or starting position on a sports team. In such cases, teachers place their students in the situation of having to choose between an education and their deeply held beliefs.\n\n\n\nGiven the constitutional complexities of teachers praying while at work, the best practice for teachers may be the simplest one. Indeed, given that one of the most important roles an educator has is protecting the conscience of&nbsp;all&nbsp;their students, the easiest way to do that is to pray in private.\n\n\n\nDavid Callaway is the religious freedom specialist for the Freedom Forum.",

I thought it\ncritical to gauge the impact of the tech icon who was the very\nfirst interview: Steve Jobs. So, I am bringing together the trio\nwho knew him best to discuss his lasting impact: @tim_cook,\n@laurenepowell and Jony Ive.\n\n\nAn on-stage interview looking back at Steve Jobs with any one of those three would be quite a get. To land all three, remarkable.\n\nThis year’s Code is running from September 6–8. With Apple’s “Far Out” event on the 7th, I presume this panel will be on the 6th.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "description": "After the Presentation\n\nSchool of Architecture, University of Liverpool, degree-day afternoon.\n\nQuote of the Day\n\n&#8220;You go Uruguay and I&#8217;ll go mine.&#8221;\n\n\nGroucho Marx (in Animal Crackers)\n\n\nMusical alternative to the morning’s radio news\nRandy Newman | Louisiana 1927\nLink\n\nLong Read of the Day\nWhy Doctors hate their computers\nFabulous New Yorker essay by Atul Gawande.\n\nMy hospital had, over the years, computerized many records and processes, but the new system would give us one platform for doing almost everything health professionals needed—recording and communicating our medical observations, sending prescriptions to a patient’s pharmacy, ordering tests and scans, viewing results, scheduling surgery, sending insurance bills. With Epic, paper lab-order slips, vital-signs charts, and hospital-ward records would disappear. We’d be greener, faster, better.\nBut three years later I’ve come to feel that a system that promised to increase my mastery over my work has, instead, increased my work’s mastery over me. I’m not the only one. A 2016 study found that physicians spent about two hours doing computer work for every hour spent face to face with a patient—whatever the brand of medical software. In the examination room, physicians devoted half of their patient time facing the screen to do electronic tasks. And these tasks were spilling over after hours. The University of Wisconsin found that the average workday for its family physicians had grown to eleven and a half hours. The result has been epidemic levels of burnout among clinicians. Forty per cent screen positive for depression, and seven per cent report suicidal thinking—almost double the rate of the general working population.\nSomething’s gone terribly wrong. Doctors are among the most technology-avid people in society; computerization has simplified tasks in many industries. Yet somehow we’ve reached a point where people in the medical profession actively, viscerally, volubly hate their computers.\n\nThis is long, long but worth every minute. Gawande writes beautifully about medicine, but this is also one of the most insightful pieces I&#8217;ve read about the institutional impact of software.\n\nWhat’s going on in China?\nFrom the (really impressive) Tech newsletter put out by Tortoise Media:\n\nIn the most recent data, youth unemployment in China reached 19.9 per cent, an historically high rate. A faltering birth rate is being compounded by record unemployment and Tencent has not been exempt from the wave of layoffs that have swept the global technology sector. The company reported that – alongside its first ever fall in sales – it also saw the first quarterly drop in the size of its workforce, which fell by 4.7 per cent. China’s young, dynamic and technologically savvy workforce is being alienated. Its population is ageing, and the rewards of globalism on which it has relied in the past are dwindling to nothing. At the centre of its once burgeoning technology sector is Tencent.\n\nHmmm&#8230; There&#8217;s trouble ahead for Xi Jinping.\n\nAbout that Citroen DS19…\nSome time ago I wrote that when we’re in France I’m always on the lookout for a DS19 that’s been carefully restored. We didn’t see any this year, but one lives in hope.\nAnd then, mirabile dictu!, a generous reader pointed me at this:\n\nA DS19 that has not only been beautifully restored but electrified.\n\nElectrogenic is a company formed by Steve Drummond and Ian Newstead, based near Oxford, specialising in converting classics to electric power. The pair have previously electro-converted a Triumph Stag and a Morgan Plus 4.\n“Repowering classic cars with all-electric drive brings a number of benefits, from ease of use to reliability and performance gains. But with our conversions, the aim is always to enhance the original characteristics of the car. In this respect, the Citroën DS was ideally suited to an electric conversion – the silent powertrain adds to the serene driving experience and fits perfectly with the character of the car,” said Drummond at the unveiling of this, the DS Electrogenic.\n\nThe thing about the DS19 was that it was originally supposed to have an innovative air-cooled six cylinder engine. But,\n\nBudget hang-ups at Citroën meant that the planned air-cooled flat-six engine (let’s sit back, quietly, and reflect upon that for a moment…) was binned. In the end, the DS used a mildly revised version of the old Light 15 ‘Traction Avant’ 1.9-litre four-banger. Ever after, the DS was an astonishing car in search of an appropriate engine.\n\nWell, now it’s an astonishing car with a proper electric motor.\n\nMy commonplace booklet\nWords of Advice to Motorists\n“At the rise of the hand of policeman, stop rapidly. Do not pass him or otherwise disrespect him. When a passenger of the foot hove in sight, tootle to him melodiously at first.\nIf he still obstacles your passage, tootle him with vigour and express by word of mouth the warning, Hi, hi’.\nBeware the wandering horse, that he shall not take fright as you pass him. Do not explode the exhaust box at him. Go soothingly by, or stop by the roadside till he pass away.\nGive big space to the festive dog that makes sport in the roadway. Avoid entanglement of dog with your wheel spokes. Go soothingly on the grease-mud, as there lurk the skid demon. Press the brake of foot as you roll around the corners to save the collapse and tie-up.”\n\nAdvice in an English-language newspaper in Tokyo.\n\n\nThis Blog is also available as a daily email.

        "description": "Russian rocket strike kills 22 at a railway station in eastern Ukraine; Zelenskiy says Moscow has placed the world ‘on the brink of a radiation disaster’See all our Ukraine war coverageRussia plans to disconnect Europe’s largest nuclear plant from Ukraine’s power grid, risking a catastrophic failure of its cooling systems, the Guardian has been told. Petro Kotin, the head of Ukraine’s atomic energy company, said Russian engineers had drawn up a blueprint for a switch on the grounds of emergency planning should fighting sever remaining power connections. “The precondition for this plan was heavy damage of all lines which connect Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant to the Ukrainian system,” Kotin said.At least 22 people have been killed and 50 wounded in a Russian rocket strike on a Ukrainian railway station, as the country marked a sombre independence day, and six months since Moscow’s invasion started. Ukraine’s president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, said the rockets struck a train in a station in the town of Chaplyne, about 145km (90 miles) west of Donetsk in eastern Ukraine. “Chaplyne is our pain today. As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car, an 11-year-old teenager died,” he said adding that the death toll could increase as rescue operations continue.Zelenskiy says Russia has placed the world “on the brink of a radiation disaster”. “It is a fact that the Russian military made the territory of the largest nuclear power plant in Europe a combat zone … Now all of Europe and all neighbouring regions are under the threat of radiation pollution,” he said in a Wednesday evening address. Zelenskiy also called for th UN’s nuclear watchdog to take “permanent control” of the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant.US president Joe Biden confirmed a further $3bn (£2.5bn) in military aid, including anti-aircraft missiles, artillery, counter-drone defences and radar equipment. US officials said the equipment, which will have to be ordered and will not be delivered for months or years, represented a longer-term investment in Ukrainian security. It is the biggest tranche of US military aid to date.The UK prime minister, Boris Johnson, visited Ukraine for the third time since Russia invaded, urging the international community to “stay the course” in its support. Announcing £54m in support, he told Zelenskiy that Ukraine “can and will win the war”. Other senior politicians from across Europe travelled to Kyiv to show their support in person.Moscow is making preparations to stage referendums in Russian-occupied areas of Ukraine, according to US intelligence. “We have information that Russia continues to prepare to hold these sham referendum in Kherson, Zaporizhzhia, and the so called Donetsk and Luhansk people’s republics,” spokesperson for Biden’s national security council, John Kirby, said. “We’ve also learned that the Russian leadership has instructed officials to begin preparing to hold sham referenda, particularly in Kharkiv as well. And these referenda could begin in a matter of days or weeks.”Plans by Russian-backed authorities to try Ukrainian prisoners of war in Mariupol would be a “mockery of justice”, the US secretary of state spokesperson, Ned Price, said. “The planned show trials are illegitimate and a mockery of justice, and we strongly condemn them,” he said on Wednesday.Russia has claimed that the slowing pace of its military campaign in Ukraine is deliberate, and driven by the need to reduce civilian casualties. Russian defence minister, Sergei Shoigu, said: “Everything is being done to avoid casualties among civilians. Of course, this slows down the pace of the offensive, but we are doing this deliberately.” Ukraine’s top military intelligence official, Kyrylo Budanov, said Russia’s offensive was slowing because of moral and physical fatigue in its ranks and Moscow’s “exhausted” resource base.Britain is importing no energy from Russia for the first time on record. Figures from the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released six months after the start of the war found that in June the UK’s imports from Russia were down by 97% and stood at only £33m as sanctions took effect.

        "description": "The state at the center of Democrats' uphill drive to keep the House just gave the party the strongest signal yet that their fortunes might be reversing.\nAfter a special election campaign centered on abortion rights, turnout surged Tuesday in Democratic Rep.-elect Pat Ryan’s home turf of Ulster County — the most heavily populated section of New York’s battleground 19th District. Ryan’s margins even narrowly exceeded President Joe Biden’s performance over Donald Trump’s in the county in 2020, giving him the cushion to withstand drop-off elsewhere in the district and win a bellwether race just months before the general election.\nRyan’s victory is the latest in a string of recent signs suggesting that Republicans may not be poised to deliver the shellacking that many expected this fall — and that Democrats, who spent months mired in infighting, off-year election routs and abysmal poll numbers, are getting a jolt of momentum. National generic ballot polling has been slowly trending to the left. In Washington state’s top-two primary earlier this month, the partisan split in Senate and congressional elections fell squarely in between the Democratic wave year of 2018 and strong Republican years in 2010 and 2014, suggesting a more neutral environment.\n“There are 222 seats in the House that are better in terms of the Biden vote than New York 19,” said Sean Patrick Maloney, the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.“That is the canary in the coal mine for what's coming. And it's not the first time, right, we saw it happen,” pointing to special elections in Minnesota and Nebraska and a referendum on abortion rights in Kansas.\nIndeed, Ryan’s win is part of a string of four special elections across three states showing growing suburban enthusiasm for Democrats since the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision, which undid the national protection of abortion rights previously granted under Roe v. Wade.\n“When we really clearly stand up and fight and say what our principles are and don’t pull our punches, we inspire people, we get people motivated and energized, and we win,” Ryan said in an interview Tuesday with POLITICO.\n\nHere’s what happened in those four districts — and what they tell us about the shifting political environment.\nNew York\nIn the closely watched 19th Congressional District, a rare special election in a true swing district, Ryan took home about 51.1 percent of the vote, according to unofficial results as of midday Wednesday. New York continues accepting mail-in ballots postmarked by Election Day for seven days after.\nRyan’s performance was about 1.5 percentage points ahead of Biden’s 2020 performance in the district, though several points behind former Rep. Antonio Delgado’s margin that year. That jump was driven by high Democratic turnout from voters who also showed up for primary elections for full terms in the newly redrawn 18th and 19th Districts (parts of both are included in the old 19th where the special took place.) In six of the seven counties fully inside the district boundaries, the share of Democratic voters who cast a primary ballot was higher than the share of overall registered voters who voted in the special election — suggesting Democrats turned out at higher rates than Republicans or independents.\nRepublicans insist they are not worried about the loss, blaming it largely on low interest among voters not aligned with a political party, who are likely to turn out at much higher rates in November. These independents — who will determine dozens of swing seats in the fall — had less incentive to participate in a special election held on the same day as New York’s closed party primaries, in which they cannot vote.\n“Any Democrat celebrating holding a seat they won last cycle by double digits is in for a rough November,” said Michael McAdams, spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee, referencing Delgado’s 2020 margin. “We will continue to remind voters Democrats are responsible for historic price increases, surging violent crime, and a southern border that has been completely overrun by drug cartels and human smugglers.”\nThe unofficial results show that defeated Republican Marc Molinaro actually received a higher share of the vote than most recent Republican candidates in practically every corner of the district. But the difference was that turnout in its Democratic-friendly portions was far higher.\n“People are seeing every election matters,” said state Sen. Michelle Hinchey, a Democrat from Ulster. “The decisions over the last few months have really reengaged people and worked them up to what is at stake right now. And it’s not business as usual.”\nDemocrats actually made greater gains compared to 2020 in Western New York’s 23rd District, where Max Della Pia brought in 46.4 percent of the special election vote, according to unofficial results. That’s more than 3 percentage points better than Biden’s performance there two years ago, but not enough to beat out Republican Joseph Sempolinski, who will fill the seat vacated by former GOP Rep. Tom Reed.\nThe biggest gain for Democrats by vote share was in Tompkins County, home of Ithaca, where Della Pia took home 85 percent of the vote compared to 73 percent for Joe Biden two years prior.\nMinnesota\nRyan’s victory in the special election was the first actual Democratic special election victory this summer, after candidates in Nebraska and Minnesota overperformed Biden’s numbers — but came up short of wins in districts that had been held by Republicans. In southern Minnesota, Democrat Jeff Ettinger ran about 3 percentage points ahead of Biden’s 2020 margin, though that still was not enough to top Brad Finstad, a Republican who filled the seat left open by the late Rep. Jim Hagedorn.\nWhile the self-funding Ettinger outspent Finstad, the race attracted only sparse outside spending, all in support of the Republican. That frustrated some Minnesota Democrats who thought they had a chance to flip a rare open seat in the aftermath of the Dobbs v. Jackson decision, said Ken Martin, chair of the Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.\n“The moment that decision came out, you started hearing from people at the doors,” Martin said.\nNebraska\nIn a special election in late June just days after the Dobbs ruling, Democrat Patty Pansing Brooks, a Nebraska state senator, improved nearly five points on Biden’s margin in the state’s deep-red 1st Congressional District, which Trump had won by 11 percentage points. She still came up short against now-Rep. Mike Flood.\nPansing Brooks’ biggest gains came in the populous Lancaster County, which contains the state capital of Lincoln. She won 56.6 percent of the vote there in the special election, compared to 52.7 percent for Biden two years prior.\nIn the closing days of the race, Pansing Brooks released a TV ad where she vowed to push back against a “Supreme Court assault on women's rights” — despite the cautions of some her advisers. She attributes her close margin to the shocking ruling and said she wished she had more time for the news to sink in with the electorate before the special election.\n“I did better than any Democrat since ‘64 in my congressional district,” she said. “I beat Biden by 5 points. I beat the predecessor who ran that was a Democrat by 13. We really felt like the momentum was there.”",

Lynn Winmill wrote that the state's near total ban on abortion violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, a law that requires providers to offer medically stabilizing treatment in an emergency, even if that care is an abortion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe abortion ban, which was scheduled to take effect Thursday, will be put on hold while the lawsuit from the Justice Department is argued.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWinmill granted a preliminary injunction preventing the enforcement of the law when abortion is necessary for emergency medical care, in line with the federal law. The block is effective immediately.\n\n\n\nState law must yield to federal law where the two conflict, Winmill wrote in Wednesday’s filing.\n\n\n\n“It’s not about the bygone constitutional right to an abortion. This Court is not grappling with that larger, more profound question,” Winmill wrote. \"Rather, the Court is called upon to address a far more modest issue—whether Idaho’s criminal abortion statute conflicts with a small but important corner of federal legislation. It does.”\n\n\n\nThe ban was a so-called trigger law that was set to take effect once the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade with its decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, handing the regulation of abortion over to individual states.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnder the ban, abortion would be illegal after six weeks even in the case of a medical emergency or complication,&nbsp;with exceptions&nbsp;for rape, incest and saving the life of the mother, and Idaho doctors could be criminally prosecuted for performing the procedure.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department&nbsp;filed suit&nbsp;over the Idaho ban earlier this month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“On the day Roe and Casey were overturned, we promised that the Justice Department would work tirelessly to protect and advance reproductive freedom,” Attorney General&nbsp;Merrick Garland&nbsp;said in a statement&nbsp;announcing the suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We will use every tool at our disposal to ensure that pregnant women get the emergency medical treatment to which they are entitled under federal law,” Garland added.\n\n\n\nUpdated: 9:08 p.m.",

        "description": "Amazon is shutting down its virtual and in-home health care service Amazon Care by the end of the year, citing issues with the program's ability to connect with larger companies and more customers.\n\n\n\nNeil Lindsay, Amazon Health Services senior vice president, sent an email to Amazon Care employees on Wednesday announcing the move, a copy of which was obtained by The Hill. Lindsay said the decision to close the service was made after \"many months of careful consideration.\"\n\n\n\n“Although our enrolled members have loved many aspects of Amazon Care,\" Lindsay wrote in the memo, \"it is not a complete enough offering for the large enterprise customers we have been targeting, and wasn’t going to work long-term.”\n\n\n\nAmazon Care, which launched in 2019 as a pilot program for employees in Seattle, Wash., provides telehealth and on-demand services from a diverse team of clinicians. Nurses and providers do not have physical locations or offices to work out of.\n\n\n\nAmazon has grown increasingly focused on the health care sector, acquiring the company PillPack and rebranding it as Amazon Pharmaceuticals in 2020.\n\n\n\nLast month, Amazon acquired One Medical for nearly $4 billion. One Medical operates 188 medical offices in 25 markets.\n\n\n\nAmazon Care has also remained a focus until Wednesday's announcement. In February, Amazon announced the health care service was rolling out virtually nationwide and in-person care would extend to 20 cities in the country.\n\n\n\nAnd in an April letter to shareholders, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy listed Amazon Care as an \"iterative innovation.\"\n\n\n\nStill, Amazon Care faced competition from Aetna, Cigna, Humana and Kaiser Permanente, which also have virtual services.\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post reported about internal strife at Amazon Care last week. Some employees have complained about the company prioritizing the business over health care services. \n\n\n\nSeveral nurses told the newspaper they grew alarmed over Amazon Care's inability to actually help patients because they did not have adequate resources or physical locations to operate from.\n\n\n\nIn Wednesday's memo, Lindsay said employees should be proud of what they have accomplished but noted the decision was based on the fact the service was not the \"right long-term solution for our enterprise customers.\"\n\n\n\n\"Our work building Amazon Care has deepened our understanding of what's needed long-term to deliver meaningful health care solutions for enterprise and individual customers,\" Lindsay wrote. \"I believe the health care space is ripe for reinvention, and our efforts to help improve the health care experience can have an immensely positive impact on our quality of life and health outcomes.\"",

They more recently criticized Russia for the deaths of civilians in Ukraine and the actions that Russian soldiers have taken as the war has continued.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe accounts created fake personas and posed as independent news outlets, using memes and short videos, trying to start hashtag campaigns, and launching petitions to favor a cause.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGraphika said in its analysis that the study of influence operations has mostly focused on those from \"authoritarian regimes\" such as Russia and China, but the report indicates that additional actors take part in these types of operations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Graphika said the effectiveness of the campaigns was limited, and most posts received no more than a handful of likes. Less than 20 percent of “covert assets” had more than 1,000 followers.",

        "description": "Earlier today, President Biden announced details for student loan forgiveness for eligible borrowers — a part of their plan to address growing concerns over student loan debt across the country. This long awaited announcement came shortly after the  U.S. Department of Education announced that is forgiving $3.9 billion in student loan debt for students who attended ITT Technical Institute between January 1, 2005 and September 2016. MPR News host Cathy Wurzer spoke with Ashley Sibri who graduated from the for-profit college in Eden Prairie about what the forgiveness means for her.

        "description": "A federal judge on Wednesday blocked part of Idaho’s near-total abortion ban — siding with Biden administration in a key test case for what legal strategies might prevail in a post-Roe America.\nU.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill in Boise issued a preliminary injunction, ruling that the state law, which was set to take effect on Thursday, does not provide adequate protection for physicians who perform abortions during a medical emergency, and therefore runs afoul of federal law guaranteeing patients the right to treatment when their health or life is at risk.\n\"The Court does not find the State’s argument persuasive because it has failed to properly account for the staggeringly broad scope of its law, which has been accurately characterized by this Court and the Idaho Supreme Court as a 'Total Abortion Ban,'\" wrote Winmill, a Clinton appointee. \nThe federal government’s challenge represents one of its most aggressive actions to preserve abortion rights since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June. The lawsuit followed weeks of complaints from Democratic advocates and elected officials that the administration has not done enough to push back as abortion access has crumbled in nearly a dozen states.\nThis particular case — one of many playing out across the country — concerns whether states enacting near-total abortion bans are preempting the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, known as EMTALA. That decades-old federal law requires health care workers provide treatment that stabilizes a patient experiencing a medical emergency, and the Biden administration released guidance in July warning doctors and hospitals that EMTALA applies even if the required treatment is an abortion — no matter what state law dictates.\n\nThe case is being closely watched, with attorneys general from more than half of U.S. states submitting friends-of-the-court briefs — red states siding with Idaho and blue states with the Biden administration.\nWednesday’s ruling, however, still allows Idaho to ban nearly all abortions, except in cases of rape, incest or threats to the mother’s life. It only prevents prosecutors from charging doctors with felonies if they perform an abortion for a patient in a medical emergency and are unable to prove that the operation was necessary to save the patient’s life.\nThe state is expected to appeal the ruling to the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, which has gotten more conservative over the last few years and may not be inclined to uphold the decision. \nBy contrast, the Idaho decision also comes the day after a federal judge in Texas, appointed by former President Donald Trump, blocked the Biden administration's guidance on abortion in medical emergencies within the state, siding with state officials who argued that it constituted an unlawful “abortion mandate” and didn’t give enough weight to the needs of “unborn children.”\nThe DOJ is expected to appeal that decision to the conservative 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, and both cases may eventually work their way to the Supreme Court.\nBut the Idaho ruling may force some states considering new abortion restrictions in summer special sessions and when legislatures return early next year to broaden their exemptions for medical emergencies to avoid a lawsuit — adhering to federal guidelines that protect doctors performing abortions when the health of patients, not just their lives, are at risk.\n\n\n\n“Some will plow ahead with sweeping abortion bans no matter what the court says and hope the Supreme Court ultimately supports them,” said Jeff Dubner, an attorney with the advocacy group Democracy Forward who is representing state and national medical groups in the case. “But if courts make clear that EMTALA is the law of the land and does preempt laws like this, states should respect that.”\nThe case is also another sign that medical workers who care for pregnant patients are becoming increasingly vocal and influential as states grapple with how far to roll back abortion rights. During a hearing on Monday, Judge Winmill and attorneys for the Justice Department repeatedly referenced testimony submitted by Idaho OB-GYNs warning that the new law would make doctors afraid to provide abortions in medical emergencies, worsening the state’s maternal morality rate.\n“Doctors are risk-averse. It’s in the very nature of their profession,” said Winmill, adding that he feared what would happen in cases where there’s a threat of “serious medical injury if the abortion is not performed” — including organ failure, sepsis, stroke or infertility — but that fall short of clear life endangerment.\n“We know that is more than just a hypothetical concern,” he said, pointing to the doctors’ written testimony.\n\nBrian Netter, an attorney for the Biden administration, leaned into this reasoning during oral arguments, warning that if the law isn’t blocked, doctors may hesitate to treat people in an emergency because of the threat of prosecution, and that even short delays in care can lead to serious impairments.\n“Provider fear and unease is real and widespread,” he said. “Lives, livelihoods and health are surely on the line. The need for judicial intervention is dire.”\nMonte Stewart, the lawyer representing Idaho lawmakers, pushed back on this, telling the court on Monday that he would advise worried doctors to “go ahead and use your best medical judgment and you don’t have to fear prosecution,” adding that he gives that advice “without the slightest heartburn and without second-guessing myself.”\nThe judge appeared skeptical.\n“It is not much comfort to a doctor that there is a prosecutor who may or may not enforce it,” Winmill said. The legislature wouldn’t have adopted the law unless they intended it to be enforced.”",

        "description": "The U.S. military launched additional retaliatory strikes on Iran-backed forces in Syria on Thursday, in the latest back-and-forth with militants that American officials said were being directed by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\nIn the latest skirmish, the militants planned to launch additional rockets on U.S. personnel, Defense Department officials said, but U.S. forces prevented the attack by striking the militants with AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, AC-130 gunships and M777 artillery. The additional strikes killed four more enemy fighters and destroyed seven enemy rocket launchers, according to a release from U.S. Central Command.\nIran-affiliated forces have recently stepped up low-level attacks on U.S. forces in Syria, including one incident on Aug. 15 when they launched rockets at the Green Village base near the Iraqi border.\nThe Biden administration responded to that attack with precision airstrikes in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, on Tuesday that targeted infrastructure facilities used by groups affiliated with the IRGC.\nIn retaliation, the militants launched rocket attacks on two separate sites in northeastern Syria that wounded three U.S. service members on Wednesday. At roughly 7:30 p.m. local time, rockets landed inside the perimeter of Mission Support Site Conoco, and a further barrage later landed in the vicinity of Mission Support Site Green Village, the military said.\nOne U.S. service member in Conoco was treated for a minor injury and returned to duty, while two others are under evaluation for minor injuries.\nU.S. forces initially responded to the Wednesday strikes using attack helicopters, according to Central Command. The response destroyed three vehicles and equipment used to launch some of the rockets, and initial assessments indicate that two or three suspected militants were killed.\nThe precision strikes were intended to send a message to Tehran that the United States will defend itself, officials said.\n \n\n“We're not going to tolerate attacks by Iran-backed forces on our forces anywhere in the world to include in Syria, and we won't hesitate to protect ourselves and take additional measures as appropriate,” Colin Kahl, the Pentagon's undersecretary for policy, told reporters on Wednesday.\nThe U.S. military had scoped out 11 bunker targets at the site, Kahl said, but ended up targeting only nine of them because shortly before the strike, there was new evidence there might be individuals near the bunker. The forces held off on striking those targets “out of an abundance” of caution in order to avoid casualties, he said.\nThe IRGC is responsible for and directing the attacks, said one senior DoD official.\nThe attacks come as the U.S. continues to pursue negotiations with Tehran to agree on a new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 agreement former President Donald Trump withdrew from during his term in office.\nThe strikes underscore that the U.S. will not hesitate to defend itself when attacked, Kahl said, and that is not connected to the negotiations.",

        "description": "UVALDE, Texas — The Uvalde school district’s embattled police chief was fired Wednesday following allegations that he made several critical mistakes during the mass shooting at Robb Elementary School that left 19 students and two teachers dead.\nIn a unanimous vote, the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District’s board of trustees dismissed police Chief Pete Arredondo, three months to the day after one of the deadliest classroom shootings in U.S. history.\n“Coward!” parents yelled in a Uvalde auditorium as the meeting got underway.\nArredondo is the first officer dismissed over the hesitant and fumbling law enforcement response to the May 24 tragedy. Only one other officer — Uvalde Police Department Lt. Mariano Pargas, who was the city’s acting police chief on the day of massacre — is known to have been placed on leave for their actions during the shooting.\nArredondo, who has been on leave from the district since June 22, has come under the most intense scrutiny of the nearly 400 officers who rushed to school but waited more than an hour to confront the 18-year-old gunman in a fourth-grade classroom.\nMost notably, Arredondo was criticized for not ordering officers to act sooner. Col. Steven McCraw, director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, has said Arredondo was in charge of the law enforcement response to the attack.\nArredondo was not in attendance.\nInstead, minutes before the meeting of the Uvalde school board got underway, Arredondo’s attorney released a scathing 4,500-word letter that amounted to the police chief’s fullest defense to date of his actions. Over 17 defiant pages, Arredondo is not the fumbling school police chief who a damning state investigation blamed for not taking command and wasted time by looking for keys to a likely unlocked door, but a brave officer whose level-headed decisions saved the lives of other students.\nThe letter also accused Uvalde school officials of putting his life at risk by not letting him carry a weapon to the school board meeting.\n“Chief Arredondo is a leader and a courageous officer who with all of the other law enforcement officers who responded to the scene, should be celebrated for the lives saved, instead of vilified for those they couldn’t reach in time,” Hyde wrote.\nUvalde school officials have been under mounting pressure from victims’ families and members of the community, many of whom have called for Arredondo’s termination. Superintendent Hal Harrell had first moved to fire Arredondo in July but postponed the decision at the request of the police chief’s attorney.\nAmong those at the meeting was Ruben Torres, father of Chloe Torres, who survived the shooting in room 112 of the school. He said that as a former Marine, he took an oath that he faithfully executed willingly, and did not understand why officers did not take action when leadership failed.\n“Right now, being young, she is having a hard time handling this horrific event,” Torres said.\nThe Texas Department of Public Safety, which had more than 90 state troopers at the scene, has also launched an internal investigation into the response by state police.\nSchool officials have said the campus at Robb Elementary will no longer be used. Instead, campuses elsewhere in Uvalde will serve as temporary classrooms for elementary school students, not all of whom are willing to return to school in-person following the shooting.\nSchool officials say a virtual academy will be offered for students. The district has not said how many students will attend virtually, but a new state law passed last year in Texas following the pandemic limits the number of eligible students receiving remote instruction to “10% of all enrolled students within a given school system.”\nSchools can seek a waiver to exceed the limit but Uvalde has not done so, according to Melissa Holmes, a spokeswoman for the Texas Education Agency.\nNew measures to improve school safety in Uvalde include “8-foot, non-scalable perimeter fencing” at elementary, middle and high school campuses, according to the school district. Officials say they have also installed additional security cameras, upgraded locks, enhanced training for district staff and improving communication.\nHowever, according to the district’s own progress reports, as of Tuesday no fencing had been erected at six of the eight campuses where it was planned, and cameras had only been installed at the high school. Some progress had been made on locks at three of eight campuses, and communication improvement was marked as half complete for each campus.\nUvalde CISD did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        "description": "KYIV, Ukraine — Russian forces Wednesday launched a rocket attack on a Ukrainian train station on the embattled country’s Independence Day, killing 22 people, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said after warning for days that Moscow might attempt “something particularly cruel” this week.\nThe lethal attack took place in Chaplyne, a town of about 3,500 people in the central Dnipropetrovsk region, Ukrainian news agencies quoted Zelenskyy as telling the U.N. Security Council via video. The president’s office also reported that an 11-year-old child was killed by rocket fire earlier in the day in the settlement.\n“Chaplyne is our pain today,” Zelenskyy said in his nightly video address to the nation.\nAt one point, Zelenskyy put the number of wounded at about 50. The deputy head of Zelenskyy’s office later said 22 people were wounded in the attack, which hit five passenger rail cars.\nUkraine had been bracing for especially heavy attacks around the national holiday that commemorates Ukraine’s declaration of independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. Wednesday also marked the six-month point in the war.\nDays ahead of Independence Day, Kyiv authorities banned large gatherings in the capital through Thursday for fear of missile strikes.\nResidents of Kyiv, which has been largely spared in recent months, woke up Wednesday to air raid sirens, but no immediate strikes followed. As the day wore on, Russian bombardments were reported in the country’s east, west and center, with the most serious attack apparently at the train station.\nOutgoing British Prime Minister Boris Johnson marked the holiday with a visit to Kyiv — his third since the war broke out — and other European leaders used the occasion to pledge unwavering support for Ukraine, locked in a battle that was widely expected to be a lightning conquest by Moscow but has turned into a grinding war of attrition. President Joe Biden announced a new military aid package of nearly $3 billion to help Ukrainian forces fight for years to come.\nOver the weekend, Zelenskyy cautioned that Russia “may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel” this week. He repeated the warnings ahead of the train station attack, saying, “Russian provocations and brutal strikes are a possibility.”\nNevertheless, a festive atmosphere prevailed during the day at Kyiv’s Maidan square as thousands of residents posed for pictures next to burned-out Russian tanks put on display. Folk singers set up, and many revelers — ignoring the sirens — were out and about in traditionally embroidered dresses and shirts.\nOthers were fearful.\n“I can’t sleep at night because of what I see and hear about what is being done in Ukraine,” said a retiree who gave only her first name, Tetyana, her voice shaking with emotion. “This is not a war. It is the destruction of the Ukrainian people.”\nIn a holiday message to the country, Zelenskyy exulted over Ukraine’s success in fending off Moscow’s forces since the invasion, saying: “On Feb. 24, we were told: You have no chance. On Aug. 24, we say: Happy Independence Day, Ukraine!”\nBritain’s Johnson urged Western allies to stand by Ukraine through the winter.\n“This is not the time to put forward flimsy negotiating proposals,” he said. “You can’t negotiate with a bear when it’s eating your leg or with a street robber when he has you pinned to the floor.”\nA car bombing outside Moscow that killed the 29-year-old daughter of right-wing Russian political theorist Alexander Dugin on Saturday also heightened fears that Russia might intensify attacks on Ukraine this week. Russian officials have blamed Ukraine for the death of Darya Dugina, a pro-Kremlin TV commentator. Ukraine has denied any involvement.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin’s forces have encountered unexpectedly stiff Ukrainian resistance in their invasion and abandoned their effort to storm the capital in the spring. The fighting has turned into a slog that has reduced neighborhoods to rubble and sent shock waves through the world economy.\nRussian forces have repeatedly targeted civilian areas in cities, including hospitals and a Mariupol theater where hundreds of people were taking shelter.",

        "description": "On the value of remaining resolutely what you are.\n\nJust before Christmas in 1977, the thirty-six-year-old Bob Dylan sat down for a long conversation with Jonathan Cott. Included in Cott&#8217;s endlessly wonderful book Listening: Interviews, 1970&ndash;1989 (public library), it remains Dylan&#8217;s most soulful and deepest-fathoming interview, replete with his reflections on vulnerability, the meaning of integrity, and the power of music as an instrument of truth. \nOne particular fragment of it has stayed with me over the years &#8212; the kind of pure mountain spring on which the spirit is refreshed again and again with each visit.\nBob Dylan (Library of Congress)\nTwo decades before string theorists formulated the holographic principle &#8212; a property of quantum gravity under which the three-dimensional universe we perceive might be a two-dimensional hologram &#8212; Dylan tells Cott:\nWe&#8217;re all wind and dust anyway&#8230; We don&#8217;t even have any proof that the universe exists. We don&#8217;t have any proof that we are even sitting here. We can&#8217;t prove that we&#8217;re alive.\nWhen Cott asks what kind of life Dylan believes in, in the absence of such proof, he holds up &#8220;real life&#8221; &#8212; the reality of life he experiences &#8220;all the time,&#8221; but which lies &#8220;beyond this life.&#8221; (I am reminded here of Saul Bellow&#8217;s superb Nobel Prize acceptance speech from the same era: “Only art penetrates&#8230; the seeming realities of this world. There is another reality, the genuine one, which we lose sight of. This other reality is always sending us hints, which without art, we can’t receive.”) \nThis prompts the ever-erudite Cott to read for Dylan a teaching by the Hasidic rabbi Dov Baer, the Maggid of Mezeritch, in which he sees a mirroring of Dylan&#8217;s creative ethos and way of being in the world. It so captivates Dylan as &#8220;the most mind-blazing chronicle of human behavior,&#8221; exceeding in wisdom any of the &#8220;gurus and yogis and philosophers and politicians and doctors and lawyers,&#8221; that he asks for a copy to pin to his wall.\nFrom a child you can learn\n1) to always to be happy;\n2) never to sit idle;\n3) to cry for everything you want.\nFrom a thief you can learn\n1) to work at night;\n2) that if you cannot gain what you want in one night to try again the next night;\n3) to love your co-workers just as thieves love each other;\n4) to be willing to risk your life even for a little thing;\n5) not to attach too much value to things even though you have risked your life for them &#8212; just as a thief will resell a stolen article for a fraction of its real value;\n6) to withstand all kinds of beatings and tortures but to remain what you are;\n7) to believe that your work is worthwhile and not be willing to change it.\nComplement with Dylan on the unconscious mind and Leonard Cohen&#8217;s lessons in the art of stillness, then revisit the four Buddhist mantras for turning fear into love.\ndonating = lovingFor a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

        "description": "Ted Leonsis has emerged as a potential suitor in the ongoing sales process involving the Nationals, according to a report from Barry Svrluga, Ben Strauss and Chelsea Janes of the Washington Post. Leonsis&#8217; Monumental Sports &amp; Entertainment is already a major factor in the D.C. sports scene, owning the NBA&#8217;s Wizards, the NHL&#8217;s Capitals and the WNBA&#8217;s Mystics.\nAccording to the Post, Leonsis is one of a few potential buyers granted access to the Nationals financial data. He&#8217;s not making a run at sole ownership, however; Drew Hansen of the Washington Business Journal reports that David Rubenstein, a private equity businessman, is part of the group with Leonsis. It isn&#8217;t clear who else is involved with Leonsis and Rubenstein.\nThe Leonsis group becomes the third known potential suitors for the Nationals. Since the Lerner family announced in April they were exploring the possibility of a sale, the Post has reported that South Korean equity mogul Michael B. Kim and mortgage executive Stanley Middleman have each met with Nationals personnel. Whether Leonsis and Rubenstein have also formally met with Nationals executives yet isn&#8217;t known. The Post has reported that at least five potential bidders have met with the Lerners in recent weeks, so it&#8217;s not a given that any of the three publicly-known suitors will wind up submitting the winning bid.\nThe Lerner family has stopped short of making a firm declaration it&#8217;d pull the trigger on a sale, although it&#8217;s generally expected they&#8217;ll do so. The Post writes that the process could be finalized shortly after the conclusion of the season, with potential ratification of a sale taking place at the owners meetings in November. The Nationals are one of two franchises that could soon change hands, as Angels owner Arte Moreno announced yesterday he was looking into the possibility of selling the Anaheim organization as well.",

        "description": "The Uvalde school board on Wednesday fired Pete Arredondo, the school district’s police chief who led the law enforcement response to a May 24 mass shooting at an elementary school that left 19 children and two adults dead.\n\n\n\nThe Uvalde Independent Consolidated School District unanimously fired Arredondo during a&nbsp;termination hearing, which was held behind closed doors. Local residents gave emotional testimony about the loved ones they lost in the school shooting in the auditorium while they waited for the school board to make the final decision.\n\n\n\nFamilies of the victims have long called for Arredondo's termination.&nbsp;Many residents showed up on Wednesday with signs, including those reading “If you did not do your job, give up the badge.”\n\n\n\nArredondo did not show up for the termination hearing, citing threats made against his life. In a 17-page&nbsp;statement published by the Texas Tribune, his lawyers wrote their client \"will not participate in his own illegal and unconstitutional public lynching\" and requested that Arredondo be reinstated with full backpay.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHis attorneys laid the blame for the shooting on what they called a host of other failures, including an accusation that the school district did not heed his call last year to prepare for a school shooting. They said if Arredondo had better equipment or the school had taller fences and doors that properly locked, \"it could have been different.\"\n\n\n\n\"Chief Arredondo is a leader and a courageous officer who with all of the other law enforcement officers who responded to the scene, should be celebrated for the lives saved, instead of vilified for those they couldn’t reach in time, and not for lack of effort,\" the statement reads. \"The 'perfect storm' of circumstances had to culminate to cause such a tragedy. There was only&nbsp;one person that caused this – the shooter.\"\n\n\n\nAround 376 officers from multiple agencies, including Border Patrol, Texas Department of Public Safety and the Uvalde school district, responded to the shooting at Robb Elementary School while a gunman opened fire inside two classrooms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPolice did not take the shooter down for more than an hour despite gathering inside the hallway outside the classrooms.\n\n\n\nArredondo, who was the commanding officer on site, has defended himself and claimed that he believed the situation had evolved into a barricaded suspect, not an active shooter situation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite writing the school district's active shooter response plan that installs him as the incident commander, Arredondo has also claimed he&nbsp;\"could not have served as the incident commander\" that day because he was on the front lines of the response.\n\n\n\nThe former police chief was placed on paid administrative leave in June and has been on unpaid leave since July 19. At the hearing, the Uvalde school board decided not to pay him for the time he was on unpaid leave.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) and a Texas state House committee launched investigations into the law enforcement response. A July report from the Texas committee found \"egregious failures\" from both the school board and the police.\n\n\n\nSecurity camera footage leaked last month also showed police officers crowded into a hallway outside the classrooms for more than an hour.\n\n\n\nArredondo, an Uvalde native, was hired as the school district's police chief in 2020. He previously worked for the Uvalde Police Department and other departments in Texas, including Laredo and Webb County.",

        "description": "Giorgio Fontana is an Italian writer and novelist living and working in Milan.\n\n\n\nFor Italy, the future is bleak.\n\n\n\nIt seems there’s no choice but to hold one’s nose and vote for anyone who can stop a post-fascist wave from washing across the country. It looks like an ethical imperative.\n\n\n\nAt least that’s the position of philosopher Paolo Flores d&#8217;Arcais who, in an editorial last month, said it’s impossible to be picky. What’s at stake for d&#8217;Arcais is civilization &#8220;as it was a century ago&#8221;— that is, as it was at the time of Benito Mussolini&#8217;s March on Rome, the grim anniversary of which falls on October 28, a month after Italy is set to hold its parliamentary elections.\n\n\n\nBut what about those who decide not to vote at all? Polls predict there will be a growth in abstentions due to widespread distrust in political parties, especially among those under 35. And if these abstainers are left-oriented, must we conclude they’re immoral?\n\n\n\nLet me be clear: As an anti-fascist, I absolutely want to stop the “black wave.” A win for a right-wing alliance led by Giorgia Meloni would be a disaster, leading to widespread xenophobia, unequal fiscal reforms and a culture of fear and resentment to say the very least. Abuse of power and a couldn&#8217;t-care-less attitude would become politically justified.\n\n\n\nBut the &#8220;negative argument&#8221;— voting firstly to stem a threat — has been common currency for the left for about two decades, and it has weakened the center left&#8217;s ability to build a valuable program and support.\n\n\n\nIn 2001, the Economist had deemed Silvio Berlusconi unfit to run Italy, concluding that his election &#8220;would mark a dark day for Italian democracy and the rule of law.&#8221; And since then, leftist democrats have couched their campaigns as a matter of “either us or the wolf.” Either us or Silvio Berlusconi, or Beppe Grillo, or Matteo Salvini or Giorgia Meloni . . .\n\n\n\nOf course, in Italy there’s never been a truly democratic right wing: It’s either been perpetually polluted by fascism, with today’s the League and the Brothers of Italy as the Italian Social Movement of yesteryear; or it’s been tainted by judicial and moral issues, by Berlusconi today just as parts of the Christian Democracy were yesterday; or it’s been masked by revolutionary ambitions that hide a retrogressive nature, with today’s Five Star Movement as the Common Man&#8217;s Front of yesterday.\n\n\n\nPerhaps our election campaigns since 1948 have always been partially based on fear. In the past, it was the phobia of communism — a technique Berlusconi retooled and used himself in his campaigns.\n\n\n\nBut focusing on a threat is a bad way to promote an alternative. Stopping a right wing tainted by neo-fascism is just a first step. After that, an elected government must run the country — hopefully, with a good plan. And to simply pursue &#8220;Draghi&#8217;s agenda&#8221; isn’t enough — averting a crisis now in order to face a bigger one later isn&#8217;t a strategy.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, unlike voting, abstention doesn’t demonstrate an explicit choice. One can opt out of an election out of general disinterest but also out of fatigue and a lack of identification. It would be a mistake to read it as a mere sign of moral deficit. It highlights a structural issue, a vaster problem of trust in representative democracy.\n\n\n\nSo, yes, it&#8217;s necessary to vote to stop the right. But it&#8217;s also reductive to think that politics just boils down to a vote every few years.\n\n\n\nPolitics is an everyday thing. It&#8217;s the vibrant charity system that runs through the country; through the secular and Catholic associations, labor unions, mutual aid organizations, self-managed social centers, feminist leagues, etc. Getting these people concretely involved rather than simply focusing on party alliances is vital.\n\n\n\nOverall, the right has fewer problems. Its strategy is a brutal one, and it knows how to foment hatred and division perfectly. Whereas the task for the left is to build a credible and radical alternative for those who believe in social equality and want to avert global warming — to name only two obvious issues — without just resorting to the “anyone-but-them” argument.\n\n\n\nSimply assuming that &#8220;they will vote for us anyway&#8221; could be a lethal mistake.",

        "description": "ALGIERS — French President Emmanuel Macron will land in Algeria on Thursday — his first visit to the former colony in five years — aiming to improve tense relations with the gas-rich nation as the EU wrestles to diversify energy supplies away from Russia.\n\n\n\nIssues like security, economic ties and energy rank high on the French president’s agenda, but it’s what he has to say about the country&#8217;s colonial past that will likely draw the most attention. The Mediterranean nation was part of the French colonial empire for well over a century until it gained independence in 1962 following a war that took a massive human toll and was characterized by savage brutality — leaving a lasting mark on French politics and society.\n\n\n\nFranco-Algerian relations hit rock bottom last year following Macron’s comments over Algeria’s alleged instrumentalization of past grievances. Algeria withdrew its ambassador in response, though the two nations have made some headway in re-establishing ties since.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMuch is at stake for the French president during his three-day visit as France aims to not only normalize bilateral relations with Algeria but also salvage its sphere of influence in Africa as Russia and China seek to strengthen alliances across the continent.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFriends and foes appear to have supplanted France as privileged partners with the country. Algeria, one of the leading producers of gas in the world, signed a major energy deal with Italy last month, and plans to hold joint military exercises in November with its longtime ally Russia.\n\n\n\nThe visit will focus firmly on “the future” of the relationship, the Elysée said at a briefing with the press Tuesday, noting several forthcoming meetings with Algerian president Abdelmadjid Tebboune that are not focused on historical differences.\n\n\n\n“The president has already done a lot of work on the questions [of the colonial past]… We have to continue working on these issues and the president wants to, but there are other topics… there’s the future, the youth, new technologies, etc.”\n\n\n\nIn a sign that the French president means business, the presidential delegation will include no less than six French ministers and several business leaders including the head of energy company Engie Catherine MacGregor and the billionaire telecommunications tycoon Xavier Niel.\n\n\n\nBut pitfalls and opportunities for missteps will be numerous for a French president who loves face-to-face encounters with ordinary citizens and does not shy away from speaking his mind.\n\n\n\nMacron&#8217;s choice of words on the colonial past will also be closely watched at home by the &#8220;Pied Noir&#8221; communities, descendants of the French returnees from the colony who have their own grievances with the French state. Macron is heading to the city of Oran on Friday after having called earlier in the year for &#8220;the massacre&#8221; there of &#8220;hundreds of Europeans, mostly French citizens,&#8221; to be recognized.\n\n\n\n“Macron is taking a risk. Visiting Algeria, a former colony, is always a risky visit for a French president, and it’s a significant year, it’s 60 years since the end of Algeria’s war of independence,” says Hasni Abidi, a political scientist at the University of Geneva.\n\n\n\n“Macron wants to send a message, that he wants to go beyond history and open a new page in relations,” he said.\n\n\n\nMending ties with a former colony\n\n\n\nMembers of the Algerian delegation pose on March 17, 1962 at its arrival at the Hotel du Parc in Evian-les-Bains, before talks to put an end to the war in Algeria, which will lead to Evian Accords | AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\nRelations between France and Algeria soured last year when the French president was quoted as having made several incendiary remarks about Algeria in the French press. Macron accused Algeria’s “military-political system” of rewriting history and of encouraging “hatred towards France.”&nbsp; He also questioned whether Algeria existed as a nation before French colonization.\n\n\n\nThe comments infuriated the Algerian regime, which recalled its ambassador for several months.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe North African country won its independence from France following a brutal and protracted eight-year war that ended with the signing in March 1962 of the Evian Accords. French historians say half a million people died in the war, including 400,000 Algerians, while Algerian authorities say 1,500,000 lives were lost.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn July of the same year, 99.72 percent voted for independence in a referendum and Algeria finally broke the yoke of French colonial rule — but memories of the 132-year occupation continue to cast a cloud over Franco-Algerian relations.\n\n\n\nMacron will face intense scrutiny on these issues after his comments triggered what Amar Mohand-Amer, a historian at a research center in Oran, called a “grave crisis.” At the time, Macron was accused of pandering to the far-right electorate ahead of the 2022 presidential election.\n\n\n\n“What he says will be observed closely … I think he will make a statement about the colonial past to end the fluctuations with Algeria. And then he will stop talking about these issues.”\n\n\n\nIn his first term, the French president started out with significant political capital in Algeria. During the campaign for the presidential election in 2017, Macron characterized France’s colonization of Algeria as “a crime against humanity.”\n\n\n\nAs the first French president born after the Algerian war of independence, Macron made several bold statements and while he refused to issue an official apology, he took steps to address France’s colonial past such as declassifying state archives and commemorating victims of the war.\n\n\n\nBut it remains to be seen whether ordinary Algerians will warm to Macron once again during his visit. \n\n\n\n“A lot of Algerians don’t like Macron’s flip-flopping. We welcomed the candidate Macron who was courageous and said colonization was a crime against humanity,” Mohand-Amer said.\n\n\n\n“But five years later, he says that colonial France created the Algerian nation. His ambiguity offends people,” he said.\n\n\n\nThe French and Algerian governments have made little progress on tackling unresolved historical conflicts. Prominent Algerian-born historian Benjamin Stora was commissioned in 2020 by the French government to write a report on colonization, but his recommendations were largely ignored by Algeria.\n\n\n\n“None of the recommendations were implemented [on the Algerian side], whether it was starting youth exchanges, working on war cemeteries, there was no response,” said French historian Pierre Vermeren at the Sorbonne University.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There can’t be a Franco-Algerian cooperation on the past, if one of the two parties doesn’t want to take part,” he said.\n\n\n\nWhile Macron has made little headway resolving historical differences with the Algerians, he did however provoke the indignation of France&#8217;s far-right National Rally, with one figure dismissing the Stora report as &#8220;a memorial war on French families.&#8221;\n\n\n\nFrance’s shrinking sphere of influence\n\n\n\nBeyond the hard-edged issues of gas and security cooperation in the Sahel, France’s cultural sphere of influence is also at stake | Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\nDespite a lack of progress on historical matters, the Elysée now sees signs that a corner has been turned in relations with the Algerian government.\n\n\n\nFrench military planes are once more allowed to fly into Algerian airspace after being banned last year, a move that helps military operations as France wraps up its anti-Islamist operation in the Sahel. A longstanding disagreement over re-admitting illegal immigrants back into Algeria also appears to be reaching a resolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to political scientist Hasni Abidi, the Russian invasion of Ukraine has changed the outlook not only for France which is looking to diversify the EU’s energy suppliers, but also for Algeria.\n\n\n\n“Algeria has understood that it doesn’t want to remain on the sidelines and appear part of the Russian axis, it wants to work with the Western camp,” said Abidi.\n\n\n\n“Gas and oil are Algeria’s bread and butter. It saw how Russia was ostracized from the international community and it wants to stay credible,” he added.\n\n\n\nAlgeria is already a gas supplier to France, and while the Elysée warned that “no groundbreaking deals” would be announced during the trip, boosting gas deliveries to Europe to compensate for dropping Russian deliveries will be a focus of the trip according to several observers.\n\n\n\n“It’s clear that Algeria has become more important on the energy front [for France]. But the Italians got in first, the Ukraine crisis was already bad in November last year and they started negotiations,” said energy expert Francis Ghilès from the CIDOB research center in Barcelona, referring to a €4-billion deal signed last month between Algeria and Italy. \n\n\n\n“But looking further than the Ukraine crisis, there are whole swathes of the territory that are unexplored or could be re-explored,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBeyond the hard-edged issues of gas and security cooperation in the Sahel, France’s cultural sphere of influence is also at stake. In July, the Algerian president announced that primary schools would start teaching English to pupils, a move that might signal a shift away from French, a language still used in officialdom. Frustrated Algerian elites are being lured away from going to France over visa issues and often prefer destinations such as Turkey or the Gulf states.\n\n\n\n“But all is not lost for France. Algeria has shown that it can diversify its partners, and I think the message has been heard loud and clear in Paris,” said Abidi.\n\n\n\nThere are cards in Macron’s hand — a shared history, a strong Franco-Algerian community, military cooperation — if he can play them well.\n\n\n\nAmerica Hernandez contributed to reporting.",

The question being asked across Westminster now is whether, assuming she becomes U.K. prime minister on September 6 as expected, she can possibly deliver.\n\n\n\nThe manifesto for government Truss has unveiled over her six-week leadership campaign is both ambitious and eye-wateringly expensive — and, critics say, bordering on impossible, given the increasingly fragile state of the U.K. economy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTruss has made tax cuts &#8220;from Day One” her signature offer, a totemic pledge that has proved music to the ears of members who want to see the party return to its low-tax, small-state tradition.\n\n\n\nBut her stated resistance to offering &#8220;handouts&#8221; to those in need — even during an energy bill spike of unprecedented scale — has been abandoned under intense public pressure, and allies now accept a costly support package for struggling households will also be required in an emergency budget penciled in for September 21.\n\n\n\nSupporters and opponents alike are starting to question if the twin pledges are realistic, as surging U.K. inflation hammers public finances, and the scale of what households will be facing this winter becomes clear — or whether Truss may have to pivot away once the battle for members&#8217; hearts has been won.\n\n\n\n&#8220;She&#8217;s got a choice to make, &#8221; said a senior figure within the opposition Labour Party. &#8220;It&#8217;s hard to see how she can possibly afford — or justify — £30 billion of tax cuts once she&#8217;s speaking to the nation and not just 180,000 Tory members. The whole conversation is going to be about helping households with their bills. Does she delay? Does she press on? Does she just keep borrowing? We all know there isn&#8217;t any money.&#8221;\n\n\n\n&#8216;An extremist&#8217;\n\n\n\nThere is certainly precedent for U.K. politicians abandoning their once-solemn pledges, having won the hearts and minds of party members during internal leadership contests. \n\n\n\nLabour leader Keir Starmer wooed the left of his party in 2020 by promising to adopt some of predecessor Jeremy Corbyn&#8217;s most radical policies — before ditching them wholesale once in power. Outgoing Prime Minister Boris Johnson told Tory members in 2019 that he would slash income taxes for middle-earners and deliver Brexit by October of that year. Neither came to pass.\n\n\n\nBut those who have worked closely with Truss insist there is little chance she will abandon her right-wing instincts if she becomes Tory leader next month.\n\n\n\nUnlike Johnson, whose ideological allegiances were always hard to pin down, Truss “really believes all this right-wing economic theory, and that will definitely be guiding her,” said a former Cabinet minister who worked alongside her.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA senior Conservative MP backing her for leader echoed this, adding: “She’s always been an extremist in everything she does.”\n\n\n\nOutgoing PM Boris Johnson | WPA Pool photo by Oli Scarff/Getty Images)\n\n\n\nAsked whether Truss would implement the tax cuts she’s promised in the fall, another supportive Tory MP said: “She’s going to have to. She’s got this far by being someone who sticks to her guns and does what she believes in.&#8221;\n\n\n\nComparing Truss&#8217; approach to that of her heroine, Margaret Thatcher, the supportive MP added: &#8220;I think we could be heading for a 1980s-style culture shock. She’ll have people around her telling her to do some radical things, and that she has two years as PM to make a difference before she fights an election.”\n\n\n\nIndeed, last week, Jacob Rees-Mogg, one of Truss’ close allies, wrote a piece for the Telegraph arguing that Brexit gives the U.K. government an opportunity to carry out a full rethink of &#8220;whether the state should deliver certain functions at all.”\n\n\n\nRed lights flashing\n\n\n\nTruss&#8217; refrain throughout the campaign has been that the U.K. has £30 billion of headroom within the public finances and that spending the cash on tax cuts will quickly spark growth. Those forecasts, however, were made in March — since when the economic outlook has radically changed.\n\n\n\nThe expectation from Truss&#8217; colleagues is that she will now push Cabinet and civil servants hard to deliver what she has pledged in the hope of achieving a scaled-down version.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNonetheless, many are already predicting her ambitions will not survive the cold shock of reality awaiting her in No. 10 Downing Street.\n\n\n\nThe scale of financial pressures facing households this winter means her support package will likely require spending cuts or higher borrowing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFurthermore, she must address a severely overburdened National Health Service, with waiting times for ambulances currently soaring alongside excess deaths. Truss caused surprise this week by suggesting her solution would be to divert billions of pounds intended to tackle NHS backlogs into social care, in an effort to free hospital beds. \n\n\n\nA Conservative councilor for a large local authority said: “My personal issue is that she&#8217;s not been saying what she&#8217;s going to take away. If you&#8217;re in an area like ours, which has suffered really badly from cuts to local government, you&#8217;re very acutely aware that there isn&#8217;t much else to cut.”\n\n\n\nThe former Cabinet minister quoted above said he assumed Truss would ultimately have to deviate from her current set of pledges.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA &#8220;sensible&#8221; government would pause certain areas of planned expenditure, he predicted, whereas “simply putting it on the credit card and passing it to our grandchildren and telling them they&#8217;ll have to pay for it, that&#8217;s not a responsible solution.”\n\n\n\nAll eyes on the Treasury\n\n\n\nTruss will also have to contend with the rigors of the finance ministry, the former minister added. “The Treasury will remind her, and she&#8217;ll see it in practice, that if you start going off on a completely dangerous tangent, the markets will intervene.”\n\n\n\nShould she press ahead on a radical path, Truss&#8217; hand would be strengthened by choosing a chancellor prepared to help realize her vision. Truss&#8217; pick for the Treasury is widely expected to be the current business secretary, Kwasi Kwarteng. The pair have a longstanding affiliation as two of the newly-elected Tory MPs who, in 2010, co-authored &#8220;Britannia Unchained,&#8221; a radical right-wing program for fostering economic growth. \n\n\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg is one of Truss’ close allies | Rob Pinney/Getty Images\n\n\n\nHenry Hill, deputy editor of the ConservativeHome website, observed: “Her best shot of getting stuff over the Treasury will be with a brand new chancellor that she&#8217;s just appointed.”\n\n\n\nHe added: “What will be interesting is if we get to, say, six months in and the entire dashboard is flashing with red lights, will the chancellor stick with her — ride or die — with a plan that the Treasury doesn&#8217;t like, or does he end up succumbing to the Treasury’s center of gravity?”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAll the contributors who spoke to POLITICO for this article honed in on Truss&#8217; longer-term pledge of increased infrastructure spending as the big ticket item most likely be sacrificed to guarantee tax cuts, casting doubt on her promise to northern voters of better rail provisions.\n\n\n\nIf 2019 was the high-water mark of Johnson’s broad electoral coalition between traditional southern Conservative voters and Brexit-supporting voters in northern towns, some MPs now question whether that alliance can possibly survive the competing demands about to be placed on the new prime minister.\n\n\n\nIt is only when Truss begins to confront these choices that the U.K. will find out exactly what sort of prime minister she intends to be.\n\n\n\nEleni Courea contributed reporting.",

        "description": "You’ve got to admire Kris Bryant. He gets paid handsomely by the Rockies, yet rarely has to show his face on the field and put up with the stinking embarrassment that is playing baseball at 20th and Blake.\nLet’s all raise a toast to Bryant. Who doesn’t want money for nothing?\nWhen franchise owner Dick Monfort and yes-man Bill Schmidt signed Bryant to a seven-year, $182 million deal prior to this season, it conclusively proved the Rockies are not cheap.\nBut this team is stupid, to say nothing of misguided and delusional. As best I can tell, Schmidt&#8217;s plan as general manager is to pretend the Rockies are a contender.\nWell, in the first year of his contract, Bryant has definitely declared himself a serious contender for the worst free-agent signing in club history. That’s really saying something, considering the money this team has flushed down the drain over the years when acquiring pitcher Denny Neagle, washed-up Daniel Murphy and Ian Desmond, who was given $70 million and a glove to a position he had never played.\nOn Wednesday morning, Rockies manager Bud Black announced Bryant received a platelet-rich plasma injection in his left foot, in the hope of speeding his recovery from plantar fasciitis.\nHey, it&#8217;s worth a shot. What does Bryant have to lose except more time on the disabled list? If he takes the field again this season we’ll all be pleasantly surprised. Bryant has played only 42 of Colorado’s 125 games, sidelined for the vast majority of the season with injuries to his back and foot, as well as paternity leave.\nThen, on a summer day when the Rockies didn’t need more bad news, we were reminded why it was puzzling Bryant was signed in the first place.\nThe visiting Texas Rangers jumped to a 6-0 lead on the strength of eight hits and the generosity of three walks and one Colorado error before an out was recorded in the top of the second inning. When Rockies starting pitcher Jose Urena finally coaxed a pop-up to shortstop from Leody Tavaras, the friendly crowd of 25,213 at Coors Field gave the Pet Rocks an enthusiastic, albeit sarcastic, round of applause.\nFinal score: Texas 16, Colorado 4. Maybe that’s not the rock bottom of this forgettable season. But it’s enough to make even a professional ballplayer start making plans for vacation in October.\n“Everybody is just trying to play good baseball,” veteran pitcher Austin Gomber said. “As a team, we want to win. And certain individuals that have been struggling are trying to find their way. Every night, showing up, ready to compete, that’s part of being a big-leaguer.”\nIn the Colorado clubhouse after this disconcerting loss, there was no chatter, no cohesion and no accountability. Fans love Charlie Blackmon, but he has never seen it as his role to stand and take the heat after a bad loss. The rest of this team, from Jose Iglesias, to C.J. Cron, to Randal Grichuk, feels like a loose collection of guys just passing through town.\nOK, nobody’s faulting Bryant, who has produced five homers and 14 RBIs in return for an $18 million salary, for lousy health luck. Colorado does miss his bat in the middle of the order. But a team with an alarming lack of both power and speed is not a healthy Bryant away from making the playoffs.\nBryant is a piece a team logically adds to push it over the top to World Series contention if it keeps Nolan Arenado, DJ LeMahieu and Trevor Story.\nEven a knucklehead like me can figure that out. So why can’t the Rockies grasp Baseball Economics 101? What’s far more damning than overspending on Bryant is the total lack of a discernible and executable plan to build a winner.\nSince the All-Star break, when the Rockies hurtled straight off a cliff on the road to nowhere, losing 21 of 32 games, I’ve heard grumbling that maybe it’s time for Colorado to move on from Black.\nIt’s entirely fair to criticize Black, whose expertise is pitching, for a Colorado staff that ranks 12th among National League teams in walks surrendered, 14th in earned run average and dead last in on-base percentage allowed.\nBlack, however, is not responsible for roster construction, including a stubborn refusal to rebuild that puzzles observers throughout the major leagues.\nRelated Articles\n\nSports Columnists | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRangers hammer Rockies, 16-4, following Jose Urena&#8217;s disastrous start\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nSports Columnists | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; 2023 schedule includes Yankees at Coors Field\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nSports Columnists | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Rockies Mailbag: Manager Bud Black&#8217;s job is not in jeopardy part II\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nSports Columnists | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies ride 3-run homers by C.J.

        "description": "Dmytro Kuleba is Ukraine&#8217;s foreign minister.\n\n\n\nSince Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy suggested banning Russian tourists from traveling to Europe and beyond about a week ago, the idea has gained momentum within the European Union, while also causing heated debate. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSimply put, Russian tourists, businesspeople and students should be banned from traveling to the EU and G7 countries. This is an appropriate response to Russia’s genocidal war of aggression. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“But why sanction ordinary Russians?” some ask. Because an overwhelming majority of them support this war, cheer the murder of Ukrainian civilians, laud missile strikes on Ukrainian cities and deny Russian war crimes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd though the legal responsibility for the committed crimes is, indeed, individual, there is also a common social responsibility that all Russians should bear for the horrors that have been inflicted on Ukraine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet, massive popular support in Russia for the war is a grim reality that not all European leaders seem ready to appreciate. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor instance, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz keeps holding on to his concept of “Putin’s war.” But Germans know better than anyone else that common social responsibility does exist, that assuming common guilt is the only way to overcome common mistakes of the past. Germans have assumed guilt for what their country did in World War II for generations. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Russians haven’t even begun. In fact, they’re moving in the opposite direction. Let’s take off the rose-colored glasses and wake up to the reality of Russian fascism. Placing the blame solely on President Vladimir Putin is dangerously naive. Russia won’t change until generations of Russians assume common responsibility and guilt for what their country has done. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt is therefore imperative that all EU and G7 countries cease issuing tourist visas to Russians as a first step, to sober them up. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey must be deprived of the right to cross international borders until they learn to respect them. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt is true, of course, that a small minority of Russians oppose Putin and the war against Ukraine. Some of them risk persecution at home and must retain the opportunity to seek asylum. I am confident that all necessary procedures for the vulnerable few will remain in place. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz  | John MacDougall/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\nEqually, entry on humanitarian grounds should also remain possible. But tourism and non-essential travel must stop now. Russians who support the war will simply have to make up their minds: Do they want to destroy Europe, or enjoy vacations there?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s important to understand that those who support the aggression against Ukraine, with the use of missiles and tanks, are also supporting Russia’s aggression against Europe and the West by weaponizing energy to trigger higher gas prices and inflation, fomenting political instability. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Russian tourist taking a smiling selfie at the Brandenburg Gate or the Eiffel Tower is most likely someone who also adores Putin and wants Europeans to freeze this winter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTake, for example, Russian pop star Philip Kirkorov who, accompanied by propaganda media, visited a military hospital in occupied Crimea to support wounded Russian soldiers, shortly before going to Las Vegas and Monaco to enjoy a lavish vacation. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nPeople like him retain their right to hypocrisy thanks to the deceptive “Putin’s war” narrative.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSuch Orwellian doublethink is essential for any dictatorship, and Russian whataboutism is a crucial part of this dual reality. For instance, while Putin’s supporters may want Russia to be a global power, they simultaneously support policies that drive it into North Korea-like isolation. Though they may want everyone in the world to respect them, they themselves disrespect others. And even as they might talk for hours about America’s wars, they support their own country’s invasion of Ukraine without even trying to create a casus belli.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLiving such a dual reality is quite common for Russians — generations did just that in the Soviet Union. And Russia has never come to terms with its totalitarian past. It has never assumed guilt for Soviet crimes after the USSR’s collapse. A poll carried out by the Levada Center just last year showed around 60 percent of Russians still have a positive view of Stalin. So, no surprise that modern Russian propaganda has succeeded in splitting Russian minds in two so easily.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussian musician Philip Kirkorov | Kevin Winter/Getty Images\n\n\n\nAnd no other topic reveals Russian doublethink better than its citizens’ attitudes toward Europe. They manage to somehow envy the well-being of Europeans and hate it at the same time. They enjoy humiliating European values and fantasizing about Europe’s imminent collapse, but they prefer to spend their holidays in Biarritz and send their offspring to school in London. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis double standard cannot continue, and banning their tourist travel will end the ambiguity. Having it both ways should not be an option.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere’s also a very practical side to this debate in terms of security. Russians pose an elevated risk of hate crimes and conflict, especially now, when they’re being brainwashed daily by aggressive propaganda. They’re already known for their notorious behavior at global resorts and touristic places, but these risks are now even higher. Turning them away will increase security and reduce crime.\n\n\n\nTourism is an achievement of peace and humanity. Belligerent nations that break international peace must lose access to the privileges of peaceful coexistence.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis was exactly the reason why, at the end of April, the U.N. World Tourism Organization (UNWTO) suspended Russia by an overwhelming majority of votes, far exceeding the required two-thirds threshold. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFollowing the vote, the organization’s Secretary-General Zurab Pololikashvili said: “Tourism is a pillar of peace and international friendship, and members of UNWTO must uphold these values or face consequences, with no exceptions. This emergency General Assembly shows that Russia’s actions are indefensible and contrary to the very principles of UNWTO.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nUkraine is now actively working with partners in the EU and G7 to persuade them to turn away Russian tourists. We see it as one of the most effective personal sanctions against Russia. Unlike some other restrictive measures, it costs almost nothing, enhances security, needs no additional legislation and sends a powerful signal to all Russians. It says that Putin and his supporters have shut the Russia’s door to Europe.",

        "description": "EU trade officials will be paying close attention to Brazil&#8217;s election race this October in the hope that far-right leader Jair Bolsonaro will be booted out and they can resurrect a landmark trade deal with South American countries.\n\n\n\nBrussels struck an initial deal with the Mercosur countries — Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay — in June 2019, but the pact has effectively been on ice since then, not least because of a bitter political and personal clash between Bolsonaro and French President Emmanuel Macron. \n\n\n\nMacron was willing to throw his support behind the deal in June 2019, but only on the understanding that Bolsonaro would take action on the deforestation of the Amazon. By August, everything had unraveled. With global headlines dominated by blazing Amazon fires, Macron accused Bolsonaro of having &#8220;lied&#8221; to him and the enmity became irredeemably toxic when the Brazilian leader mocked the looks of Macron&#8217;s wife, Brigitte. \n\n\n\nBolsonaro&#8217;s main competitor in the election battle, former left-wing President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, is casting himself as a more natural partner to resuscitate trade ties with the EU. He&#8217;s more in tune with Europe&#8217;s goal when it comes to combating deforestation, although he is insisting on renegotiating parts of the 2019 accord. In particular, the former lathe operator and union boss is keen to extract more concessions from the EU side to promote the development of Brazilian industry, tilting the emphasis of the trade relationship away from Brazil simply acting as a giant beef and soybean farm for European consumers. \n\n\n\nEarlier this week, Lula said that the current Mercosur deal was not &#8220;valid,&#8221; and added: &#8220;What we want in the discussion with Europe is not to give up our interest in reindustrializing ourselves.”\n\n\n\nAggregated polls in Brazil give Lula a comfortable lead over Bolsonaro — of about 45 percent to 33 percent — so EU officials may soon have to be grappling with these topics. Alarmingly, however, Bolsonaro, an outspoken admirer of former U.S. President Donald Trump, has been unclear about whether he will accept the results, suggesting enigmatically that he would only concede if the vote were &#8220;clean&#8221; and &#8220;transparent.&#8221;\n\n\n\nFrom the EU side, there is certainly appetite to try to get trade deals back on track, with two trade-friendly countries at the helm of the EU&#8217;s rotating Council presidency: the Czech Republic until the end of the year, then ultra-liberal Sweden. European policymakers have been shaken by the war in Ukraine, which has pushed Europe to strengthen its alliances and supply chains with other parts of the world.\n\n\n\nBrazilian leftist presidential pre-candidate Lula Da Silva speaks during a campaign rally at Centro de Convenções Ulysses Guimarães in Brasilia, Brazil | Andressa Anholete/Getty Images\n\n\n\nThe big question is whether the negotiators at DG TRADE in Brussels are willing to reopen talks with Lula. The European Commission said it&#8217;s working on &#8220;an additional instrument to accompany the agreement.&#8221; Extra provisions regulating environmental effects, it hopes, would avert the need to reopen the agreement.\n\n\n\nThe Commission is “not very fond of renegotiating the deal because [they’re] afraid that once we open the negotiations, it would be like a Pandora’s box,” one EU diplomat told POLITICO on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental concerns\n\n\n\nSeveral EU countries, MEPs and activists have raised environmental concerns about the deal — especially concerning Brazil’s role in the deforestation of the Amazon.\n\n\n\nSince taking office, Bolsonaro has weakened the country’s environmental protection agencies and favored rural landowners, notably by supporting a bill that would formally legalize land grabbing in the Amazon. Last year saw record deforestation in the Amazon, and the first semester of 2022 has already seen deforestation rates over 10 percent worse than those of 2021.\n\n\n\nEven with greater political will on the European side to finalize the Mercosur deal — which was agreed in 2019, but has yet to be approved by the Council of the EU — much will come down to how quickly Lula could turn the page on the environmental front if he wins. \n\n\n\nAmâncio Jorge de Oliveira, who teaches international relations at the University of São Paulo, said a clean U-turn from Brazil was likely. “With a victory from the left, the arguments about the environment would disappear. Brazil would certainly meet the environmental issues,” he said. \n\n\n\nIf those obstacles were removed, that would come as good news to Spain and Portugal, which have been leading proponents of deeper ties with South America.\n\n\n\n(From left to right) Chile&#8217;s President Sebastian Pinera, Uruguay&#8217;s President Tabare Vazquez, Brazil&#8217;s President Jair Bolsonaro, Argentina&#8217;s President Mauricio Macri, Paraguay&#8217;s President Mario Abdo Benitez and Bolivia&#8217;s President Evo Morales pose for a family photo during the 54th Summit of Heads of State of Mercosur and Associated States in Santa Fe, Argentina in 2019 l Stringer/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\nFor France, however, there is the added complication that its farmers, a very vocal political constituency, are opposed to a deal that they argue will open the floodgates to imports of Brazilian beef. Macron has had to navigate these interests carefully as other powerful groups, such as French car makers and big industrial enterprises, are pushing him hard to expand access to South American markets.   \n\n\n\nDiffering priorities\n\n\n\nBolsonaro has been vocal about wanting a deal, and has blamed France for the holdup. “We are doing our best, but France, defending its own interests, gets in our way,” he said in 2020 during one of his weekly Facebook live broadcasts.\n\n\n\nAnd that position seems as entrenched as ever in his camp. This month, Brazil’s Economy Minister Paulo Guedes said that France &#8220;is becoming irrelevant&#8221; to Brazil and is in a weaker negotiating position. He said if France doesn&#8217;t treat Brazil better, it&#8217;s likely Brazil won&#8217;t be &#8220;giving a fuck” about it. \n\n\n\nConversely, Lula has promised to add bits regarding Brazil&#8217;s industrial sector if he&#8217;s elected. &#8220;We will call on the European Union to improve the agreement. I have faith that we will announce this agreement soon, but with better quality to ensure that Latin American countries can have an industrial policy,&#8221; Lula said in July. \n\n\n\nStrengthening Brazilian industry has been one of Lula’s main promises during his campaign. The industrial sector&#8217;s share of Brazil&#8217;s output fell from 28.6 percent in 2004 to 18.9 percent in 2021, its worst performance in almost two decades. Lula has pushed to make investments in technology and innovation, and said the country should treat its state-owned oil corporation Petrobras &#8220;not only as a company, but also as an agent of development.&#8221;  \n\n\n\nDe Oliveira said that Europe would face a tough choice if Bolsonaro were re-elected: Hold their noses and get the deal done or keep it frozen. &#8220;Europe would realize that it is no longer possible to postpone its decision. It doesn&#8217;t make sense to postpone this for four more years,&#8221; he said.\n\n\n\n&#8220;I think the big challenge for the ratification of the deal lies within Europe, not Brazil.”\n\n\n\nSarah-Anne Aarup contributed reporting. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of&nbsp;POLITICO Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one-stop-shop solution for policy professionals fusing the depth of POLITICO journalism with the power of technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive, breaking scoops and insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomized policy intelligence platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-level public affairs network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY GO PRO\n\n\n\nLOG IN",

        "description": "Three U.S. service members were injured in rocket attacks in Syria carried out Wednesday by suspected Iran-backed militants, according to U.S. Central Command, the latest in a slew of attacks on American personnel that U.S. officials said were directed by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\n\n\nRockets landed at two separate sites in northeastern Syria starting at roughly 7:30 p.m. local time, the command said late Wednesday in a press release. Several rockets struck inside the perimeter of Mission Support Site Conoco, followed by additional rockets that landed in the vicinity of Mission Support Site Green Village.\n\n\n\nOne U.S. service member in Conoco was treated for a minor injury and returned to duty, while two others are under evaluation for minor injuries.\n\n\n\nU.S. forces responded to the strikes using attack helicopters, according to the release. The response destroyed three vehicles and equipment used to launch some of the rockets, and initial assessments indicate that two or three suspected militants were killed.\n\n\n\nThe latest attacks come after U.S. forces conducted precision airstrikes in Deir ez-Zor, Syria, overnight, targeting infrastructure facilities used by groups affiliated with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The strikes were in retaliation for Iran-backed groups’ recent attacks against U.S. personnel in Syria, including one on Aug. 15, and intended to send a message to Tehran that the United States will defend itself, officials said.\n\n\n\n“We’re not going to tolerate attacks by Iran-backed forces on our forces anywhere in the world to include in Syria, and we won’t hesitate to protect ourselves and take additional measures as appropriate,” said Colin Kahl, the undersecretary of defense for policy.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. military had scoped out 11 bunker targets at the site, Kahl said, but ended up targeting only nine of them because shortly before the strike, there was new evidence there might be individuals near the bunker. The forces held off striking those targets “out of an abundance” of caution in order to avoid casualties, he said.\n\n\n\nThe IRGC is responsible for and directing the attacks, said one senior defense official.\n\n\n\nThe attacks come as the U.S.&nbsp;continues to pursue negotiations&nbsp;with Tehran to agree on a new nuclear deal to replace the 2015 agreement former President Donald Trump withdrew from during his term in office.\n\n\n\nThe strikes underscore that the U.S. will not hesitate to defend itself when attacked, Kahl said, and that is not connected to the ongoing negotiations.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/rich-hill-discusses-possible-2023-plans.html",
        "description": "Rich Hill is currently amidst his 18th big league season, with the long-tenured southpaw set to reach his 43rd birthday before next Opening Day. Among active players, only Albert Pujols &#8212; who has already announced 2022 as his final season &#8212; is older than the Red Sox&#8217;s hurler. Hill, however, tells Rob Bradford of WEEI he feels physically able to continue his playing career beyond this year. He nevertheless also expressed a desire to spend more time with his wife and son, pointing to the amount of time players spend away from their families over the course of a 162-game schedule.\nWith that in mind, Hill tells Bradford he could consider an atypical approach to next season &#8212; sitting out the first few months with an eye towards joining a contender midseason. Hill, who will be a free agent again at the end of this year, suggested he could stay in shape and continue to throw independently for the first few months of next season before pursuing an opportunity with a club around July. &#8220;If we look at the trade deadline, even for this year, everybody needs more pitching,&#8221; the pitcher noted. &#8220;Whether that be out of the bullpen and/or starting, it&#8217;s that opportunity to be able to help a team that&#8217;s going to be able to go into the postseason and make some things happen, especially with the experience I have in the postseason.&#8221;\nTo be clear, Hill didn&#8217;t definitively state he was committed to the half-season approach. He expressed confidence in his ability to hold up physically if he went the traditional route and signed with a team over the offseason and played a full schedule. It seems he&#8217;ll wait until the offseason for he and his family to officially settle upon their plans, but Hill pointed to some benefits that could be associated with a hypothetical half-season approach. Waiting until midseason would give him and his representatives at ACES a clearer picture of the standings to target a playoff contender. He also indicated a preemptive rest period could have performance benefits for the stretch run.\n&#8220;You&#8217;ll be 43, but there&#8217;s obviously some more to give inside, where you can take those extra couple months to rejuvenate and put the work in and the time in the gym. It could be beneficial for that second half,&#8221; he opined. &#8220;You&#8217;re trying to come back and be as productive and fresh as possible. &#8230; I&#8217;m not saying I wouldn&#8217;t be for an entire season. It just might not be ideal for my family. (It might be better) to spend half the year with my son and my wife, where we can enjoy each other, and start to move in that direction.&#8221;\nHill, who has suited up for a whopping 11 teams in his big league career, signed a $5MM guarantee to return for a third MLB stint with the Red Sox last December. He lost most of July to a left knee sprain but has been a useful back-of-the-rotation contributor when healthy. Hill has given the Sox 82 2/3 innings of 4.68 ERA ball. While his 18% strikeout rate and 8.4% swinging strike percentage are each below-average, he remains a capable strike-thrower and has held left-handed opponents to a meager .220/.278/.320 line in 54 plate appearances on the year.\nBetween that production and Hill&#8217;s wealth of major league experience, he should still find interest from teams during the upcoming offseason. Whether he elects to pursue a job during the winter or holds off until the middle of next season remains to be seen, but his comments to Bradford indicate he&#8217;s eyeing a 19th MLB campaign in some capacity.",

It would allow authorities to arrest a health-care professional involved in performing an abortion, putting the onus on that person to prove in court that the abortion met the criteria for one of the exceptions.&#8221;",
