        "description": "Ten Republican senators sent a letter to members of the Biden administration this week demanding an explanation for a rule change that will allow some individuals who have materially supported terrorist organizations to immigrate to the U.S.\n\n\n\n“We write because the American people deserve an explanation regarding the broad, open-ended nature of this authority for exempting individuals who would otherwise be barred from immigration to the United States for supporting a terrorist organization,” Sen. Bill Hagerty (Tenn.) and his colleagues wrote wrote in the letter addressed to Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas and Secretary of State Antony Blinken.\n\n\n\nThe June 8 determination by the Departments of Homeland Security and State announced that people who have provided “insignificant” or “limited” material support to terrorist organizations in the past will no longer be barred from immigration.\n\n\n\nThe Secretaries of the two departments have authority to exempt some from federal prohibitions on the immigration of people linked to terrorist activity.\n\n\n\nHowever, according to the letter, “Usually, such an exemption is limited to specific groups or conflicts for obvious reasons.”\n\n\n\nThe senators took issue with the generality of the rule change, which according to the DHS was intended to help “vulnerable Afghans,” saying that its lack of limits to “certain conflicts, terrorist organizations, geographic regions, or time periods” is dangerous.\n\n\n\nThe letter sought answers to eight questions concerning the determination, including about whom it had already allowed into the country, why the language was general rather than specific to Afghans and whether it would apply to people at the Southern border or affiliated with the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n\n\n\nSens. Rick Scott (Fla.), Kevin Cramer (N.D.), Ted Cruz (Texas), Marco Rubio (Fla.), Joni Ernst (Iowa), Roger Marshall (Kansas), Tommy Tuberville (Alabama), John Hoeven (N.D.), and Steve Daines (Montana) joined Hagerty in signing the letter.\n\n\n\n--Updated on Aug. 28 at 8:30 a.m.",

        "description": "Mays finished his legendary career with the Mets. During their festivities for Old Timers’ Day at Citi Field today, the Mets made a big surprise announcement: The team has retired #24 for the legendary Willie Mays.\nOne of baseball’s inner-circle Hall of Fame players, Mays spent most of the 1972 season and all of the 1973 season as a Met. That marked a return to New York City, the city where his spectacular career began as a member of the New York Giants before they moved to San Francisco.\nBefore joining the Mets, Mays had been promised by then-owner Joan Payson. But after his retirement and her passing, the number retirement never came to fruition. The 91-year-old Mays wasn’t able to attend the announcement, but he did offer some thoughts on the honor:\n“I want to thank Steve and Alex Cohen for making this day possible and embracing Mets history,” Mays said. “I can never forget the way it felt to return to New York to play for all the loyal Mets fans. I’m tremendously proud I ended my career in Queens with the Mets during the ’73 World Series. It’s an honor to have my number retired in my two favorite cities – New York and San Francisco. New York was a magical place to play baseball.”",

I am assuming that if I made a copy of a Sheet with a Named Function that this comes with the copy? I also assume that unlike with Google Scripts, there is no need to provide permission for Named Functions? I am left wondering about combining the use of macros and Named Functions.The post 💬 A Guide To Named Functions In Google Sheets (New For 2022!) – first appeared on Read Write Collect.Also on: benlcollins.com",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  David Peterson and the Mets’ bullpen were very good, and Brandon Nimmo had a nice night. For the third time in as many nights, the Mets made it very clear that they are playing in a different tier than the Rockies. This time, four Mets pitchers combined to shut out Colorado, and the Mets won the game 3-0 in the end.\nDavid Peterson went six innings, struck out seven, didn’t walk anyone, and gave up just four hits. He now has a 3.21 ERA on the season. Seth Lugo, Trevor May, and Adam Ottavino each threw a scoreless inning in relief of Peterson to finish off the shutout.\nAt the plate, the Mets took the lead immediately, as Brandon Nimmo hit a solo home run to start the bottom of the first. That was all the Mets really needed on the night, but it certainly didn’t hurt that Nimmo drove in a run with a double in the second or that Starling Marte plated Nimmo on a double in the seventh.\nAs Gary Cohen pointed out at the end of the game, the Mets are 36 games over .500 for the first time since the end of the 1988 season.\nSB Nation GameThreads\nAmazin’ AvenuePurple Row\nBox scores\nMLB.comESPN\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      FanGraphs\n  \nWhat’s WPA?\nBig Mets winner: David Peterson, +31.0% WPABig Mets loser: Eduardo Escobar, -8.8% WPAMets pitchers: +43.6% WPAMets hitters: +6.4% WPATeh aw3s0mest play: Brandon Nimmo doubles in a run in the second, +11.0% WPATeh sux0rest play: Ryan McMahon singles in the fifth, -4.9% WPA",

        "description": "Two Colorado lefties squared off in front of a packed house in Queens Saturday night in what turned out to be a sweet pitcher&#8217;s duel.\nIn the end, the Mets&#8217; David Peterson, the distinguished alumnus of Regis Jesuit High, bested the Rockies&#8217; Kyle Freeland, the pride of Thomas Jefferson.\nPeterson blanked the Rockies for six innings, giving up just four hits, striking out seven and walking none in the Mets&#8217; 3-0 victory at Citi Field.\n&#8220;What we noticed was the uptick in the velocity, up to 97 (mph),&#8221; Rockies manager Bud Black told AT&amp;T SportsNet. &#8220;We have seen him in the past, 90, 91, 92, but I think the uptick in the velocity is what stood out for me.\n&#8220;And a good change and a few good sliders. He pitched well. The pitching tonight was really good.&#8221;\nNew York, winners of 15 of their last 17 games at Citi Field, improved to 43-19 at home, while the Rockies cemented their hold on the worst road record in the majors (18-42).\nPeterson&#8217;s victory over his Colorado buddy comes with an asterisk.  While Peterson had the Mets&#8217; offense backing him, Freeland had the Rockies&#8217; lifeless road offense in his corner. Colorado totaled just five hits, just three after the first inning, and struck out 11 times.\nFreeland, gritty as always, gave up two runs on just four hits in five innings, but two of the hits he surrendered were game-changers. And he needed 95 pitches to get through his night, in part because the Mets fouled off 28 of his pitches.\nBrando Nimmo greeted Freeland in rude New York fashion, demolishing Freeland&#8217;s second pitch of the game for a 433-foot homer that turned out to be the only run the Mets needed.\nThe first frame has been problematic for Freeland all season. He entered Saturday&#8217;s game having allowed 18 runs in the first, tied for the sixth-most in the majors. Opponents are batting .330 in the first inning against Freeland, and it didn&#8217;t help Colorado&#8217;s cause that New York is now 65-12 when scoring first this season.\nNimmo hurt Freeland again in the second, ripping a two-out, RBI double to right. Freeland set himself up for trouble, plunking Mark Canha to open the inning and then walking Jeff McNeil.\n&#8220;I thought early that Kyle was showing the secondary pitches quite a bit and they were fighting them off,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;And then he sort of turned the corner and got to the fastball location a little bit more and the later innings were much better, obviously.&#8221;\nBlack is testing a lot of relievers as the season winds down, including right-hander Justin Lawrence, who&#8217;s showing glimpses that he could be a late-inning reliever next season. But he was hit and miss Saturday night, giving up a run on three hits in two innings. Lawrence was hurt in the seventh inning when he issued a one-out walk to Nimmo, followed by a run-scoring double by Starling Marte that pushed the Mets&#8217; lead to 3-0.\nThe Mets, who have beaten the Rockies eight times in the last nine games at Citi Field, will attempt to finish off the four-game sweep on Sunday afternoon.\n\nOn Deck\nRockies RHP Germán Márquez (6-10, 5.22 ERA) at Mets RHP Max Scherzer (9-3, 2.33)\n11:40 p.m. Sunday, Citi Field\nTV: ATTRM\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM\nMarquez is trying to rebound from a rough start at Coors Field vs. Texas. He was saddled with six earned runs over his six innings. That was a gut punch for Marquez, who had been on a nice roll, allowing three or fewer runs in six of his last seven outings while posting a 3.30 ERA. The Mets took it to Marquez on May 21 at Coors Field, scoring five runs (four earned) on 11 hits over six innings. In six career starts vs. New York, he&#8217;s 3-2 with a 3.89 ERA.\nWith 199 victories, Scherzer is one win away from joining a select club of active pitchers with 200-plus victories. Justin Verlander (242) and Zack Greinke (223) are the only active pitchers who have won more than 200 games in their careers. Scherzer is coming off a sub-par performance against the Yankees, who tagged him for four runs on seven hits, including a home run, over 6 2/3 innings. Scherzer has struggled against the Rockies, going 2-4 with a 4.91 ERA in 11 career starts. A big part of that ugly number, of course, is Coors Field, where he&#8217;s 0-3 with a 6.39 ERA in six starts.\nTrending: Outfielder Wynton Bernard, the 31-year-old rookie, entered Saturday&#8217;s game having hit safely in eight of his first 10 career games, including three multi-hit games. He was hitting .308 (12-for-39).\nAt issue: Of the Rockies’ 41 road losses in 2022 (entering Saturday night&#8217;s game), 13 have been one-run games (18-21 overall in those games), and of those 13 games, 11 of them ended with the opponents scoring the game-winning run in the eighth inning or later. Seven of those losses were walk-offs, including Friday night&#8217;s Mets victory.\nPitching probables:\nMonday: Off Day\nTuesday: Rockies RHP Jose Urena (2-5, 5.98) at Braves LHP Max Fried (12-4, 2.52), 5:20 p.m., ATTRM\nWednesday: Rockies RHP Ryan Feltner (2-5, 5.87) at Braves RHP (16-5, 2.99), 5:20 p.m., ATTRM",

        "description": "Updated: Aug. 28, 4:25 p.m.Severe storms swept through the Twin Cities on Saturday night, sending people at the Minnesota State Fair scrambling for cover amid flash flooding on the fairgrounds.The National Weather Service said Sunday multiple EF 0 tornadoes struck southern Ramsey county and Dakota county.  Survey teams found damage that indicated a tornado with peak winds of 75 miles per hour traveled 3.4 miles from Interstate 94 and Highways 10 and 61. It passed by Harding High School, and ended at Goodrich Golf Course. Other EF 0 tornadoes hit Eagan, Apple Valley, Burnsville and West St. Paul, but were brief.The storms brought gusty winds over a wide area.  One gust measured at 61 mph at the State Fair Grandstand — as well as torrential rain that caused street flooding.Just before 9 p.m., fair officials tweeted that the Grandstand show — The Current&#x27;s Music On-A-Stick, featuring headliner Portugal. The Man — was paused as the storms approached. Officials urged fairgoers to seek shelter.As downpours started to cause street flooding on the fairgrounds, fair officials announced  that the remainder of the concert had been canceled.In a statement Sunday, Fair officials said rides were operating normally and the grounds opened as usual.  They said attendees should check the Fair’s Twitter account and website for updates. Elsewhere in the Twin Cities, there was a report of trees down and blocking a street near Maplewood as the storms passed through around 9 p.m., as well as a report of hailstones bigger than quarters in Little Canada.There also were reports of trees and large branches down in Coon Rapids, Lakeville, Eagan and Apple Valley — where there was a report of a tree that fell on a home.Xcel Energy reported more than 27,000 customers without power in its Minnesota service area in the wake of the storms. That number was down to about 8,500 homes and businesses as of 7:30 a.m. Sunday.The Minnesota Valley Electric Cooperative reported more than 1,000 customers without power immediately after the storms, and the Dakota Electric Association reported more than 800.A cold front forecast to sweep across the region may produce more showers and storms on Sunday afternoon and evening, and the Weather Service says some of those may be severe.Find forecast updates on MPR Weather&#x27;s Updraft blog.Find radar updates here and more storm updates on our live weather blog.Severe storms brought torrential rain that caused flooding at the Minnesota State Fair on Saturday night.Jacob Aloi | MPR News",

        "description": "Prior to today&#8217;s game with the Dodgers, the Marlins selected the contract of left-hander Jake Fishman from Triple-A Jacksonville.  Right-hander Bryan Hoeing was optioned to Triple-A in the corresponding move.\nWhile Fishman wasn&#8217;t needed in today&#8217;s 2-1 victory thanks to Sandy Alcantara&#8217;s complete-game gem, Fishman can provide the Miami bullpen with some length as they navigate a difficult stretch in their schedule.  The southpaw has found a lot of success as a multi-inning reliever this season, with a 2.04 ERA, 23.9% strikeout rate, 8.6% walk rate, and 52.6% grounder rate over 53 innings in Jacksonville.\nFishman made his MLB debut on July 31, allowing one run over 3 1/3 innings of relief work in a 9-3 Miami loss to the Mets.  The southpaw was designated for assignment the next day, then outrighted to Triple-A and off the 40-man roster after clearing waivers.\nOriginally a 30th-round pick for the Blue Jays in the 2016 draft, Fishman joined the Marlins organization as a selection in the minor league version of the 2020 Rule 5 Draft.  While relievers are generally more under the radar than most prospects, it is perhaps a little surprising that it took Fishman until 2022 to get his first crack at the majors, considering the solid numbers he has posted throughout his minor league career.",

        "description": "In a speech Thursday night, President Joe Biden called out today&#8217;s MAGA Republicans for threatening &#8220;our personal rights and economic security&#8230;. They&#8217;re a threat to our very democracy.&#8221; When he referred to them as &#8220;semi-fascists,&#8221; he drew headlines, some of them disapproving.A spokesperson for the Republican National Committee called the comment &#8220;despicable,&#8221; although Republicans have called Democrats &#8220;socialists&#8221; now for so long it passes as normal discourse. Just this week, Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL) called Democrats &#8220;radical left-wing lunatics, laptop liberals, and Marxist misfits.&#8221;Biden&#8217;s calling out of today&#8217;s radical Republicans mirrors the moment on June 21, 1856, when Representative Anson Burlingame of Massachusetts, a member of the newly formed Republican Party, stood up in Congress to announce that northerners were willing to take to the battlefield to defend their way of life against the southerners who were trying to destroy it. Less than a month before, Burlingame's Massachusetts colleague Senator Charles Sumner had been brutally beaten by a southern representative for disparaging slavery, and Burlingame was sick and tired of buying sectional peace by letting southerners abuse the North. Enough, he said, was enough. The North was superior to the South in its morality, loyalty to the government, fidelity to the Constitution, and economy, and northerners were willing to defend their system, if necessary, with guns.  Burlingame&#8217;s &#8220;Defense of Massachusetts&#8221; speech marked the first time a prominent northerner had offered to fight to defend the northern way of life. Previously, southerners had been the ones threatening war and demanding concessions from the North to preserve the peace. He was willing to accept a battle, Burlingame explained, because what was at stake was the future of the nation. His speech invited a challenge to a duel. Southerners championed their region as the one that had correctly developed the society envisioned by the Founders. In the South, a few very wealthy men controlled government and society, enslaving their neighbors. This system, its apologists asserted, was the highest form of human civilization. They opposed any attempt to restrict its spread. The South was superior to the North, enslavers insisted; it alone was patriotic, honored the Constitution, and understood economic growth. In the interests of union, northerners repeatedly ceded ground to enslavers and left their claim to superiority unchallenged. At long last, the attack on Sumner inspired Burlingame to speak up for the North. The southern system was not superior, he thundered; it had dragged the nation backward. Slavery kept workers ignorant and godless while the northern system of freedom lifted workers up with schools and churches. Slavery feared innovation; freedom encouraged workers to try new ideas. Slavery kept the South mired in the past; freedom welcomed the modern world and pushed Americans into a new, thriving economy. And finally, when Sumner had spoken up against the tyranny of slavery, a southerner had clubbed him almost to death on the floor of the Senate. Was ignorance, economic stagnation, and violence the true American system? For his part, Burlingame preferred to throw his lot with education, morality, economic growth, and respect for government.Burlingame had deliberately provoked the lawmaker who had beaten Sumner, Preston Brooks of South Carolina, and unable to resist any provocation, Brooks had challenged Burlingame to a duel. Brooks assumed all Yankees were cowards and figured that Burlingame would decline in embarrassment. But instead, Burlingame accepted with enthusiasm, choosing rifles as the dueling weapons. Burlingame, it turned out, was an expert marksman.Burlingame also chose to duel in Canada, giving Brooks the opportunity to back out on the grounds that he felt unsafe traveling through the North after his beating of Sumner made him a hated man. The negotiations for the duel went on for months, but the duel never took place. Instead, Brooks, known as &#8220;Bully&#8221; Brooks, lost face as a man who was unwilling to risk his safety to avenge his honor, while Burlingame showed that northerners were eager to fight. Forgotten now, Burlingame&#8217;s speech was once widely considered one of the most important speeches in American history. It marked the moment when northerners shocked southerners by calling them out for what they were, and northerners rallied to Burlingame&#8217;s call.President Biden&#8217;s Twitter account has recently been taken over by new White House's Deputy Director of Platforms Megan Coyne, who garnered attention when she ran the official New Jersey Twitter account with attitude, and it seems as if the administration is taking the new saltiness out for a spin. &#8220;All the talk about the deficit from the same folks that gave an unpaid-for $2 trillion tax cut to the wealthy and big corporations.

        "description": "Critics were lukewarm upon release but the resulting decades have been kinder to the unsettling prequel that takes a look at the real Laura Palmer“I’ve already gone places. I kind of like to stay where I am.” The great Harry Dean Stanton tearfully recites these words to FBI agents Chet Desmond (Chris Isaak) and Sam Stanley (Kiefer Sutherland) in David Lynch’s 1992 masterwork Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me. Though this scene seemingly has nothing to do with Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee), it’s a perfect summation of the film’s tragic protagonist. Someone attempting to find light in a nightmarish world. Unfairly lambasted by critics during its original release, Fire Walk with Me is a terrifying, tragic look into the last days of a young woman experiencing the worst kinds of abuse.Serving as a prequel (and a semi-sequel) to the cult TV series, the film mainly focuses on the last week of Laura Palmer’s life, the teenage homecoming queen whose murder became the focal mystery of the show. In 1990, television audiences were constantly asking who killed Laura Palmer but, in Fire Walk with Me, Lynch tried to answer the question: who was Laura Palmer? Continue reading...",

In it, children – boys and girls, despite the name – were encouraged, or at liberty, to make days of adventure, building campfires and using scrap building materials to knock together dens and sheds.When she discovered Jongensland, Schulz-Dornburg had lately been working on a project involving young heroin addicts in Düsseldorf, where she lived. She instinctively felt that the children in Amsterdam had the raw materials for a more constructive future. She ended up making many photographs of the structures built at the site. A new collection of them, Huts, Temples, Castles, is published this month.Huts, Temples, Castles by Ursula Schulz-Dornburg is published by Mack Continue reading...",

        "description": "The emergency created by soaring energy prices is so grave that normal politics doesn’t apply. Our leaders must wise up – and fastThe world has changed on energy prices, so our policy response must also change. That is what every politician should understand after the confirmation that typical bills are heading for £3,600 in October and £5,000-plus in January. Whatever they thought they came into politics for, whatever pet projects or prejudices they have, must be set aside. Their task is to avert the winter of discontent ahead.Gas prices are shooting up just as we need it to keep our homes warm: half of annual gas consumption happens between January and March. The result will be average winter bills of £500 a month, three times those of last year. Monthly energy costs will peak at more than £700 in January. Anyone who thinks low- and middle-income Britain can afford this hasn’t noticed the living standards stagnation of the last 15 years that has left low-income households spending 59% of their budgets on essentials (up from 52% in 2006).

        "description": "From Wednesday, August 31 through Friday, September 2, I’m going to be tending the Auth0 booth at ng-conf 2022 in Salt Lake City’s Grand America Hotel, the annual conference dedicated to all things Angular.\n\n\n\nI’ll be there, providing yeoman service to two coworkers who’ll be speaking at the event&#8230;\n\n\n\nAlisa Duncan, Senior Developer Advocate at Okta.\n\n\n\nFirst, there’s Alisa Duncan, Senior Developer Advocate at Okta (Auth0’s parent company), who’ll be presenting There’s Safety in Angular, which is scheduled for Wednesday, August 31 at 10:32 a.m. MDT (that’s not a typo, it’s happening at ten thirty-two). Here’s the brief on her talk:\n\n\n\nWhen you use Angular, you know you’ve got a best-in-class framework with all the bells and whistles at your fingertips. But did you know Angular is also a cozy blanket that keeps you safe and secure? Businesses with a security breach in 2021 average over $8 million in remediation, and it can permanently damage their brand. The 2021 OWASP Top 10 list includes broken access control and web injection exploits in their top 3 security risks. This talk will cover web vulnerabilities, risks posed by exposing sensitive information, and how Angular has your back so you can rest easy.\n\n\n\nSam Julien, Director of Developer Relations at Auth0.\n\n\n\nThen, there’s my teammate Sam Julien, Director of Developer Relations at Auth0. He’ll be presenting with Cloudinary’s VP of Developer Experience Kim Maida&#8230;\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nKim Maida, VP of Developer Experience at Cloudinary.\n\n\n\n&#8230;and their talk is titled RXWut? and scheduled for Wednesday, August 31 at 2:36 p.m. MDT (again, not a typo; it’s happening at two thirty-six). Here’s the abstract:\n\n\n\nYou’re working on your Angular application late one night and need to handle some data. That means using RxJS, so you think, “Great! People love RxJS and there are tons of docs. This will be easy!” You remember that someone told you “everything is a stream” and “it’s just an array over time” but in practice, those insights haven’t been as helpful as you’d hoped. You also need to manipulate data in the stream, which means: operators! You head to the docs and you’re looking for just the right operator… Distinct until what? What’s a forkJoin? These examples all have to do with multiplying arrays of numbers, but your data isn’t numerical. Okay, what about these weird diagrams? Wait, what the heck do marbles have to do with programming?!RxJS is fascinating and powerful, but the learning curve for reactive programming can be challenging (to say the least). In this talk, we’ll take a light-hearted approach to demystifying reactive programming concepts, confusing operator names, and much more. Whether you’re already a reactive wizard or still a fledgling Rx apprentice, you’ll laugh (and maybe cry) while learning some new magic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you’re attending ng-conf 2022, drop by the Auth0 booth! I’ll be there, and I’ll be pretty easy to spot&#8230;\n\n\n\nYours truly, that rare specimen of accordion-playing developer advocate.\nThe post I’ll be at ng-conf 2022 this week! appeared first on Global Nerdy.",

        "description": "This superb and uncompromising study of 21st-century healthcare by the former head of the BMA asks whether we get the treatment we deserveIt has been the quite the year for self-assured authors diagnosing what fundamentally ails the NHS. Former health secretary Jeremy Hunt (Zero: Eliminating Unnecessary Deaths in a Post-Pandemic NHS) wants to stop doctors making mistakes. Former Conservative party deputy chairman Michael Ashcroft and journalist Isabel Oakeshott (Life Support: The State of the NHS in an Age of Pandemics) can barely disguise their loathing of the venal medics, feckless managers, malingering health tourists and bottomless money pits that fatally blight the NHS. I await another former health secretary Matt Hancock’s forthcoming tome with bated breath – not least in the hope that he reveals the secret of how he found the energy to conduct an office-based extramarital affair while ostensibly managing a pandemic.The latest author off the blocks is Prof Sir David Haslam – former chair of the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, former president of the Royal College of GPs and of the British Medical Association. Haslam has, as far as I can tell, no political axe to grind, no track record in government to buff and defend and – most refreshing of all – a deliciously plain-speaking way with words. Side Effects: How Our Healthcare Lost Its Way and How We Fix It is the real deal, a superb analysis of the thorny, intractable, endlessly sidestepped issues that bedevil 21st-century healthcare. Don’t be put off by the title. In our superficial, cakeist, post-truth era, it is genuinely exhilarating to read a proper, heavyweight analysis framed in prose as blunt, on point and devoid of spin as Haslam’s.

        "description": "Serbian President Aleksandar Vučić announced on Saturday that the EuroPride festival won’t be held in Belgrade as planned next month due to the “significant crisis in Kosovo.”\n\n\n\nThe announcement stunned organizers of the pan-European celebration, which had been scheduled for September 12-18 in the Serbian capital. EuroPride, which features a Pride parade, is an independently organized event hosted in a different city every year, with the host city being chosen either for its political significance or the size of the LGBT community.\n\n\n\n“We were shocked by this announcement,” said Marko Mihailovic, an organizer of the Belgrade Pride parade involved in this year’s EuroPride events. He said organizers met with government and city authorities as recently as Thursday as part of the planning for EuroPride.\n\n\n\n“This is quite the defeat for Serbia,” Mihailovic told POLITICO on Saturday. “Now when we have an event of European proportions organized in Belgrade and a lot of people have announced their attendance and bought tickets, it’s being canceled.”\n\n\n\nTensions flared between Kosovo and Serbia a few weeks ago along the border between the two over license plates and entry documents, with barricades being erected and shots fired at the Kosovo police. Late Saturday, the EU said an agreement had been reached to resolve the border issue.\n\n\n\nSerbia does not recognize the sovereignty of its former province, which declared independence in 2008. The oppression of the country’s ethnic Albanian population led to an armed conflict in the late 1990s that culminated with the NATO bombing of Serbia and Montenegro.\n\n\n\nAs the Russian invasion of Ukraine rages on, there are fears that the long-lasting Serbia-Kosovo tensions – coupled with Serbia’s close relationship with Russia – could lead to the region once again being engulfed in conflict.\n\n\n\nVučić said he is “not happy about” the decision to cancel EuroPride, “but we can’t do it all at once.”\n\n\n\n“Of course this jeopardizes minority rights and that is a problem for us, but at this moment the state is pressured by all kinds of problems,” Vučić said.\n\n\n\nRight-wing groups and hooligans regularly target events organized by activists, as well as their offices in Belgrade.\n\n\n\n“For decades, the LGBT+ community has been demonized in mainstream narratives in the country, and there is little to no condemnation for the hate speech and hate crimes directed towards it,” Mihailovic said.\n\n\n\nA Serbian Orthodox bishop “cast a curse” on those supporting the EuroPride parade. Religious protests have been held against the event, and even the mayor of Belgrade, Aleksandar Sapic, voiced his disapproval.\n\n\n\n“Large swathes of Serbian society are plagued by a traditionalism that is always seeking out an enemy, someone to blame or someone to treat as inferior,” said Sofija Todorovic, the program director at the Youth Initiative for Human Rights, an NGO.\n\n\n\nPolitical parties often try to capitalize on events such as the Pride parade to score points among voters espousing more traditional values. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis despite the fact that Serbia’s prime minister, Ana Brnabic, is openly lesbian. At the same time that he announced the cancelation of EuroPride, Vučić put forward Brnabic to lead the formation of a new government after the recent elections.\n\n\n\nLate on Saturday, EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell said an agreement had been reached between Kosovo and Serbia whereby Serbia would allow Kosovan citizens to enter the country with their personal ID cards. This is a landmark deal, considering Serbia refuses to acknowledge any documents issued by Kosovo.\n\n\n\nIn his press conference earlier, Vučić explained that the decision would be followed by a disclaimer, made visible on all border crossings, stating that the acceptance of Kosovo ID cards would be done &#8220;exclusively for practical reasons, to make it easier for individuals and to enable the freedom of movement&#8221; and that it cannot be interpreted &#8220;as a recognition of the unilateral declaration of independence of Kosovo.&#8221;\n\n\n\nThe agreement exposes Vučić to attacks from nationalists and those further to the right than him, for whom any compromise involving Kosovo is unacceptable.\n\n\n\nSerbia’s president is known for maintaining a careful balance between being diplomatic and open-minded among officials in Brussels, while espousing conservative and nationalist values at home.\n\n\n\nThe cancellation of EuroPride could disrupt the juggling act he has maintained for years.\n\n\n\n“Vučić can no longer play the game that he is used to playing, which is having one story for the citizens of Serbia while having a completely different approach to Brussels,” said Todorovic.\n\n\n\n“EuroPride makes this dilemma very simple. Either we have it or we don’t have it; either Vučić is a European politician or he isn’t.”\n\n\n\nThe event in September would have been the first time EuroPride was organized in southeast Europe, with previous events taking place in cities ranging from Manchester to Warsaw.",

        "description": "Trying to stave off the advancing years is fine for a superstar. If only we mortals had the timeNicole Kidman, 55, is not only an excellent, award-winning actress and reportedly good company, witty and clever. Next month’s cover of Perfect magazine reveals that she also possesses the latest weapon in the anti-ageing armoury, namely muscles. Furthermore, unlike the deep-frozen facial impact of Botox for holding back the years, these are muscles that move – if Kidman’s reverse plank, also pictured, is any guide. Since the portrait of the actress was released last week, dressed in what looks like a quilted upmarket nappy, it transpires that she is definitely not alone in acquiring sculpted biceps, washboard abs and banished batwings (upper arm sag) in the elasticated period now known as midlife.

There is not only a beneficial effect from spending time in green spaces – as shown by the way it can reduce stress levels and even speed healing times in hospitals. But a growing body of scientific evidence now shows we don’t just like plants, we have a physical need to be around their beauty. So, here is my question: why, even as a nation of gardeners, do we struggle to get people involved in gardening?I’ve been sitting on panels for more than a decade as industry bodies, media outlets and charities try to address the increasingly worrying question of how few young people are interested in horticulture. With garden societies closing, course places going unfilled and nurseries shutting shop, it’s becoming quite urgent. Continue reading...",

        "description": "This post was intended for August 27,  and I could even get the energy for the tapping it in until the wee hours, slipping into August 28.\n\n\n\nThis is the day to remember, honor, tell a few stories about my Dad, who left this world August 27, 2001 and my Mom, who followed him 10 years later, on the same day. That is 11 years and 21 years ago, lengths of time that remain hard to grapple as they keep iterating.\n\n\n\nAbou the only thing I thought of was the play on the rules of Blackjack, where the Ace today plays 11 and the Queen makes it 21, but the house wins only memories that get fuzzier.\n\n\n\nWhat stories are left? There&#8217;s more that left with them than I can rummage. While making breakfast this morning I tried to hear the phone calls from Dad when he would open with, &#8220;hello Junior&#8221; and I would snap back &#8220;hello, Senior!&#8221; I tell myself I can hear it, but do I? There are no film plot gimmicks where the call comes through over time travel.\n\n\n\nThere are long ago distant memories of the rare times Dad &#8220;cooked&#8221; breakfast on a Sunday&#8230;\n\n\n\n\n\nSunday Special flickr photo by cogdogblog shared under a Creative Commons (BY) license\n\n\n\nNo he did not use Old Bay, but he had some unique technique for making what had to be the driest omelet in history. I never complained, and would get bites down with the help of milk. I did not want to dishonor his effort. No matter how good or not you are in the kitchen, I learned that making food for your family was an act of love.\n\n\n\nI spent a chunk of time making the feature image for this post, maybe I was putting off trying to find words. Then I went through the archives tagging all the August 27 posts into a collection. I go at a shiver seeing the 10 year post I wrote for Dad in 2011, a short one I think dashed on while stopped for lunch on the highway. I would have written that hours before that horrible call from my sister, her hysterical voice telling me, &#8220;Mom is gone.&#8221;\n\n\n\nMy sister Judy who came to Saskatchewan from Maryland &#8212; it&#8217;s been too many years. Maybe the best part was seeing how well she and Cori bonded, just like sisters.\n\n\nI feel so fortunate this summer that my sister Judy and her husband traveled here from Maryland to spend time in our home, but more importantly, to meet for the first time and bond with Cori. It fills much of the empty spots; and Cori shared today how much that those days together her made her feel more presence of my Mom.\n\n\n\nLast week Cori and I went for a day excursion to one of our favorite camp spots, where we took a walk over some wild bush landscape to get to the beach side part of the South Saskatchewan River. Just as we stepped out, Cori stopped, and pointed. There was the presence of Mom&#8230; a small Monarch butterfly just sitting on the trail.\n\n\n\nJust as Mom always said it worked&#8230; that whenever you see a butterfly it represents the spirit of someone you loved who passed away. \n\n\n\nI was not deft enough to get my phone camera out in time for a photo, so you just have to trust us. She has shown up before when we were camping\n\n\n\n\n\nHello Butterfly flickr photo by cogdogblog shared into the public domain using Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0)\n\n\n\nAnd being the loving person she is, last Christmas Cori gave me a metal butterfly as a tribute of tis emory that had a friend make for me.\n\n\n\n\n\nMetal Butterfly flickr photo by cogdogblog shared into the public domain using Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0)\n\n\n\nI know deeply Mom would have loved visiting us, telling Cori stories, and loving her as a daughter.\n\n\n\nSo here this post just wanders again through the memory shreds. It strikes me how little of a person&#8217;s whole experience and person we can encode as memories, but the fullness of what they did provide feels as strong as ever.\n\n\n\nUPDATE: I came back here to edit because I left out a photo I was going to share, time travel to 1976, yes, Mom and Dad dressed to the max for my Bar Mitzvah, a large affair they provided for me as supposedly my entrance into &#8220;manhood&#8221; (one enters that wearing a baby blue tuxedo, mine matched Dad&#8217;s).\n\n\n\nIn the formal wear for my Bar MItzvah, circa May 1976. I wore the same tux as Dad!\n\n\nThere it goes, another click of the yearly clock, another but farther down the road of time away from my parents.The sadness is more a somber realization of what it means that there are not really too many older branches of the family tree left, I&#8217;m kind of sitting at the top now. But the tree is far from empty, it&#8217;s full of these memory shreds and echoes of love.\n\n\n\nUntil next August 27&#8230;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatured Image: My own photo of the Ace of Hearts and Queen of Diamonds playing cards, with photos of Mom and Dad placed inside of them, all my creation, so consider it shared under a CC BY  (bye bye) license.",

Between the longstanding traditions and myths that shape the place, the owners that span four generations have never seen prices rise as they have in the past year.Across America, inflation affected the food industry acutely, and in the case of La Segunda, the cost of wheat doubling in just 12 months left a bruise. “That’s 30% to 40% of our manufacturing,” said Copeland More, a partner alongside his father in the business.

Away with them!”The Marriage Portrait, like O’Farrell’s 2020 runaway bestseller, Hamnet, is written in a lavish if rather solemn present tense that tries to bring the past to life: “The two girls grip each other by the arms. The maid is trembling, a hand held to her chest, as if to still her heart. The scream comes again, louder this time, and with words attached: ‘No, no, no!’” It’s Pullman tearing his hair out!

        "description": "From Red Road to Prometheus, the Scottish actor has quietly amassed one of the most impressive CVs on screen. Our film critic talks to one of his favourite actorsEarlier this year, an Observer reader asked me the question: “Which actor do you think has produced the greatest quality of work across their career?” My answer was Kate Dickie. The Scottish star made a splash in Andrea Arnold’s directorial feature debut, Red Road, in 2006, for which she won a Scottish Bafta, and has gone on to appear in a bewilderingly diverse array of films. These range from Ridley Scott’s sci-fi blockbuster Prometheus (2012) to Robert Eggers’s indie chiller The Witch (2015), Tom Geens’s mysterious, grief-stricken Couple in a Hole (also 2015, for which Dickie won a second Scottish Bafta), and more recently David Lowery’s epic chivalric poem adaptation The Green Knight (2021). In some of these films Dickie takes the lead; in others she plays a supporting role. Crucially, in none of them does she give less than 100%. And as I said in response to the reader’s question: “You can watch three Kate Dickie films back to back and not realise you’re watching the same person.”“That has actually happened quite a lot,” says Dickie, who is guest of honour next weekend at Screenplay, the Shetland film festival that I have proudly co-curated for more than a decade. “I’ve had people tell me, ‘Oh, I saw a film you were in and I didn’t even realise it was you.’ That’s great because it means that you’re doing your job properly – although it’s maybe not so great for networking. But my whole thing with acting is that I’m here to tell these characters’ stories as best I can, even if they’re not at a great point in their lives. I think I’ve got one of those faces that changes with the characters I play – I’m not a ‘pretty’ person, but I’ve got strong features. And to be honest I generally don’t do a lot of press or interviews or photoshoots because I’m not really bothered about how I look, and I tend to feel that the less you know about me outside of the roles I play the better.” Continue reading...",

Now, on the eve of the premiere of a starry British film about the amazing discovery of his remains under a Leicester car park, the great “lost king” of England is again the subject of conflict.The group of expert archaeologists who retrieved his bones from the hidden ruins of the Greyfriars church 10 years ago last week, and who skilfully proved who he was, are this weekend fighting to stop their side of the story being buried for ever.

I Was Neon catalogues all the ways Jacklin has tried to present “correctly” – a deceptively easygoing indie rock tune whose wordless exclamations convey as much as her well-chosen words and even tone.Jacklin’s ability to stop you in your tracks has not waned. “Go put ice in your mouth, let them slap you about,” she sings, cataloguing sex advice she has absorbed since her early teens on Ignore Tenderness. Mid-album, Less of a Stranger is a skewering dose of bittersweetness about the distance between Jacklin and her mother. By contrast, she can also conjure picture-perfect third-person vignettes. Moviegoer “opens with a wide shot”, and ponders how success is elusive: “20 million dollars, still nobody understands you,” sings Jacklin, sweetly. Continue reading...",

He’s drawing, as usual, a picture of his little sister. She is a large egg with two lines for legs (no arms) and a smile that bisects the entire width of her Humpty Dumpty face like a garotted Parisian aristocrat. His fascination with spelling is charming, if a little back to front. He never asks how words are spelled, preferring instead to list a random sequence of letters and ask what word they make: F-D-T-R or G-S-O-P or P-R-I-B.Just once in all this time has he hit upon even an acronym, and for this reason he now knows more than any four-year-old really needs to about the Republic of South Africa, the Royal Society of Arts, and the Road Safety Authority. It is impossible to explain to him that this is an inefficient way of increasing his spelling knowledge, but some part of me thinks it keeps him more deeply engaged with letters and their uses than the other way round, so maybe it’s better. The sad fact is I don’t know, and that’s becoming more of a problem. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The U.S. intelligence community will evaluate the potential national security risks stemming from former President Donald Trump’s possession of top-secret documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence, Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines told top lawmakers.\n\n\n\nIn a letter obtained by POLITICO and dated Friday, Haines told House Oversight Committee Chair Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) and House Intelligence Committee Chair Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) that her office will lead an “assessment of the potential risk to national security that would result from the disclosure of the relevant documents.”\n\n\n\n“The Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) are working together to facilitate a classification review of relevant materials, including those recovered during the search,” Haines wrote, adding that the review will be conducted in a way that “does not unduly interfere with DOJ’s ongoing criminal investigation.”\n\n\n\nThe correspondence represents the Biden administration’s first known engagement with Congress on the issue of the ongoing investigation ensnaring the former president. Court documents unsealed in recent days have revealed that the Justice Department is investigating potential violations of the Presidential Records Act, the Espionage Act, and obstruction of justice.\n\n\n\nIt’s also the first known acknowledgment by the intelligence community of the potential harm caused by the missing documents, which prosecutors said Friday included human-source intelligence and information gathered from foreign intercepts. Top lawmakers have been clamoring for details about the substance of the documents since the Aug. 8 search of Mar-a-Lago, but so far neither the intelligence committees nor congressional leaders part of the so-called Gang of Eight have been briefed.\n\n\n\nHaines’ response came on the same day that a federal judge unsealed a redacted version of the affidavit that laid out the Justice Department’s justification for obtaining a search warrant for Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit revealed that prosecutors believed Trump was holding a range of top-secret documents at his private residence, including some of the former president’s handwritten notes.\n\n\n\n“We are pleased that in response to our inquiry, Director Haines has confirmed that the Intelligence Community and Department of Justice are assessing the damage caused by the improper storage of classified documents at Mar-a-Lago,” Schiff and Maloney said in a joint statement to POLITICO. “The DOJ affidavit, partially unsealed yesterday, affirms our grave concern that among the documents stored at Mar-a-Lago were those that could endanger human sources. It is critical that the IC move swiftly to assess and, if necessary, to mitigate the damage done — a process that should proceed in parallel with DOJ’s criminal investigation.”\n\n\n\nThe intelligence community’s review is likely to encompass whether any unauthorized individuals had access to the highly sensitive documents. The Justice Department previously raised alarms about the lax security of the records within Trump’s estate. That question could also bear on the criminal probe, as Justice Department counterintelligence investigators determine whether the highly classified records were compromised in any way.\n\n\n\nThe Senate Intelligence Committee has also asked the intelligence community to conduct a damage assessment related to Trump’s handling of the documents, but the inquiry was bipartisan. The panel’s chair, Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), and vice chair, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), both signed onto the request.\n\n\n\nIn addition to informing Maloney and Schiff of her office’s intent to conduct a damage assessment, Haines sent a similar response to Warner and Rubio on Friday.\n\n\n\nThe Senate duo also asked the Justice Department to give the committee access to the specific documents that were seized from Mar-a-Lago. A wider group of congressional leaders&nbsp;asked to see the documents, too.\n\n\n\nIn a statement earlier Saturday, Rubio noted that the Justice Department hasn’t yet responded to the committee’s letter, but made no reference to Haines’ response.\n\n\n\n“The Senate Intelligence Committee is still waiting for information from the Department of Justice about the specific intelligence documents seized from Mar-a-Lago and what necessitated an unprecedented search warrant on President Trump’s residence,” Rubio said.\n\n\n\nKyle Cheney contributed to this report.",

        "description": "A federal judge said Saturday she’s inclined to grant Donald Trump’s request to bring in an outsider to oversee the review of more than two dozen boxes of materials the FBI seized from the former president’s Florida estate earlier this month.\n\n\n\nIn her&nbsp;brief order, which she emphasized was not a final decision, U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon also directed the Justice Department to produce by Tuesday “a more detailed” list of items seized from Trump’s residence on Aug. 8 as well as the status of the government’s ongoing review of those materials, which includes the use of a “filter team” to screen for attorney-client privileged records.\n\n\n\nThe FBI executed a search warrant of the Mar-a-Lago estate aimed at recovering what a magistrate judge said were “highly classified” documents in Trump’s possession. The search was part of a criminal investigation into alleged “willful retention” of classified information, theft of government records and obstruction of justice.\n\n\n\nCannon, who was nominated by Trump and confirmed by the Senate about a week after his defeat in 2020, said she plans to hold a hearing Thursday in West Palm Beach on the former president’s request for a special master. She typically convenes court in Fort Pierce, Fla., about an hour’s drive north of there.\n\n\n\nThe judge’s two-page order giving “notice of [her] preliminary intent to appoint a special master in this case” came less than a day after Trump’s attorneys late Friday made a pitch for an independent review of the materials seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate and before prosecutors filed any reply.\n\n\n\nCannon gave no indication how she viewed Trump’s claims that the search was unnecessary and extreme. Instead, she asked Trump to file a brief responding to the Justice Department’s produced list of seized materials. She also asked both sides to describe specifically the role they envision for a special master. And she asked DOJ to reveal the status of its filter review, and whether any investigators outside of the review team had seen the seized materials.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice declined to comment on the ruling.\n\n\n\nAppointments of special masters to oversee the handling of evidence seized in federal criminal investigations are unusual, but typically have occurred when prosecutors seize records from an attorney’s office. Judges in Manhattan used the mechanism in recent years in connection with investigations into two Trump attorneys: Michael Cohen and Rudy Giuliani.",

        "description": "A memorable meal from the much maligned marrow. Plus, a delicious seasonal caleShould we get rid of the marrow? I am not entirely sure what possessed me to bring it home, perhaps a fit of nostalgia for the harvest festival where the least-loved squash and its pale green and cream stripes would sit among bunches of carnival-coloured dahlias on the church’s stone windowsill. Whatever the reason, it is still in the fridge and beginning to haunt me.I am less ambivalent than most about the last of the green-fleshed summer squash. The flesh sponges up garlic, herbs and pan juices deliciously and when left to fry until golden, the edges will (eventually) caramelise sweetly enough. They are cheap – I bought mine for less than £1 – and all too often appear in the weekly late-summer vegetable delivery box. Even peeled and seeded there is a lot of flesh in a 1kg marrow. I found it likes miso, too. I will get a couple of good dinners out of mine, the first with minced pork, the second as a gratin, under a nostalgic blanket of parmesan-crusted cheese sauce.

Excitement arrived unpredictably during my 2022 Edfest: not from blasts of new work but from adaptation and revisitings.I did not skip into A Little Life, Ivo van Hove’s stage version of Hanya Yanagihara’s 2015 novel. Though its plot follows the lives of four New Yorkers, its central subject is abuse and self-abuse: it pivots on the plight of one of the men, who, violently assaulted by priests and the non-godly, cannot trust enough to be intimate – and cuts himself to take charge of his pain. Van Hove’s adaptation is four hours long and in Dutch (with surtitles). I was sceptical about the director’s idea that he was adapting not a book but “an excess”. What does that mean? Why should fiction’s remit be narrowed? Does turning a volume into an abstraction allow it to float above examination? Continue reading...",

This implies that Ukraine may still need to be provided with heavy weaponry next summer, she added.\n\n\n\n“Ukraine is defending our freedom, security architecture too and we support Ukraine financially and militarily for as long as necessary,” she was quoted as saying. \n\n\n\nThe foreign minister also defended Ukraine&#8217;s claim to the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea, which was seized by Russia in 2014. “Crimea is also part of Ukraine. The world never recognized the illegal annexation of 2014,” she said.",

The British historian and scholar Professor Hakim Adi has spent decades trying to correct what he calls the Windrush myth – the idea that Black migration to the UK began in 1948, when the famous ship landed with several hundred Jamaicans at Tilbury docks.His latest book, African and Caribbean People in Britain, is his crowning achievement; a meticulously researched tour de force that charts black presence on the British Isles from Cheddar Man through the African Roman legions and Black Tudors and into the present day. In the age of Black Lives Matter, and following books such as David Olusoga’s Black and British, the Windrush story has been under increasing strain. Adi’s work should represent the final nail in the coffin for those who think that Britain was ever truly white and should be kept that way. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The provocative work of the self-taught Ukrainian spans nearly 60 years, from Soviet oppression and glasnost to today. Now the outsider comes in for a major retrospective in Paris – and a new bookBorn in 1938, Boris Mikhailov grew up in the industrial city of Kharkov (now Kharkiv) in what was then Soviet Ukraine. “There was nothing there to influence me,” he said of his formative years as a photographer. “I found myself in a sort of zero state – a state of total openness.” Without any knowledge of photography’s history, traditions and categories, he became a self-taught artist in the truest sense, his work driven by his fertile imagination, absurdist humour and apparent disregard for accepted notions of technical excellence or formal composition.Next month, those quintessentially Mikhailovian elements will be on display at the Maison Européenne de la Photographie (MEP) in Paris, which will host an extensive retrospective of his work. Titled Ukrainian Diary, it features selected works from 27 projects made over the past 50 years. It is an interesting time to exhibit his work, not least because Mikhailov’s Ukraine is not the Ukraine currently fixed in the popular imagination – a European-style country whose progressive principles and Europeanised culture so incensed Vladimir Putin that he declared war on its citizens. (The exhibition, and an accompanying book, were planned before the invasion and both are dedicated “to Ukraine and to all who are suffering from the treacherous and incomprehensible attack on our motherland, with great sorrow and endless compassion.”) Continue reading...",

        "description": "Secluded coves, quiet villages, hilltop hideaways… Where do the French go when they holiday in France?Stretching out from Corsica’s northern coast, this 25-mile long peninsula is one of the island’s wildest regions, with stunning beaches, winding hiking trails and small ports on the eastern side, and clifftop villages on the west. Villages such as Erbalunga and Nonza feel authentic and unspoilt, with centuries’ old houses and churches and atmospheric ruins, while fishing villages like Centuri still send out daily boats to bring back spiny lobsters and fish to serve in the waterfront restaurants. Stay at Domain Misincu, a sleekly luxurious bolthole on the east coast. Doubles from £235 B&amp;B; hotel-misincu.fr Continue reading...",

People are getting back to their normal lives. But does a “normal life” mean coming back to the office? That’s up for debate. And what a debate it is.Workers at AT&amp;T say they’re being forced to return to the office early and have started a Change.org petition to make their company’s pandemic work-from-home policies permanent. Apple employees, upset with their company’s return-to-office orders, have launched a petition saying the company has risked stifling diversity and staff wellbeing by restricting their ability to work remotely.

        "description": "Underbelly Bristo Square, Edinburgh The Dave’s Edinburgh comedy awards best newcomer nominee carries a confidence and warmth that is hard to resistIn a lesser controversy at this year’s fringe, the comic Matt Forde was mocked for tweeting peevishly at audience members bringing babies to his show. He should take a leaf out of Emmanuel Sonubi’s book. There’s a baby in the front row of the north Londoner’s gig today, and Sonubi riffs with the tot relaxedly throughout – and gets big laughs for doing so. That won’t be why this former bouncer secured himself a Dave’s best newcomer nomination; one doubts the baby is a fixture. But it’s indicative of the unflustered confidence and warmth that’s winning the comic well deserved attention. You wouldn’t guess Sonubi was a newbie, in other words. There’s no eagerness to please: you meet this comic on his own terms, or not at all. But it’s hard to imagine anyone resisting. Emancipated excavates engaging tales from Sonubi’s previous life as a nightclub doorman – but also as a dad, a cruiseship entertainer, and the survivor of a recent heart scare. The bouncer material is particularly strong – because it’s fresh, in a standup context, but also because Sonubi constantly plays off his appearance (large, musclebound, archetypally scary) and his personality – a musical theatre lover who can’t fight and easily takes fright. Until Monday Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3617474-white-house-faces-legal-questions-with-student-loan-forgiveness-plan/",
        "description": "The White House has stepped into tricky legal territory with a plan to erase $10,000 in federal student loan debt for millions of borrowers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe plan is expected to face legal challenges, which would cause uncertainty for borrowers who stand to benefit from the new policy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the same time, there are also expected to be challenges for those planning to sue the administration over the plan.\n\n\n\nDemonstrating standing in the case in particular is seen as a hurdle, leading some to doubt a future challenge will be successful.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration relied on the 2003 Heroes Act enacted following the Sept. 11 terror attacks to underpin its plan. It argues that because of the COVID-19 emergency, the law gives the Education Department the authority to both suspend loan repayments through Dec. 31 and cancel loan debt for many borrowers.\n\n\n\nGroups like the centrist Democratic think tank Third Way have opposed Biden’s plan in part due to the threat of legal challenges.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’re very concerned that it is going to get held up in court and leave borrowers in limbo,” said Lanae Erickson, senior vice president for social policy, education and politics at Third Way.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere has been discussion for months about the administration’s legal authority to cancel student loan debt, as progressives increased pressure on Biden to take action. The initial expectation was that the Biden administration would use the Higher Education Act to justify executive action on student loans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden on Wednesday announced plans to cancel up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers making under $125,000 per year, and up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients. The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel released a memo outlining the legal justification.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Heroes Act was passed in 2003 with bipartisan support and gives the Education secretary the authority to waive debt obligations amid a war or national emergency. The law was passed with veterans fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan in mind, but the administration believes the coronavirus pandemic is covered by the law because it was declared a national emergency.\n\n\n\n“They very clearly narrowed their decision to this very specific national emergency hook,” said Dalié Jiménez, a law professor at University of California Irvine. “I think they did that probably to avoid a legal challenge or prevent it as much as possible.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s strategically a much better thing to do, and I think it narrows the possibility of successful challenges considerably,” Jiménez said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nErickson, however, argued that there remains a “very high likelihood” that the action will ultimately be struck down.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It is still very vague congressional language and I don’t think Congress thought when it was passing Heroes that it was giving the department the authority to wipe out student debt,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre was asked Thursday if the administration is prepared for potential legal challenges, she declined to get into what she called a hypothetical scenario.\n\n\n\nBharat Ramamurti, deputy director of the National Economic Council, said Friday that Biden did not want to move forward with loan forgiveness unless he was certain he was on firm legal footing.\n\n\n\n“Of course people can challenge actions in court, it happens all the time,” Ramamurti said. “It’s going to be up to the courts to decide whether those are valid claims or not. But we believe we’re on very strong legal ground.”\n\n\n\nThere are questions about who could demonstrate standing in a case.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s an obvious standing hurdle. It seems plausible to me that some plaintiffs could overcome it,” said Richard Re, University of Virginia law professor. “If someone can show that this measure will cost them something financially, that would probably be the strongest way to have a challenge be heard on the merits.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRe and others have suggested that loan servicers could potentially sue to stop the loan forgiveness. Erickson said that borrowers who fall just outside the income bracket for the loan forgiveness — such as those who make $126,000 per year — may also be able to sue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShould they retake control of the House of Representatives in the upcoming midterm elections, Republicans could also file a lawsuit against the student loan forgiveness plan as early as January, she said, like the suit then-House Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) filed over the Affordable Care Act in 2014.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConservative critics of Biden’s announcement acknowledge there is uncertainty over who would have standing to bring a lawsuit in this case, but they largely agreed that the policy itself is unconstitutional and contradictory.\n\n\n\nCritics pointed to comments last July from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) when she cast doubt on the president’s authority to unilaterally wipe out student loan debt.\n\n\n\n“People think that the president of the United States has the power for debt forgiveness. He does not. He can postpone, he can delay, but he does not have that power. That has to be an act of Congress,” Pelosi said.\n\n\n\nAkash Chougule, vice president of government affairs at Americans for Prosperity, argued using the Heroes Act to justify the measure is a “misreading of the executive branch’s authority,” noting that a former Obama administration counsel for the Education Department determined in a memo earlier this year that the executive branch likely does not have the power to cancel student debt.\n\n\n\nChougule also suggested the administration was hypocritical in describing the COVID-19 pandemic as an emergency that necessitated the loan forgiveness since the White House moved to lift the Title 42 immigration policy on the grounds that the pandemic was no longer an emergency that required the rapid expulsion of migrants.\n\n\n\n“The difficulty, I think, is I don’t know who has standing to sue,” said Neal McCluskey, a policy analyst at the CATO Institute. “So, the most direct harm it seems to me is on taxpayers because they’re not getting repaid and they have to cover government spending.”\n\n\n\nAlex Gangitano contributed.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Getty Images\n\n\n\nWhen the United States pulled its troops from Afghanistan in a chaotic dash, the Biden administration and its critics traded fire over whether America could keep its borders safe from terrorist threats without boots on the ground.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA year later, that debate is still raging. \n\n\n\nWhile the Biden administration has pointed to key wins from afar — in particular a Kabul drone strike earlier this month that killed longtime al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri — former and current defense officials and experts harbor doubts that the U.S. is safe from future threats with its troops gone from the region.\n\n\n\n“It means that we are going to have to be very vigilant about the potential for terrorism to raise its ugly head out of Afghanistan again,” former Defense Secretary Leon Panetta told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat isn't easy when the U.S. doesn't have a presence in a country, he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think there's a lot we don't know about what's going on in Afghanistan.” - Colin Clarke, research director at global security firm the Soufan Group.\n\n\n\nWhile the al-Zawahiri strike showed the U.S. can still hit at terrorists, the leader’s presence in Afghanistan also proved a long-held concern that the Taliban would provide safe haven for extremist organizations, as it did leading up to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd without eyes and ears on the ground, it’s difficult to discern the extent to which al Qaeda could regrow in Afghanistan and be able to conduct operations outside of the country, Clarke said.\n\n\n\nAl-Zawahiri’s Kabul location was “just further proof of what myself and most counterterrorism experts have been saying since last year — which is it's wishful thinking at best and naivete at worst to think that the Taliban and al Qaeda are going to break in any meaningful way. It's just not going to happen,” Clarke added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn this photograph taken on July 31, 2022, smoke rises from a house following a US drone strike in the Sherpur area of Kabul. President Biden later announced that Al-Qaeda chief Ayman al-Zawahiri had been killed by a drone strike in Kabul. Getty Images/AFP\n\n\n\nThe administration has been grilled in Congress for its failure to foresee the Taliban’s rapid takeover after the U.S. exit, and the bungled handling of the withdrawal of some 120,000 Afghans — during which 13 American service members and more than 170 Afghan civilians were killed in a suicide bombing at Kabul’s airport. Friday marked the one-year anniversary of the deadly attack, which also wounded at least 150 others.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast week, Republicans on the House Foreign Affairs Committee released a 121-page report that investigated the U.S. effort, blaming the Biden administration for having no solid plan in place once all U.S. troops left Afghanistan.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The choices made in the corridors of power in D.C. led to tragic yet avoidable outcomes: 13 dead service members, American lives still at great risk, increased threats to our homeland security, tarnished standing abroad for years to come, and emboldened enemies across the globe,” Republicans said in the report.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House, in turn, issued a memo brushing aside the GOP investigation, accusing it of advocating “for endless war and for sending even more American troops to Afghanistan.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe administration further argued its decision strengthened national security and did not compromise America’s ability to extinguish terrorist threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe memo pointed to U.S. intelligence assessments that found al Qaeda has not reinstated itself in Afghanistan, with “less than a dozen” operatives in the country, and only al-Zawahiri so far attempting to restart operations there.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe terrorist group “does not have a capability to launch attacks against the U.S. or its interests abroad from Afghanistan,” and “neither the few remaining [al Qaeda] core members nor its regional affiliate are plotting to attack the Homeland,” White House National Security Council spokeswoman Adrienne Watson wrote in the memo.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Dustin Carmack, the former chief of staff to ex-Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe, said that al-Zawahiri’s occupancy in Kabul appeared to highlight Washington’s dearth of intelligence capabilities now that U.S. forces are gone.\n\n\n\n“We are flying blind to a large extent,” said Carmack, now with the Heritage Foundation.\n\n\n\n“We still have a lot of capabilities, a lot of ability to go after folks but … how we left Afghanistan and just the way in which we removed any kind of contingencies of elements to be able to go execute proper [counterterrorism] strategies, it’s just an alarming failure because we’re going to be dealing with this for a long time.”\n\n\n\nAnd Clarke said it’s likely a matter of time before al Qaeda could launch an attack against the West. While it’s unlikely the group would be able to pull off anything on the scale of 9/11, there is the possibility of smaller but deadly attacks. He pointed to the al Qaeda-directed commuter train bombings in March 2004 in Madrid that killed 193 people and the July 7, 2005, London transportation bombings that killed 52 people.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These attacks against soft targets — transportation, infrastructure, things like that — I think are certainly within al Qaeda’s capability set or skill set in the next year to 18 months. And that's a significant possibility. It's a real threat,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Joe Biden speaks before signing the \"PACT Act of 2022\" during a ceremony in the East Room of the White House. Associated Press-Evan Vucci\n\n\n\nThe White House’s confidence is also not shared by some former military leaders that oversaw the region firsthand.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo former heads of U.S. Central Command (Centcom) — retired Gen. Frank McKenzie and retired Gen. Joseph Votel — have publicly argued that the U.S. is less safe now than it was a year ago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I do not believe we are safer as a result of our withdrawal from Afghanistan,” the recently retired McKenzie, head of Centcom from 2019 to 2022, told Voice of America on Monday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHis predecessor Votel, leader of Centcom from 2016 to 2019, told the outlet that there remains “a lot that we don't know about the organizations, the terrorist organizations that are left on the ground.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I don't think we’re more stable or more safe,” Votel added. “I think Afghanistan is more unstable and, as a result, that this region is more unstable.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoth McKenzie and Votel had also recommended the president keep a U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I just don't buy the idea that we had to pull everybody out,” Votel said, noting that he feared the “forever war” narrative pushed by the past two administrations “overtook smart, strategic decisionmaking.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEven with the White House pointing to its recent win with the al-Zawahri strike, the government remains wary when it comes to the region, and particularly the Taliban.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe administration last week ruled out releasing $3.5 billion held in the U.S. back to Afghanistan’s central bank, citing the al Qaeda leader’s former presence in Kabul. The al Qaeda leader was killed on the balcony of a house tied to the Taliban.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We do not have confidence that that institution has the safeguards and monitoring in place to manage assets responsibly,” Thomas West, the American government’s special representative for Afghanistan, said in a statement first reported by The Wall Street Journal.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“And needless to say, the Taliban’s sheltering of Al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri reinforces deep concerns we have regarding diversion of funds to terrorist groups.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVotel had also recommended the president keep a U.S. troop presence in Afghanistan.&nbsp;Associated Press-Evan Vucci\n\n\n\nBeyond fears over al Qaeda, concerns also remain as to the Taliban’s ability to keep at bay the Afghan branch of the Islamic State, known as ISIS-K. Before and after U.S. troops left Afghanistan, the terrorist group staged numerous bombings, assassinations and suicide attacks that the Taliban has been unable to combat.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. defense and intelligence officials have voiced fears that left unchecked, such groups, including al Qaeda and ISIS-K, may soon develop capabilities to launch attacks across borders.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShortly after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan, Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. Mark Milley in September told lawmakers that the extremist organizations could build up a capability to attack the United States in one to three year’s time.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat assessment appeared to be supported by Centcom head Gen. Michael Kurilla, who in June said U.S. intelligence confirmed that terrorist groups have begun to build training camps inside Afghanistan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCarmack, meanwhile, said Milley’s predicted timeline could likely be sped up.\n\n\n\n“I think they’re being a little almost rosy in their thoughts, because when these guys have the ability to kind of grow and just run around Kabul and start being able to communicate globally again — at least more than what they were doing maybe a few years ago — they will be seeking new targets,” he said.",

        "description": "President Joe Biden plans to establish a new ambassador-at-large position focused on the Arctic region, an area of growing geostrategic concern to the United States — as well as Russia and China.\n\n\n\nThe decision will be unveiled by the State Department on Friday, according to an announcement obtained in advance by POLITICO. The position will be subject to Senate confirmation.\n\n\n\nIt was not immediately clear who the nominee for the role will be, but a State Department official familiar with the issue predicted a name would be submitted soon.\n\n\n\nThe Arctic is of growing interest to the United States and its top rivals in part because of climate change. Though the warming of the region could have cataclysmic effects on global sea levels, the reduction in ice has opened new shipping lanes and made possible opportunities for energy extraction. With its long Arctic coastline,&nbsp;Russia is putting its mark on the region, including by expanding its military presence. China has eyes on the territory, too,&nbsp;calling itself a “near-Arctic state”&nbsp;and seeking ways to expand its access for economic and other reasons.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. at the moment has an “Arctic coordinator” position; the State Department announcement says the plan is to “elevate” the coordinator role into an ambassadorship. The decision comes amid unusually tense relations between Washington and Moscow due to Russia’s war on Ukraine, and it was made following consultations with U.S. lawmakers, among others.\n\n\n\nEarlier this summer, the Arctic portfolio was given on a temporary basis to State Department Counselor Derek Chollet.&nbsp;He told POLITICO at the time&nbsp;that, when it comes to the region, the Biden administration sees “this moment as one of strategic opportunity.”\n\n\n\nThe department announcement says the new ambassador will “engage with counterparts in Arctic and non-Arctic nations as well as Indigenous groups, and work closely with domestic stakeholders, including state, local, and tribal governments, businesses, academic institutions, non-profit organizations, other federal government agencies and Congress.”\n\n\n\nThe department also calls for a swift confirmation of whomever is nominated for the position.",

        "description": "TAIPEI, Taiwan — The U.S. Navy sailed two warships through the Taiwan Strait on Sunday, in the first such transit publicized since U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi visited Taiwan earlier in August, at a time when tensions have kept the waterway particularly busy. The USS Antietam and USS Chancellorsville are conducting a routine transit, the U.S. 7th Fleet said. The cruisers “transited through a corridor in the Strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal State,” the statement said. China conducted many military exercises in the strait as it sought to punish Taiwan after Pelosi visited the self-ruled island against Beijing’s threats. China has sent many warships sailing in the Taiwan Strait and waters surrounding Taiwan since Pelosi’s visit, as well as sending warplanes and firing long-range missiles. It views the island as part of its national territory and opposes any visits by foreign governments as recognizing Taiwan as its own state. China said it tracked the movement of the ships. “Troops of the (Eastern) Theater Command are on high alert and ready to foil any provocation at any time,” said senior Col. Shi Yi, spokesperson for the People Liberation Army’s Eastern Theater Command. The U.S. regularly sends its ships through the Taiwan Strait as part of what it calls freedom of navigation maneuvers. The 100 mile-wide strait divides Taiwan from China.",

        "description": "Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-AvonJamie Wilkes’s Parolles steals the show in Blanche McIntyre’s unromantic, social media-inflected productionAll’s Well That Ends Well is one of Shakespeare’s least performed, most puzzling plays. Doctor’s daughter Helena is hopelessly in love with Bertram, who is socially way above her. When Helena cures the King of France of a seemingly terminal illness, he grants her request: the choice of any noble youth at court for her husband. Naturally, Helena chooses Bertram. Appalled, he marries her under duress but imposes impossible terms for their physical union and then hurries abroad to war. Helena, determined to have him, follows.Director Blanche McIntyre’s patchily thought-out production is set in the present – cue flashy social media projections that introduce a made-for-secondary-school feel and serve to highlight the improbabilities of the plot (which Shakespeare partially masked by setting the action outside Elizabethan England). The romance aspect of the play is clinically dispatched: Helena (Rosie Sheehy) is brisk and determined; Bertram (Benjamin Westerby) comes across as arrogantly entitled; there is no spark between the two.All’s Well That Ends Well is at the Royal Shakespeare theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon until 8 October Continue reading...",

        "description": "FLINT, Mich. — For a decade or more, when you drove through Michigan the most ubiquitous posting was the “For Sale” sign. Cars with phone numbers written on the windows. Entire blocks of boarded up homes. Craggy industrial parks with weeds poking through the parking lot. Billboards with space for rent. Each told its own tale of someone that found — or was looking for — better options elsewhere. But this summer, as I took a post-Fourth of July trip across a state festooned with red, white and blue, a different posting dominated the roads from Lansing to Flint: “Help wanted.” A hospital outside the state capital advertised cash rewards for referring nurses. Trucking companies touted higher pay and more time at home. Auto part factories were raising wages — sometimes multiple times — and still struggled to find workers. Fast food joints had public wage duels with their rates posted next to the drive through. On the surface, those signs point to a rebirth – one that both parties in Washington are eager to spark with their newly rekindled affinity for American industrial policy. Each claim they will be the one that brings back American industrial jobs, and with it the halcyon middle-class American lifestyle they afforded. And by the numbers, it’s starting to work. In February, an opinion piece from Bloomberg named Michigan as America’s “No. 1” economy, touting a revival of manufacturing jobs as the pandemic subsided. But talk to the residents and it’s a different story. Economic anxiety is rife. Union workers are taking second and third jobs to make ends meet. Auto factories keep stopping over chip shortages, leaving workers to file for unemployment. Retirees often choose between food and medicine after receiving pension cuts. And everywhere, people express a deep frustration that the jobs on offer today don’t offer the same pay, benefits and community cohesion that they remember from Michigan’s industrial heyday. “My father came here from the South, with no education, got a job with General Motors and he was making the kind of money that, if he wanted to, he could take care of two or three families,” said Deon Evans, a 25-year veteran auto parts worker, who spoke with POLITICO in a union hall in Flint. “He could invest money, he could buy rental property … The average person today can't do that. Now having a job really doesn't seem like much. You're still struggling as if you don't have one.” Those sentiments, expressed by dozens of voters over a two-week period in July, point to a contradiction at the heart of governments’ domestic manufacturing push. While incentives from Washington and state capitols have helped to jumpstart some factories, those jobs are not filling the social expectations — in health care, retirement, education and the like — that industrial employment set decades ago. Democratic leaders here fear that if they cannot revive some of those aspects of American social life through their spending plans in Congress, they’ll lose the region to the populism of Republicans, just as in 2016. “It's not just a nostalgia for jobs of a particular kind, although it's easy to understand why people talk about it and think about it this way,” said Gabriel Winant, an assistant professor of U.S. history at the University of Chicago focused on the industrial economy. “It's for the security and way of life that arose from, and ultimately depended on, industrial growth.” Those aspects of economic security — which Winant and other scholars call “social citizenship” — formed the bedrock of American middle-class life for decades after World War II. Unions won generous pensions, health insurance plans and wages from companies, which also helped build schools, roads and city infrastructure through their tax payments. But today, in a more competitive global economy, corporations are unwilling or unable to shoulder many of those social expectations, so familiar to residents who lived through the glory days of American manufacturing. “If you talk with people who are older, they’re probably going to say that we need those GM jobs back, because that's what their parents and they grew up on,” said Phillip Thompson, pastor at Bethlehem Temple Church in Flint. “My mom retired from General Motors and they used to call it ‘generous motors,’ because you had a good job and a guaranteed pension. That's gone. It is what it is.”    Democrats, in theory, have a solution. The Biden administration’s original Build Back Better agenda was supposed to address the shortcomings of the American manufacturing renaissance by shifting the provision of many aspects of social citizenship from corporations to the state — through expanded Medicare and Medicaid, drug pricing reform, paid family leave, elder care and more. Those, combined with lucrative tax breaks for companies to build new factories in the U.S., were meant to reshape the American economy so a wider swath of workers had access to the middle-class lifestyle the old industrial economy used to afford. “This is the moment that we have an opportunity for a redo” as the economy emerges from the covid pandemic, said Todd Tucker, an industrial policy expert at the progressive Roosevelt Institute. “In a nutshell, that’s what the promise of Build Back Better — not so much the act, but the opportunity — was.” Lately, that’s looked more like an opportunity missed. As their agenda ran aground in Congress, vulnerable Democrats ran into a wall of disillusionment in their midterm campaigns this summer. Again and again, residents expressed a deep disbelief that the new jobs on offer can rebuild the industrial-era communities they’ve come to romanticize with the passing years. “We have not been in a place where we can call ourselves middle-income people, I would say, since 1999,” said Ommie Ruffin, who retired from GM in that year and has lived in the same Flint neighborhood since 1968. “Around Fint, we would like to see some of that comeback. But I doubt it will.” While Democrats were able to resurrect some of that agenda in the party-line Inflation Reduction Act that passed Congress in August, the slimmed-down bill eliminated many of the party’s social spending priorities — like the child tax credit, money for early education, child care, elder care, housing and community college — even as it approved more than $60 billion in domestic manufacturing incentives. Michigan Democrats fear that leaving those issues unaddressed will mean that the uneven economic recovery in towns like Flint and Lansing will continue, feeding the politics of resentment that will cost them their jobs and deliver working-class communities for the Republican Party. “There's a consequence” to not passing the agenda Democrats ran on, said Rep. Dan Kildee, a Flint Democrat who is in a tight reelection campaign this year. “The consequence is that the American people don't get to have a government that is a reflection of their will. And when that happens, the party in power pays a price.”  Deep in an old autoworker neighborhood in northern Flint stands The Cathedral of Life Church, housed inside an old elementary school. In fact, it’s the old elementary school of its leader, Bishop Christopher Martin, whose chambers are in an old classroom nestled in the back of the building. The sports banners have long been lowered from the modest gymnasium, replaced with giant affirmations of faith. It’s a Pentecost Sunday, and a dozen old women have donned the traditional white robes of the pentecostal faith, dancing and shaking as the power of the Lord — and the music of an impressively well-rehearsed band — moves through them.  “It’s hard to pastor today,” Martin thundered from the altar. “We don't have the glory days of the ‘80s, when GM was fruitful, Flint was bustling, the economy was large, they was handing out money in 14 GM plants. There were dealerships all up and down Clower Road, stores all over the place, Smith Bridgman downtown” — a reference to one of the nation’s oldest department stores. Affirmations rise from the audience. Everyone knows or remembers themselves, what this place used to be. Some of them, like Martin, could have even attended this elementary, back when Flint had more than ten times as many students in its school system as it does today. “No,” Martin continued, “we pastor now in a society that’s been tainted by crisis after crisis after crisis: the economic collapse of the ‘80s, the drug infestation, and the rise of gangs in the ‘90s. And this decade — amen — the 21st century has got political upheaval like never before.”    Back in his chambers, Martin gave a brief history of Flint’s industrial decline. “General Motors went from 14 plants in the ‘80s and ‘90s, if you will, to two,” he said. “And when you go from 14 plants to two, and you employed 80,000 people, and now trying to employ maybe 4,000 or 5,000, that had a huge effect on the neighborhood. We lost entire neighborhoods over decades, with General Motors pulling out.” “It really destroyed the fabric of Flint,” he continued. “We went from a city of hundreds of millions of dollars in annual budget to a city of less than $100 million annual budget, which has caused a crippling effect on just our pension system. We're struggling now just to make pension payments because of what that did.” It’s a story countless Flint and Lansing residents repeated with their own variations — and a healthy dose of romanticism — as residents recalled not just the employment, but the security and community that those jobs afforded. Kevin Owens, a deacon at the church, the band’s bass player, and a local YMCA coordinator, had a front-row seat to the decline. Calling himself a “child of the shop,” whose parents migrated up from the South to work in the Michigan auto factories, he wistfully recounted the life those jobs afforded him. “That was a blessing in and of itself, to be able to go into a plant and get you 30 years, 35 years, your watch, your pension, your health insurance for your family, your own piece of property, you may own a vehicle,” he said. “That was huge.” For Owens’ family, the “shop” meant home ownership in a neighborhood of Flint previously off-limits to Black families. It meant he could go to private catholic school as a child. But when the plants started to leave, the revocation of the social citizenship they afforded was sharp and swift. “My father pulled me into a sit down with him and he told me that there were things that he just wasn’t going to be able to do anymore because “Chevy in the Hole” — that’s what his plant was called — was one of the ones getting ready to go,” Owens said. “Whereas shop kids, we’ve seen bikes, we’ve seen savings bonds from the government, no longer was that going to be something you could have, and you had to worry about finances. So I’ve been a worrier about this city, financially, for a long time.”  Two miles south of the church, on the corner of a potholed street on the north side of Flint stands the Neighborhood Engagement Hub, a nonprofit that serves the remaining residents of the formerly middle-class enclave. The inhabited houses in this neighborhood of modest mid-century builds are tidy and well kept up, but few are renovated. And many stand empty, loose planks hanging from porches, or have been leveled, leaving overgrown lots. Across the street from the hub are two abandoned buildings with towering murals of MLK, Malcolm X, Marcus Garvey and others, painted and preserved with precision. Inside, a group of residents and community leaders assembled to talk about Flint’s economy gave knowing, sometimes pitying nods at the reporter asking them about the city’s industrial heyday. The history is well worn here, as are outside caricatures of it. Ommie Ruffin can’t wait for everyone to finish introductions. She launches into her rendition of Flint’s industrial past, the colorful scarf tied in her hair bobbing as she nods along to her story. “When we moved here, we had a beautiful neighborhood, a beautiful school just across the street with students. It was just really beautiful,” she said. “But when GM began to pull out you can see people begin to lose their homes. And if no one purchased them, they just … sat there for years and years deteriorating, and you go from a beautiful neighborhood to a neighborhood you're really scared to live in.”    Connie Edwards, a retired teacher whose parents migrated from the South to work in the plants, nodded along in agreement. Her black hair pulled back into a tight bun, exposing the gray roots, her eyes widened as she remembered her old community. “General Motors carried Flint,” she said. “We had the best education system, we had the best community recreation system. We were the model city for community and parks and swimming — everything, we had it here. But then after [the factories] started going down in the ‘70s, the schools went down, the parks went down, everything went down.” Sitting back in a white tag collar shirt and cufflinks, Pastor Phillip Thompson tried to break through the nostalgia. While the old days were good, he said, both the residents and politicians who focus primarily on the employment aspect of American manufacturing are missing the point. Because the jobs don’t cover the provision of other social services, they alone won’t bring back the middle class.  “The whole conversation about bringing manufacturing jobs back, it's really political talk. I mean, it sounds good, it’s nostalgic, and people reach for nostalgia when they don’t have anything else,” said Thompson, pastor at the Bethlehem Temple church in Flint. “But what we need are economic policies that can remove some of the barriers for people to get into the middle class. We know child care is an issue, affordable childcare. We know that housing is an issue, transportation is an issue, medical costs — all of those things right there. We can do substantive things to address them.”  Leave Michigan for long enough and the locals can tell. You drop the nasally vowels, start wearing collared shirts, even to the local bar. You’ve gone “coastie,” as my friends back home would call me, shedding the comfortable provinciality of the midwest for the customs and culture of America’s metropolitan centers. It was hard to think Rep. Elissa Slotkin wasn’t feeling a bit of a coastie when she convened a group of Lansing auto industry employees at UAW Local 724 in mid-July. The Democrat’s smooth, CIA-trained demeanor chafed against the gruffness of her cargo short-clad audience as she tried to find a silver lining to an economy that’s worn the vitality out of its participants, their eyes drooping at the corners in that familiar face of stress-induced fatigue. These are the voters Slotkin needs to turn out in November if she’s going to retain her seat in Congress against State Sen. Tom Barrett — a square-jawed, gun-toting Republican veteran who seems typecast to run against her. But the workers — granted anonymity to speak freely in the meeting — barely murmur their approval from behind their “pop” cans when she tells them there’s a “once-in-a-generation correction” in worker power allowing them to demand better wages and conditions on the job. Has that played out for them?    “Yes and no,” says one woman, her gelled hair falling in waves down her back. While wages are rising, she said they don’t seem to be outpacing increases in everyday costs. “They had to jack the wage up from $11.75 to $13.75 and now $16 because they couldn’t get anyone,” said a male employee from a parts supplier. Still, he said, they struggle to find people, and he didn’t feel much better off. Others, chastened by decades of outsourcing, worried that they would make themselves uncompetitive with non-union states and countries. “We’re going to price ourselves out,” another worker warned. At some points, resentment bubbled to the surface. Some of the people driving trucks to the auto parts plants “can’t even speak English,” one older male employee complained, pulling on his dirty knee brace in between swigs of Coke. And the new employees coming in the door? “They don’t give a damn” about the union, he said, and are happy to skip paying dues now that Michigan is a right-to-work state. That statement sparked concurring grumbles and nods from around the table. “They just don’t understand the history” of the union, a mulleted parts worker said of “these kids.” Back at her campaign headquarters, Slotkin said she was encouraged by the rising wages and the return of some factory jobs. She’s counting on Democratic support for the industrial economy to help her retain her seat against Barrett, who has voted multiple times against state-level tax breaks for new auto factories. Around town, giant red billboards tick off the number of votes he’s taken against the auto assistance — “on his way to work” at the state capitol, she pointed out.    Still, Slotkin’s political career is in jeopardy. She’s running in a redrawn district that Biden would have carried by less than a point. Leaked polling from the Barrett camp showed him ahead this summer. And Slotkin worried that even amid their industrial policy push, Democrats weren’t doing enough to address non-employment aspects of the economy. “Often, because of our housing market here, people are paying more for healthcare than they are in their mortgage,” she said. “So if you're gonna take an approach to defend and expand the middle class, you're gonna go after their biggest bills, and their biggest bills are the price of healthcare and price of prescription drugs. That to me, is one of the most universally popular things I've heard because everybody is struggling, particularly with the price of prescription drugs.” But there, Slotkin’s practiced eyes flash with frustration. While Democrats' signature Build Back Better package had policies to control drug prices and expand healthcare coverage, she complained that those focuses were lost in the “Christmas tree” that the bill became. For that, she blames the president and congressional leadership.  “I think that if you're for everything, you're for nothing, that if you don't prioritize what you really care about, and get those two or three things done that are going to make a transformational difference in people's lives, then people don't know what you're about and nothing ends up happening,” she said. “I think that's my problem is when people say, Biden cares about this issue, and I’m sure he does. I know he genuinely cares about all of these issues. But you’ve got to have your top three. And even if his top three were not exactly my top three, I just want to know what the priority is.” “When you don't have a frame, you sort of lose what you're doing, you lose your point of reference,” she said. “And I think that that is what happened in the way that Build Back Better went down.”  Even in rural areas in Michigan, voters feel a deep nostalgia for the industrial economy. On an evening canvassing run in Potterville, a small town outside Lansing, voters told Barrett that they, too, felt a desire to bring back some of the manufacturing jobs lost to decades of outsourcing. Jill Martin, who retired from the health insurance industry, said she voted for Trump in part because he promised to do just that.  “I felt like he had America-made stuff more in mind than what is being projected now,” she told Barrett from her front step. “It seems like the America First is gone, and maybe it's because I'm an old person, but this globalist — whatever it's called now — is just not something that I'm still backing. I’m still backing America first.” “It seems like the whole rest of the world, and the Democratic Party, want to see Americans lower their standard of living, so we can bring up the standard of living in other countries,” she added. “And I don't think that's the way to go about it. I don't think we should have to lose anything to enhance” our lives. Here, too, Martin’s concerns went beyond just employment and crossed into another aspect of social citizenship — healthcare. After working for decades in the insurance industry, she retired in frustration, saying the system is “just rampant with things that are wrong.”  “It paid me a good wage, but contrary to what people think it was terrible insurance, even working for an insurance company,” she said. “I had seen them just take more and more control, and all the plans and policies we would write took more and more rights away from the doctors and patients and gave the insurance companies the right to choose your care for you. That to me is just scary, and I don’t like it.” Martin said she was “totally against” Obamacare, until she retired and got coverage through the exchanges the law set up. “I am glad I had that,” she said. But she still winced at the idea of a socialized healthcare system, saying her insurance industry experience made her wary of any large entity controlling care. “The more bureaucracy that got involved, the less the person's choice got to be, and the more the insurance company got to call the shots,” she said. As we walked, Barrett acknowledged that the renewed focus on industrial policy puts him in a tough spot. But instead of tax breaks or incentives for particular industries, he said he favors a more classic Republican approach of cutting taxes and regulations in hopes that industries will be attracted by lower costs.    “I voted against this big incentive deal for General Motors to build an electric vehicle plant here in Michigan in my district, that the Democrats are beating the crap out of me over,” he said. “And I voted against it, because I don't think it's fair to take tax dollars from people in my district in my community, and pay $160,000 per job that General Motors is creating under this incentive.” “Every dollar we … put into these tax credits is a dollar that can't go into roads, can't go into schools, can't go into fixing problems, paying for police services, and all the other things that we do,” he added. “It's my belief that industries work best markets work best when the government gets out of the way. When the government gets in and micromanages these industries it ends up working worse, not only for our taxpayers, but usually for the industries being promoted.”  The idealized American class that Michiganders recalled wasn’t some natural beneficence of the industrial economy, other union workers were eager to remind. It was wrested from the same corporations that the locals lionize, often through dramatic confrontation. Such is the history of the UAW Local 659 in Flint. It was this division of the autoworkers union that first sat down on the job in late 1936, locking the bosses out of the factory until — after a bloody police confrontation and weeks of tension — GM recognized their union. It was one of the first official union recognitions following passage of the National Labor Relations Act and paved the way for the United Auto Workers union to win wages and benefits that defined the American middle class for a generation. The pride is still evident outside the hall. The sit-down strike is commemorated on the fading union local sign, which sits across the street from the factory they captured from the bosses. At another local next door, a decades-old sign sticks out of a thicket of weeds, warning drivers that foreign automobiles left there will be towed. I parked my VW out on the street.    Inside, Deon Evans’ voice is soft and smooth as he recounts the economy that his family discovered when they moved to Michigan to work in the plants. But it breaks into anger when he talks about his neighborhood today. “One thing that disgusts me, in the neighborhood that I live in, there's probably two of us on my block that have jobs and we work,” he said. “The other people, they're just home every day, they live off of state assistance, or whatever is coming to them. But it's not working a job.” The problem, he said, isn’t just the pandemic-era assistance programs, which kept many unemployed workers above water. It’s that the jobs they come back to aren’t offering a much better lifestyle than scraping by without a consistent paycheck at all. “The problem is, they look at us get up every day and go to work, and they look at the status of living, it's not really a whole lot different,” he said. “So it's not encouraging people to get up and go get a job, if they're going to be living the same way.” The two other workers at the conference table give knowing nods. Christina Dupris, another plant worker says that she’s seen many colleagues try to take on new jobs closer to home, particularly as inflation drives up gas prices and other costs faster than unions can renegotiate contracts. “For my members, a lot of them have some travel time, so they're really concerned about the gas prices,” she said. “They're looking for second jobs or looking for jobs closer to home. And unfortunately, they feel that their hands are tied. They feel that the higher-paid jobs are non-union, and then they have to make that decision to take a pay increase and lose out on benefits, because some of the non-union higher-paying jobs don't have the benefits. But it's closer to home and they've got to survive. They've got to be able to afford gas and food.” “It sounds like the middle class is getting phased out,” she added. “There's gonna be rich and poor, no middle class.” Tim Hauck, a towering, bearded union truck driver, nodded his approval. For him and his coworkers, health care is a constant challenge. “I think something needs to change with the health system. To me, that destroys my wages. I think I pay $100 a week for my family to be insured, and I think that's ridiculous,” he said. “I think as a company, we should be able to do it cheaper than that. There are other companies that are doing it cheaper than that.” “It's pretty bad when a Michigan resident can go over to Canada and buy drugs for a 10th of what they cost over here. There's something wrong with that. And if that means government regulation stepping in because Big Pharma and big corporations have no self control … maybe that is the answer,” he added. “But as soon as you start talking about that kind of shit, guess what the word socialism comes in, and everybody buttons up and runs away from it because nobody wants to live in a socialist country. I get that. But if these, you know powers that are in place, can't self regulate, maybe they need to be regulated.” More than just low wages, it’s the higher price for health care and other necessities — like child care and transportation — that makes it harder today for workers to secure a middle-class lifestyle than in the past. “When Deon was referencing when his mom and dad came up, back then the middle class, they could afford that house, they could afford that vacation,” he said. “Now, we got guys over at these plants that are making 30 bucks an hour and living check to check. So, it’s a combination of a lot of things.”    Amid the economic upheaval, these workers said they found security in their union work, which they credited with pushing up pay for workers across the economy — even if they were still struggling to meet inflation. “These unions, I think, bring the wages up,” Hauck said. “And then the rest of the companies that are-non union kind of gotta follow and suit within reason, because if they don't, they're not going to have employees. So absolutely the unions play a very important role in the economy and employees’ wages.” But they felt even that security was under threat from the slow attrition of employees from their locals — both through workers relocating and those opting out of the union in the right-to-work state. “I would like for our politicians to know, I would like for them to put some work towards getting rid of right-to-work here in the state of Michigan,” Evans said. “I think it's crap. I think it's destroying what we stand for, and we don't need that. Because we're on a rebuilding stage, trying to build this back up to what it used to be, and right to work was like a punch in the jaw, you know.” “Where else do you provide a service that you decide all you don't want? I want your service, but I don't think I want to pay for it. So I'm going to opt out of the union,” Hauck agreed. “It's just ridiculous. The whole concept is, and it was, put in place to break the union.”  Dan Kildee can’t be said to have gone coastie in his time in Washington. He’s a big guy, affable and plain-spoken, and could as easily be a shop steward from a Flint UAW local as the deputy whip for Democrats in Congress. But his demeanor is as practiced as it is practical experience. Kildee is from a political family, and his uncle, Dale Kildee, held this seat in Congress for 11 terms. “Oh, I’ll always vote for a Kildee,” a white-haired woman says when the embattled congressman rings her doorbell on a canvassing run outside Bay City. “Good family.” But Kildee, like Slotkin, cut a frustrated figure on his July campaign loop through his new district. The self-styled practical progressive — a member of both the Progressive and Problem Solvers caucuses in Congress — was as likely to highlight splits with his party as he was to pump their priorities. His ads tout his support for a gas tax holiday and funding the police, and his first stop in Saginaw, a small former auto town north of Flint, was to the city cops. At a coffee shop in downtown Bay City, a small town 50 miles north of Flint, Kildee let loose at members of his own party who he said were blocking his legislation to cap insulin prices, along with other health care provisions in the Build Back Better package. “It does make a difference what the priorities in healthcare are comprised of,” Kildee said after canvassing one day. “Not only is there a question of economics, that's a moral question to me. There are people who have died. Because they had to ration their insulin, not because it was too expensive to make. They could see the insulin vial on the other side of the pharmacy counter. And it was literally within their physical reach, but beyond their economic reach.” If Democrats can’t get some relief passed before the midterms, Kildee could still survive, coasting off his name and community familiarity. But if he loses, he said there’s “no question” that his fellow Democrats who preserved the filibuster instead of passing aggressive policy, will be to blame.  “I don't know how somebody can consider themselves to be a conservative or a moderate, when they're using the authority of government to stop the will of the people becoming policy,” he said. “That's a radical view. That's a dangerous view. And so, who's the moderate here? A person who is standing behind the Jim Crow-era tool to stop somebody from getting life-saving insulin? I don't think so.”  David Michael, like many of the UAW union members in Michigan, has more of a head for policy than politics. Throughout a tour through the newly renovated Lake Orion electric vehicle plant, he waxed on about the intricacies of union contract details and trade deals, like the one with South Korea that kept this plant going in the 2010s.  But when I asked if a man in a “Let’s go Brandon” shirt working the line was a Trump supporter. He seemed confused. “Tim’s a Trump guy, yeah. How did you – how did you make that correlation? That’s weird, because he’s hardcore Trump.” I ran through the NASCAR origin story of “Let’s go Brandon” — the more polite conservative substitute for the real message: “Fuck Joe Biden.” Michael laughed. “Oh so I’m slow on that joke,” he said. “Brandon is a school district here.” The UAW and GM both frame the Lake Orion plant as one of the nascent success stories in the American manufacturing renaissance — places where Michael said workers feel they make enough to support their families, even if the health care, retirement and child care options don’t live up to their romanticized recollections. For decades, its history has run counter to the mainstream economic currents in America. Opened under President Ronald Reagan, the plant was slated to shut in the early 2010s until a trade deal with South Korea gave it a new market for small cars, reviving the facility for a few years. Now, it’s been converted as GM’s first all-electric vehicle assembly plant, the line refitted to hoist in massive battery packs into the chassis of the Chevy Bolt EV, instead of the old transmissions of internal combustion engines. It now employs 1,200.    Inside, Michael positioned the plant and his career as a comeback story. After the financial crisis, when the UAW acquiesced to allowing lower-paid, temporary workers for bailed-out automakers, Michael took a pay cut to come back to work. Now, he says veteran plant workers make $32/hour with benefits — “absolutely” enough to support a family in the area, he said, particularly with new profit-sharing checks from GM.  “We're into profit sharing that my father never experienced, like his biggest profit-sharing checks, maybe 50 bucks, and he worked 30-some years for General Motors,” he said. “So now not only have we come out of bankruptcy, with a viable product has kept this plant running. Now we're profitable. Now these small cars are actually contributing to the bottom line. So it took a while to get there, and now you're seeing the gains coming back financially for the workers, who were able to get agreements that take us up to livable wages across the board for all the workers here.” The GM plant, to be sure, is an outlier in many ways. Employees of the auto part factories that supply Orion — like the UAW members in Flint and Lansing — make considerably less than their counterparts at GM itself. And GM pits those suppliers against each other to keep their prices and wages down. But even here, Michael said that the allure of Trump had caught on with many factory workers, — even him, for a time. “Like the first couple months of that campaign, I'm like, this guy's saying everything we want to hear,” he said. “So I was kind of riled up about it, like, this guy's talking the real deal here.” In the end, Michael said he didn’t end up supporting Trump in either election, despite voting for Republicans in the past, like George W. Bush’s reelection. But a full third of the union members at this plant did go for Trump, he said, particularly the “lower middle class white males.” (Michael is Black.) In this plant, a full third of the unionized members went for Trump, said Gerald Lang, a union vice president and team leader at the Orion plant who spoke on behalf of Biden at the 2020 Democratic National Convention. He, too, said Trump’s message to the working class resonated with him at the start, and pushed Democrats to replicate it.  “When you hear the president coming out and talking directly to working class, lower middle class Americans, I mean, that, that hits me right in the heart,” he said. “I'm sitting here saying, okay, community and neighborhoods need to be prosperous. And where does that start? It starts with jobs.”  Throughout the two-week tour through Michigan, voter testimonials and interactions with candidates took on a familiar pattern. Residents would express a nostalgia for the social citizenship of the mid-century industrial economy, often expressed in terms of health care, time off and a freedom from financial anxiety, as well as employment. The local leader or politician would agree with them in principle, and later express frustration that they can't force the government to shoulder the social burden that corporations once did. For Slotkin and Kildee, the result is a deep frustration with the leaders of their own party, who they feel are sabotaging their own reelection campaigns by not prioritizing the kitchen table issues their voters care about. For Slotkin, part of the issue is that the party in Congress is led by members from safe districts on the coasts, with Kildee being the only Midwesterner in the House leadership stack.    “There are just very few Midwesterners in leadership at all,” she said, explaining that is part of why she voted “present,” instead of for Nancy Pelosi in the 2021 Democratic leadership race. “They're just not people who look like us and have our issues in mind. It's like people from California, people from New York, like people from, you know, places that are super, super blue. So they don't see the world exactly the same way we do.” Additionally, historians like Winant say the decline of organized labor helps explain the struggle to rebuild social citizenship. Though unions were never able to spread those benefits to the entire population, like through a national healthcare system, their collective bargaining agreements with major corporations like GM set the standard for the industrial economy and middle-class life through the mid-20th century. Labor militancy also helped win workplace regulations like the eight-hour day, an end to child labor, safety standards and the like. But after the decline of organized labor, with unions now representing less than one in ten workers, unions lack the influence in Washington to win major expansions in the provision of social citizenship in the Build Back Better package. “The failure of BBB has to be understood in terms of the absence of sufficiently powerful social forces pushing for it,” Winant said. “There was (presumably) no corporate donor calling Manchin and [Arizona Sen. Kyrsten] Sinema to say, ‘listen if this doesn't pass we're going to have an even worse problem on our hands, so vote yea already; You need some version of that, much as the New Deal had.” Today, the mid-Michigan voters can’t count on a powerful labor movement to bend Washington politics to their will, even if recent organizing wins at Starbucks and Amazon point to a revival in worker militancy in America. The winnowing down of the Build Back Better package to an Inflation Reduction Act that focuses on building industrial jobs, but ignores other social expectations, is emblematic of the weakness of workers' voices in Washington, Winant says. “BBB in its larger form might've really been a New Deal-like moment,” he said, “This is closer to Obamacare, if that: an adjustment on the margin that will matter for lots of people but doesn't really change the game in a fundamental way.” Whether that materializes in the future through an upwelling of labor organizing remains to be seen. But in the meantime, residents in mid-Michigan said Democrats can focus more on the economic planks in their platform, rather than the culture wars. “The party is losing its brand to the Republican Party, because the Democratic Party emphasizes too much on the social agenda, and not the financial agenda,” said Bishop Martin of the Cathedral church in Flint. Instead of a “zeal” for abortion rights and LGBTQ protections — which he said he can’t support doctrinally — he urged the party to rekindle its focus on economics. “We're not going to physically fight it, but we can't support that [social] agenda,” he said. “What do we all agree on? It’s that hamburger is too doggone high. It’s that milk is too high.” That increasing economic insecurity presents electoral peril for Democrats, Winant said, and not just in this year’s midterms. “It's the erosion of economic security that has led to the disaffection of the white working class from progressive politics in particular, and from politics in general,” he said, “with the broader effect of destabilizing democracy.” But therein lies another contradiction for Democrats. Both Kildee and Slotkin are counting on a backlash to the Supreme Court’s abortion decision to drive Democrats to the polls this fall. At her campaign office, Slotkin gleefully noted that a petition to enshrine abortion rights in the Michigan constitution had garnered over 750,000 signatures — a record for a ballot drive in the state. That question will now appear on the November ballot.    There are deeper social issues associated with rebuilding the industrial economy as well. For all of the romanticized security of the post-war era, the provision of social citizenship was only truly open to a sliver of the American workforce — the largely white factory workers and their families. Occupations dominated by nonwhite workers and women — services, agriculture, healthcare and the like — were left out of that compact. Instead, their labor was marshaled to help provide the cushy lifestyle for factory workers, through caring for children, attending to medical needs, or producing the food industrial workers needed. Those are aspects of the economy that Kildee is adamant he does not want to revive, even as he tries to bring the manufacturing economy back. “We don't want to go back to a time when a big percentage of the population were locked out of the economy,” he said after wrapping up a visit with the Saginaw police. “But we can take from that experience is that we can build things here, we can make things here, we can do it in a way that gives people a decent job, a good life, a wage that allows them to not just support their families, but have some security in their future.” Whether Democrats can muster the political will to build that type of economy is an open question, Kildee acknowledges. But the UAW’s Lang, like many leaders here, said if they can deliver on some of those policy aims, that would drive his members to the polls. “Where are they at on lower-middle, working-class issues that affect the pocketbook, the kitchen table type issues that need to be discussed?” Lang asked. “If there was an opportunity that there was a promise that was followed through on, yeah, I mean we’d like that. But it’s just not happening.”",

        "description": "My first meeting in Roger Ailes’ boardroom of doom was on Election Day 2010. At the time, I was the network’s new political editor. Republicans were poised to deliver a serious walloping to President Barack Obama and roll back the Democrats’ doughty majorities in both houses of Congress. The GOP was in a position to score major wins in governors’ mansions and statehouses from coast to coast. The second floor of the News Corp headquarters on Sixth Avenue in New York was a hive of excited optimism. With Republicans looking forward to big wins, we knew viewership would be enormous that night. I was invited to the regular afternoon executive meeting for the first time so I could lay out the expectations we had on the Decision Desk and the politics team for what would transpire that night. I had only been with the company for about four months, and I was sweating it hard as I sat there at the far end from Ailes at a conference table roughly the size of a World War II aircraft carrier. The meeting was packed. Not only were executives from New York crowding in, but people like my boss Bill Sammon, who would have ordinarily joined the afternoon meeting by phone, were attending in person. It felt like a steam bath in there, and I was running on about two hours of sleep and too many energy drinks. I had been up all night finishing the cards that we would use on the desk and the anchors would use on-air for quick reference guides on each race. They all had to be perfect (they still weren’t), but I couldn’t make my colleagues look foolish quoting my bad data. Plus, these were the five-inch by eight-inch little life rafts that I could hold on to as I tried to run the rapids of the many, many calls we were going to have to make that night. How many Republican votes in 2004 in Ozaukee County? When did the incumbent win his first term? What did the last polls say? Didn’t her husband used to have that seat? After four straight days and nights of data obsession and rehearsals, I had to now appear to be a normal human in front of a room full of New Yorkers to whom I assume I appeared to be a sweaty bumpkin. By the way, TV networks rehearse election nights with dummy numbers. The Decision Desk makes calls based on the pretend results to simulate the workflow and pinch points of the big night. If you’re making 100 calls, the hours between 9 p.m. and 11 p.m. are bound to be chaotic. Then the election night team uses the practice calls to test the graphics, lighting, anchor and guest positions, and communications. After six cycles of working with that crew at Fox, we really learned how to make it hum by the end of my time at the network. But in 2010, I was clueless.    So there I was, exhausted, tweaking on taurine and looking around the room at people who had been with the company from the beginning. I was feeling very self-conscious. There was even one guy who dyed the temples of his hair white like Paulie Walnuts from The Sopranos. The smell of aftershave and coffee was making me queasy. But I was the only one feeling that way. The mood was jocular, and Ailes was having fun doing what he liked best in the world: busting balls. The language of Fox News in those days was definitely locker-room swagger. Men and women alike tried to match Ailes’s tough-guy energy. His top lieutenant, Bill Shine, carried it off perfectly. He grew up on Long Island, the son of a police officer. Shine didn’t talk too much, but he made the words count. And like Ailes, he never missed a chance to crack on someone, usually in an avuncular way. Razzing people over their teams, their neighborhoods or whatever was at hand was the language of belonging on Ailes’s crew. Bill O’Reilly was the avatar for these folks: suburban New York, Roman Catholic, traditional values but not necessarily socially conservative — the New York Post, not the New York Times. I was definitely out of place. I had never been to New York as an adult until I started going up for Fox. I knew about as much about the TV business as a horse knows about making a saddle. It’s possible I was wearing a bow tie. As the execs went around the table offering the boss their updates, I rehearsed my lines in my head. Sammon teed me up, and I started racing through time zones and expected times for calls and generic ballot trends until Ailes interrupted to say, “What’s your number?” The number, of course, was how many seats I forecast Republicans to win that night. “Our best guess is 64 seats, sir.” Ailes, mouth set like a bulldog and eyes staring through the back of my head, said, “Dick Morris says it could be one hundred. Why is yours so low?” I figured Ailes, a smart man, knew that Morris, a network contributor at the time, was a joke. Morris had not yet reached the comic heights in his pronouncements that he would in 2012 and beyond, but the former Clinton advisor turned Republican Pollyanna was already pretty clearly making stuff up. In 1874, after Republicans lost the whole South at the end of Reconstruction and during a financial panic and with a scandal-plagued GOP administration in the White House, they lost 96 seats. Obamacare was unpopular and all, but there just weren’t enough competitive seats on the post-1994 map to make such a number possible. Morris said goofy stuff like that, I assumed, because it got him on TV. Sean Hannity in particular would bring Morris on to say that the red wave was a Krakatoa-sized tsunami that would change politics forever. They, and some other analysts who I previously thought were more principled and smarter than Morris, used the same routine for the 2012 presidential election. That time they made preposterous claims not only that Mitt Romney was obviously going to win, but that it would be by a landslide. The best I could say for Romney in that cycle was that he had a path to a narrow victory by picking off a couple of Blue Wall states if he could turn things around in Ohio, where he had been sucking wind all summer. But a landslide? Pish posh. That 100-seat number in 2010 was just hype to juice ratings, and Ailes had to know that. Right? He was messing with the new guy. Right? But I wasn’t sure. I didn’t say what I thought: Morris is feasting on the carcass of journalism like a lamprey eel on a dead nurse shark. But maybe Ailes believed the hype. I instead carefully explained how I had worked with the all-stars in our then-great Brainroom to check every seat and every estimate to make sure we were on the money. Ailes left me with “You’d better hope you’re right ...” and I walked out in the herd of suits in a haze. I had just disputed the maximum leader of Fox News and talked down Republican chances in a room full of people flying high on the thought of a ratings bonanza. I would eventually learn to say what I was thinking, lampreys and all. It served you better with Ailes, who in those days appreciated honest disagreement on his team. It was partly his scorpions-in-a-bottle management style, but also that he genuinely seemed to think it was better to air out disagreements. Bust balls or be busted. I sat on those House races like a mother hen all night until we were able to make the call for the 64th net pickup for Republicans sometime in the wee small hours. We hit the number right on the screws, and I had delivered on my called shot in the boardroom. I rode adrenaline through a day and a night of on-air hits and then slept the whole way home on the train. The lesson I learned was that Hannity, Morris and the rest of the crew of the crimson tide were certainly engaging in wishful thinking, but certainly also motivated reasoning. The story they were telling was good for ratings or the frequency of their appearances. They wanted it to be true because they wanted Republicans to win, but keeping viewers keyed up about the epochal victory close at hand was an appealing incentive to exaggerate the GOP chances. It was good for them to raise expectations, but it wasn’t good for the party they were rooting for. Early in an election cycle, crafty partisans want to play up their side’s chances. It helps their candidate recruitment and fundraising and may lead vulnerable incumbents on the other side to just go ahead and retire. But at the end of a cycle, the preferred message whenever possible should be that the race is tight-tight-tight — every vote could be the winning vote, so don’t forget to cast your ballot. Ask Hillary Clinton how overconfidence can depress turnout as marginal voters opt to stay home. It occurred to me in 2010 and was confirmed to me in 2012 that despite all that Fox’s detractors said about the network being a mouthpiece for the Republican Party, the two organizations had fundamentally different aims. Good politics is often bad TV. As much as we rightly lament the decline of the American electorate’s aspirations and expectations, at least a plurality of voters still clearly prefer competency, cooperation and decency. And what could be more boring than that? As a journalist, I believe that what is wrong with my vocation and the industry in which I work is harming Americans left, right and center. Major players in the news business are abusing their privileges and shirking their duties, and we all pay the price. The agenda at many outlets is to move away from even aspirational fairness and balance and toward shared anger and the powerful emotional connections it can create. Unable to sell large, diverse audiences to advertisers, news outlets increasingly focus on developing highly habituated users. To cultivate the kind of intense readers, viewers or listeners necessary to make the addiction model profitable, media companies need consumers to have strong feelings. Fear, resentment and anger work wonders. It helps news outlets create deep emotional connections to users not just as users of a product, but as members of the same tribe. Reporters increasingly disdain the old virtues of fairness and balance as “bothsidesism,” reimagining the ancient vice of bias as something honorable. Opinion pages become more homogeneous. Story selections become more predictable. Most ominously, post-journalism produces stifling groupthink inside news organizations and serious consequences for journalists who dissent. What we think of as “bad news” can score like gangbusters if it is scary and anger-inducing. But news that is bad for your audience’s ideological in-groups is clickbait kryptonite. In such a competitive marketplace, riling people up against the other side isn’t enough. You’ve also got to create a safe space for consumers to plop down and contentedly contemplate ads for beet-based nutrient powders, reverse mortgages and copper underpants. If you challenge their assumptions or suggest that their avatars in the culture war are wrong or losing, they may leave for competitors who offer more complete protection from harsh realities.  Despite a successful decade as politics editor at the Fox News Channel, I got canned after very vocal and very online viewers — including the then-president of the United States — became furious when our Decision Desk was the first to project that Joe Biden would win the former GOP stronghold of Arizona in 2020. (A FOX News spokesperson at the time said the layoff was a part of post-election restructuring, but would not comment specifically on Stirewalt’s role, citing employee confidentiality.) The call was the handwriting on the wall for Trump’s chances, and it delighted Democrats almost as much as it infuriated MAGA land. Regardless of who won, we were proud to have beaten the competition yet again and defended the title network promos had given us as “the best-in-class Decision Desk.” But even in the four years since the previous presidential election, Fox viewers had become even more accustomed to flattery and less willing to hear news that challenged their expectations. Me serving up green beans to viewers who had been spoon-fed ice cream sundaes for years came as a terrible shock to their systems. When I went on-air in 2020 to defend the Decision Desk’s call that Joe Biden would win Arizona, I was supremely confident. The Decision Desk team that director Arnon Mishkin had built was the best in the business. And we had better survey data than the competition, thanks to our partnership with the Associated Press and the National Opinion Research Center.    The irony for Fox was that the call that so infuriated Trump and so many viewers was possible only because Rupert Murdoch had four years earlier yanked Fox out of the consortium of other networks paying for exit polls. He sure wasn’t wrong. The exit polls were bad and getting worse. So Arnon &amp; Company built a better mousetrap, and that was even before we found out that the coronavirus pandemic would increase the share of mail-in ballots by as much as 50 percent. You can’t do an exit poll if nobody is exiting the polls, so while our competitors were scrambling to put together a system to accommodate the change, we had already tested our superior product in the 2018 midterms. It turned out to be a capability that the network would regret developing. Amid the geyser of anger in the wake of the Arizona call, Senator Kevin Cramer, Republican of North Dakota, called for my firing and accused me of a “cover-up.” Covering up what, exactly? We didn’t have any ballots to count and we didn’t have any electoral votes to award. We were just some guys with a cool computer, lots of polling data, and a lot of nicotine gum and coffee. But if you’ve been living comfortably in the climate-controlled emotions of post-journalism, when the real thing comes along, it’s a shock to the system. There are lots of books and articles that talk about how the news media is hurting select groups: Republicans or Democrats or populists or minority groups or the family or whatever suits you. But that kind of blame-casting just alienates us further, replicating the core defect of the news media that critics are attacking. There is no trophy for being more harmed by our lazy, alienating press. We’re all losers in this one.

But not many would have predicted that The Lark Ascending would be included in a concert given by the Finnish Radio Symphony Orchestra, with its principal conductor Nicholas Collon, or that a Finnish violinist, Pekka Kuusisto, would be the soloist.It had also seemed unlikely in advance that Kuusisto’s performance of the Vaughan Williams would be the highlight of what otherwise turned out to be a disappointing concert. His rather withdrawn, intimate approach, almost an improvisation spun on the slenderest thread of sound, made it seem less rural idyll than elegy, an exercise in nostalgia written at a time when the way of life and the world it hymned was about to disappear in the maelstrom of world war.Available on BBC Sounds until 10 October.

        "description": "Cyber crooks steal medical information of tens of millions of people in the U.S. every year, a number that is rising fast as health care undergoes its digital transformation. It leads to millions of dollars in losses for hospitals, insurers and other health care organizations, threatens care delivery and exposes patients to identity theft. But the Department of Health and Human Services' Office for Civil Rights, which is tasked with investigating breaches, helping health care organizations bolster their defenses, and fining them for lax security, is poorly positioned to help. That’s because it has a dual mission — both to enforce the federal health privacy law known as HIPAA and to help the organizations protect themselves — and Congress has given it few resources to do the job. “They're a fish out of water … They were given the role of enforcement under HIPAA but weren't given the resources to support that role,” said Mac McMillan, CEO of CynergisTek, a Texas firm that helps health care organizations improve their cybersecurity. Due to its shoestring budget, the Office for Civil Rights has fewer investigators than many local police departments, and its investigators have to deal with more than a hundred cases at a time. The office had a budget of $38 million in 2022 — the cost of about 20 MRI machines that can cost $1 million to $3 million a pop. Another problem is that the office relies on the cooperation of the victims, the institutions that hackers have targeted, to provide evidence of the crimes. Those victims may sometimes be reluctant to report breaches, since HHS could then accuse them of violating HIPAA and levy fines that come on top of costs stemming from the breach and the ransoms often demanded by the hackers. Depending on the circumstances, it can seem like blaming the victim, especially since the hackers are sometimes funded or directed by foreign governments. And it’s raised questions about whether the U.S. government should be doing more to protect health organizations. In an Aug. 11 letter to HHS Secretary Xavier Becerra, Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) and Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.), past co-chairs of a cybersecurity commission that examined the danger, raised that point, questioning the government’s “lack of robust and timely sharing of actionable threat information with industry partners.” ‘A stronger hammer’ The scope of the threat is massive and the consequences of breaches severe. According to a 2021 survey by the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society, more than two-thirds of health care organizations had a “significant” incident in the previous year — mostly phishing or ransomware attacks. These episodes pose potentially significant financial consequences and can threaten patients’ lives. A recent report from cybersecurity company Cynerio and the Ponemon Institute, a cybersecurity research center, found that about 1 in 4 cyberattacks resulted in increased mortality by delaying care. Experts said the health care sector is particularly vulnerable to attacks, partly due to its digital transformation and partly due to its vulnerability to ransomware. Disrupting care could endanger patients' lives, which can leave health care organizations feeling forced to fork over ransoms. In 2021 alone, hackers accessed records of nearly 50 million people, raising privacy concerns and leaving many vulnerable to fraud.    The HHS office expects to see 53,000 cases in the 2022 fiscal year. As of 2020, it had 77 investigators, some of whom are assigned to other things, like civil rights violations. The Biden administration official who runs the Office for Civil Rights, Melanie Fontes Rainer, said her investigators have to pick their battles because they are “under incredible resource constraints and incredibly overworked.” She frames the problem as one of funding and the Biden administration has asked Congress to give the agency a roughly 58 percent budget increase in fiscal 2023, to $60 million, that would allow it to hire 37 new investigators. But advocates for victims want to be sure those new hires would favor helping them prevent future attacks over penalizing them for failing to stop past ones. “If OCR is looking for money that will protect hospitals … good. That’s HHS’ role — not just to penalize the victim,” said Greg Garcia, executive director of the Healthcare and Public Health Sector Coordinating Council, which represents a number of sectors within health care targeted by the hackers. For the most part, that’s what the office does, but fines are always a possibility and Fontes Rainer said more resources will yield more enforcement that will encourage health care organizations to meet their obligations under HIPAA. Tim Noonan, a high-ranking official under Fontes Rainer, also expects it will bolster the agency’s ability to offer guidance and technical assistance. A budget increase “will give us a stronger hammer,” Fontes Rainer said. “Enforcement … stops the conduct, but is also a deterrent for others.” In July, HHS levied its first major fine on breaches since President Joe Biden took office, $875,000 on Oklahoma State University’s Center for Health Services. Agency investigators found that the center may not have reported a breach in a timely manner and that it also had failed to take steps to protect data. And Fontes Rainer is pressing to increase fines following a legal setback at the end of the Trump administration. In January 2021, the 5th Circuit Appeals Court struck down a $4.3 million penalty that the Office for Civil Rights had assessed the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center over data breaches. The court called it “arbitrary” and “capricious,” giving ammunition to critics of the office’s enforcement efforts. The Trump administration levied more than $50 million in fines related to breaches over four years. But the director of the Office for Civil Rights at the time, Roger Severino, also moved to reduce fines for entities that weren’t found in “willful neglect” of the privacy law or had taken corrective action, saying the office had misinterpreted the law. ‘A cop on the side of the road’ If HHS were to further back off from enforcement, it could prompt more negligence, some experts said. More than half of the health care industry is “woefully underprepared” to protect against cyber threats, said Carter Groome, CEO of First Health Advisory, a health care risk management consulting firm. At organizations with few resources, that lack of preparedness is understandable. But it’s not at large health systems. “We know of a CIO in a small rural facility … he’s also in charge of … everything from snow shoveling to making sure the air conditioning is working,” said Tom Leary, head of government relations at the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society. “But if they’re well-resourced and they’re not meeting their responsibilities, [enforcement] absolutely needs to be a part of the process.” Leary’s group has found that cybersecurity budgets are often meager. Stepped-up enforcement could prompt health care organizations to increase them.  Others are more skeptical. “HHS enforcement is like ninth on the list of reasons to have a good security program,” Kirk Nahra, a privacy attorney at law firm WilmerHale said, adding that aggressive enforcement could hamper data sharing that the government is otherwise trying to encourage. “Why would I open up access to you ... if there’s a risk it could go wrong and I could get hammered.” There are other ways government could help health care organizations improve their cybersecurity. Advocates for industry point to two key areas: cash for better defense systems and funding for workforce development. John Riggi, the national adviser for cybersecurity and risk at the American Hospital Association, has called for federal support in training workers and grants to help organizations boost their security efforts. And in testimony to Congress, Erik Decker, chief information security officer at hospital chain Intermountain Healthcare, called for the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services to look into developing payment models to “directly fund” cyber programs. In contrast to King and Gallagher, many in the industry said they are encouraged by progress on information sharing. HHS' Health Sector Cybersecurity Coordination Center has helped, they said, and the public-private 405(d) Program and Task Group has received high marks for its work to develop guidelines to help health care organizations defend themselves. Congress called for the collaboration in section 405(d) of a 2015 law. Still, King and Gallagher in their letter to Becerra said they worried the information sharing was not robust enough, given the growth in cyberattacks. They called for an urgent briefing from HHS and suggested they’d be willing to propose funding and laws extending the agency new powers to take on the hackers.",

        "description": "NASA, after watching space billionaires capture the world's attention, is looking to take some of the glory back. As early as Thursday, the most powerful rocket the space agency has ever built will sling an uncrewed space capsule on a record 42-day journey around the moon and back. The maiden launch of the Space Launch System rocket and the Orion space capsule, designated the Artemis I mission, is a make-or-break trial for NASA’s goal of building a permanent presence on the lunar surface. The stakes are high: On the next mission, astronauts will be aboard. It’s also NASA's chance to show the world that it’s not just billionaire privateers who are charting the new space age and fueling public fascination with the prospect of exploring other worlds. “The public still has great affection for NASA. There is not a better brand, certainly in government,” said Lori Garver, former deputy NASA administrator. She cited the awe and excitement over the first images captured by the James Webb Space Telescope. “But the human spaceflight program is a little different,” she said, speaking ahead of what was supposed to be the launch on Monday, which was scrubbed due to technical issues. The next launch window is this Thursday. “SLS, human spaceflight, new astronaut class? Twitter likes are in the single-digit thousands. I don’t think in any world will Monday’s launch be on the order of the space telescope, yet we spent multiples of the amount.” The James Webb telescope cost roughly $10 billion; the bill for the Artemis program is expected to be $90 billion by 2025, according to the NASA Inspector General. The uncrewed mission will be the first and only rigorous test of the rocket and the space capsule before it takes astronauts around the moon in 2024 and then helps deliver them to the surface in 2025 to begin building a research station. Much of the attention is on the SLS, the mega-rocket built by Boeing, Northrop Grumman, Aerojet Rocketdyne and other major aerospace contractors but is years behind schedule and billions over cost. The Lockheed Martin-built Orion capsule, intended to carry four astronauts for 21 days, will travel twice as long as designed. And a crucial test will be of its novel heat shield when the capsule reenters the Earth’s atmosphere at a record 25,000 miles per hour. Less high-profile attention has been paid to the network of specialized ground systems, including the massive structure that serves as the mobile launcher to deliver the rocket and capsule to the launch pad and has also experienced serious development problems and cost overruns. It means more disparate and highly complex systems than NASA has been relying on in recent years. “We are a hardware-rich program,” James Free, associate NASA administrator for the Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate, told reporters on Friday. “That does not happen in NASA all that often.” The mission, therefore, requires a series of historic engineering feats on a scale that NASA has not attempted since the Space Shuttle program in the 1980s. “Artemis I is that first step down this path, when we talk about sustained exploration on the lunar surface and getting on to Mars,” Free said. “We are exercising the systems [on Artemis I] to a great extent to make sure that when we put crew on [Artemis] II the vehicle is ready to go.” There is little room for error — technically or politically. “The first mission of an untried vehicle is an ambitious and complex one,” said Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University and former executive secretary of the White House National Space Council. “Congressional support could certainly erode if it doesn’t work,” added Greg Autry, a former NASA adviser and professor of space policy at the Thunderbird School of Global Management at Arizona State University. A major knock on the SLS rocket, which has been nearly two decades in the making, is that it is based heavily on older designs. For example, it is expendable, which means the rocket is discarded after placing Orion in orbit. A new generation of commercial space companies such as Elon Musk’s SpaceX and Jeff Bezos’ Blue Origin, meanwhile, is steadily perfecting reusable and lower-cost alternatives for venturing into deep space. SpaceX demonstrated in 2015 the first reusable space rockets that return to Earth and in 2020 delivered American astronauts from U.S. soil to the International Space Station aboard its commercial Dragon crew capsule. It is now testing the potentially game-changing Starship, a reusable, all-in-one spaceship designed to lift off from Earth and carry astronauts directly to the surface of the moon — or Mars — and back. NASA already plans to transfer its astronauts to the Starship in the moon’s orbit on the first mission to reach the lunar surface in 2025. The other issue dogging the program is its cost. SLS is considered hugely expensive — perhaps too expensive to be used for regular missions to the moon or eventually Mars — with an estimated price tag of up to $4 billion per launch, according to the NASA Inspector General. “We understand that this program needs to be sustained. And we’re going to do our part to reduce costs,” Doug Hurley, senior director of business development at Northrop Grumman, said Friday when asked about the high operating costs at a NASA press conference. But many predict pressure is only going to grow on NASA to seek alternatives as the moon program matures. “I can’t imagine that they are going to fly a bird with the cost associated with the SLS as the key transportation system for the moon for the next 20 or 30 years,” said Robert Walker, former chair of the House Space Committee and now a space industry consultant. He predicted that SpaceX will soon “prove the competency of the Starship and at some point Bezos is going to arrive on the scene here and have some alternative technology as well. “If you look out even three or four years,” he added, “the options for NASA are likely to be pretty robust.” “Let’s face it. If Starship is successful and operational, it will call into question SLS and Orion,” Garver said. Another challenge for NASA is capturing the public imagination — and fueling a new generation of scientists and engineers — by landing the first woman and person of color on the moon. NASA Administrator Bill Nelson said the goal is no less than to replicate the impact of the Apollo missions to the moon in the 1960s and 1970s. “STEM-trained workers swelled in the years during and following the height of Apollo and unlocked untapped human potential — the modern computing age, the multi-billion-dollar satellite industry, and so much more,” he told POLITICO. “Now, it’s the Artemis generation. “There’s nothing better than seeing a little kid’s eyes light up, seeing that spark go off,” he added. “NASA shows them that if they can dream it, they can be it. Artemis I is just the beginning to a new era in spaceflight.” Not everyone is so sure. “I think more people know what Elon Musk is doing than what NASA is doing,” Autry said. “I feel there should be more general excitement. The space community of course is revved up. I’d like to have seen the White House talking about it more.” On hand for the launch at Florida’s Kennedy Space Center will be Vice President Kamala Harris, who chairs the National Space Council, and a who’s who of current and former NASA leaders and astronauts. She is expected to “speak about the United States’ leadership in space exploration and thank the NASA workforce, private sector partners, and international partners for their work,” the White House said in a statement on Friday. To stoke public excitement, NASA has also enlisted some star power, including actors and musicians such as Jack Black, Chris Evans, Keke Palmer, Josh Groban and Herbie Hancock, along with the Philadelphia Orchestra and cellist Yo-Yo Ma. The world will also be watching, including competitors Russia and China that are also pursuing human space exploration. Indeed, many see success as having significant implications for geopolitics. Zhanna Malekos Smith, a senior associate at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, predicts that a successful mission will boost the Artemis Accords, the international partnership of 20 nations that lays out a shared vision of principles for the exploration of the moon. Artemis I, she said, will be “symbolic triumph for the global Artemis community‘s dedication to a safe and peaceful future for all humanity.” For some veterans of the space program, however, the stakes are much bigger. “Space dominance — and specifically the exploration and eventual settlement of the moon — play a great psychological role in forming the attitudes of people who ultimately will choose between tyranny and freedom,” Apollo 17 astronaut Harrison Schmitt wrote in an op-ed this week.

        "description": "(Warner)Amid an OTT blizzard of musical styles, the English rockers meet doom head on, from the climate crisis to Liz TrussMuse’s Matt Bellamy has been writing songs about a dystopian near-future for years, so it seemed strange when, well into the age of Trump and Brexit, he reined in his lyrical excesses for 2018’s Simulation Theory. He has rediscovered his paranoid mojo for the band’s ninth album – and how… Will of the People confronts variously the rise of populism and dictatorships (the title track), wildfires, earthquakes, Covid and, well, everything (We Are Fucking Fucked, presciently written before Liz Truss declared her candidacy for the Tory party leadership). Muse’s angst isn’t confined to state-of-the-world addresses either: the personal misery of an abusive relationship is dissected on You Make Me Feel Like It’s Halloween. One way or another, a sense of dread permeates almost every song.Unfortunately, the message is diluted by the inevitably OTT hysteria of the delivery, the trio’s arrangements frequently overwhelming Bellamy’s words in a blizzard of musical gymnastics. There are echoes of Queen at their most overblown throughout, most notably on Liberation, along with the band’s usual cross-pollination of genres – metal on Kill or Be Killed; danceable synthpop on Compliance; U2-like stadium rock on Verona; stomping glam on the title track – with bombast the sole constant. It’s all consistently inventive rather than dull, but also endearingly daft rather than chilling. Still, that makes for Muse’s most enjoyable album since the 00s. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The U.S. Navy sailed two warships through the Taiwan Strait on Sunday, marking the first transit since Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s (D-Calif.) visit to Taiwan earlier this month. \n\n\n\nThe U.S. 7th Fleet said that the USS Antietam and USS Chancellorsville conducted a \"routine\" transit.\n\n\n\n“These ships transited through a corridor in the Strait that is beyond the territorial sea of any coastal State,” officials said, adding that the movement of the guided-missile cruisers shows that the U.S. is committed “to a free and open Indo-Pacific.” \n\n\n\n“The [ships'] transit through the Taiwan Strait demonstrates the United States' commitment to a free and open Indo-Pacific,” officials said. “The United States military flies, sails, and operates anywhere international law allows.”\n\n\n\nPelosi’s trip to Taiwan marked the first time a high-ranking U.S. official visited the country in 25 years. \n\n\n\nHer visit angered Chinese officials, who warned the Speaker against making the trip.\n\n\n\nBeijing, which views Taiwan as part of China's territory, has stepped up its military and domestic pressure against Taiwan in recent months. \n\n\n\nIn its own statement, the Chinese military’s Eastern Theater Command said it would monitor the two U.S. warships, adding that it would be “ready to thwart any ​​provocation,” according to CNN.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3617000-black-americans-feel-disproportionate-pain-from-high-interest-rates/",
        "description": "The federal government's efforts to stanch inflation are disproportionately impacting Black Americans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Federal Reserve has hiked interest rates in the hopes of cooling off a red-hot economy, but its actions are hitting Black Americans — who have historically been squeezed out of home ownership and affordable loans — the hardest.\n\n\n\nFed interest rate hikes are meant to slow consumer and business spending by making debt more expensive, including mortgages. Mortgage rates rise as the Fed hikes its baseline interest rate higher, making monthly home payments more expensive for anyone seeking a new home or those who purchased one with an adjustable interest rate loan.\n\n\n\n“African Americans have the lowest homeownership rates among the four major racial groups in the country,” Romie Tribble, professor of economics at Spelman College and secretary of the National Economic Association, told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJust 45.3 percent of Black households owned their homes during the second quarter of 2022, according to the Census Bureau, compared to 74.6 percent of white households, 61.1 percent of Asian households and 48.3 percent of Hispanic households.\n\n\n\n“It's now going to be more difficult for them to acquire and to also keep a home,” Tribble said.\n\n\n\nBlack Americans have long faced higher barriers to homeownership than their white counterparts, which is one of several forces behind a steep racial wealth gap.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring the post-World War II economic boom, racist lending practices&nbsp;and bans on home sales to non-white families locked millions of minority families out of the housing market.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Congress passed laws intended to halt discriminatory&nbsp;lending practices during the 1970s, discrimination in the housing market still persists. And the racial wealth gap created in part by housing discrimination has left Black families with fewer resources to help achieve homeownership.\n\n\n\nFor many Black homeowners, interest rates are already often higher than their white counterparts regardless of income, according to a 2021 Harvard University study. This is, in part, because Black homeowners are seen as a bigger financial risk than white homeowners.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCombined with the short supply of housing around the country, Tribble said, these concerns all exacerbate housing inequities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile higher interest rates are likely to take a steeper toll on Black Americans, the decades of near-zero rates meant to help low and middle-income households shore up their finances were not as helpful for them, experts say.\n\n\n\nThe Fed slashed its baseline interest rate range to near-zero levels in the wake of 2007-08 financial crisis to help keep money flowing through the economy. The central bank held rates near zero until 2015 and only hiked them gradually in the years that followed.\n\n\n\nUltra-low Fed interest rates in the wake of both the Great Recession and the COVID-19 recession helped fuel record-breaking home prices as households with means to keep up enjoyed low mortgage&nbsp;rates. Homeowners were also able to refinance their mortgages at lower rates, giving them more money to save up for the next home purchase.\n\n\n\nBut those super low rates did little to help Black Americans without homes and others on the margins of the housing market, all while pushing home prices even higher.\n\n\n\n“The Fed through that period argued that ultra-low interest rates supported household wealth by virtue of allowing people with homes to reduce their cost of housing with refinancing and therefore improve their wealth position. But that turned out not to be anywhere near as true for low and moderate income people, particularly minorities,” said Karen Shaw Petrou, author of “Engine of Inequality: The Fed and the Future of Wealth in America.”\n\n\n\n“We've now had 22 years … of policies that make it harder for lower and moderate income households, especially those of color, to be homeowners. “\n\n\n\nBut even for those who don’t have mortgage payments, high interest rates have led to the continued practice of banks offering predatory credit lines for Black Americans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany African Americans don’t participate in the stock market, said Sharif Muhammad, CEO of Unlimited Financial Group Inc. and board member of the Association of African American Financial Advisor, meaning whatever cash they do have doesn’t have high growth prospects during a normal rate of inflation.\n\n\n\n“But now when we're in this hyperinflationary environment, purchase power is even more profound,” said Muhammad.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut a lack of financial literacy leads to consumers spending more — and buying on credit more, too.\n\n\n\nThe problem is, Muhammad said, banks are capitalizing on that lack of knowledge by providing credit to unsuspecting African American communities who then “use it as an extension of their purchase power rather than seeing it as an actual borrowing of money.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd when the interest rates hit, Muhammad said, it becomes a “double whammy.”\n\n\n\n“Your money is not growing because you’re keeping it in a savings account or cash and not properly investing it,” he explained, “and then you're out there spending money using credit cards that are growing at almost usury level rates and compounding on a daily basis.”\n\n\n\nThe impact of these high interest rates seep outside the home, too, and into businesses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor many small business owners, the pandemic deeply affected their ability to stay afloat, and Black-owned businesses suffered the most.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow, even as the country moves into post-pandemic times, the struggle to recover persists.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn average, Black-owned businesses already pay 1.4 percent more&nbsp;in interest than white-owned businesses, according to the U.S. Department of Commerce’s Minority Business Development Agency.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith interest rate increases, the cost of borrowing goes up as well. Most of these small businesses operate with “working capital,” or capital accessible to banks, said Tribble.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“For a small restaurant, rising interest rates in working capital means either ‘I'm going to have to cut back on employees or I'm going have to cut back on the hours that I'm open,’” said Tribble.\n\n\n\nWhich in turn exacerbates racial disparities in unemployment.\n\n\n\nBlack Americans face higher unemployment than whites at every level of education, according to the Associated Press. And despite the seemingly good job market, Muhammad points out the jobs numbers are a “lagging indicator” that won't accurately reflect job retention until the next month.\n\n\n\nStill, Tribble advises Black Americans to try to hold on to their jobs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I know that prices are really difficult,” he said. “I know that people in the low income category are having to make hard choices. The limited money and limited funds that we have, we've just got to use them more efficiently than ever before.”\n\n\n\nMuhammad also had advice: “get aggressive” paying down debt. He also added that now could be a good time to take advantage of investment opportunities and meeting with experts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor those who may be bracing for a potential layoff, he said, this will allow them to ensure they have a “rainy-day war chest.”\n\n\n\n“Sit down with an advisor to really look at your tax situation and see if there’s anything in the provisions for the new tax laws that you’re not currently taking advantage of,” he advised.&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://www.franchisewire.com/why-the-hustle-culture-is-losing-its-appeal-in-corporate-america/",
        "description": "Frustrated with “Working for the Man,” Americans are Taking a New Direction With Franchise Business Ownership   \n\n\n\nDuring vacation this summer, my family and I stopped at a designated tourist spot noted for blowholes. When we arrived, I was drawn not to the blowholes but to cairns that were seemingly everywhere. According to yourdictionary.com, cairns (pronounced /kerns/) is a pile of stones heaped up as a landmark to guide travelers. When I began my second business venture two years ago, I used two images for my branding. A compass and cairns to complement the slogan, “leading you in a new direction.” \n\n\n\nStarting a business in the height of a pandemic is no easy feat, but I could feel that there was a reset within myself and all around me, and sure enough, the Great Resignation took place, and now Quiet Quitting is trending. People don’t want to work 60-70 hours a week for someone else. The Hustle Culture is dying — at least when it comes to working for someone else.  \n\n\n\nThe Great Resignation led nearly 43 million people to leave their jobs in 2021. The pandemic lit a fire under something brewing in corporate America and accelerated it. The mantra that the younger generation is supposed to do better than their parents is losing water. Home values have skyrocketed, inflation is at a forty-year high, college debt is insurmountable, and wages cannot keep up in many industries.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat Started the Hustle Culture?\n\n\n\nDecades ago, when manufacturing in the U.S. began to move overseas, parents sent their kids to college with the hope that they would land a job in the corporate world. Promises of upward mobility, free quality health care, retirement plans, and paid vacation were all shiny enticements. A gold watch or plaque was given to commemorate 30-40 years of loyalty, and retirees happily went off into their golden years. That all began to change as more companies became public and were obligated to the stock market, shareholders, or private equity firms. \n\n\n\nBenefits were shrunk down and went from being part of your salary to a costly sum removed from each paycheck. Staffing was reduced as layoffs became the answer for many to show that their profit line had improved. Those layoffs meant workers had to double or triple their workload. Human resources had stacks of resumes by the hundreds, so if you were unwilling to do it, someone else would. That extra work would provide a promotion in title only, and you would be told once again that your annual raise was the maximum of 3%, but your healthcare costs blossomed to 7%. But you were grateful to have a job. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that the average job tenure is hovering around four years. Is it any wonder?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe New Hustle Culture\n\n\n\nMillennials have not adopted the “work over everything else” mindset that has pervaded corporate America, and remote work has allowed many to realize that there is more to life than just working.&nbsp;Millennials and Gen Z are among the most entrepreneurial generations. They are starting businesses online, launching their own brands, and taking charge of their destinies. They may be hustling, but they are doing it on their own terms. They don’t want to “work for the man” as their parents did.\n\n\n\nAccording to a 2022 Small Business Trends study by Guidant Financial, “entrepreneurs in the U.S. tend to be between the ages of 25 and 44 and are often motivated by a desire to pursue their passions, exit corporate America, and take advantage of new opportunities.” There are so many opportunities in franchising where you can find rewarding work. According to the International Franchise Association’s 2022 Franchising Economic Outlook, franchising is on a growth trajectory despite the pandemic. Sure, franchise owners need to hustle — especially in the first year of business — but they do it for themselves. Franchising offers a better alternative to “working for the man.”   \n\n\n\nThe Hustle Culture only works when you are hustling for yourself.\n\n\n\nFinding Your “Why”\n\n\n\nI work with hopeful business owners across the country to help them find the freedom that they seek. As we grow to know and trust each other, it becomes imperative to find their “why.”&nbsp;Financial freedom or workplace independence are often pain points plaguing them. They no longer want to “work for the man.” They are tired of helping grow a business that is not theirs, or they are simply burnt out. Accepting a counteroffer once you have handed in a resignation is never advisable. The reason is simple. It was never about the money. The extra money is nice, but there are many other burrs on your side by that point and no remedy to remove them. The Hustle Culture only works when you are hustling for yourself.\n\n\n\nOne thing is clear. People want control of their own destinies. They are tired of adding rocks to a cairn that only benefits others and want to do it for themselves.\n\n\n\n“Go confidently in the direction of your dreams! Live the life you&#8217;ve imagined.” ~Henry David Thoreau",

        "description": "The writer’s intriguing, uneven novel follows an academic as he meanders through the streets of the city and in and out of realityIt sounds like a handsomely prestigious assignment. The year is 2005 and the unnamed narrator of Amit Chaudhuri’s latest novel has moved to Berlin for four months to occupy the role of Böll professor at an unnamed university. Awarded a generous stipend, he is put up in a spacious flat that once housed the Nobel prizewinning author Kenzaburō Ōe. He has a minder who handles his admin, frets over his cultural intake and introduces him to luminaries in the department.But the narrator is under no great illusions. At his inaugural talk, where he “rambled on why India was a ‘modern’ idea, not a colonial or postcolonial one” – a subject that Chaudhuri has written about in the past – he notes that his hosts have to pretend he is a scholar of significance and not, as he believes, “an ornament to an international initiative”. Teaching a class later on, he “holds forth” to a dwindling number of students “but wasn’t authoritative”.Sojourn by Amit Chaudhuri is published by Faber (£14.99).

Plus, a magnificent snapshot of postwar Britain’s industrial mightIn August 2020, some 2,750 tonnes of ammonium nitrate carelessly stored in Beirut’s ancient port suddenly exploded. The blast, one of the worst in world history, released a fireball miles into the air. In the briefest of moments before the whiteout, it was possible to see silver sparks flying – fireworks, lethally stored in the same depot – through the slowed images captured on mobile phones. The thunderclap was so loud it could be heard across the Mediterranean in Cyprus.At least 218 people lost their lives and 7,000 more were terribly injured. People spoke of being lifted into the air like feathers, of sudden deafness and hot blood in their eyes. Some buildings stood, unaccountably, while others right next to them collapsed in an instant. The explosion had the magnitude of a small nuclear bomb. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Kyle Ross-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Another day, another loss.  Not much to say about this one. When it’s bad in Bucco Land, it’s bad. The Pittsburgh Pirates were shut out by the Philadelphia Phillies on Saturday 6-0 for Pittsburgh’s seventh straight defeat. They only managed six hits on the day.\nTyler Beede drew the start on the mound and was ineffective again, going for three innings and giving up six runs on five hits with three walks and five strikeouts. Over his last three starts, Beede has given up 12 earned runs in 10 innings pitched. That’s not going to get it done anywhere, let alone in Pittsburgh where we’re allergic to scoring runs. \nThe only multi-hit Bucco was Greg Allen, who went 2-for-3, and the Pirates struck out 12 total times on the day and were 0-for-6 with runners in scoring position. Bryan Reynolds, Ben Gamel, and Ke’Bryan Hayes were all 0-for-4.\nBest part? According Phillies pitcher Kyle Gibson, who pitched seven shutout innings while striking out nine Bucs... “I didn’t feel very sharp.” What would’ve happened if he was?\nWe have no highlights for you from the defeat. It was bad enough that I wasted three hours of DVR space recording this thing.  \nThe Bucs are back at it today, where they will look to avoid being swept. Don’t hold your breath.",

        "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said that a nuclear plant that produces power for the country is \"constantly being provoked by Russian forces,\" sparking fears of possible damage to the facility causing a radiation leak. \n\n\n\nDuring a video address to the country late Friday evening, Zelensky said that Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant had been put in a \"very risky and dangerous\" situation, with nuclear scientists and specialists in the energy industry working to protect it from \"the worst-case scenario.\"\n\n\n\n\"I want to emphasize that the situation remains very risky and dangerous,\" he said in a translated speech. \"Any repeat of yesterday's events, that is, any disconnection of the plant from the grid, any actions by Russia that could trigger the shutdown of the reactors, will again put the plant one step away from disaster.\"\n\n\n\nHe said the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) should come to the plant as soon as possible, urging Russian troops to withdraw from the plant and neighboring areas to eliminate the threat entirely. \n\n\n\nZelensky also thanked \"all those who are mobilizing the world's response to Russian radiation blackmail.\"\n\n\n\nRussian rocket and artillery strikes hit areas near the plant, Ukrainian officials said Sunday. In the city of Zaporizhzhia, two people were wounded after heavy fire throughout the night. Heavy firing also left parts of Nikopol without electricity, and rocket strikes damaged about a dozen residences in Marhanets.\n\n\n\nRussian forces occupied the Zaporizhzhia plant early in the invasion of Ukraine. Ukrainian workers still run the facility, which is the largest in Europe, and both sides have repeatedly accused each other of shelling the site.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/3618328-the-tragedy-of-novak-djokovic/",
        "description": "He’s arguably the world’s greatest tennis player and belongs squarely in the greatest-of-all-time conversation. But tennis fans won’t see him on one of its biggest stages at the U.S. Open because of the federal government’s rule against allowing unvaccinated non-U.S. citizens into the United States.“Sadly, I will not be able to travel to NY this time for US Open,\" Djokovic wrote on Twitter. \"Good luck to my fellow players! I'll keep in good shape and positive spirit and wait for an opportunity to compete again.\"  The 35-year-old Serbian is one month removed from capturing Wimbledon in London again. He’s now won 21 Grand Slam singles titles, one fewer than the great Rafael Nadal. Nadal may very well extend that lead with Djokovic unable to play. Regardless of whether a Djokovic-Nadal matchup would have taken place, not having the world’s best player in New York competing against anyone is robbing tennis fans.And it’s all for nothing.Djokovic isn’t vaccinated against COVID-19. His body, his choice. He could easily get the jabs and be done with it, but he’s steadfastly sticking to his principles. If this is about the science and data and protecting others from the virus, how does getting the vaccine stop the spread of the virus? Because more and more, we’re seeing triple-vaccinated people contracting coronavirus. President Joe Biden and First Lady Jill Biden even got it twice in the span of less than two weeks despite being fully vaxxed up.But don’t take my word for it. Here’s what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky said recently about vaccines preventing transmission.\"Our vaccines are working exceptionally well. …What they can’t do anymore is prevent transmission.\"\n\n\n\nConsider also that Djokovic already hadCOVID in June 2020 and December 2021 and therefore has naturally acquired immunity. Several respected studies have suggested that natural immunity is also effective at preventing major illness from the virus.  In other words, Djokovic, relatively young and in top health, has little risk from COVID, because his body has produced naturally what a vaccine would otherwise provide. And if this is about public health and safety, someone really needs to explain why Djokovic, nowhere near anyone on a court, cannot play while more than 23,000 fans fill Arthur Ashe Stadium without masks and without showing the same vaccination card Djokovic is required to present before entering the country.“At this time, ticket holders will not be required to show proof of COVID vaccination for admission into the US Open,\" the event's official website states.\n\n\n\nAnd while we're at it, why was he allowed to play in last year's U.S. Open unvaccinated but not in 2022 under the same status?When it comes to healthy athletes and vaccine mandates, it’s all become very arbitrary. Take a nationally televised NBA game from earlier this year featuring the New York Knicks at the Brooklyn Nets.Kyrie Irving, the Nets unvaccinated star point guard, wasn't allowed to play for the home team due to New York’s COVID laws at the time. But there was Irving, plain-clothed and sitting courtside, mingling with fans and cheering his team on, without a mask, and even greeting players during timeouts with high fives and chest bumps.Can you believe this? Irving was allowed to sit in the stands with no mask. He could touch his teammates and talk to people in the stands at close range. But playing was deemed a health risk.\n\n\n\nOh, and here's the best part: New York’s rules allowed unvaccinated players from other states to play.\n\n\n\nTennis icon and broadcaster John McEnroe called the Djokovic decision \"a joke.\" \"I don't think it's fair,\" the always candid McEnroe told reporters on Thursday. \"I think it's a joke. I would have had the vaccine and gone and played, but he's got very strong beliefs and you have to respect that.”\"At this point, in the pandemic, we're 2½ years in, I think people in all parts of the world know more about it, and the idea that he can't travel here to play, to me is a joke,\" he added.A Djokovic-less Open comes as the U.S. government is allowing millions of migrants to enter the country regardless of vaccination status. Those entering illegally are coming in from poorer countries, where vaccines are less common.\n\n\n\nOf course, our government does not require those entering illegally to show a vaccination card. But if you're Novak Djokovic, it’s an absolute necessity.Tennis fans will be robbed this week. Novak Djokovic, who had been ranked #1 for 373 consecutive weeks (a record), will sit and watch someone else win a title he's captured three times.We will someday look back on the COVID era with such shame — shame for what our leaders did in preventing our children from going to school and requiring that they wear masks for years.\n\n\n\nThe same illogic applies to those who believe&nbsp;keeping Novak Djokovic out of the country and out of the Open is a good idea.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJoe Concha is a media and politics columnist.",

        "description": "The White House is rushing ahead to roll out a new COVID-19 booster shot campaign in early September, but is facing an uphill battle to ensure it is successful.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe vaccines&nbsp;being used in the campaign&nbsp;are the first ones that have been manufactured to specifically target the subvariants of omicron that are currently causing the most infections,&nbsp;and administration officials have indicated they're preparing to start offering the shots shortly after Labor Day.\n\n\n\nImmunity from the initial round of vaccines is waning and health officials said they want to ensure the public is protected as much as possible against another wave of infections in the fall and winter. Right now, close to 450 Americans are dying every day from the virus, and there's concern the numbers could rise as people move indoors.\n\n\n\nBoth Pfizer and Moderna have asked the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for emergency use authorization for booster shots that target the omicron BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants. Pfizer's vaccine will be for everyone aged 12 and older, while Moderna's will be meant just for adults aged 18 and older.\n\n\n\nAdministration officials say these new vaccines will be key to controlling a potential fall surge, but they will need to convince an increasingly checked-out public&nbsp;to get the shots.\n\n\n\nWhite House COVID-19 response coordinator Ashish Jha has been front and center trying to promote the reformulated boosters, saying recently that “all the data suggests [they] should be highly effective against the new variants.”\n\n\n\n\"The big picture bottom line is these are substantial upgrades in our vaccines in terms of their ability to prevent infection, to prevent transmission. Certainly to prevent serious illness. And so it's going to be really important that people this fall and winter get the new shot.\" Jha said during a U.S. Chamber of Commerce event on Aug. 16.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring an interview with the radio program \"Conversations on Health Care,\" Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Director Rochelle Walensky said the administration wants to provide people with the broadest possible protection.\n\n\n\n\"So the strategy now is to tailor vaccine for giving us the largest breadth of response, ideally one that would have less waning over time,\" Walensky said. \"I believe it is best to use a vaccine that is tailored for the variant that we have right now.\"\n\n\n\nBut despite the administration's optimism, the effort is likely to face major hurdles. Chief among them is a lack of interest from the public. Only about two-thirds of the U.S. population have been vaccinated with a primary COVID-19 vaccine series, while less than half of that group has received even a first booster.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe vaccination rate among children is even lower. According to the CDC, less than 4 percent of eligible kids under the age of 2 have received at least one dose, and only 6 percent of kids between the ages of 2 and 4 have received a single dose.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRupali Limaye, a vaccine expert at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said she doesn't expect the retooled boosters will do much to convince the under-vaccinated population&nbsp;to get another shot.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe same people who rushed to get the initial vaccine series and then the first round of boosters will be the ones to receive the omicron-specific shots, she said, and mixed messages from health officials are partly to blame.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe most recent update to the CDC's guidance emphasized living with the virus, and downplayed many of its previously recommended mitigation strategies. That doesn't necessarily mesh with the&nbsp;idea that&nbsp;the public&nbsp;urgently needs&nbsp;to get an updated vaccine.\n\n\n\n\"I think for the most part, the majority of the public has sort of moved on, if you will. And the messaging has been that this is going to now be with us,\" Limaye said. \"Why do I need a new vaccine related to a virus that essentially my government has told me is no longer an issue?\"\n\n\n\nRather than a broad rollout&nbsp;of the updated vaccines&nbsp;for the general public, Limaye and other scientists have suggested a more targeted approach, tailoring vaccine recommendations to the elderly and immunocompromised.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJohn Moore, a virologist at Weill Cornell Medicine, said it's not clear how much extra protection the new shots would provide against infection, but predicted they won't be much better than the first round of boosters.\n\n\n\nThe protection is likely \"somewhere between mediocre and reasonable. I mean, we just don't know,\" Moore said.&nbsp;\"A booster will give some additional protection against infection for, you know, a few months before it wanes again.\"\n\n\n\nMoore said it's important that health officials provide the public with realistic messaging, and don't oversell the benefits of the shots.\n\n\n\n\"It's not like they're a magic bullet that gives you super strong protection,\" Moore said. \"If the public thinks they're getting something that is really, really against infection, then they might change their behavior and increase the risk of exposure. That's counterproductive.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe other concern among some scientists is that the government is moving too quickly to authorize the vaccines. Neither&nbsp;Moderna nor Pfizer&nbsp;has clinical trial data for the vaccine. Instead, their requests are based on data from a booster targeting an earlier version of omicron, as well as preclinical data from mice.\n\n\n\nBut health officials maintain they don't need additional data, because&nbsp;vaccine manufacturers are&nbsp;essentially making a minor update to the existing vaccine, which has an established track record of success.\n\n\n\n\"There’s always a question here of being too slow versus too fast, and I think one of the challenges is if we wait for those data to emerge in human data, not just mice data, in human data, we will be using what I would consider to be a potentially outdated vaccine,\" Walensky said. \"I believe it is best to use a vaccine that is tailored for the variant that we have right now.\"",

        "description": "Poets and songwriters have long known that love hurts, but now scientists are examining the physical anguish caused by a breakup – and the results are helping people understand and recover from their distressIn the winter of 2004, women started arriving at Japanese hospitals complaining of chest pains and a shortness of breath. It was a month since a major earthquake had shaken the country, causing mudslides in the mountains, injuring 4,805 people and killing 68. In emergency rooms, doctors hooked the women up to ECG monitors, and saw the same extreme changes they’d expect with heart attacks. But subsequent tests showed their coronary arteries weren’t blocked, as they would be by a heart attack. Instead, their hearts had changed shape. It didn’t take long for these cases to be diagnosed as takotsubo cardiomyopathy, or “broken heart syndrome”.Heartbreak is not simply a metaphor. Today, up to 7% of all sudden cardiac hospital admissions in Japan are diagnosed as takotsubo, when stress hormones after a traumatic event have caused a weakening of the left ventricle, meaning it can no longer pump effectively – for a while, it gives up. It hurts. And it clearly shows the link between the stresses happening in a person’s life, whether an earthquake or the end of a relationship, and their heart. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Let&#8217;s face it, the present state of the Rockies is gloomy.\nThey entered the weekend with a 54-72 record and were on pace to finish with 93 losses. With 23 of their final 36 games on the road, things could get gloomier still.\nBut there is genuine hope on the horizon. And that&#8217;s not just spin coming from the folks at 20th and Blake.\nAs recently as 2020, the Rockies&#8217; farm system was ranked 28th by both Baseball America and MLB Pipeline, which is run by MLB.com. This month, the Rockies were ranked 10th by Baseball America and ninth by MLB Pipeline. Even ESPN, which has been a consistently harsh critic of the Rockies, has proclaimed some improvement, with the organization climbing from 23rd in the spring to its current rank of 16th.\nChris Forbes, Colorado&#8217;s director of player development, admits that it&#8217;s nice to see the farm system receive some praise.\n&#8220;Internally, we&#8217;ve kept that total belief that we were in a much better spot than most people thought we were, on the farm,&#8221; Forbes said. &#8220;But it’s nice to hear and it’s much better than hearing the other way.&#8221;\nWhile the farm system is certainly not going to provide the Rockies with immediate success at the major-league level, there is a wave of position talent not that far away.\n&#8220;More than a specific position, I would say that the Rockies&#8217; rise has been fueled by a lot of strong talent that&#8217;s coming up from the lower levels,&#8221; said Kyle Glaser, a national writer for Baseball America, the well-respected publication that has evaluated minor and major league players for more than four decades.\n&#8220;Last year at low-A Fresno, it was very apparent that there was a lot of talent on that team,&#8221; Glaser continued, noting how outfielder Zac Veen, shortstop Ezequiel Tovar and catcher Drew Romo stood out in the California League. &#8220;At that time, Veen was the only one who was considered a top-100 prospect. But watching that team I could see that there was a lot of talent.&#8221;\nThe best players from Fresno moved up to High-A Spokane while Veen and Tovar are now at Double-A Hartford. Tovar is likely going to be promoted to Triple-A once his groin injury has sufficiently healed. Tovar will almost certainly make his major league debut early in 2023 and Veen is not that far behind.\nHere is Baseball America&#8217;s synopsis: &#8220;The Rockies have the biggest breakouts from the 2022 season in Ezequiel Tovar, Drew Romo and (shortstop) Adael Amador. As those players rose up the Top 100 they joined 2020 first-rounder Zac Veen among the premier prospects in the game.\n&#8220;With strong international classes in recent years and the addition of five players within the top 100 picks of the 2022 draft. The Rockies&#8217; system boasts high-end, up-the-middle talent with strong depth and upside throughout their lower levels.&#8221;\n\nRising up the Ranks\nAfter a number of down years, the Rockies&#8217; farm system is on the upswing, according to recent national reports. Here&#8217;s how the Rockies rank among the 30 major league teams:\nBaseball America\nCurrent rank: 10th\nPreseason rank: 24th\n2021: 25th\n2020: 28th\n2019: 23rd\n2018: 19th\n2017: 10th\nMLB Pipeline\nCurrent rank: 9th\nPreseason rank: 24th\n2021: 26th\n2020: 28th\nNote: MLB Pipeline did begin ranking all 30 teams until 2020.\n\nJonathan Mayo of MLB Pipeline is also bullish about the young blood in the Rockies&#8217; system.\n&#8220;There is talent at every level and the Rockies&#8217; top-30 prospect list is much more robust than it was a couple of years ago,&#8221; Mayo said. &#8220;That&#8217;s why they moved into our top 10.&#8221;\nHere is MLB Pipeline&#8217;s thumbnail evaluation of Colorado&#8217;s system: &#8220;The Rockies had been making small, incremental progress up the rankings until this huge leap, putting them in the top 10 for the first time since the 2017 preseason (when we only did a top 10).\n&#8220;There weren’t any big trades that caused the push, but rather a combination of several players already in the system breaking out as top-notch prospects (three of the four Top 100 prospects in the system were not on the list at the start of this season) and a strong 2022 Draft class &#8212; six from the top 100 of our Draft Top 250 are now Rockies &#8212; that added seven new names to a much deeper Top 30.&#8221;\nReporters such as Glaser, Mayo, and ESPN&#8217;s Kiley McDaniel make their prospect evaluations and compile their lists and establish rankings based upon conversations with scouts, front-office personnel and minor-league managers and coaches. There are also a lot of in-person visits to minor league games.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s hours and hours of reporting, and we talk to opposing teams to get their view, too,&#8221; Glazer said. &#8220;It&#8217;s very, very comprehensive and it&#8217;s very challenging culling down all of that information.&#8221;\nWhile not all farm directors take kindly to the rankings and evaluations, Forbes said that he respects them.\n&#8220;I had a scouting background previously, so I do (find) some validity from the guys who are sitting in the stands, and talking to people in baseball and truly evaluating our farm system,&#8221; he said.\nAs for his own view of the Rockies&#8217; system, Forbes is optimistic.\n&#8220;Seeing this wave is encouraging,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They are not all going to hit, of course, but I kind of like the makeup and competitiveness of the group. Plus, they are physical and they are toolsy. I’m liking some of our versatility pieces. I like the balance of it. And I really like where our catching is at. It’s been a long time since we have had a complete catching corps like this.&#8221;\nBut it&#8217;s the other half of the battery &#8212; pitching, starting pitching in particular &#8212; where the Rockies remain thin. Injuries and poor performance from recent high draft picks have left the cupboard bare.\nRight-hander Peter Lambert (second round, 2015) has made just two starts since making 19 starts as a rookie in 2019 and he&#8217;s still recovering from his 2020 Tommy John surgery. Lefty Ryan Rolison (first round, 2018) climbed to Triple-A last year but didn&#8217;t pitch at all this year and underwent shoulder surgery in July.  Lefty Helcris Olivarez, an international signing, would likely have made his Rockies debut this season but he&#8217;s been injured since spring training and needs surgery to repair his shoulder capsule and faces a lengthy rehab. Righty Mike Nikorak (first round, 2015) retired without getting close to the majors because of elbow issues.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGerman Marquez outduels Max Scherzer as Rockies beat Mets, 1-0\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRegis Jesuit&#8217;s David Peterson outduels Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s Kyle Freeland as Mets blank Rockies\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSaunders: A paint-by-numbers look at the Rockies&#8217; slide\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMets walk-off Rockies who blow chance for a rare road win\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMets&#8217; Jacob deGrom dominates as Rockies fall to 18-40 on the road\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n&#8220;There&#8217;s no question about it, that right now, the strength of the Rockies organization and the players fueling this rise are position players and catchers,&#8221; Glaser said. &#8220;We did see the Rockies spend three of their top five picks on pitchers in this year&#8217;s draft, including (first-rounder) Gabriel Hughes at No. 10 overall.\n&#8220;And they got Jaden Hill last year, who&#8217;s now back on the mound after Tommy John (surgery).

        "description": "KYIV, Ukraine — Russian rocket and artillery strikes hit areas across the Dnieper River from Europe’s largest nuclear power plant, Ukrainian officials said Sunday, as fears persisted that fighting in the vicinity could damage the plant and cause a radiation leak. Russian forces took control of the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant soon after the war began and hold adjacent territory along the left bank of the wide river. Ukraine controls the right bank, including the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, each of them about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the plant. Heavy firing during the night left parts of Nikopol without electricity, said Valentyn Reznichenko, governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region. Rocket strikes damaged about a dozen residences in Marhanets, according to Yevhen Yevtushenko, the administration head for the district that includes the city of about 45,000. The city of Zaporizhzhia, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) upriver from the nuclear plant, also came under fire during the night, wounding two people, city council member Anatoliy Kurtev said. In eastern Ukraine, where Russian and separatist forces are trying to take control, shelling hit the large and strategically significant cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, but no casualties were reported, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, governor of the Donetsk region. Much of the Donetsk region is held by Russian and separatist forces. It is one of two Ukrainian regions that Russia has recognized as sovereign states. Authorities last week began distributing iodine tablets to residents who live near the Zaporizhzhia plant in case of radiation exposure, which can cause health problems. Much of the concern centers on the cooling systems for the plant’s nuclear reactors. The systems require power to run, and the plant was temporarily knocked offline Thursday because of what officials said was fire damage to a transmission line. A cooling system failure could cause a nuclear meltdown. Russian forces occupied the nuclear plant complex early in the 6-month-old war, but local Ukrainian workers have kept it running. The Ukrainian and Russian governments have repeatedly accused the other of shelling the complex and nearby areas, raising fears of a possible catastrophe. Periodic shelling has damaged the power station’s infrastructure, Ukraine’s nuclear power operator, Energoatom, said Saturday. “There are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is high,” it said. The U.N.’s atomic energy agency has tried to work out an agreement to send a team in to inspect and help secure the plant. Officials said preparations for the visit were underway, but it remained unclear when it might take place.",

        "description": "Former assistant special Watergate prosecutor Nick Ackerman said late Saturday that he thinks the Department of Justice (DOJ) will be closely watching the national security damage assessment reportedly underway regarding documents the FBI obtained from former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence. \n\n\n\n“That's a big issue here. In fact, I think the prosecutors will be investigating some of the same things. I mean, for example, they're looking at the videos that were on the storage area,” Ackerman told anchor Jim Acosta on \"CNN Newsroom.\" \n\n\n\n“They're going to want to see who moved things in and out, when they did it in relation to requests that they made,” he added. \"I'm sure they're going to be fingerprinting every one of those documents to try and determine whether anybody else had access to them and who had access to them.\"\n\n\n\nAckerman’s remarks come after the redacted FBI affidavit used to convince a judge to approve this month's search of Trump’s Florida residence was unsealed to the public on Friday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 28-page affidavit indicated that authorities found up to 184 classified documents they obtained from the Mar-a-Lago residence, with 25 of those documents containing top secret information.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAckerman also told Acosta that \"the obstruction piece of this\" stands out to him from the affidavit.\n\n\n\n“The concealment that's listed in that affidavit, I mean, that is what really triggered this search warrant in the first place because they had evidence that they were being lied to, that they were being played, and that Donald Trump and some others were basically concealing these documents, which leads to the big question why would they even want these documents in the first place, which of course, brings up this issue of what happened to these documents, who had access to them, and were any of our real major secrets blown because of the way this material was handled,” Ackerman said. \n\n\n\n“I think from a prosecutor's standpoint, it's that obstruction piece that really is important here,” he added.\n\n\n\nDirector of National Intelligence Avril Haines reportedly sent a letter to two Democratic representatives on Friday noting that officials would assess the risk resulting from potential disclosure of the classified information in the documents.\n\n\n\nTrump has denied any wrongdoing regarding the documents.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/3618338-what-colleges-are-up-against-if-the-supreme-court-bans-affirmative-action/",
        "description": "In the coming year, the Supreme Court appears poised to ban or sharply limit affirmative action in college admissions, reversing 40 years of precedent and overturning admission practices at hundreds of colleges and universities.        \n\n\n\nAffirmative action has been the subject of heated controversy for decades. In a series of decisions dating back to 1978, the Supreme Court concluded that the educational benefits of diversity constitute a compelling governmental interest justifying some consideration of race in college admissions. Decades of social science research and “the overwhelming consensus of American universities” support that conclusion. Affirmative action is also justified, we would add, because, as Matt Zwolinski and John Tomasi have observed, discrimination against groups, like radioactive waste, “has a long, diffuse, and toxic half-life.”\n\n\n\nNonetheless, in 2014, Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA), a non-profit formed by conservative activist Edward Blum, sued Harvard University and the University of North Carolina (UNC) for allegedly discriminating against Asian-American and, in UNC’s case, white applicants. After losing in the lower courts, SFFA appealed to the Supreme Court, which will hear oral arguments on Oct. 31.\n\n\n\nGiven the changing landscape, admissions professionals in colleges and universities have been working hard to address the obstacles they face — by identifying, adopting, and/or expanding race-neutral strategies to attract a talented and diverse student body.\n\n\n\nThe fundamental issue, of course, is whether institutions of higher education can meet their diversity goals through race-neutral alternatives. The short answer is no, but race-neutral alternatives can contribute to student-body diversity.\n\n\n\nTen states, including California, Florida, and Michigan, already prohibit consideration of race in public university admissions. Since most colleges and universities admit most of the students who apply, bans on affirmative action have relatively little impact on them. But at highly selective institutions, the elimination of affirmative action has led to sharp declines in the percentages of students from underrepresented groups.\n\n\n\nFollowing a 1996 ban on affirmative action at the University of California (UC) system, for example, enrollment of Black and Native American students at Berkeley and UCLA, the system’s most selective campuses, was “cut in half.” Ever since, the UC system has “experiment[ed] with a wide variety of alternative approaches” for fostering student-body diversity, with only limited success. In 2019, although over 52 percent of California public high school graduates identified as Latinx, just 25 percent of UC freshmen did. At Berkeley, only 15 percent of freshmen identified as Latinx, and similar disparities exist for African American and Native American students. Other public university systems dealing with bans on affirmative action, such as those in Michigan and Oklahoma, have experienced similar outcomes.\n\n\n\nBut even though race-neutral measures cannot overcome the impact of a ban, they can help. The impact of any given race-neutral measure will depend on an institution’s characteristics, demographic patterns, and the ability to afford often expensive programs. Percentage plans, for example, which admit all students whose grades place them near the top of their high school class, might prove beneficial in states with a large number of majority-minority high schools. In Texas, a “top 10 percent” plan helped increase enrollment of Latinx students (though it had little impact on Black student enrollment). By contrast, in Michigan, where the “number of majority-minority schools is dwarfed by the number of schools that are heavily white,” a percentage plan “would have minimal or negative effects on racial diversity.”\n\n\n\nSFFA and other critics of affirmative action often claim that targeting economically and educationally disadvantaged students is the best way to achieve diversity. In those categories, however, white students with competitive academic qualifications often greatly outnumber students of color; as a result, efforts to target those groups increase socioeconomic diversity, an important benefit in its own right, but are “less effective at enrolling students from underrepresented minority groups.”\n\n\n\nThe best approach, which many colleges now follow in various ways, involves “widening the funnel,” that is, to combine generous financial aid programs with targeted recruitment strategies. In addition to increasing admission officer presentations to students (and, when possible, their parents or guardians) at high schools with diverse populations, strategies include virtual high school visits, enhanced campus visit programs that focus on underrepresented prospective applicants, workshops for high school counsellors, and scholarships for high school sophomores and juniors to attend on campus summer academic programs. Building partnerships with community-based organizations, including affinity groups, and working with community colleges on transfer programs may also help.\n\n\n\nHarvard, UNC, and many other institutions have already deployed many of these measures, and the admission office professionals continue to find new and data-driven ways to innovate. But much work is still needed to determine best practices generally and for each institution.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court is likely to reach a decision in the Harvard and UNC cases by June 2023.&nbsp; As they hope for the best and prepare for the worst, it’s time for colleges and universities to redouble their already considerable efforts to prepare for the challenges ahead.\n\n\n\nGlenn C.

He moved to Kingston as a teenager to pursue music and had his first hit at 14 with Hurricane Hattie. After stints in New York and London he returned to Jamaica and played the lead role in the 1972 film The Harder They Come, whose soundtrack (featuring four of Cliff’s songs) helped popularise reggae around the world. The film has just been rereleased for its 50th anniversary, and Cliff’s latest album, Refugees, his first in a decade, is out now on UMe.You tackle some weighty subjects on your new album – racism, money lust, the refugee crisis. Was that your motivation for making it: to speak out on these issues?No, I wanted to make it because I wanted to make new music. And along the way these songs were inspired. A lot of the way I write is: I talk lyrics into my phone. Then I listen back and think: ‘Wow, this sounds good, and this is a relevant song for the time, I had no idea!’ So it came like that, and that’s a happy feeling. Continue reading...",

Then he said about the current team, “I just pray to God that those guys do what I couldn’t do.”\nThe Mets made a number of roster moves prior to yesterday’s game, optioning Yolmer Sánchez and Connor Grey to make room for Eduardo Escobar and David Peterson on the active roster.\nDespite Eduardo Escobar’s return from the injured list yesterday, the Mets opted to keep Brett Baty in the major leagues.

        "description": "In﻿ a previous column, I foresaw a Republican congressional red wave in this year’s elections, giving&nbsp;the GOP a strong House majority that could only be impeded by Donald Trump announcing his 2024 candidacy and diverting voters’ focus from&nbsp;​President&nbsp;Biden's failures to Trump's misadventures. This&nbsp;​past&nbsp;week’s GOP primary results in New York have caused certain modifications — negative and positive — in my estimate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe negative is that a GOP red wave is no longer a guarantee. The Supreme Court’s&nbsp;Dobbs decision&nbsp;reversing Roe v. Wade and Biden's legislative wins on&nbsp;spending&nbsp;and&nbsp;guns&nbsp;have energized the Democratic base and caught Republicans flat-footed. This Democratic energy was demonstrated in New York’s special election to fill the unexpired term of Antonio Delgado, who had resigned his congressional seat in the 19th District to become the state’s lieutenant governor. Though Delgado is a Democrat, his winning margins had been&nbsp;tight&nbsp;and gurus in both parties considered the 19th as the type of district that would switch to red in a wave year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Republican candidate, Dutchess County Executive Marc Molinaro, was a proven vote-getter who had run a credible race as the GOP candidate for&nbsp;governor&nbsp;in 2018. His Democratic opponent, Pat Ryan, the county executive of neighboring Ulster County, was a respected campaigner, but the smart money was on Molinaro.\n\n\n\nBut the smart money was proven wrong as Ryan eked out a 2-point&nbsp;victory. Ryan had based his campaign almost entirely on&nbsp;abortion rights&nbsp;and that indeed was a factor in his win. An added factor was the fact that two Democratic primary contests in the district boosted Democratic turnout. I think what was almost as significant in this race — and what potentially has more staying power through Election Day than abortion as an issue — was the reemergence of Donald Trump. The FBI&nbsp;raid&nbsp;at his Mar-a-Lago home and his fierce, unrelenting defense and counterattack put Trump back on the front pages and at the center of political attention, pushing aside — at least temporarily — the Republican issues of crime, inflation and Biden’s incompetence.\n\n\n\nOn the positive side: Solid, conservative Republican congressional candidates — incumbent Congressman&nbsp;Andrew Garbarino&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nick LaLota&nbsp;on Long Island, and&nbsp;Nick Langworthy&nbsp;upstate — beat back pro-Trump opponents in three hotly controlled primary races. They will be much more formidable and likely to have success in the general election than their vanquished opponents.\n\n\n\nThe Molinaro defeat should be a wake-up call to Republicans that they can’t just ride a wave to victory as they did in their massive victories in 1994, 2010 and 2014.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe elements for achieving a working House majority are still there. Violent&nbsp;crime&nbsp;is climbing at a startling rate. Inflation is at a&nbsp;four-decade high. Joe Biden is still wildly&nbsp;unpopular,&nbsp;with favorable numbers in the low&nbsp;40s. And the political reality is&nbsp;​that&nbsp;the party controlling the White House​ historically&nbsp;loses seats&nbsp;in the&nbsp;off-years. I believe these issues will more than counterbalance abortion and be of more pressing importance to the majority of everyday Americans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Trump factor, though, remains the political wild card. The more Donald Trump dominates the headlines, the more difficult it will be for Republicans to get their winning message across and to win the votes of&nbsp;independents and traditional mainstream Democrats. And if he launches the ultimate October surprise and announces his presidential candidacy, then truly all bets are off.\n\n\n\nPeter King was the U.S. representative of New York’s 2nd and 3rd congressional districts for 28 years, including serving as chairman of the House Committee on Homeland Security.

        "description": "Gilberto Celestino walked with the bases loaded in the 10th inning and the Minnesota Twins rallied to beat the San Francisco Giants 3-2 Saturday night.It was the second straight win for Minnesota, which had previously lost six in a row.Pinch-runner Caleb Hamilton started the extra inning on second base and advanced to third on a perfect sacrifice bunt by Nick Gordon. Gio Urshela walked and Max Kepler was intentionally walked before Celestino took four straight balls from Dominic Leone (4-5), San Francisco&#x27;s fifth reliever of the night.&quot;It&#x27;s easy to get carried away in that situation and just try to go out there and hack for a homer but he stayed composed. He had a good approach and he drew that walk,&quot; said Carlos Correa, who tied a career-high with four of Minnesota&#x27;s nine hits.Hamilton, Minnesota&#x27;s third-string catcher, scored his first career run in his fifth career game.&quot;When you have ups and downs in a game, in a very tightly contested game, like it was tonight, and then you just find a way no one cares how you get it done, you just want the result. … It took a lot of different and seemingly small individual plays today to all add up to a &#x27;W,&#x27;&quot; Twins manger Rocco Baldelli said.Minnesota scored all its runs in the final two innings.Down to its last out, RBI singles by Correa and Jake Cave off San Francisco closer Camilo Doval tied the score 2-2 in the ninth. Kepler walked to open the inning and Luis Arraez walked two outs later. Correa singled to right to drive in Kepler and Jose Miranda went the other way to score Arraez.With Jhoan Duran (2-3) pitching, a heads up play by Correa at shortstop opened the San Francisco 10th. With Luis González trying for third base on a ground ball, Correa threw to Urshela for an easy tag.&quot;Yeah, right now Luis is, as he&#x27;s developing into a major league player, he just doesn&#x27;t trust himself enough. So, he&#x27;s kind of in between and being in between on the bases is not conducive to making good reads,&quot; Giants manager Gabe Kapler said.Correa started a near-rally in the eighth against John Brebbia, hitting a sharp single past third baseman Evan Longoria. Cave snapped an 0-for-21 skid with a single to get Correa to third, but Brebbia got Miranda to pop out and Gordon struck out for the third time.Doval replaced Brebbia and Urshela lined out. Minnesota was 2 for 10 with runners in scoring position.Tommy La Stella drove in an early run for the Giants, who had just four hits for the second straight night. Three of those came in the ninth before Austin Slater&#x27;s sacrifice fly scored another.San Francisco starter Alex Cobb allowed four hits while striking out seven; however, he needed 99 pitches to get through his quintet of innings, 31 in the five-batter second inning.After Zack Littell threw a 1-2-3 sixth, Alex Young survived a shaky seventh by, first, getting Celestino to hit into a double play. Two batters later and moments before a 51-minute rain delay, Arraez flew out with a man on second and lightning nearby.Minnesota starter Sonny Gray also put up the outs in his five-inning outing without much brevity. Of his 90 pitches, 53 were strikes.&quot;Not very pleased with how it went. I know that I need to be a lot better than that, and I got some things to work on. Overall, not very pleased with it,&quot; he said.Yet Gray took a no-hitter into his final inning but walked Slater and González — Slater was picked off first base — before Joey Bart lined a double to left field for the first San Francisco hit. La Stella followed with a sacrifice fly to score González.Gray has allowed two or fewer runs in six of last seven starts since the All-Star break, going 3-1 in that span with a 1.91 ERA. He&#x27;s struck out at least five in all but Saturday&#x27;s game, where his total was four.",

        "description": "Star Mets prospect Francisco Alvarez is undergoing evaluation on a sore right ankle, SNY&#8217;s Andy Martino reports (Twitter link).  As per other Peter Botte and Mike Puma of the New York Post, the injury isn&#8217;t thought to be too severe, though simply given the calendar, there is a possibility that the Mets could shut Alvarez down for what remains of the 2022 season.  More will be known in a few days&#8217; time, after Alvarez has been more fully tested.\nOne of the top minor leaguers in all of baseball, there has been speculation that the 20-year-old Alvarez might receive a call-up to the majors this season, as the Mets haven&#8217;t gotten much from the catching position.  However, even before his ankle injury surfaced, Alvarez wasn&#8217;t off to a great start in his first taste of Triple-A action, batting only .180/.340/.378 in 141 plate appearances.  It certainly isn&#8217;t the ideal platform to launch a young player into making his MLB debut in the thick of a pennant race, and naturally the Mets want to be as careful as possible with the development of a possible cornerstone player of the future.\nOther updates from around the NL East&#8230;\n\nThe Nationals shifted Yadiel Hernandez to the 60-day injured list on Saturday, officially ending the outfielder&#8217;s season.  (In a corresponding move, Washington reinstated left-hander Seth Romero from the 60-day IL and assigned him to Double-A.)  Hernandez was retroactively placed on the 10-day IL on August 19 due to a left calf strain, and his third MLB season saw the 34-year-old hit .269/.312/.410 with nine homers over 327 plate appearances.  Hernandez has spent much of his Nats tenure as the left-handed hitting side of an outfield platoon, posting roughly league-average offense since the start of the 2021 campaign.  He is under team control through 2026, but given his age and the Nationals&#8217; rebuild, it is possible the team might consider moving onto a younger option for next season.\nSixto Sanchez&#8217;s continued shoulder inflammation will result in a cortisone shot on Monday, per Craig Mish of the Miami Herald (via Twitter).  Sanchez made his MLB debut with 39 innings in 2020, but hasn&#8217;t since pitched at any level due to shoulder problems, which included surgery in July 2021.  It is becoming increasingly unlikely that Sanchez will get any game action in the majors or minors before 2022 is out, making it another lost year for the Marlins right-hander.",

        "description": "A new Google Workspace update is rolling out that will allow you to unmute yourself using your keyboard&#8217;s spacebar during a Google Meet. Having this capability will make it a lot easier for users to quickly unmute themselves without fumbling around for the mute button on the screen. Of course, users will still be required to mute using the mute button, but unmuting temporarily will be as easy as just holding down the spacebar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe feature works by temporarily holding down the spacebar during a meeting to be unmuted, then releasing the spacebar to go back to being muted. This ensures that you remain muted throughout the meeting, except during the times that you wish to participate, even if you forget to mute yourself again. This is considered an accessibility setting and joins the rest of the keyboard shortcuts available to control features within Google Meet.\n\n\n\nInitially, this feature will be off by default but can be enabled in the Google Meet settings. It will begin to roll out to Rapid and Scheduled Release domains on September 9, 2022, and will take about two weeks to reach everyone. All Google Workspace customers and users with personal Google Accounts will be able to take advantage of it on all web browsers, which is great news.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/3617450-red-wave-hits-breaker-gop-midterm-worries-rise/",
        "description": "Republican worries of a midterm flop are growing heading into the critical post-Labor Day campaign season, with analysts who had previously predicted massive GOP gains shifting their forecasts toward Democrats.\n\n\n\nRick Tyler, a Republican strategist and analyst, said the environment looks “not even close” to a red wave election year.\n\n\n\n“The enthusiasm is just not there,” Tyler said. “Last time Republicans had a good year, they were 6 points ahead in the generic poll. Now we're barely 2 points ahead. So it's definitely not going to happen.”\n\n\n\nRealClearPolitics averages of polls measuring whether voters would prefer Republican or Democratic control of Congress show the GOP advantage slipping from 4.8 points in late April to less than a point as of Friday. At around this point in 2010, when Republicans saw historic gains in Congress, generic polls showed an advantage of  4 to 6 points for the GOP.\n\n\n\nPunctuating the narrowing polls was the result in a special election on Tuesday. New York’s 19th Congressional District — which includes suburban areas and went for former President Trump in 2016 but President Biden in 2020 — is representative of the kind of battleground districts that Republicans are hoping to flip across the country. \n\n\n\nBut while Republican Marc Molinaro stuck to the party’s points about inflation and the economy, topics that Republicans have repeatedly said are top of mind for voters, Democrat Pat Ryan narrowly won the seat after focusing heavily on abortion rights following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade earlier this summer.\n\n\n\nFormer GOP Sen. Rick Santorum (Pa.) said on Newsmax on Thursday that after the special election, “Republicans have to start paying attention.” \n\n\n\n“The problem is where Republicans have to pick up in order to win the Congress is in districts like that,” Santorum said. “If you look at the national polls, if you look at a lot of these races like in my home state of Pennsylvania — if this is a red wave year, the polls are not showing it right now.\"\n\n\n\nDemocrats&nbsp;celebrating the win in New York&nbsp;also point to recent special House elections in&nbsp;Minnesota&nbsp;and&nbsp;Nebraska&nbsp;as evidence of enthusiasm. Candidates there overperformed historical trends in GOP-leaning districts, even though they ultimately lost those races.\n\n\n\nAnd in the wake of the Supreme Court’s Dobbs decision and the controversy surrounding Trump over Jan. 6, 2021, and the FBI's seizure of classified documents at his Mar-a-Lago estate, Democrats are aiming to emphasize negatives on Republicans rather than make the election a referendum on Biden or Democratic leadership.\n\n\n\n“MAGA Republicans hope voters ignore their dangerous extremism, but NY-19 shows us that voters will reject their extreme agenda,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Tommy Garcia said in a statement.\n\n\n\nTop Republicans have already started tempering expectations of taking back the evenly divided Senate as GOP nominees who were boosted by Trump show signs struggling.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said last week that the House is more likely to flip control than the Senate, citing “candidate quality.” \n\n\n\nTyler blamed Trump for the shifting dynamic.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Donald Trump has turned this campaign from a referendum on Joe Biden, inflation, high food prices, high gas prices and affordable housing into a referendum on him,” he said.\n\n\n\nWeaknesses for GOP candidates along with results from recent elections have led election analysts at Sabato’s Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics and The Cook Political Report to shift several forecasts for key congressional midterm races toward Democrats. Cook revised its expected GOP gain in the House from 15 to 30 seats to 10 to 20 seats, and its Senate outlook from Republicans having an edge to a toss-up. \n\n\n\nThat marks a stark contrast from nine months ago, when House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) predicted that 2022 could be even more of a Republican wave than 2010, when Republicans won a staggering 63 seats.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have since warned House members not to measure the drapes early and that the election will be tough, but GOP lawmakers are still largely operating on the assumption that they will win control of the chamber.\n\n\n\nA Senate loss and only a small GOP majority in the House would “lead the media to say, ‘You know, this was a split decision,’” Tyler said. “No mandate, no red wave, no rejection of Biden's policies. That's a disaster for the Republican Party.”\n\n\n\nOther GOP operatives downplay those fears, saying that the New York special election was an outlier case complicated by high Democratic turnout in primaries happening the same day and noting that there are still months to go before the midterms.\n\n\n\n\"Anyone who thought retaking the majority was going to be easy needs to buck up,” National Republican Congressional Committee communications director Michael McAdams said in a statement. “Majorities are won in November not August and we look forward to prosecuting the case against Democrats' failed one-party rule.”\n\n\n\nSarah Chamberlain, president and CEO of Republican Main Street Partnership, cautioned against looking at the New York special election as an indication for what may happen in November. Many voters did not even know the election was happening, she said, or were on vacation.\n\n\n\n\"I would not red flag it yet. We're going to wait to see and do some more polling, but I think things are fine,” Chamberlain said.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have beaten expectations before. Despite Democrats having more than a 6-point edge on the generic ballot in 2020, Republicans gained House seats and squeezed Democrats into the slimmest majority in the lower chamber in a century.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are also spending millions on defending seats rather than being offensive in their House map, a GOP strategist noted, with the record number of Democratic House members retiring rather than running for reelection this year helping the GOP expand its pickup opportunities.\n\n\n\nKyle Kondik, managing editor at Sabato’s Crystal Ball, said that weaknesses in GOP Senate and gubernatorial candidates, as well as many Republicans’ position against abortion, has given Democrats the opportunity ”to make the election more of a choice than a referendum.” But he cautioned against fully reevaluating the midterm environment before Labor Day and said that Republicans could still flip both chambers even if they fall below expectations of a “red wave.”\n\n\n\n“It is possible that the Democrats’ addition of more college-educated voters, at the expense of losing more non-college voters, has skewed some of these special elections, as the college cohort is a more reliable voting bloc,” Kondik said. “That said, if the GOP had some big enthusiasm edge over the Democrats — and if it was bringing a lot of lapsed GOP voters back into the fold — one would think they’d be doing better than they are.”",

Another legal stratagem may rescue him from his latest exposure for grossly mishandling government secrets: “graymail.”\n\n\n\nGraymail was coined to describe a tactic used by defendants in cases in which national security information is at issue: The defendant dares the government to proceed, threatening to insist that the raw information the government wants to protect must be disclosed in court, thus inflicting the very damage to national security that the government wants to avoid.\n\n\n\nSometimes this brazen tactic works. But it may not work for Trump if he is ever charged with a crime in connection with the search.\n\n\n\nWhen U.S. magistrate judge Bruce E. Reinhart released the search warrant for Trump’s residence at Mar-a-Lago, many observers reacted instinctively, saying this at last could be a rap that Trump can’t beat. The warrant showed that the government was investigating a variety of potential federal crimes involving alleged mishandling of national security information, and the inventory of materials seized seemed to demonstrate that Trump actually had been concealing the kind of information that he was not permitted to have. Additional reporting revealed that both the National Archives and a federal grand jury issuing subpoenas had been trying for months to retrieve the material. That seemed to be about as clear-cut as any of the various abuses that have been attributed to Trump over his career.\n\n\n\nBut what may seem clear to an objective observer has rarely been sufficient to keep Trump from skating through various stages of legal jeopardy.\n\n\n\nIn some ways, Trump is a modern-day legal Houdini. From bankruptcies to allegedly fraudulent business deals and charities,to alleged racial discrimination in housing and allegations of sexual assault, Trump successfully sidesteps them all, engaging in massive counterattacks, legal delay and financial settlements. And that was before he was elected president.\n\n\n\nAfter his election, Trump avoided responsibility for nearly a dozen apparent incidents of obstruction of justice in the Russian-influence investigation, thanks to the deferential passivity of special counsel Robert Mueller. Adding to his unique trophy case as the nation’s “Teflon Don,” Trump successfully relied on partisan enablers to shield him from two impeachments.\n\n\n\nWhich brings him to the seeming predicament that he now confronts in the aftermath of the Mar-a-Lago search and seizure. Trump already initiated the first phase of his customary strategy, going on the offense in order to throw off-balance the forces pursuing him. He and his proxies issued statements characterizing the search as a “siege,” an “assault” and a “break-in.” He filed a lawsuit in south Florida asking the federal court to appoint a “special master” to take control of the seized documents and return “his” property to him. All of which is to distract both the prosecutors and the public and enhance Trump’s strategic theme that he is the real victim.\n\n\n\nBut Trump has a sharper arrow in his defense quiver — the graymail defense: The same facts that appear to make his culpability so clear would make it difficult to succeed in prosecuting him.\n\n\n\nThe graymail problem arises because, in any criminal prosecution, the government must prove as a fact that the information that Trump refused to surrender constituted “national defense information” that any reasonable person would realize could injure the country if disclosed.\n\n\n\nThe government’s burden to prove this crucial element of the crime was used for years as an effective device for discouraging the government from pursuing even hard-core espionage cases, as well as the kinds of crimes that Trump apparently committed.\n\n\n\nThe government must demonstrate that disclosure of the information would be at least “potentially damaging” to the United States or advantageous to a foreign government. Espionage Act defendants often argued that, since the jury has to be persuaded about the seriousness of the danger posed by the information, the constitutional rules of evidence require that the information be displayed in open court.\n\n\n\nWhen I was asked to join Watergate special prosecutor Archibald Cox as his counsel, I was serving as Deputy Solicitor General for Criminal and National Security Matters. I was familiar with this problem. This issue eventually arose during the Watergate investigations, because some of the so-called White House “plumbers” had broken into the office of the psychiatrist consulted by Daniel Ellsberg, the former Defense Department official who had leaked the Pentagon Papers to the Washington Post and New York Times. Lawyers for the men tried to forestall prosecution for invading the psychiatrist’s civil rights, arguing that the plumbers were looking to see whether Ellsberg had disclosed such highly sensitive information as the government’s SIOPs — nuclear targeting strategies — and that they would insist on having us produce the information in open court in order to allow them to explain their motives.\n\n\n\nWe were able to sidestep this graymail defense by developing an alternative evidentiary approach, which I subsequently urged Congress to codify. After two years of hearings, Congress enacted the Classified Information Procedures Act in 1980. The statute is carefully designed to balance the defendant’s interest in a fair trial in matters involving national defense information and the public’s compelling interest in protecting nuclear secrets and intelligence sources and methods. Among other techniques, it allows federal trial judges to craft accurate descriptions of the types of information at issue without actually disclosing the detailed information itself.\n\n\n\nOver the past few decades, this statute has worked reasonably well, although not always. The Guantanamo prisoners case is an example of a situation in which the court determined that the CIPA mechanisms would not work, because information about the alleged terrorists’ activity had to be made available in raw form.&nbsp;Defendants with their backs to the wall, aided by clever and imaginative lawyers, are still able to develop arguments that nothing short of full disclosure of the secrets themselves will be sufficient to give the jury a fair picture of the accused’s conduct.\n\n\n\nIt remains to be seen whether the statutory reform will allow the Justice Department to override any attempt by Trump to graymail his way out of another alleged flouting of the rule of law.\n\n\n\nGiven Trump’s track record, he just might escape again.\n\n\n\nPhilip Allen Lacovara was Deputy Solicitor General of the United States for criminal and national security matters, counsel to the Watergate Special Prosecutor, and president of the District of Columbia Bar.",

The U.S. intelligence community will assess whether the documents taken pose a threat to national security, a spokesperson for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence told NPR.Giorgio Viera/AFP via Getty ImagesUpdated August 27, 2022 at 7:48 PM ETThe Office of the Director of National Intelligence will review materials taken from former President Donald Trump&#x27;s home in Florida for potential national security risks.A spokesperson for ODNI told NPR that intelligence leaders will assess what level of harm could come from releasing documents seized from Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago resort.&quot;ODNI will closely coordinate with [the Justice Department] to ensure this [Intelligence Community] assessment is conducted in a manner that does not unduly interfere with DOJ&#x27;s ongoing criminal investigation,&quot; the spokesperson said.Meanwhile, a federal judge said she is inclined to grant Trump&#x27;s request to appoint a special master to oversee the search of the seized material. The decision is not final, and U.S. District Judge Aileen Gannon also told the Justice Department to produce &quot;a more detailed&quot; list of the items that were taken from Mar-a-Lago.This is an initial step in a legal process that will span weeks.Lawmakers back the intelligence community&#x27;s moveRep. Adam Schiff, who chairs the House intelligence committee, and Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney, who chairs the House oversight and reform committee, praised the intelligence community for their assessment in a joint statement.&quot;The DOJ affidavit, partially unsealed yesterday, affirms our grave concern that among the documents stored at Mar-a-Lago were those that could endanger human sources,&quot; they said. &quot;It is critical that the [Intelligence Community] move swiftly to assess and, if necessary, to mitigate the damage done—a process that should proceed in parallel with DOJ&#x27;s criminal investigation.&quot;A redacted version of the affidavit used by the FBI to search the former president&#x27;s home was made available Friday, nearly half of which was unreadable, NPR has reported. \nAccording to the affidavit, 184 classified documents were found among 15 boxes taken from the resort earlier this year. Twenty-five of the documents were labeled &quot;Top Secret.&quot;\nCopyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "Clark&#x27;s team strongly recommends you don&#x27;t poke your fingers through the window of Clark&#x27;s crate.Dawn GriffardOn Monday, there was one traveler who got a true bird&#x27;s-eye view of the Charlotte Douglas Airport.Clark, a 19-year-old bald eagle, was recorded going through TSA with his handlers for his return flight home to Missouri. The footage and photos caught the attention of Twitter.Clark is a flying ambassador of World Bird Sanctuary in south St. Louis. The scales on his talons never developed properly, and he would eventually get pneumonia and die if he were to hunt in the wild, the nonprofit&#x27;s executive director, Dawn Griffard, told NPR over the phone.Griffard said Clark&#x27;s job is to spread a message about conservation and raise money to support the sanctuary. He does this by attending events to fly to songs like The Star Spangled Banner or You Raise Me Up.Griffard said that Clark, who is named for William Clark – and yes, there is another eagle named Lewis at his sanctuary – is hired to fly between four to six times a year. Over the course of 12 years, this frequent flier has taken more than 100 commercial flights.Eagles may not have shoes or belts to remove, but they have their own version of being patted down. A TSA search of a bald eagle involves investigating its crate and under the carpet inside it. People at airports often want to touch or see Clark, and his stewards have to deny their requests to stick their fingers through the window in his crate. But usually they&#x27;re respectful, Griffard said.Much to World Bird Sanctuary&#x27;s appreciation, Southwest Airlines lets Clark travel in the main cabin. Other airlines don&#x27;t allow this, and Griffard has had to put him in cargo in the past – once, she said, an airline misplaced him this way.Despite standing 30 inches high and weighing 7.5 pounds, Clark gets two seats and three seat-belt extenders. That&#x27;s because of his crate, which gets strapped in at the plane&#x27;s bulkhead. A member of World Bird Sanctuary&#x27;s eagle team sits beside the crate to keep an eye on him and give him snacks — typically bits of rat, Griffard explained.Clark sits on his perch in his private hotel room.Dawn GriffardIn each stage of travel, World Bird Sanctuary&#x27;s team, the airport staff and often even the Southwest pilots are careful to keep Clark&#x27;s trip as bump-free as possible. He hates turbulence.When the group arrives at their destination, Clark gets his own hotel room. They move the furniture and throw a large tarp over the floor. He gets a perch in the middle of the room, from which he watches TV. Griffard said he prefers cartoons and nature shows. Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

The plan has sparked heated debate, including about its economic fairness.Paul Morigi/Getty Images for We the 45mPresident Biden&#x27;s plan to forgive hundreds of billions of dollars in student debt is sparking heated debate.Biden last week announced plans to forgive up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients and up to $10,000 for others who qualify.The news will provide relief for borrowers at a time when the cost of higher education has surged. But critics are questioning the fairness of the plan and warn about the potential impact on inflation should the students with the forgiven loans increase their spending.Here are three key arguments – for and against the wisdom of Biden&#x27;s decision.Raising living standards or adding fuel to inflation?Undoubtedly, student debt is a big burden for a lot of people.  Under Biden&#x27;s plan, 43 million people stand to have their loan payments reduced, while 20 million would have their debt forgiven altogether.  People whose payments are cut or eliminated should have more money to spend elsewhere – maybe to buy a car, put a down payment on a house or even put money aside for their own kids&#x27; college savings plan.  So the debt forgiveness has the potential to raise the living standard for tens of millions of people. Critics, however, say that additional spending power would just pour more gasoline on the inflationary fire in an economy where businesses are already struggling to keep up with consumer demand.   Inflation remains near its highest rate in 40 years and the Federal Reserve is moving to aggressively raise interest rates in hopes of bringing prices back under control.Not all economists believe the debt forgiveness will do much to fuel inflation.Debt forgiveness is not like the $1,200 relief checks the government sent out last year, which some experts say added to inflationary pressure. Borrowers won&#x27;t suddenly have $20,000 deposited in their bank accounts. Instead, they&#x27;ll be relieved of making loan payments over many years. President Biden announces student loan relief in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, D.C. on Aug. 24.Olivier Douliery/AFP via Getty ImagesBecause the relief is dribbled out slowly, Ali Bustamante, who&#x27;s with left-leaning Roosevelt Institute says Biden&#x27;s move won&#x27;t move the needle on inflation very much. &quot;It&#x27;s just really a drop in the bucket when it come to just the massive level of consumer spending in our very service- and consumer-driven economy,&quot; he says. The White House also notes that borrowers who still have outstanding student debt will have to start making payments again next year.  Those payments have been on hold throughout the pandemic.  Restarting them will take money out of borrower&#x27;s pockets, offsetting some of the additional spending power that comes from loan forgiveness.Helping lower income Americans or a sop to the rich?Another big point of contention has to do with fairness.Forgiving loans would would effectively transfer hundreds of billions of dollars in debt from individuals and families to the federal government, and ultimately, the taxpayers.  Some believe that transfer effectively penalizes people who scrimped and saved to pay for college, as well as the majority of Americans who don&#x27;t go to college.They might not mind subsidizing a newly minted social worker, making $25,000 a year.  But they might bristle at underwriting debt relief for a business school graduate who&#x27;s about to go to Wall Street and earn six figures.  Students from George Washington University wear their graduation gowns outside of the White House in Washington, D.C, on May 18. Economists worry President Biden&#x27;s plan to forgive student loans could encourage more people to take on debt in the hopes of also being forgiven.Stefani Reynolds/AFP via Getty ImagesThe White House estimates 90% of the debt relief would go to people making under $75,000 a year.  Lower-income borrowers who qualified for Pell Grants in college are eligible for twice as much debt forgiveness as other borrowers.But individuals making as much as $125,000 and couples making up to $250,000 are eligible for some debt forgiveness. Subsidizing college for those upper-income borrowers might rub people the wrong way.   &quot;I still think a lot of this benefit is going to go to doctors, lawyers, MBAs, other graduates that have very high earnings potential and may even have very high earnings this year already,&quot; says Marc Goldwein senior policy director at the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Helping those in need or making college tuition worse?Goldwein also complains that the loan forgiveness doesn&#x27;t address the larger problem of soaring college tuition costs. In fact, he suggests, it might make that problem worse — like a Band-Aid that masks a more serious infection underneath. For years, the cost of college education has risen much faster than inflation, which is one reason student debt has exploded. By forgiving some of that debt, the government will provide relief to current and former students. But Goldwein says the government might encourage future students to take on even more debt, while doing little to instill cost discipline at schools. &quot;People are going to assume there&#x27;s a likelihood that debt is canceled again and again,&quot; Goldwein says. &quot;And if you assume there&#x27;s a likelihood it&#x27;s canceled, you&#x27;re going to be more likely to take out more debt up front. That&#x27;s going to give colleges more pricing power to raise tuition without pressure and to offer more low-value degrees.&quot; \nThe old rule in economics is when the government subsidizes something, you tend to get more of it.  And that includes high tuition and college debt.\nCopyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "A little over a month after signing a minor league deal with the Blue Jays, right-hander Vinny Nittoli now plans to opt out of that deal, FanSided&#8217;s Robert Murray tweets.  Nittoli will hit the free agent market again, and could join his fifth different organization in just over a year&#8217;s time.\nA 25th-round pick for the Mariners in 2014, Nittoli has already bounced around several times in his career &#8212; this is his second stint with the Blue Jays, and he also has two separate stints with Seattle.  It was with the Mariners in 2021 that Nittoli made his MLB debut, tossing a single inning of work on June 23, 2021.  After the M&#8217;s released him last August, Nittoli has since signed minor league deals with the Twins, Yankees, and Blue Jays, with Nittoli also opting out of his pact with New York.\nAmidst all this movement, the 31-year-old has had a solid season at the Triple-A level, with a 3.30 ERA over 46 1/3 combined innings for the Yankees&#8217; and Jays&#8217; affiliates.  Nittoli also has a 32.06% strikeout rate and 7.61% walk rate, but despite these numbers, it appears as though he wasn&#8217;t on the radar of either AL East team for an in-season promotion.",

        "description": "President Joe Biden's forgiveness of some federal student loan debt was neither unfair nor unsound, Democratic National Committee senior adviser Cedric Richmond said Sunday. Speaking on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Richmond said, \"This country is not a zero-sum game where somebody has to fail for others to succeed, and so we have historic tax credits, we have business tax credits to help those who own businesses, and not everyone in America owns a business, but we help business owners because we want to promote it.\" He added later: \"America is a country about the common good.\" Richmond, who previously served as a congressman from Louisiana and in the Biden White House, addressed criticism of Biden's move last week to forgive up to $10,000 of student loan debt (up to $20,000 for recipients of Pell Grants), subject to income restrictions.  Biden also extended a moratorium on payments, but said they will restart at the beginning of 2023. “It’s time for the payments to resume,” the president said.  Biden's education policies, Richmond said, would help \"working-class people.\" \"What the president is saying for those people who fight and search and go gain an education, that we are going to help you, because education is the best way out of poverty,\" Richmond said. \"And you shouldn't be saddled with that debt.\"   Speaking to host Jennifer Griffin, Richmond pushed back on attacks from conservatives — and even some Democrats — who said the policy unfairly benefits a select group of people. Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) tweeted: \"Why should a machinist in Ohio pay for the student loans of a jobless philosophy major in Los Angeles?\" Richmond countered that characterization. \"We have business deductions everywhere and all day long,\" he said. \"We just gave, in 2017, $2 trillion to the top 1 percent and businesses — 99 percent of the country did not benefit from the 2017 $2 trillion tax cut. People all across the country are going to benefit from this debt relief. And so look, we are not picking winners and losers.\" Richmond also said the loan forgiveness program would stand up to challenges in court. \"Yes it will hold up in court, just like the 2020 election, which the president won by over 7 million votes,\" he said.",

        "description": "A sacred Mexican rock unites four people over 200 years in Hope’s thoughtful, ambitious fourth novelAnna Hope’s fourth novel may begin in the cramped, sweaty confines of a van making its way through Mexico but its narrative sweep is capacious, straddling the experiences of a quartet of very different characters over more than200 years. It has ambition to match, musing on freedom and reciprocity, on the redemptive power of storytelling and the sustaining force of ritual. Climate anxiety features prominently, too, though it’s through the rock of its title that Hope strives to bind the book together.According to Wixárika legend, the rock was the first solid object born on Earth. Or as Hope would have it: “Here was the place that formlessness first fell in love with form.” Located a few hundred metres off the coast of a sleepy-seeming backwater called San Blas, it remains a place of pilgrimage and its sacred potency has combined with strategic importance to provide an arresting, haunted history.The White Rock by Anna Hope is published by Fig Tree (£14.99).

The west London three-storey Victorian home of the former fashion director of British Vogue – now founder of both the online shopping platform Collagerie and the fashion and homeware label Colville – is a deliciously love-worn colour fest. Joyful without being wacky, layered with pattern and textural contrast, it’s a delight – unless you’re a minimalist.I’m not, but even I start to feel anxious while attempting to record the highlights. I’ve barely noted the ornate fountain in the front garden when I’m distracted by… well, everything: the front door’s floral curtain cinched with a knot of pom-poms; a Moroccan chandelier; the impressive gallery of photography creeping like smoke up the stairs; a glimpse of a white-painted veranda, festooned with hanging lanterns and a glitter ball, the tangled green garden beyond.

        "description": "(Warner)Orbit’s glory years may be behind him, but the one-time superproducer’s latest album still offers smooth, ambient grandeurIt’s good to have William Orbit back. After a brief and unrewarding dabble with drug addiction, the veteran English musician had a comeback of sorts with 2021’s patchy Starbeam EP, but The Painter is a more satisfying return. Orbit’s definitive work is surely All Saints’ Pure Shores, where sleek, subliminal layers of electronic effects add depth and wonder to its gorgeous melodies. While there’s no sign of Orbit resuming that imperial phase when he was first-pick producer for Madonna and U2, his distinctively ambient-classical take on dance-pop proves surprisingly durable.Longtime collaborators Katie Melua and Beth Orton seem almost smothered by his efforts here, but there’s a gentle grandeur to first single Colours Colliding, with Polly Scattergood giving it her best Björk among some lovely strings and piano. It would be nice to have more dancefloor-friendly beats, like the Despacito dancehall kick powering Nuestra Situación, but there aren’t many artists who could create Heshima kwa Hukwe, a tribute to departed Tanzanian singer Hukwe Zawose without seeming grimly exploitative. Like the album as a whole, it’s slightly overlong and unnecessarily repetitive, but clearly made with great care and affection. Continue reading...",

Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said on Sunday that the Biden administration's plan to forgive some student loans is “monumentally unfair” to people who didn’t attend college or have already paid back their debt and therefore wouldn't benefit.\n\n\n\nDuring an appearance on ABC’s “This Week,” Blunt told anchor George Stephanopoulos that while \"education is important\" the loan forgiveness plan is \"just bad economics.\"\n\n\n\n“It should impact the way people live their lives. I just thought it was monumentally unfair, unfair to people who didn't go to college because they didn't think they could afford it, unfair to people who pay their loans back, unfair to people who got higher education in an area that the government didn't make loans, and just bad economics,” Blunt told Stephanopoulos.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In addition to that, I think it's going to have a long term devastating effect on a student loan program that worked pretty effectively until about 10 years ago when the federal government assumed responsibility for that program,” Blunt added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Biden announced on Wednesday an initiative to forgive up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers who make less than $125,000 annually as well as $20,000 in forgiveness for borrowers who are Pell Grants recipients.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBlunt added that the forgiveness wouldn't benefit an already complicated economy. \n\n\n\n“You don't slow the economy down by forgiving debt and giving people another $24 billion to spend that they would have been spending paying off the student debt that they borrowed,” Blunt said.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Correction: An earlier version of this report incorrectly identified the host of Sunday's \"State of the Union\" program.\n\n\n\nSen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Sunday said the next step is to tackle the cost of college after President Biden announced that he will forgive some student loan debt for millions of Americans.\n\n\n\nWhile she praised Biden's decision to cancel up to $20,000 in student loan debt for some borrowers, Warren told CNN's \"State of the Union\" anchor Dana Bash that universities and public education have widespread problems that must be addressed.\n\n\n\n\"We have a lot of problems in the whole system. The president has done what he can do with the tool in front of him. And that is he's helped relieve the debt burden for millions of Americans,\" Warren said, adding that \"we need to deal directly with the cost of college. Absolutely.\"\n\n\n\nBiden announced last week he would cancel up to $10,000 in student loan debt for borrowers who make under $125,000 a year and up to $20,000 for borrowers who were Pell Grant recipients. The long-awaited move was hailed by Democrats and progressives.\n\n\n\nStill, many have turned to the question of what comes next, considering the next generation of students will face the same high tuition costs.\n\n\n\nWarren on Sunday noted that Democrats have several bills on the table that would address the rising cost to attend college, including one she has sponsored focusing on more transparency around pricing.\n\n\n\nWarren, who has long pushed for student loan debt cancellation, told CNN that when she was in college, she paid her entire way through the university as a part-time waitress, before becoming a special education teacher and opening a \"million doors\" of opportunities.\n\n\n\n\"That opportunity is not out there today for any of our kids,\" she said. \"Our public education system is no longer creating opportunities for kids like me and other families who can't afford to write a check.\n\n\n\n\"Instead, we're saying to these young people you got to get an education, but we are going to wrap the chains of debt around you,\" she continued. \"For many, you're going to be paying it for decades into the future.\"\n\n\n\n--Updated at 10:24 a.m.",

        "description": "Fifty years after the last humans walked on the moon, humankind has started to go back to Earth’s nearest neighbor. After all the false starts, the political wrangling, the technological difficulties and the bureaucratic ineptitude that has accompanied the effort, NASA’s Artemis 1 mission will launch as soon as Monday, Aug. 29.\n\n\n\nThe Artemis program has taken the efforts of many engineers, managers and politicians over the past several years to make the dream a reality. The latest return to the moon effort has been as much a product of backroom dealing and political compromise as it has been engineers refining designs and managers trying to control costs.\n\n\n\nThe NASA Space Launch System, which will hurtle the uncrewed Orion capsule on a multiweek mission around the moon, resulted from a&nbsp;“Faustian bargain,”&nbsp;as former Deputy NASA Administrator Lori Garver put it. The deal took place in the wake of&nbsp;President Barack Obama’s cancelation&nbsp;of the previous return to the moon, Project Constellation. In return for Congress swallowing that cancelation and the start of the Commercial Crew effort, NASA agreed to build the giant, Space Launch System using engines and other parts left over from the space shuttle.\n\n\n\nTheoretically, using proven hardware would keep costs low. The reality turned&nbsp;out to be different. The Space Launch System is years behind schedule and billions over budget. One launch will cost an eyepopping $4.1 billion, although NASA hopes to reduce that amount to some extent. Ironically, one of the senators involved in the deal, Bill Nelson, is now NASA administrator and thus has the task of making the heavy-lift rocket work.\n\n\n\nLeaving aside that we are going back to the moon in the most expensive, hardest way possible — we are, in fact, returning to the moon, an event that will affect the course of history in ways that are beyond evaluation. Artemis will recapture the lost promise of Apollo. The program will help to make humanity a multi-planet species, with all that implies to the&nbsp;acquisition of knowledge,&nbsp;wealth and&nbsp;soft political power.\n\n\n\nArtemis 1 will not carry astronauts to the moon, but the mission will test technologies that will be important for future crewed missions. One such technology is&nbsp;a version of Amazon Alexa, a virtual assistant technology, &nbsp;that will report on the status of the Orion spacecraft’s systems and allow astronauts to control the spacecraft with voice commands.\n\n\n\nThe mission will also test an&nbsp;anti-radiation vest&nbsp;designed by Israeli and German engineers. A mannikin designed to simulate the female body called Zohar will wear the vest along with radiation sensors to test how the device shields against space radiation. Another mannikin, dubbed Helga, will not be equipped with the vest and will serve as a control.\n\n\n\nA third mannikin, dubbed “Commander Moonikin Campos,” will wear an orange Orion spacesuit. Campos will come equipped with a number of sensors designed to measure things like radiation and vibration that will be experienced by future astronauts.\n\n\n\nArtemis 1 is also carrying 10 CubeSats as secondary payloads. Among the more interesting ones are:\n\n\n\nLunar IceCube, designed to study water distribution and interaction on the moon.NEA Scout, which will use a solar sail to perform a flyby of a small, Earth-approaching asteroid.OMOTENASHI, which will attempt a semi-hard landing on the lunar surface to test the technology for cheap, small landers.\n\n\n\nThe CubeSats will be released shortly after the Orion performs a translunar injection maneuver.\n\n\n\nThe future of humanity’s return to the moon depends on the success or failure of the Artemis 1 mission. If Artemis 1 launches, completes its mission and then splashes down off the coast of California, much criticism of the expense and complexity of the Space Launch System will likely fade away.\n\n\n\nHowever, if the mission ends in failure, and uncounted ways exist for it to fail, critics will raise questions. The date of the first footprints on the moon will be pushed back while engineers search for what went wrong and how to correct it. People who are opposed to going back to the moon at all will be emboldened.\n\n\n\nCurrently, NASA has scheduled Artemis 2, which will take four astronauts around the moon, for 2024. If Artemis 2 succeeds, one to two years after, human beings will walk on the moon. The event will be fraught with beauty and glory, two things this world needs more of.\n\n\n\nMark&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Whittington&nbsp;is the author&nbsp;of&nbsp;space exploration&nbsp;studies&nbsp;“Why is It So Hard to Go Back to the Moon?”&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;“The Moon, Mars and Beyond,”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“Why is America Going Back to the Moon?”&nbsp;He blogs at&nbsp;Curmudgeons Corner.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren expressed clear concern Sunday about the Federal Reserve's push to counter inflation on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" “What's worse than high prices and a strong economy is high prices and millions of people out of work,\" Warren said to host Dana Bash. \"I'm very worried that the Fed is going to tip the economy into recession.\"  Warren was responding to a statement from Jerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, who said this week that the Fed would take forceful actions on inflation — including by raising interest rates. Inflation has spiked in recent months, though price increases have slowed as energy prices have started to come down. In a speech Friday, Powell said these measures could cause \"some pain\" to households and businesses.  \"What he calls 'some pain' means putting people out of work, shutting down small businesses, because the cost of money goes up, because the interest rates go up,\" Warren said in her response.  Powell's plan does not address what Warren labeled as the root causes of inflation, including the ongoing impacts of Covid, supply chain issues and the war in Ukraine.  \"There is nothing in raising the interest rates, nothing in Jerome Powell's tool bag, that deals directly with those. And he has admitted as much in Congressional hearings,\" the Massachusetts Democrat said.  Powell's brief speech at the Fed's annual conference Friday was highly anticipated; he suggested at the same gathering last year that inflation would be temporary.  His reappointment split progressives at the beginning of President Joe Biden's administration.",

Machynlleth can claim to have been the ancient capital of Wales and, such was the calibre of this particular evening, the town certainly felt like a cultural capital.Leonskaja’s opening gesture was an indication of her seriousness of purpose, lifting the redundant music desk away from the instrument, placing it on the floor, disdaining the flutter of amused applause and, without further ado, launching into the E major sonata Op 109, immediately capturing its idiosyncratic balance between light pastoral flow and slow declamatory passion. The minor mode Prestissimo was almost martial in its fierceness, the perfect foil for the warm serenity of the theme and variations finale, albeit laced with fugal feist. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Walter Leporati/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Mets retiring Willie Mays’s number 24 is long overdue, and it about much more than 1972 and 1973.  The Mets, surprising virtually everyone in attendance and watching on television, announced that Willie Mays’s iconic number 24 will never be worn by a New York Met—and in essence, any New York National League team—again.\nWithout proper context, it is easy to question Mays getting his number retired by the Mets; after all, he only played 135 of his ,2992 Major League games in a Mets uniform. However, the number retirement has nearly nothing to do with those games. With a productive 1972 campaign and how instrumental he was throughout the 1973 playoffs, Mays helped the Mets reach their second World Series in his final season, though they came up short, losing in seven games to the Oakland Athletics. It is about something much deeper than that.\nMays played six years in New York, winning an MVP award and a World Series trophy in 1954, before following the Giants as they left New York City and the Polo Grounds for San Francisco, where he spent the overwhelming majority of his career. While the move from the East Coast to the West was heartbreaking for fans, their love for players like Mays would never waver. When Mets owner Joan Payson—who, which in completely unsurprising fashion, was a Giants fan and shareholder—made it so Mays would end his career where it started, in New York on a National League ballclub, he was a beloved fan favorite here yet again.\nA legend in the city and the game of baseball had returned home.\nWhile the Mets do not, and will not ever, share any records with the Brooklyn Dodgers and the New York Giants, they arguably share something much deeper: a heart and a soul. The Mets were birthed solely to replace those two teams leaving New York for California, and along the way picked up two fanbases that were desperate for baseball—with the Yankees, of course, never being an option for their fandom. They wear blue to honor the Dodgers, and orange to honor the Giants. The NY on the Mets cap is virtually identical to that of the New York Giants. Their first home stadium was the Polo Grounds. Their current home stadium, Citi Field, is an ode to Ebbets Field. The Mets are direct and spiritual decedents of the New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers, with the trio intrinsically intertwined.\nNational League baseball in New York is storied, albeit in a unique way. The Dodgers and Giants were titans of the National League, with the Giants winning 17 pennants and 5 World Series, and the Dodgers winning 12 pennants and one lone World Series in 1955 during their time in the city. The Dodgers signed Jackie Robinson, breaking the color barrier in baseball, arguably the most important moment in the history of the sport. While the Los Angeles Dodgers and San Francisco Giants do celebrate these achievements, there is little emotional connection between them — with the way the two franchises left, and the hurt that caused, it is a slippery slope. The Mets, under the guidance of Payson, brought those who were left behind by those two clubs back into the sport with the Mets — without those clubs the Mets would have nowhere to grow. While the Mets have an up and down history of their own, their miracle run in 1969 and dominance in 1986 are perfect additions to National League baseball in New York, and makes the three teams unique and storied history all the more. The Giants and Dodgers fans of old shed their fandoms to combine into one, making the adoring Mets faithful we are all apart of today.\nUnder the Wilpons, the Mets struggled to honor their own history, which is something that is rightfully being changed by Steve Cohen; first with the Tom Seaver statue and now with Old Timer’s Day, which was a rousing success. However, the Mets and their fans would be remiss to forget about National League baseball in New York before they existed. The chapters those New York Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers teams wrote are prologues to the story the Mets have written since 1962.\nThe Mets have a history of their own worth celebrating, as we saw multiple times this year. While they will not, and should not, share any official records with the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants, they share an emotional bond that should never be broken. With Jackie Robinson’s number rightfully retired league wide, and Willie Mays’s 24 being retired in Queens, no National League player in New York will ever wear 42 or 24 again—as it should be.",

        "description": "With Pupper West Side, our popular dog-centric column due to return on Tuesday, September 6, reader Victoria Cumings professed her love for Pupper, but wondered if felines could also be featured. &#8220;How about a similar column on cats called West Side Mews?&#8221;  she wrote. &#8220;Here is a test piece.&#8221;\nLet us know what you think in the comments.\nMuffy &amp; Bialy – The Odd Couple\nBy Victoria Cumings\nMuffy.\nBialy.\nWith personalities as different as their looks, Muffy and Bialy took some time to get acquainted in their Upper West Side apartment. Initial introductions didn’t go well due to Bialy not being happy at all that the home she’d been brought to was already occupied by another kitty. But in time, with the help of some calming spray, much coaxing, and a feline therapist, the two now live peacefully together on West 98th street, spending most days sleeping by a window, watching pigeons, clambering in and out of delivery boxes, and pestering their mom for treats.\nBoth rescues, Muffy is a spritely 8 year old, with long, thick, beautiful fur. She has some characteristics similar to a Siberian, which may explain why she loves to lie on cool tiles and sit in her condo by the air-con. Bialy, on the other hand, warms her back in the sun, and will leave the room if it’s anything under 78 degrees. At 6, she’s the younger kitty, but clearly the boss, pawing snacks away from under Muffy’s nose and sprawling on the coffee table where she can be the center of attention. She loves having her velvety gray tuxedo coat brushed, whereas Muffy prefers to groom herself, doing a very good job despite having multiple layers of fluff!\nAs for their names, Muffy is short for Miss Muffet, after the nursery rhyme about a child scared by a spider. Quite fitting, as Muffy is skittish and gets spooked easily. When she’s eating, the house rule is no noise can be made in the kitchen, as even the opening of a drawer could disrupt her meal. Bialy, on the other hand, is as tough as a doughy roll and afraid of nothing. One could pop a paper bag behind her head and she wouldn’t bat a cat eyelid.\nThat’s not to say Muffy and Bialy don’t have any common traits. Both kitties share a love of crunchy nibbles, their ‘bee on a wire’ floaty toy, and venturing into the elevator landing &#8211; under close supervision &#8211; to have a scratch on neighbors’ doormats (shhh!).\nTwo little girls enjoying life on the UWS . . .",

        "description": "Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday lamented conservative criticism of President Joe Biden's plan for student debt forgiveness. \"I know it is shocking, George, to some Republicans that the government actually, on occasion, do something to benefit working families and low-income people,\" Sanders said to host George Stephanopoulos on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"I don't hear any of these Republicans squawking when we give massive tax breaks to billionaires.\" Asked whether the debt relief was fair to people who had paid off loans or who didn't go to college, Sanders acknowledged that “in a sense, that criticism is correct.\"  But, he continued, \"The answer is not to deny help to people who cannot deal with these horrendous student debts ... The answer is that maybe, just maybe, we want to have a government that works for all working people and not just the people on top.” Biden announced this week that his administration would relieve up to $10,000 of student loan debt for borrowers making up to $125,000 annually, and up to $20,000 for people who had received Pell grants.  Less enthusiastic about the debt relief Sunday was Rep. Tim Ryan, who appeared on CNN's \"State of the Union.\" Ryan is the Democratic nominee for Ohio's open Senate seat.  \"I understand the burden of it. My wife and I are still paying her student loans off. But there are a lot of people hurting in our society right now,\" including many who didn't attend college, Ryan said.  Instead, he proposed a broader tax cut, renegotiating loan interest rates or incorporating relief into a larger package.  \"This direct, targeted thing, I don't think, is sending the right message,\" Ryan said.  The move fulfilled a campaign promise, though Biden had previously expressed skepticism about canceling large amounts of debt.  Sanders, for his part, ran on a plan to cancel nearly all student debt when he campaigned for president in 2020. He has also long supported making public universities free, as well as expanding financial aid.",

        "description": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) said on Sunday that he believes the Democrats have a “reasonable chance” to retain control of the upper chamber in the midterm elections. \n\n\n\nDuring an appearance on ABC’s “This Week,” moderator George Stephanopoulos noted the legislative victories the Democrats have had over the summer, including the signing of the Inflation Reduction Act earlier this month. \n\n\n\n“I think there is a reasonable chance that Democrats will retain control over the Senate,\" Sanders told Stephanopoulos.   \n\n\n\n\"I certainly hope we get more than 50 in the Senate that we got at least 52 so we can start going forward and protecting working people in a way we have not been able to do up to now,” he added.\n\n\n\nSanders said issues including abortion rights may drive voters to support Democrats in November. \n\n\n\nHis comments come after the Supreme Court earlier this year struck down Roe v. Wade, which gave the constitutional right to abortion to women, leading the way for multiple GOP-led states to implement their own abortion bans and restrictions on the matter. \n\n\n\n“I think that the American people are saying, 'Excuse me, in America in the year 2022 women will make that decision,' ” Sanders told Stephanopoulos “And I think that decision is going to reverberate very poorly for Republicans who think that women do not have a right to control their own bodies.”\n\n\n\nVice President Harris has cast multiple tiebreaking votes in the Senate, which is now evenly split between Democrats and Republicans.",

        "description": "In March of 2019, I wrote a piece for The Hill on why 2020 might just be Joe Biden’s time. At that point — early in the primary season — many had written him off. Now, as we approach the 2022 elections and polls and pundits are once again writing off Joe Biden, my advice is ­— be careful, be very careful.\n\n\n\nHere are 10 reasons why, once again, I urge the chattering class not to count Biden out, should he decide to run.\n\n\n\nReason #1: Low presidential poll numbers in the off year are notoriously unreliable predictors. Just look at 1982, 1994, 2010. Here is the headline from the New York Times from August 19, 1982: “Approval Rating for Reagan is Lowest Ever in Gallup Poll.” Reagan’s job approval rating was a dismal 41 percent — and yet two years later, Reagan carried 49 states against Walter Mondale.\n\n\n\nBill Clinton was in desperate shape in late August of 1994, when his popularity was at 39 percent. Democrats lost the House for the first time since the 1950s, shedding 54 seats, while losing eight Senate seats. In 1996, Clinton came back to defeat Bob Dole by nearly 10 points.\n\n\n\nIn August of 2010 this was the headline from Reuters: Obama Poll Slide Mirrors Reagan’s 1982 Midterm Woes. Obama’s job performance number stood at 43 percent, Democrats lost 64 House seats in 2010, and yet Obama dispatched Mitt Romney fairly easily, winning 332 electoral votes two years later.\n\n\n\nThus, projecting the outcome of the 2024 presidential election based on what we are seeing today is risky business indeed.\n\n\n\nReason #2: The likely Republican nominee is Donald Trump. Of course, we said he was the easiest to beat in 2016, but now we really mean it. Yet for Biden, who beat Trump once, he should be able to beat him twice. Trump’s negatives are still through the roof, legal troubles abound, his ego runs wild and now he will have Liz Cheney and others nipping at his heels. Plus, there is also the age factor; he is not much younger than Biden.\n\n\n\nReason #3: Critically important: the economy is improving, inflation is coming down, jobs are plentiful, and salaries are increasing, especially for low- and middle-income Americans. Consumer confidence is likely to rise, and — just as in the case of Reagan, Clinton and Obama — voters are likely to feel “they are better off” as we head into the presidential election year. As Democratic policies improve economic prospects for Hispanic and African American voters, their turnout and support will be crucial in key swing states.\n\n\n\nReason #4: Social issues begin to work for Democrats and Biden. Republicans will increasingly be on the defensive on abortion, gun control, LGBTQ rights, women’s rights. The fear of the far right will motivate and sway not only younger voters, but also many older Americans who can remember life before Roe, even life when interracial marriages were illegal (pre-1968) and when gay marriage was prohibited. Once again, the prospect of turning the clock back will not sit well with suburban and ex-urban voters either.\n\n\n\nReason #5: Biden’s advantage — Debates. Although it is possible that there will not be presidential debates, they do almost always happen. Trump is huffing and puffing, but it is hard to imagine that there will be an empty stage. First, Trump’s ego won’t allow it, and second, his advisors will convince him to agree. Biden will be increasingly confident and in control; Trump will be lucky to have read the morning papers. Watching FOX News won’t cut it. Trump has always been ignorant of policy issues, and this year will be no different. It will remind voters of what an empty suit Trump has always been.\n\n\n\nReason #6: Trump’s MAGA playlist is old and tired; Biden is getting things done. The comparison between Biden as solid, competent, delivering on his promises and Trump’s blowhard rhetoric will be clear and convincing. Who delivered on roads, bridges and broadband? Who brought us out of the pandemic? Who moved us forward on climate change? Who got the economy moving again? Not the carnival barker; rather, the experienced leader with an experienced team.\n\n\n\nReason #7: More and more and more legal troubles for Trump. After all, how many presidents plead the fifth over 400 times, with more to come? How many members of his clown-car legal team end up in courtrooms? How many investigations can they all endure? From personal taxes, to conflicts of interest, to shady pardons, to undermining national security and hoarding documents … the list goes on and on. And why would we think Trump is going to change in the next two years?\n\n\n\nReason #8: The Jan. 6 investigation is a serious problem. When the House Select Committee hearings began, many were not sure where it was headed and how long and in-depth it would be. This is like peeling back the onion. Trump looks worse and worse, and the far-right Republicans can’t ignore it or explain it away. When you have America’s generals opening up to reporters, more close White House aides telling the truth, and revelations taking all this to Trump’s door, it makes Watergate look like child’s play.\n\n\n\nReason #9: Watch the independents and some moderate/conservative Republicans. There is no question that most Americans are pretty locked in to their political preferences; however, there are clearly persuadable voters, less interested voters and those that move, especially with high turnout elections like we had in 2020. Winning by 7 million votes isn’t exactly chump change, and 2024 may see critical states where Biden increases his narrow lead because he gains support from independents and some Republicans who can’t force themselves to back Trump. And, in the case of Republicans, it won’t take that many!\n\n\n\nReason #10: Finally, there’s the spoiled child syndrome. Let’s face it: Throwing his lunch and ketchup against the wall, really? The constant tantrums? More and more people close to Trump admit they were forced to deal with a man-boy, with a toddler mentality, who constantly needs diversions, cajoling and convincing. Trump defiled the presidency. Do we want to go through all this again?\n\n\n\nThe contrast between a Joe Biden Presidency and a Donald Trump Presidency could not be more clear. A re-match between these two would bring that to full flood-light. Just like four years ago, don’t count Joe Biden out.\n\n\n\nPeter Fenn is a long-time Democratic political strategist who served on the Senate Intelligence Committee, was a top aide to Sen.

        "description": "Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) on Sunday said she is \"very worried\" that the Federal Reserve will \"tip this economy into a recession\" after Chairman Jerome Powell announced the bank would keep raising interest rates in an effort to combat inflation.\n\n\n\nWarren told CNN's \"State of the Union\" co-anchor Dana Bash that raising interest rates does not help alleviate problems with the economy caused by supply chain disruptions and exacerbated by the war in Ukraine. \n\n\n\n\"I am very worried about this,\" the senator said. \"There is nothing in raising the interest rates. Nothing in  Jerome Powell's toolbag that deals directly with those, and he has admitted as much in congressional hearings when I've asked him about it.\"\n\n\n\nDuring a keynote speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo., Powell said the Federal Reserve is focused on bringing inflation down and will keep raising interest rates in an effort to tame the 40-year high inflation rate.\n\n\n\nIn July, the Federal Reserve raised interest rates by 75 basis points following the same hike in June.\n\n\n\nLeading economists have expressed concern about the Fed's ability to lower inflation while not triggering a recession, with a majority in one survey expecting a recession sometime next year.\n\n\n\nWarren said that while inflation is high, the nation has seen strong job growth and low unemployment numbers. That could change amid more interest rate hikes, she said.\n\n\n\n\"Do you know what's worse than high prices and a strong economy?\" she asked Bash on CNN. \"It's high prices and millions of people out of work. I'm very worried that the Fed is going to tip this economy into recession.\"",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/tyler-duffey-to-opt-out-of-rangers-contract.html",
        "description": "Right-hander Tyler Duffey is opting out of his minor league contract with the Rangers, according to FanSided&#8217;s Robert Murray (Twitter link).  Duffey only joined the organization a little over two weeks ago, but is now exercising one of the several opt-out clauses that was reportedly part of the deal.\nDuffey has a 4.91 ERA over 44 innings with the Twins this season, with below-average walk and strikeout rates and a host of other unimpressive metrics.  This performance ended Duffey&#8217;s decade-long run in the organization, as Minnesota released him about a week prior to Duffey&#8217;s signing with Texas.\nThe Rangers will end up parting ways with Duffey at no cost, since they didn&#8217;t even have to pay the reliever a prorated minimum salary since Duffey didn&#8217;t reach the big leagues.  Duffey and the Twins avoided arbitration this past winter by agreeing to a $3.8MM salary for the 2022 season, so if Duffey does land elsewhere and make it back to a Major League roster, the Twins will still be responsible for the bulk of that remaining salary (with the new team only paying the prorated portion of a minimum salary).\nDuffey&#8217;s brief run at Triple-A Round Rock saw him pitch five scoreless innings over four appearances, though he did walk four batters in those five frames.  Control was once a strength for the righty, but Duffey&#8217;s walk rate has dipped considerably over the last two seasons.  Still, as uninspiring as Duffey&#8217;s 2022 performance has been, his quality work out of Minnesota&#8217;s bullpen in 2019-21 will likely convince another team to take a shot on another minors contract.  As for the Rangers, they might have been more apt to give MLB innings to younger relievers down the stretch, rather than devote a roster spot to a veteran who will be a free agent after the season.",

        "title": "Why a Google Pixelbook with Tensor chip makes sense",
        "link": "https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/opinion/google-pixelbook-with-tensor-chip-makes-sense/",
        "description": "Rumors of future Google Tensor chips made the rounds this week. According to Galaxy Club, Google is continuing to partner with Samsung on chip design and fabrication, now testing a 3rd gen Tensor processor. Google uses its own Tensor design in the latest Pixel phones and a Google Pixelbook with Tensor chip makes a ton of sense. \n\n\n\nHere&#8217;s why.\n\n\n\nThe market for a Google Pixelbook has changed\n\n\n\nFirst the Chromebook Pixel, then the Google Pixelbook and Pixelbook Go, were created for markets that didn&#8217;t exist at the time. Well, the Go may not completely fit that narrative, but I look at the Go as a continuation of the Pixelbook line. Back in 2013, you could either buy a slow, low-quality Chromebook or a slow, low-quality Chromebook. \n\n\n\nEnter the Chromebook Pixel with its cost of more than $1,000 and choice of fast Intel Core i3, i5, or i7 processors. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis model and subsequent follow-ups offered the same: High performance. You also got some of the best industrial design in a Chromebook, even to this day.\n\n\n\nBut it&#8217;s 2022 now. And Google&#8217;s hardware partners have stepped up with their own high-performing, and/or nicely designed and built Chromebooks. Just look at the HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook or the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 that I recently bought. The 12th gen Intel Core chipsets bring ultimate performance to ChromeOS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new Google Pixelbook doesn&#8217;t necessarily have to follow the same formula of the latest Intel processors, though. In fact, Apple has shown that you can design an ARM processor that outperforms a high-end Intel-powered device. So there&#8217;s an opportunity there for Google to do the same by extending the Tensor chip platform beyond Android devices. \n\n\n\nDesktop class performance with no fan and more battery life? Sign me up for a Google Pixelbook and Tensor chip that can do that.\n\n\n\nTensor and Android apps on a Google Pixelbook\n\n\n\nAlthough you can run Android apps on an Intel-based Chromebook, I&#8217;ve often found them to run better on non-Intel hardware. And I&#8217;m not the only one. Sure, Google has done great work getting Android app support on Chromebooks with an Intel processor. However, these apps are really optimized for ARM-based silicon.\n\n\n\nAnd that&#8217;s what a Google Pixelbook with Tensor chipset would bring: A better Android app experience on Chromebooks. Sure, there are still improvements needed that have nothing to do with hardware. Optimized app resizing and better use of the larger screen found on a Chromebook is still a gap when it comes to Android on ChromeOS. But offering the best possible Android app performance on Chromebooks is a win too.\n\n\n\nEconomies of scale for Tensor chips\n\n\n\nI don&#8217;t know how many Pixel phones Google sells and I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s far more than the number of Google-branded Chromebooks. However, by using the same Tensor chip in both the latest Pixel handset and a new Google Pixelbook, Google can cut its costs. By ordering more Tensor chip production, the cost per chip can be lowered. That could lead to a high-performing Pixelbook that doesn&#8217;t cost as much as prior models.\n\n\n\nAnd let&#8217;s face it: Google doesn&#8217;t order anywhere near as many chips, either for phones or Chromebooks, as Apple, Dell, HP, Lenovo, or Samsung. Yes, Samsung produces its own chips for its Galaxy phones, but the mobile division is completely different from the chip division.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat&#8217;s partly why any Pixelbook product costs you more than any similarly equipped Chromebook. Given its specifications, the Core i5 Pixelbook Go and its $849 starting price at the time is a perfect example of this.\n\n\n\nOther vendors in this space buy far more processors and get a much bigger break on the price for them. By leveraging the Tensor orders for its Pixel phones, Google can request more Tensor chips and put them in a Chromebook. Scaling up its orders is really the only way to cut production costs on silicon. Unless Google decides to strip features from the chip to lower the cost, that is. \n\n\n\nAnd best of all, using the same chipset for phones and Chromebooks lets Google manage its codebase more effectively. It doesn&#8217;t have to work with Intel or AMD to tweak software on either its phones or Chromebooks with Tensor inside the Pixels and a Google Pixelbook.\n\n\n\nWill we see a Google Pixelbook with Tensor out of Mountain View? I haven&#8217;t seen any evidence of that yet, although I do keep looking. I think it would make complete sense and make quite a few Pixelbook fans very happy though.\nThe post Why a Google Pixelbook with Tensor chip makes sense appeared first on About Chromebooks.",

        "description": "The civil rights campaigns of the 1950s and 60s changed America. It's hard to think of the nonviolent movement and its leader, Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr., in military terms. Yet that's exactly what Tom Ricks does in a very interesting book out this fall, “Waging a Good War: A Military History of the Civil Rights Movement, 1954-1968.”\n\n\n\n“There is a direct relationship between wars and struggles for civil rights,” Ricks writes in an advance copy of the book I read. My skepticism vanished.\n\n\n\nThis is Ricks seventh non-fiction book on the military themes. He is an acclaimed historian, after a distinguished reporting career at the Wall Street Journal and Washington Post. As the Journal's Washington bureau chief, I assigned Ricks to cover the Pentagon.\n\n\n\nFor all the obvious differences, Ricks convincingly establishes real parallels between successful wars and the militantly non-violent civil rights movement: the importance of strong leadership; meticulous planning and realistic goals; recognizing the strengths and weaknesses of both your own side and the enemy; learning from inevitable setbacks, and — above all — courage in the face of grave danger.\n\n\n\nA good starting point is a million black veterans returning from World War II. Ricks relates the story of Charles Dryden, a black fighter pilot returning to train new pilots at Walterboro Army Airfield in rural South Carolina. The German POWs at the camp were allowed to eat in the white section of the cafeteria; Dryden wasn’t.\n\n\n\nLeadership that inspires and is surrounded by talent is a sine qua non of military success — Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, Adm. Chester Nimitz, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower. “Eisenhower tried to focus on the absolutely essential while delegating to others the merely important,” Ricks notes.\n\n\n\nIf King was the four-star general of the civil rights movement, he was surrounded by a lot of three-stars: John Lewis, Ralph Abernathy, Andrew Young, Diane Nash, Bob Moses, Fannie Lou Hamer, James Bevel, James Lawson, Fred Shuttlesworth and others.\n\n\n\nWe read or remember the demonstrations, the marches, the eloquent speeches, the courage under attack. That was all made possible by meticulous training and discipline. “Passion and enthusiasm were no substitute for sound strategic planning,” Andy Young noted.\n\n\n\nOne of the few women leaders in the movement was Diane Nash, who according to Ricks personified Clausewitz’s dictum that the most important task of a commander is to understand the nature of the war in which one is engaged. Last month Nash was awarded the Medal of Freedom by President Biden.\n\n\n\nJohn Lewis is remembered for the beatings he endured in leading the Selma marchers across the Edmund Pettus Bridge. He also was a disciplined leader; witness the detailed specificity of his handbook of do’s and don’ts for young blacks sitting in at segregated Southern lunch counters.\n\n\n\nBefore the Freedom Summer hundreds, almost a thousand volunteers attended two-week training sessions in Oxford, Ohio; those not ready for the dangers of riding buses through Mississippi trying to register voters were weeded out. The Selma march was planned for months. The pictures and broadcasts of “Bloody Sunday” stirred the country and paved the way for congressional approval of the Voting Rights Act.\n\n\n\nLogistics are a key to military success. Ask the Russians, with their 40 miles of backed-up, fuel-starved tanks and food-deprived troops North of Kyiv in their invasion of Ukraine, or think of Hitler's ill-fated 1941 Russian invasion.\n\n\n\nThe logistical brilliance of the Civil Rights movement was on display in the 1963 March on Washington. It was opposed by some of the old-line Civil Rights leaders and the Kennedy administration, which feared chaos and violence. It was a remarkable success, highlighted by King’s “I have a Dream” speech, one of the most memorable of the 20th century.\n\n\n\nThat was possible because of the extraordinary assemblage of 2,000 buses, 21 trains and 10 aircraft bringing many of the 250,000 to Washington — and because of the orderly discipline and preparation on the mall. They all left without incident, and in a few hours the mall was cleared and clean.\n\n\n\nKing and the others made miscalculations, a failed campaign in Albany, Ga., and disastrous foray into Chicago. But they learned from these mistakes, always keeping their eyes on goal, the prize of equal rights. I hope our military leaders similarly learn from miscalculations in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nHaving read Ricks, I couldn’t help thinking that contemporary military leaders, like Gen. James Mattis and Adm. James Stavridis, are more impressive than their Vietnam-era predecessors. But, perhaps unfairly, it's hard to see a King or a Lewis or a Nash today.\n\n\n\nRicks, noting that Selma's Bloody Sunday was about voting rights for Blacks, worries now that America is in a “downward spiral,” with efforts to roll back voting rights. Then, recalling those courageous and bold leaders of a couple generations ago, he hopes it can be done again.\n\n\n\nAl Hunt is the former executive editor of Bloomberg News.

        "description": "Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) on Sunday said he supports a broader package of debt relief and a tax cut \"for all working people\" over the student loan forgiveness plan announced by President Biden.\n\n\n\nRyan, who is running for a U.S. Senate seat in Ohio, told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" that a \"targeted\" measure helping only those with student loan debt \"sends the wrong message\" since a lot of Americans are struggling.\n\n\n\n\"There's a lot of people out there making 30, 40 grand a year that didn't go to college. And they need help as well, which is why I've been proposing a tax cut for working people that will affect everybody,\" he said. \"With the student loan piece [in my proposal], you could very easily allow them to negotiate renegotiate down the interest rates.\"\n\n\n\nBiden announced last week he would forgive up to $10,000 in student loan debt for those who make under $125,000 a year and up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients. \n\n\n\nThe move was hailed by most Democrats who have long pushed for the relief after the cost of college has soared.\n\n\n\nRyan on Sunday agreed the cost of college is \"outrageous\" but pointed out the Biden administration has no plan to tackle rising costs, meaning another generation would also struggle with student loan debt if nothing is done to fix the system.\n\n\n\n\"One of the stupidest things we've ever done in this country is tell everybody they have to go to college. I mean, that was a huge mistake,\" Ryan told CNN. \"And so here we are, and we've done nothing to control the cost of college, right? So we're going to be in the same position here in five years.\"",

        "description": "Deaths from widespread flooding in Pakistan topped 1,000 since mid-June, officials said Sunday, as the country&#x27;s climate minister called the deadly monsoon season &quot;a serious climate catastrophe.&quot;Flash flooding from the heavy rains has washed away villages and crops as soldiers and rescue workers evacuated stranded residents to the safety of relief camps and provided food to thousands of displaced Pakistanis.Pakistan&#x27;s National Disaster Management Authority reported the death toll since the monsoon season began earlier than normal this year — in mid- June — reached 1,033 people after new fatalities were reported in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and southern Sindh provinces.Sherry Rehman, a Pakistani senator and the country&#x27;s top climate official, said in a video posted on Twitter that Pakistan is experiencing a &quot;serious climate catastrophe, one of the hardest in the decade.&quot;&quot;We are at the moment at the ground zero of the front line of extreme weather events, in an unrelenting cascade of heatwaves, forest fires, flash floods, multiple glacial lake outbursts, flood events and now the monster monsoon of the decade is wreaking non-stop havoc throughout the country,&quot; she said. The on-camera statement was retweeted by the country&#x27;s ambassador to the European Union.Flooding from the Swat River overnight affected northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, where tens of thousands of people — especially in the Charsadda and Nowshehra districts — have been evacuated from their homes to relief camps set up in government buildings. Many have also taken shelter on roadsides, said Kamran Bangash, a spokesperson for the provincial government.Bangash said some 180,000 people have been evacuated from Charsadda and 150,000 from Nowshehra district villages.Khaista Rehman, 55, no relation to the climate minister, took shelter with his wife and three children on the side of the Islamabad-Peshawar highway after his home in Charsadda was submerged overnight.&quot;Thank God we are safe now on this road quite high from the flooded area,&quot; he said. &quot;Our crops are gone and our home is destroyed but I am grateful to Allah that we are alive and I will restart life with my sons.&quot;The unprecedented monsoon season has affected all four of the country&#x27;s provinces. Nearly 300,000 homes have been destroyed, numerous roads rendered impassable and electricity outages have been widespread, affecting millions of people.People navigate through flooded roads after heavy monsoon rains, in Hyderabad, Pakistan, Wednesday, Aug. 24, 2022. (AP Photo/Pervez Masih)Pervez Masih/APPope Francis on Sunday said he wanted to assure his &quot;closeness to the populations of Pakistan struck by flooding of disastrous proportions.&#x27;&#x27; Speaking during a pilgrimage to the Italian town of L&#x27;Aquila, which was hit by a deadly earthquake in 2009, Francis said he was praying &quot;for the many victims, for the injured and the evacuated, and so that international solidarity will be prompt and generous.&quot;Rehman told Turkish news outlet TRT World that by the time the rains recede, &quot;we could well have one fourth or one third of Pakistan under water.&quot;&quot;This is something that is a global crisis and of course we will need better planning and sustainable development on the ground. ... We&#x27;ll need to have climate resilient crops as well as structures,&quot; she said.In May, Rehman told BBC Newshour that both the country&#x27;s north and south were witnessing extreme weather events because of rising temperatures. &quot;So in north actually just now we are ... experiencing what is known as glacial lake outburst floods which we have many of because Pakistan is home to the highest number of glaciers outside the polar region.&quot;The government has deployed soldiers to help civilian authorities in rescue and relief operations across the country. The Pakistani army also said in a statement it airlifted a 22 tourists trapped in a valley in the country&#x27;s north to safety.Prime Minister Shabaz Sharif visited flooding victims in city of Jafferabad in Baluchistan. He vowed the government would provide housing to all those who lost their homes.",

        "description": "NEW YORK &#8212; A mint condition Mickey Mantle baseball card sold for $12.6 million Sunday, blasting into the record books as the most ever paid for sports memorabilia in a market that has grown exponentially more lucrative in recent years.\nThe rare Mantle card eclipsed the record just posted a few months ago &#8212; $9.3 million for the jersey worn by Diego Maradona when he scored the contentious “Hand of God” goal in soccer’s 1986 World Cup.\nIt easily surpassed the $7.25 million for a century-old Honus Wagner baseball card recently sold in a private sale.\nAnd just last month, the heavyweight boxing belt reclaimed by Muhammad Ali during 1974’s “Rumble in the Jungle” sold for nearly $6.2 million.\nAll are part of a booming market for sports collectibles.\nPrices have risen not just for the rarest items, but also for pieces that might have been collecting dust in garages and attics. Many of those items make it onto consumer auction sites like eBay, while others are put up for bidding by auction houses.\nBecause of its near-perfect condition and its legendary subject, the Mantle card was destined to be a top seller, said Chris Ivy, the director of sports auctions at Heritage Auctions, which ran the bidding.\nSome saw collectibles as a hedge against inflation over the past couple years, he said, while others rekindled childhood passions.\nIvy said savvy investors saw inflation coming down the road &#8212; as it has. As a result, sports memorabilia became an alternative to traditional Wall Street investments or real estate — particularly among members of Generation X and older millennials.\n“There’s only so much Netflix and ‘Tiger King’ people could watch (during the pandemic). So, you know, they were getting back into hobbies, and clearly sports collecting was a part of that,” said Ivy, who noted an uptick in calls among potential sellers.\nRelated Articles\n\nMLB | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tGerman Marquez outduels Max Scherzer as Rockies beat Mets, 1-0\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nMLB | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; farm system rises up the rankings, providing hope for the future: &#8220;There is talent at every level&#8221;\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nMLB | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMets&#8217; Jacob deGrom dominates as Rockies fall to 18-40 on the road\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nMLB | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; 2023 schedule includes Yankees at Coors Field\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nMLB | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies lose Antonio Senzatela to knee injury vs. Cardinals; Charlie Blackmon&#8217;s leg injury not serious\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\nAdd to that interest from wealthy overseas collectors and you have a confluence of factors that made sports collectibles especially attractive, Ivy said.\n“We’ve kind of started seeing some growth and some rise in the prices that led to some media coverage. And I think it all it all just kind of built upon itself,” he said. “I would say the beginning of the pandemic really added gasoline to that fire.”\nBefore the pandemic, the sports memorabilia market was estimated at more than $5.4 billion, according to a 2018 Forbes interview with David Yoken, the founder of Collectable.com.\nBy 2021, that market had grown to $26 billion, according to the research firm Market Decipher, which predicts the market will grow astronomically to $227 billion within a decade &#8212; partly fueled by the rise of so-called NFTs, or non-fungible tokens, which are digital collectibles with unique data-encrypted fingerprints.\nSports cards have been especially in demand, as people spent more time at home and an opportunity arose to rummage through potential treasure troves of childhood memories, including old comic books and small stacks of bubble gum cards featuring marquee sports stars.\nThat lure of making money on something that might be sitting in one’s childhood basement has been irresistible, according to Stephen Fishler, founder of ComicConnect, who has watched the growing rise &#8212; and profitability — of collectibles being traded across auction houses.\n“In a nutshell, the world of modern sports cards has been going bonkers,” he said.\nThe Mantle baseball card dates from 1952 and is widely regarded as one of just a handful of the baseball legend in near-perfect condition.\nThe auction netted a handsome profit for Anthony Giordano, a New Jersey waste management entrepreneur who bought it for $50,000 at a New York City show in 1991.\n“As soon as it hit 10 million I just turned in. I couldn’t keep my eyes open anymore,” Giordano, 75, said Sunday morning. His sons monitored the auction for him. “They stayed up and called me this morning bright and early to tell me that it reached where it reached.”\nThe card was one of dozens of sports collectibles up for auction. In all, the items raked in some $28 million, according to Derek Grady, the executive vice president of sports auctions for Heritage Auctions.\n“Sports collectibles are finally getting their due as an investment,” Grady said. “The best sports items are now starting to rival artwork, rare coins and rare artifacts as a great investment vehicle.”\nThe switch-hitting Mantle was a Triple Crown winner in 1956, a three-time American League MVP and a seven-time World Series champion. The Hall of Famer died in 1995.\n“Some people might say it’s just a baseball card. Who cares? It’s just a Picasso. It’s just a Rembrandt to other people. It’s a thing of art for some people,” said John Holden, a professor in sports management law at Oklahoma State and amateur sports card collector.\nLike pieces of art that have no intrinsic value, he said, when it comes to sports cards, the worth is in the eye of the beholder &#8212; or the pocketbook of the potential bidder.\n“The value,” Holden said, “is whatever the market’s willing to support.”\n_____\nFollow Bobby Caina Calvan on Twitter at http://twitter.com/BobbyCalvan",

        "description": "&#8220;One who has dared to be gloriously good and gloriously bad in one life. No Limbo for her. Rather let life itself grow living monuments out of trees and living words so that death can never take from our half-lives this radiant living that was lived among us.&#8221;\n\nIn early September 1947, a year after she rewilded the landscape of literature with Goodnight Moon, Margaret Wise Brown (May 23, 1910&ndash;November 13, 1952) watched the love of her life fade to black.\nMichael Strange, born Blanche Oelrichs, had cast an instant spell on Margaret &#8212; outspoken, sophisticated, and self-possessed, so tall Margaret had to lift her grey-blue eyes to meet the black of Michael&#8217;s, her tall frame clad in masculine clothing she herself had designed to cling to her curves, with a musical voice unspooling from her haunting dark beauty, a deep velvet laugh, and a reputation for rarely keeping a promise. In her tight tweed pants and long-tailed blazers and oversized ties, she moved effortlessly through the sea of gloves and lace and whispering society ladies. \nWhen her wealthy family of Austrian royal lineage had found her erotic poetry embarrassing, Blanche had emancipated herself under the male nom de plume, which soon became a stage name as she strode into the theater world as playwright and actress, and eventually swelled into a total persona &#8212; the name with which she signed her letters, the name by which her intimates addressed her, the name of her self-image. \nMichael Strange and Margaret Wise Brown\nHE AND SHE\nby Margaret Wise Brown\nPut a he on a he\nOr a she on a she\nAnd it never adds up\nTo 1 2 3\nPut a he on a she\nOr a she on a he\nAnd before you can even say Jack Robinson\nYou’ve made 3\nHe times she divided by he\nThen take away she\nAnd now what have you left &#8212;\nA he or a she\nAnd what’s this strange geometry\nWithin the heart of you and me\nThis place apart\nThis secret heart\nWhen all is what\nIt seems to be\nIn her youth, Blanche had been named the most beautiful woman in Paris. Now, about to turn fifty-eight, Michael Strange was a ghost on a New York stage, her skin sallow, her body emaciated to the size of a child&#8217;s after refusing to let her aggressive leukemia keep her from performing.\nMargaret and Michael had met seven years earlier. One day on Vinalhaven &#8212; the Maine island where Margaret would spend much of her life and write most of her books &#8212; she had rowed to a lover&#8217;s cottage and found the luscious stranger sunbathing there with her lover. Soon, back in New York, she was surprised to receive a lunch invitation from Michael, who had shown up dressed in fur from head to toe, asking bold questions about her love life while sipping sherry. Margaret was thirty, Michael fifty and on her third unhappy marriage; her latest husband had never read her poetry. Both women were born in the wrong century, bent on bending it to their will; both were accidental radicals, just by living unselfconsciously; both had had affairs with Thomas Wolfe; both were at heart poets more than anything else. \nBy the middle of the World War, they were lovers; Michael had declared that she had never loved anyone the way she loved Margaret and never would; she had promised to love her until her dying day. \nfrom &#8220;THAT&#8217;S THE WAY THINGS ARE&#8221;\nby Margaret Wise Brown\nWhen first we met\nI never, never, never knew\nThat I was meeting you\nThen something hit me suddenly\nSudden as a shooting star\nI felt things beating 8 to the bar\nAnd that’s the way things are \n[&#8230;]\nYou may be wild, you may be witty\nAnd you can’t even drive a car\nI’ll never let you drive my car\nBut you’re my only girl and mighty pretty\nAnd that’s the way things are.\nArt by Leonard Weisgard from The Important Book by Margaret Wise Brown\nLate one night, Margaret&#8217;s phone rang. Michael&#8217;s voice poured in, sped up with alarm, imploring her to get into a taxi right away. Her husband had found out about their relationship and, in an era when the diagnostic manual of psychiatry classified same-sex love as a mental illness, was threatening to have her locked away in an asylum. A doctor was on his way to &#8220;diagnose&#8221; her. With her maid&#8217;s help, Michael managed to slip out through the back staircase and into the taxi as Margaret was pulling up. \nOn the disorienting ride through the New York nocturne, they weighed their options and decided to head to the high-society women&#8217;s club Michael frequented. There, she collected herself, phoned her husband to demand a formal apology, then set the wheels in motion for a legal separation. \nFrom this point on, Michael became &#8212; to use the modern term, hard-won and ahistorical &#8212; Margaret&#8217;s partner. Soon, they were living across the hallway from each other, in a pair of twin apartments on the East End, with Margaret part nominal tenant and part unnamed wife as she was quickly becoming one of the country&#8217;s most original and beloved children&#8217;s book authors. \nIt was a stormy love that pushed and pulled, but grafted itself onto Margaret&#8217;s being. Michael wrote adoring letters and criticized Margaret&#8217;s diction at dinner parties. She gave her a golden wishbone necklace and a ring, made her feel like she was too needy, and derided her children&#8217;s books as unsophisticated, &#8220;silly furry stories,&#8221; not Real Literature: an actress and socialite who had not published a poem in a decade and was feeling abandoned by her own muse, deriding one of the most vibrantly creative people of the past century &#8212; poet, songwriter, progressive education reformer, author of more than a hundred singularly wondrous books for the young, with which she would earn herself a little red house, a yellow convertible, and the love of millions of children; the author whom the visionary Ursula Nordstrom had no qualms calling her favorite author, despite also publishing Maurice Sendak, Shel Silverstein, and E.B. White. Even Michael&#8217;s pet name for Margaret was laced with this ambivalent mixture of affection and disdain: Bunny-no-good.\nArt by Leonard Weisgard from The Important Book by Margaret Wise Brown\nAnd yet nobody ever knows what electrifies the infinite sky between two people, what magnetizes them together, what roils deep beneath the faint surface trails left in letters and diaries and the recollections of bystanders, what animates the long days between the islanded moments crashed by emotion and frozen in time. Margaret loved Michael with unassailable devotion, not unlike the kind that marked Auden&#8217;s relationship with Chester Kallman and inspired his eternal poem &#8220;The More Loving One.&#8221; At every turn, even through the drama at Michael&#8217;s deathbed, Margaret remained the more loving one, true to her lifelong conviction that &#8220;you can never in this world love anyone you love enough.&#8221; \nSPEAK NOT OF LOVE\nby Margaret Wise Brown\nSpeak not of love\nWho only love would show\nThere is a greater bondage\nThat those who love might know\nBeyond the outward show\nSpeak not of love\nWho loves the mirrored I\nNor ask true lovers why\nThis mirrored love should die\nThere are hard paths where love can flow\nThat only pain in love can show\nQuiet places where they go\nThen speak of love\nAll those who know\nThroughout the turbulence, Margaret channeled the swell of feeling in poems and song lyrics. Decades after her own tragic death, they were published in the digital collection White Freesias; some, including previously unpublished fragments, were later included as chapter epigraphs in the altogether magnificent biography In the Great Green Room: The Brilliant and Bold Life of Margaret Wise Brown (public library) by Amy Gary, who has devoted her life to stewarding and reviving this remarkable woman&#8217;s legacy, bringing many of her out-of-print books back to life and publishing her previously unknown manuscripts. \nArt by Leonard Weisgard from The Important Book by Margaret Wise Brown\nMusic had always been Margaret&#8217;s salvation &#8212; it was only at the piano that her mother came alive from the depression that deadened her all through Margaret&#8217;s childhood &#8212; but poetry was her first and greatest love. As a girl, during two lonely years at a strict boarding school in Switzerland, she had entertained herself with memorizing poems by reciting them to her favorite music. It was her love of poetry that led her to persuade Gertrude Stein to compose her children&#8217;s book &#8212; in the simply-worded profundity and playful language puzzles of the literary titan, Margaret saw a natural resonance with children&#8217;s minds. Poetry came to permeate her own children&#8217;s books. It was the language of her mind &#8212; her art of noticing. In poetry &#8212; &#8220;this facile writing of verse&#8221; &#8212; she felt she could give voice to &#8220;the curse&#8221; of all she felt, inexpressible in any other way. \nNO POETRY\nby Margaret Wise Brown\nThere will be\nNo poetry in this heart\nOf you and me\nNo poetry\nNo winds crying in the trees\nNo wild crashing of the seas\nNo drowsy hum of summer bees\nAll these will pass with this\nUnreal war\nAnd they will not come back any\nAnymore\nFor a long time\nRot!\nThere will always be poetry\nIn this heat of you and me\nAlways the crashing of the seas\nAlways the murmur of the bees\nThat split second when we see\nWhat for us is poetry?\nBetween the rumble of the guns\nAs long as a split second come\nPoetry came pouring out of her throughout the war and throughout the private battlefield of her relationship with Michael &#8212; a relationship particularly inexpressible, partly for the social stigma and partly for its intrinsic complexities. It was on poetry she leaned when the specter of loss came to hover over that inexpressible totality as Michael&#8217;s leukemia progressed and her state of mind became even more erratic. \nWhen she collapsed during one of her performances and was given no more than a year to live, Michael leapt from the edge of reason, the way existential panic often leads the human animal to do, and turned to religion. She declared that their relationship was a sin and had caused her leukemia. She demanded that Michael move out of their apartments. Margaret pleaded with her, composed impassioned love letters reminding her of all that magnetized them together, promised to care for her throughout the illness. Michael insisted that their physical passion had syphoned her health and if they were to remain connected at all, it could only be as friends. She refused to see Margaret, further demoting their relationship to an epistolary one. \nMargaret was shattered with incomprehension. Her world seemed to have come undone, hollowed of its center. She contemplated suicide. (It is strange how, under the blinding beam of emotional intensity, we so easily mistake our tormentors for our muses.) Somehow, remembering Michael&#8217;s characteristic inconstancy, she grasped at the blind faith that she might change her mind. \nIN GREATER AMICUS\nby Margaret Wise Brown\n For having felt well loved by you\nFor having felt no shyness that you should watch my face\nFor the joyous meeting of eyes in laughter\nThe fling of your head\nAnd the dark bright look of you\nThe warm flowing laughter\nFrom a hundred hidden springs in other years\nAnd for the constant uncertainty\nOf when you would laugh\nMargaret Wise Brown with her beloved dog. (Photograph: Consuelo Kanaga. Brooklyn Museum.)\nOne Indian-summer day, walking in the cemetery where they had buried their dogs, Margaret picked up a marigold to press into a letter for Michael, then noticed a ripe yellow apple that had dropped to ground, blending into the constellation of marigolds in the yellowing grass. The image hurled her into a time machine, back to a day during that childhood loneliness in Switzerland, when her class was being marched down the lake shore on which the teenage Mary Shelley dreamt up Frankenstein. She heard an old French ballad that impressed itself upon her imagination: “The Time of the Cherries,” composed during the Parisian Commune Revolution of 1871, told the story of a young ambulance nurse shot during the revolt, her blood blooming through her white uniform, as red as the cherry juice that painted the streets of Paris in the cherished season of the cherries, forgotten during the bloody revolution. It was a song about the senselessness of death and how it drains the world of beauty, but how beauty persists when one chooses to turn toward it and rise above sorrow. The memory of the ballad blended with the intensity of her loss and became a lyric.\nWHEN THE CHERRIES ARE RED\nby Margaret Wise Brown\nWhen the time comes around\nWhen the cherries are red\nAnd the songs are all sung\nAnd the sweet words all said\nThen the cherries are red\nAnd the promise of spring\nIn that wild blooming tree\nAnd the wild birds that sing\nIn the wild cherry tree\nHas been realized\nAnd I am with you\nAnd you are with me\nAnd the cherries are ripe\nOn the red cherry tree\nBut the time will soon come\nWhen the cherries are gone\nAnd the end will have come\nTo our own gentle song\nWhen the cherries were red\nAnd I lie on the grass\nAnd leaves fall on my head\nAnd I dream of the time\nWhen the cherries were red\nOh there once was a time\nWhen the cherries were red\nWhen I was with you\nWhen the cherries were red\nAnd the words were all said\nMargaret&#8217;s loving letters seemed to only widen the rift. She saw no other way of remaining in Michael&#8217;s life than to acquiesce to the asexual relationship. She vowed to become less needy, less passionate, anything Michael wanted her to be. \nMichael responded with a terse telegram, informing Margaret that all she needed from her was total silence. She was dying, and she could not face it, so she could not face Margaret. \nTO A FRIEND DEPARTING IN TIME\nby Margaret Wise Brown\nCould I write before you go\nBut one verse\nWho loved you so\nBut one verse that you should know\nHow I loved you, ere you go\nI would write it in a rhyme\nThat would ring beyond our time\nThat would keep this moment clear\nFar beyond our little year\nBut this I cannot write, my dear\nSo I write before you go\nAll these words\nWho loved you so\nJust before Christmas, Michael summoned her last energies for the final stop on her tour &#8212; a performance at one of Broadways&#8217;s smallest theaters, with only five hundred seats. When Margaret learned that the tickets were not selling, she couldn&#8217;t bear the thought of Michael performing to a half-empty house on opening night, so she bought rows of empty seats and enlisted friends in attending. She left a vase of flowers in Michael&#8217;s dressing room, along with keys to the Connecticut house where she was staying, and a note of apology that winter had kept her from finding a permanent home to move out of their apartments into.\nMichael responded by messenger, thanking Margaret for the flowers and demanding that she stay away, or else her energy for the performance would be syphoned. She had her doctor call Margaret on her behalf to reiterate the admonition, then added the extortionist half-promise that if Margaret could comply with not contacting her, they might be able to have a relationship in the future.\nBut there was no future. When she took the stage in the theater filled by Margaret and vacant of her, Michael&#8217;s daughter &#8212; who had come to see Margaret as her closest ally with her turbulent mother &#8212; gasped in the front row at the sight of the ghostly childlike body on the stage: a skeleton in a Grecian gown, mortality incarnate in a spectacle of life. \nAfter the show, Michael seemed to vanish into thin air. Sick with worry, afraid to reach out directly less she violate Michael&#8217;s conditional promise, Margaret tried to find out where she had gone. Eventually, Michael&#8217;s daughter broke her mother&#8217;s vow to secrecy and told Margaret that she had gone to Switzerland for an experimental treatment of radiation, blood transfusions, and vitamin injections. \nMELANCHOLY\nby Margaret Wise Brown\nLet no melancholy thought be here\nMy happy untouched days with you\nLike flies in amber, crystal still\nAnd crystal clear\nNo tear can change, no distance jar\nAnd so my thoughts being gentle thoughts\nMust steal across the night to where you are\nArt by Clement Hurd from Goodnight Moon by Margaret Wise Brown, 1947.\nOn Valentine&#8217;s Day, as snow fell over Manhattan, Michael called. They began writing letters again, Margaret carefully calibrating just how much love she let herself express, burned by the cold months of silence, terrified of another rupture. She longed to visit Michael at the clinic before it was too late &#8212; a longing Michael must not have actively discouraged, for soon Margaret was crossing the ocean of sky and checking herself into a Swiss hotel. \nBut a letter from Michael already awaited her, reinstating her ban on contact &#8212; her doctor, she said, was ordering Margaret to stay away because their relationship was a source of stress and all stress ought to be eliminated if she was to achieve remission. \nCRACKED IS THE HEART\nby Margaret Wise Brown\nCracked is the heart that might\nHave loved full well\nFlattened the mind\nWhere bright thoughts soared\nFluttering heart that has lost its thump\nDivided into many parts, not whole\nAnd one small lifetime whizzing by\nAnd the time wasting, wasted.\nThe brain unfed by the halfhearted heart\nThat dies for lack of another’s\nWhile the face smiles on\nThe words flow on\nTo success or failure\nTime is gone.\nBy some superhuman feat of self-transcendence &#8212; which might just be the other name of love &#8212; Margaret, in all her devastation and majesty of spirit, responded that she would do anything for Michael, for her health and her happiness, even if that meant removing herself, erasing herself. \nShe lingered in Switzerland for another couple of days, hoping Michael would once again change her mind. When she didn&#8217;t, Margaret headed to Italy to visit an artist with whom she was working on another book. She was at the peak of her powers, her books having finally crested into the tipping point of popularity despite &#8212; or perhaps because of &#8212; their bold deviation from convention in the way they captured the poetic pulse-beat of children&#8217;s emotional reality. \nOn the train to Rome, a man pressed a rag of chloroform over her face. She awoke to find her purse, with all of her money and her documents, gone. But he had left her valuables &#8212; her manuscripts and journals. When she managed to return to America, she discovered that her former publisher &#8212; to whom she had brought some of the era&#8217;s greatest illustrators, and for whom she had secured Gertrude Stein&#8217;s children&#8217;s book &#8212; was not only taking credit for her ideas, now that they were finally being celebrated, but was suing her for future rights on unpublished manuscripts with other publishers. \nIn that strange way the mind has of compartmentalizing trauma, she might have been more perturbed by these violations were she not so wholly consumed by anticipatory loss as Michael wasted away. When the Swiss clinic failed to grant her remission, she returned to their twin apartments and gave herself over to Margaret&#8217;s care, leaning on the very instrument of survival she had once derided &#8212; Margaret&#8217;s &#8220;silly furry stories&#8221;: To lift her spirits, they began writing a collaborative series about two bunnies living together, Rabbit M.D. and Bunny-no-good. \nCOULD I TELL YOU THAT I LOVE YOU\nby Margaret Wise Brown\nCould I tell you that I love you\nAnd never say it so\nCould I show you that I love you\nWithout the out the outward show\nAnd then you smile\nBecause you know.\nMichael grew too ill to be at home and moved into a Boston hospital specializing in leukemia. Margaret went with her, renting a hotel suite across the street, spending every day and many nights at the hospital. When Michael could sit up at all, she was swallowed by the chair in her room, her lips cracked with blood. \nOne day, the doctor in charge of her case, who seemed uncomfortable with the couple&#8217;s closeness, pronounced that Michael was to have no more visitors &#8212; her only interaction was to be with hospital staff. Michael was too weak to speak, but she scrawled a protestation on a piece of paper she tried to hand to Margaret. The doctor snatched it away and threatened to send Michael to the psychiatric ward if she did not comply with his command. When Margaret begged him to give Michael something to help her sleep through the agony, he declared that the only thing keeping her awake was her &#8220;hysteria.&#8221;\nMargaret left, then returned with a bouquet of Michael&#8217;s favorite flowers &#8212; primrose. Too anxious to antagonize the despot in the white coat less he deliver on his threat, she sat in the hallway holding the flowers until nightfall, then handed them to the nurse they had befriended to leave by Michael&#8217;s bedside, and left. \nAn hour past midnight, Michael called, having regained her voice, panic-stricken that death was at her doorstep, beseeching Margaret to escort her through. When Margaret called the hospital to ask permission, she was denied. As daybreak neared, she was still struggling with what to do when the phone rang. One of the nurses urged her to come immediately &#8212; Michael was in mortal agony, the doctor had left without a prescription for pain relief, and it seemed like the time had come. \nTHINGS TO REMEMBER\nby Margaret Wise Brown\nRemember this\nAnd never forget:\nThe first spring snowdrop,\nAll green and wet and unexpected,\nA white flower blooming out of the dark\nNever forget it.\nRemember this\nAnd never forget it:\nThat the bees flew about you\nAnd the flowers bloomed\nIn the hot drowsy fields that smelled of summer\nAnd smelled of noon\nNever forget it.\nAnd remember this:\nThe lightning bug\nYou caught in your hand,\nAnd there was the light\nIn the palm of your hand And you held it.\nRemember this\nArt by Leonard Weisgard for The Quiet Noisy Book by Margaret Wise Brown\nMichael lived through the night. By morning, Margaret was sitting outside her door, heavied by the knowledge that Michael&#8217;s estranged son &#8212; the only one of her three adult children who would not die by their own hand &#8212; had refused to go see his mother. She could hear Michael crying for her through the door. The doctor barred her from entering. \nAn infinity later, the door opened. The nurse came out with the solemn permission to enter &#8212; Michael, she said, had died. But when Margaret rushed in to close Michael&#8217;s eyes, kissing them and taking her hand into hers, the hand squeezed back, vivified by the familiar touch of love. In these last moments together, Margaret promised to read Michael&#8217;s poetry each morning in the long loneliness to come. She told her that when she is gone, a part of her own soul would also go, but in another Michael would live on forever. \nTHE BROKEN POEM\nby Margaret Wise Brown\nFor you to go\nAnd leave this world\nSo much you loved this world\nThe world must grieve a lover\nThe shadows lose you as they pass\nUnloved across the swift green grass\nSorrow is green in the dark green tree\nThat you no longer see\nSong of solitary bird\nUnheard\nThe world must grieve a lover.\n\nWhen Michael died, obituaries described her as the former wife of her famous second husband. \nThe papers reported that her son had been at her deathbed. \nNo mention of Margaret was made. \nWHO DOES YOUR HEART RETURN TO\nby Margaret Wise Brown\nWho does your heart return to\nWho do you really love\nIn that blue hour of evening\nWho are thinking of\nWho does your wild young heart turn to\nIn those dark dreams of night\nWhose is the face before you\nWhen you turn out the light\nWho does your heart return to\nWho are you dreaming of\nIn the wild wastes of nowhere\nWho do you really love\nFor everyone lives in a life apart\nIn the warm dark silence\nOf his secret heart\nAnd everyone has a place to go\nIn the dusk of night\nWhen the lights burn low\nAfter her long bereavement, Margaret would fall in love again. By the time of her own untimely death &#8212; by medical misconduct in a Parisian hospital after a minor operation, buried under her chosen epigraph: &#8220;Writer of Songs of Nonsense&#8221; &#8212; she was engaged to be married. But it was a different sort of love, more a lullaby than a ballad, comfortable in its simple ease, free from the uneven passions that roiled between her and Michael &#8212; those syncopations that fed Margaret&#8217;s spirit and pen in ways no one, not even she, could understand. \nWhile Michael was dying and Margaret was considering writing a biography of their shared life, she had written in her diary:\nWhat is there to tell beyond the endearing humanity of one on a scale more intense and larger than others? And the significance &#8212; aliveness and honesty in their own years&#8230; All the long-range back and forth in the shuffle and shuttle of being alive. And the preservation of a few of the heights in all the years. For I believe that at five we reach a point not to be achieved again and from which ever after we at best keep and most often go down from. And so at 2 and 13, at 20 &#038; 30 &#038; 21 &#038; 18 &#8212; each year has the newness of its own awareness to one alive. Alive &#8212; and life. That is the significance of&#8230; one who has dared to be gloriously good and gloriously bad in one life. No Limbo for her. Rather let life itself grow living monuments out of trees and living words so that death can never take from our half-lives this radiant living that was lived among us.\nComplement with Emily Dickinson&#8217;s electric love letters to her soul mate and muse, then revisit Moomins creator Tove Jansson&#8217;s almost unbearably beautiful letters to the love of her life, who inspired her most beloved Moominvalley character. \ndonating = lovingFor a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

Chris Sununu (R) on Sunday called for President Biden to issue an apology after the president compared the \"Make American Great Again,\" otherwise known as the MAGA-Trump wing of the Republican Party, to \"semi-fascism\" last week.\n\n\n\nSununu told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" that the president's comments were \"horribly insulting.\"\n\n\n\n\"The fact that the president would go out and just insult half of America [and] effectively call half of America semi-fascist,\" Sununu said. \"He's trying to stir up controversy, he's trying to stir up this anti-Republican sentiment right before the election — it's horribly inappropriate.\"\n\n\n\nAt a Democratic National Committee (DNC) fundraising event in Bethesda, Md., last week, Biden said the U.S. was seeing \"either the beginning or the death knell of an extreme MAGA philosophy.\"\n\n\n\n\"It’s not just [former President] Trump, it’s the entire philosophy that underpins the — I’m going to say something, it’s like semi-fascism,\" the president said.\n\n\n\nBiden has previously criticized the MAGA wing of the GOP, saying \"this is not your father's Republican party\" and calling it a \"different deal.\"\n\n\n\nSununu conceded there are \"elements of fascism and white supremacy\" in the U.S., but explained it's also not true that \"all the Democrats are communists.\"\n\n\n\n\"When we allow ourselves just to talk in these extremes, we polarize the country,\" Sununu told CNN on Sunday, adding Biden on the campaign trail had \"said he was going to bring everybody together.\"\n\n\n\n\"And then to call half of America fascists?\" the GOP governor asked. \"He owes an apology.

        "description": "When two dozen or more FBI agents searched former President Donald Trump’s residence three weeks ago, most Americans initially were left wondering what in the world must Trump have done.&nbsp;After all, a prodigious FBI search logically indicates an equally prodigious violation of some federal statute; therefore, it must be really serious.&nbsp;One former Department of Justice (DOJ) official told Politico that the evidence sought&nbsp;“was likely so pulverizing in its force”&nbsp;that it would “eviscerate” the possibility of the optics for such an invasive law enforcement action not being good.\n\n\n\nWell, it’s now pretty official: The optics aren’t good.\n\n\n\nEveryone in America, from plumber to president, is constitutionally protected from a government search that lacks adequate cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe now know why the DOJ wanted the affidavit — which is supposed to articulate the probable cause needed for a legitimate search — to be kept under seal.&nbsp;After the magistrate who authorized the search forced the DOJ to unseal&nbsp;a redacted version, two realities came into better focus.\n\n\n\nFirst, the affidavit confirmed that the FBI’s investigation was triggered in January 2022 at the request of the National Archives which wanted certain documents, especially classified documents, that it considered to be presidential records to be turned over to it by Trump. Second, from what I have seen, I don’t believe the affidavit articulates how a federal law was or is being broken.&nbsp;For those who hold out hope that the affidavit’s redacted sections fill that gap, there is almost no chance that they do. (More on that below.)&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs to the first point, this matter is, as suspected, nothing more than a document dispute that was chugging along, appropriately, as a negotiation behind the scenes and apparently making some progress.&nbsp;I don’t see anything in the affidavit asserting a refusal by Trump to cooperate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAny clinging hope — in certain quarters — that the affidavit possessed “pulverizing” cause to believe Trump was engaged in a truly serious federal violation can — I think — be considered dashed.&nbsp;The pipe dream that Trump was engaged in espionage, actively providing secrets to an enemy I think is as fanciful as the Steele dossier’s&nbsp;Moscow&nbsp;hotel&nbsp;bed reverie. And, no, I don’t believe a smoking gun of espionage or something equally shocking will be in the redacted sections.&nbsp;If the FBI had that, it would have fronted that in the unredacted portions.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs to the second and more important point, the affidavit’s probable cause statements focus on only half of what is needed to show a possible violation of the federal statutes that are cited in the warrant.&nbsp;The affidavit does a reasonable job of establishing cause to believe Trump possessed a range of classified materials — or at least once-classified materials — and that those materials were located in his residence.\n\n\n\nBut that’s not all that’s needed — in this case in particular. A criminal violation of those statutes only exists if it can be established that the person being investigated was not authorized to possess, store, transfer or copy those documents. This is an easy element to establish against anyone in America. Except one person.  \n\n\n\nThe unredacted parts of the affidavit make no attempt to articulate cause that Trump was not authorized to have these documents in his home.&nbsp;The reason why is that, as president, he had&nbsp;broad, legally intimidating authority, established by law and court determinations, to declassify any and all documents and to determine what is and is not a presidential record.&nbsp;Trump and his legal team have asserted that this authority was exercised while he was still president. Therefore, a violation of these fairly low-level and seldom-prosecuted document-oriented statutes cannot be proven.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI don’t think there’s much chance that the affidavit’s redacted portions contain some novel legal theory undercutting this broad, well-established presidential authority.&nbsp;Affidavits for intrusive searches of a private home — the most extreme action the government can take against a resident of the United States, short of arrest — are not the place for advancing theories.&nbsp;Probable cause must be built on facts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe redacted sections are considerable.&nbsp;Redaction is supposed to be utilized only to protect sensitive methods and techniques — in other words, how the government came by its information that it doesn’t want to publicly divulge so it can keep using those tactics or protect providers of information.&nbsp;A good and prudent example would be the use of confidential human and/or technical sources.&nbsp;A bad example would be citing press reports, a la the&nbsp;Carter Page FISA affidavit.\n\n\n\nThe redacted portions therefore, normally, will simply cover how the FBI supported its assertions in the unredacted sections that Trump possessed classified materials in his residence — i.e., what confidential or sensitive sources were used to establish those facts.&nbsp;Don’t expect anything more.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe situation does not look good for the government.&nbsp;The Ivy League-educated attorneys of the DOJ had to know this adventure had little chance of an eventual successful prosecution. The use, therefore, of a highly intrusive search of a home simply as a forcing function to retrieve documents for the National Archives — and&nbsp;then&nbsp;not follow through with actual charges — spikes the potential abuse needle dramatically and will not help quiet the growing suspicion that this was more of&nbsp;a political hit-job to take Trump off the chessboard than it was the pursuit of blind justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI am often asked if the FBI had no choice but to pursue the National Archives request and open a case.&nbsp;Yes, it had a choice and, no, it didn’t have to&nbsp;open this investigation.&nbsp;The FBI declines to initiate cases involving more serious violations all the time.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe platitudinous justification from Democrats is “No one is above the law” — but we know that’s not true. The last time the Democrats controlled the DOJ, Hillary Clinton was set high aloft and placed out of reach of “reasonable” prosecution by then-FBI director James Comey with the concurrence of the DOJ. Even Comey noted that she was clearly not authorized to possess highly classified documents on a private server.\n\n\n\nPoliticians on both the right and left say bombastic things that inflame passions and drive opposition attempts to eliminate competition. But involving our justice system in politically tainted efforts can never be tolerated.  No citizen of this land, no matter who they are, should be subjected to a law enforcement action where there is an absence of evidence that anything illegal occurred.\n\n\n\nKevin R.

        "description": "New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) on Sunday said he is \"disappointed\" by the heavily redacted FBI affidavit that was used to justify a raid on former President Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate, arguing that reviewing it was pointless because the document was \"almost all redacted.\"\n\n\n\nSununu told CNN's Dana Bash on \"State of the Union\" that he had been \"pretty excited to see what might be in this affidavit\" until it was released.\n\n\n\n\"I think I speak for everyone when we're all pretty disappointed to see it was almost all redacted,\" the governor said. \"I get you got to redact certain things here and there, but you had pages upon pages upon pages redacted, to the point where you say, well, what's the point?\"\n\n\n\nThe FBI searched Trump's estate earlier this month in connection to an investigation into the former president potentially violating the Espionage Act by taking home classified documents.\n\n\n\nThe 28-page affidavit released Friday showed that the National Archives had picked up 15 boxes containing 184 classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, 25 of which were labeled top secret, before the search. Agents seized 11 different sets of classified documents during the search in early August.\n\n\n\nSununu on Sunday said the redacted affidavit is not enough to justify the steps the Department of Justice took, considering the unprecedented nature of the Mar-a-Lago search. \n\n\n\nThe GOP governor also said the Biden administration should employ a \"strategy for unprecedented transparency.\"  \n\n\n\n\"You got to be able to show your cards when you're taking actions like this,\" he told CNN. \"I'm not saying put all the documents on the Internet, but give us some sense of the subject matter. Give us some sense of the time. Give us some sense of what really drove us in there.\"",

        "description": "Astronaut Charlie M. Duke Jr., lunar module pilot of the Apollo 16 lunar landing mission, is photographed collecting lunar samples during the first Apollo 16 extravehicular activity at the Descartes landing site.John W. Young/NASAPresident John F. Kennedy delivered a famous speech in 1962 outlining his administration&#x27;s challenge to land Americans on the moon. &quot;We choose to go to the moon,&quot; he declared, not because it is easy, but because it is hard.As difficult a technological feat as the Apollo moon program proved, within seven years NASA had met Kennedy&#x27;s challenge and ultimately sent a dozen astronauts to the surface on six missions between 1969 and 1972 at a cost of about $25 billion — roughly $250 billion in today&#x27;s dollars.Sixty years after Kennedy&#x27;s speech, NASA is again getting ready to send humans to the moon. The uncrewed Artemis I, the first test flight of the hardware that will be used to send astronauts later, is set to lift off Monday, if all goes well.  No doubt, many people are wondering: Why go back?There&#x27;s a lot of science to be done on the moonThe rock samples brought back by Apollo astronauts decades ago taught scientists a lot about the geologic history of Earth and the moon.What can be gathered by today&#x27;s astronauts could tell us even more, says David Kring, a lunar geologist at the Center for Lunar Science &amp; Exploration in Houston, Texas.It&#x27;s easier to set down a spacecraft near the moon&#x27;s equator, so that&#x27;s where all six Apollo landings occurred. But now, NASA has more ambitious aims.Just days ago, NASA announced 13 possible landing sites, each in the south pole region, where water ice has been confirmed deep inside craters that never see sunlight. A crewed lunar flyby, Artemis II, is anticipated for 2024. And the first crewed landing, Artemis III, could come as early as 2025.A rendering of 13 candidate landing regions for Artemis III. Each region is approximately 9.3 miles by 9.3 miles. A landing site is a location within those regions with an approximate 328-foot radius.NASAThe sites &quot;are some of the best places to go for lunar geology and understanding lunar ice and sampling lunar ice,&quot; says Bethany Ehlmann, associate director of the Keck Institute for Space Studies at the California Institute of Technology.Kring calls the lunar south pole region &quot;absolutely extraordinary geologic terrain.&quot;&quot;If you really want to understand the origin of the evolution of the solar system, there is no better place ... to go [than] the moon,&quot; Kring says. Because the moon has never had an atmosphere or flowing water, it is not subject to weathering and erosion and has thus preserved evidence of its origin, he says.As technology has steadily improved in the decades since Apollo, the level of detail on the moon&#x27;s surface revealed by such probes as the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter &quot;is so extraordinary that we&#x27;ve already identified rocks on the lunar surface that we want the astronauts to collect,&quot; Kring says.Illustration of SpaceX Starship human lander design that will carry the first Artemis astronauts to the surface of the moon.SpaceXHaving astronaut boots on the moon has other advantages, too, says Craig Hardgrove, an associate professor in the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University. He considers himself &quot;a huge fan of robotic exploration,&quot; but nonetheless acknowledges that rovers and landers are limited by the scientific instruments they carry with them. They also have a harder time capturing as much data on the detailed geologic context and landscape as an astronaut trained in geology can.Humans, by contrast, &quot;are able to collect a large number of samples much quicker than robots,&quot; says Hardgrove, who is principal investigator of the Lunar Polar Hydrogen Mapper (LunaH-Map) mission, set to launch aboard the Artemis I rocket. The shoebox-size probe aims to pinpoint the location of polar ice deposits.With astronauts selecting the best samples and bringing them home, laboratories and universities can examine them with a wider range of sophisticated tools, he says. &quot;If we can bring them back to Earth, I think we have a much better shot at answering even more questions than we can if we&#x27;re limited to rovers.&quot;It&#x27;s a stepping stone to MarsMars is at least 200 times farther from Earth than the moon, which means an enormous challenge in keeping astronauts safe from such things as radiation exposure, Hardgrove says.&quot;The launch windows to get to Mars are once every two years,&quot; he says. &quot;So, we would be thinking about keeping our astronauts on the surface of Mars for a long period of time. I personally feel like we would be doing them a service and everyone a service if we test out all these technologies on the moon first.&quot;This image of the parachute that helped deliver NASA&#x27;s Perseverance Mars rover to the Martian surface was taken by the rover&#x27;s Mastcam-Z instrument in April.NASA/JPL-Caltech/ASU/MSSSApollo was mostly about beating the Soviet Union to the moon. It succeeded, but there was no long-term plan to create a sustainable human presence there.Artemis could change that, says Clive Neal, a professor of civil and environmental engineering and Earth sciences at the University of Notre Dame. He&#x27;s especially keen to see a gradual shift toward a permanent human presence on the moon. Given that SpaceX, a commercial venture, has been chosen to provide the vehicle that will land Artemis astronauts on the lunar surface, that prospect may not be as far off as once thought.&quot;We need to build an infrastructure that&#x27;s going to say, &#x27;OK, we&#x27;re going to have human permanence on the moon and transition to commercial operations there in the future,&#x27;&quot; Neal says. &quot;And we can have a blueprint then at the moon of how to do these things sustainably that can be applied to more distant destinations.&quot;It could spur new technologiesDozens of new technologies created to go into space and to the moon have also brought substantial benefits to people on Earth — spawning everything from hand-held computers to insulin pumps and freeze-dried food.Artemis could spark similar innovations.The core technology used in  dialysis machines was first developed for NASA.Science Photo Library/Getty ImagesA 2013 study commissioned by NASA estimates that commercial products  emerging from the space agency&#x27;s research return between $100 million and $1 billion annually to the U.S. economy. Many of those &quot;spinoffs&quot; had their origin in the Apollo program.The Apollo Guidance Computer, for example, was a technological marvel of its day. It was an early demonstration of digital fly-by-wire technology that is used in modern passenger jets and military aircraft.&quot;We&#x27;re still reaping the rewards of miniaturization of electronics that happened during Apollo,&quot; Neal says. &quot;Think about mobile phones. This is a technology that maybe would not have happened without Apollo.&quot;New flame-retardant fabrics first developed for spacesuits, to withstand very high temperatures and still remain lightweight, are found today in clothing to protect firefighters around the country.A &quot;super insulation&quot; developed for NASA in the 1960s can now be &quot;found hidden inside the walls and roofs of buildings, in cryogenic tanks and MRI machines, in winter gear, and in cases for electronic devices, among other applications,&quot; according to NASA.It has the potential to inspire a generation of engineers and scientistsIt&#x27;s often said that the Apollo moonshot inspired thousands of new engineers and scientists. While numbers are impossible to quantify, according to a 2009 survey of 800 researchers, &quot;the Moon landings deserve credit for motivating a large fraction of today&#x27;s scientists ... who have published in Nature in the past three years.&quot;Workers prepare the Psyche spacecraft inside a clean room at NASA&#x27;s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., in April. After a delay, Psyche, which will enter orbit in space around an asteroid, is expected to launch next year.Patrick T. Fallon/AFP via Getty ImagesWith Artemis, &quot;we&#x27;re going to get nearly live video from the surface of the moon and people are going to start thinking about the moon as a real place,&quot; Hardgrove, of ASU, says.\n&quot;I think it can absolutely be inspirational, hopefully not just for people like me, but [also] people who may not be thinking about careers in space exploration or engineering,&quot; he says.\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

Montgomery waived his rights to appeal as part of his plea agreement, the Manhattan District Attorney’s office confirmed to WSR. \nMontgomery will also be serving a concurrent three-year sentence in state prison after pleading guilty to second-degree assault for attacking a Rikers Island corrections officer and stabbing a fellow Rikers inmate during an August 2021 melee at the jail, a statement from the Bronx District Attorney’s office said. \nMontgomery’s co-defendant in Tony’s murder, Jashawn Gorham, now 21, pleaded guilty to first-degree manslaughter in December 2019, and is currently serving a 20-year sentence.  \nThese facts end a 43-month justice waiting game for Tony’s heartbroken family. \nBut, without a full trial, will Upper West Siders ever know why Brighton Montgomery and Jashawn Gorham targeted Tony on that Thursday afternoon? Chasing him up Broadway near 99th Street. Attacking him in front of multiple eyewitnesses and video cameras. Leaving him crumpled and bleeding outside Cheesy Pizza.\nWSR attended 12 of Montgomery’s 55 pre-trial court appearances in an attempt to find out.\nThe proceedings revealed an intricate, destructive web woven by two longtime rival “crews” on the UWS: Money Comes First and Columbus Avenue Gunners. \nAccording to hearing testimony by Sgt. James Burke, who served with NYPD’s Manhattan North Gang Unit, Montgomery and Gorham were members of Money Comes First [MCF]. MCF recruits often hail from NYCHA developments in the West 90s, including Wise Towers on 90th and 91st between Columbus and Amsterdam, the DeHostos Apartments on 93rd and Amsterdam, and buildings known as WSUR sites. \nMCF’s chief adversaries? Columbus Avenue Gunners [CAG] from NYCHA’s Frederick Douglass Houses development spanning 100th to 104th Streets between Amsterdam and Manhattan Avenues. \nPolice and court records say CAG and MCF members have run criminal enterprises around the Upper West Side since at least 2013. \nTony McClain was not a gang member, Sgt. Burke testified. \nTony’s aunt Jinette Moore told WSR her nephew avoided all that “nonsense,” instead graduating from high school and working several jobs. He had no particular loyalties to a given turf, having grown up in both Wise Towers and Douglass, staying with grandmothers in each development, she said.  \nIn January 2019, Tony was living in Douglass Houses. Though not a participant, he “did know people that were into stuff,” said Moore, referring to young men involved with CAG and affiliated gangs. \nSocial media posts, however, may have misconstrued Tony’s neutrality for allegiance. Tony had appeared in Facebook posts and a YouTube music video with Jermaine “Boogie” Johnson, a CAG member. That connection with Johnson may have cost Tony his life. \nFamily photo of Tony McClain.\nThroughout 2018, MCF and CAG beefed with each other over social media, according to exhibits shown in court. Brighton Montgomery liked posing with his pal Jashawn Gorham, throwing up MCF gang hand signs and posting under variations of his nickname B-Rah. \nLackin’ videos erupted on the scene. Crews burst into places like Starbucks, indicating firearms in their possession and taunting rivals who lacked weapons to defend themselves. Such blustering bravado on social media fueled tensions.\nThings exploded on July 30, 2018, when four MCF members infiltrated Douglass Houses and were shot at by a CAG member. \nOn August 5, 2018, CAG member Jermaine Johnson went on the attack. He headed to MCF territory: 93rd and Amsterdam. Johnson opened fire, shooting Jashawn Gorham, then 17, in the chest.\nSoon after, Gorham vowed revenge via a social media post, “The get back is real.” \nFive months later, on January 3rd, 2019, Jermaine Johnson and two co-conspirators were arrested in a federal racketeering case. Its indictment included charges stemming from the July and August shootings. Johnson, now 24, ultimately pleaded guilty to assaulting Gorham with a deadly weapon as well as trafficking in counterfeit currency, “To help maintain my position in the gang,” Johnson said. \nThe day after Johnson’s arrest, Jashawn Gorham posted a picture on Facebook. It showed Brighton Montgomery giving the finger to the camera, with Gorham in the background. Was the duo gloating over Johnson’s incarceration or celebrating Gorham’s January 4th 18th birthday or both? \nPassions continued to run high. Over the next few days, accusations swirled about possible snitches. Text messages flew. By January 10th, the theory goes, Gorham and Montgomery were looking to do a hit. \nTony McClain likely knew none of this as he walked on Broadway that Thursday afternoon. His family says he was on his way home from a uniform fitting for a new job at a movie theater. \nGorham and Montgomery appeared to have staked out the dividing line between the crews’ territories – the area around 98th Street. They had their weapons. They needed a target.\nDid they follow Tony from the subway? Did they recognize him from social media as a face associated with Jermaine Johnson? Did they know anything about Tony’s actual life? Did they believe his Douglass residency was reason enough to condemn him to death?\nWe may never know. \nJinette Moore has her answer. “My nephew was not a gangbanger or thug, but an innocent person caught up in other people’s ignorance and violence.”",

        "description": "Sen. Roy Blunt said former President Donald Trump should have turned over the sensitive documents recovered in this month's search of Mar-a-Lago, even as he continued to defend Trump on Sunday.  \"He should have turned the documents over and apparently had turned a number of documents over. ... What I wonder about is why this could go on for almost two years, and less than 100 days before the election, suddenly, we're talking about this rather than the economy,\" Blunt said to host George Stephanopoulos on ABC's \"This Week.\" Blunt also questioned the handling of documents by former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former FBI Director James Comey.  \"Everybody needs to be more careful,\" Blunt said. Some Republicans have suggested that there has been a double standard as to the way Trump was treated relative to the way other leaders have been treated. The Missouri Republican wasn't the only member of his party to take a measured perspective Sunday on the FBI's search of the former president's Florida estate.  \"We should absolutely be concerned,\" New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, said on CNN's \"State of the Union\" about the possibility that Trump removed documents that he shouldn't have. But Sununu continued, \"I don't know what to be concerned about. No one seems to. What's the subject matter? ... Of course, you can’t just open the whole investigation up.” Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, a consistent Trump critic and vocal supporter of the FBI, said he didn't have enough information to determine whether the search was justified. He called for transparency, though he acknowledged the sensitivity of a federal investigation.  \"On the one hand, it could be, as some Republicans think, just a political witch hunt. On the other hand, it could be really serious federal felonies,\" Hogan said.  Hogan said he didn't yet know which side he believed, but added that it would be \"hard to believe\" the Justice Department would take these actions \"unless they had something pretty serious.\"  A partially redacted affidavit&nbsp;unsealed Friday revealed that the FBI recovered highly classified and sensitive information from Mar-a-Lago, leading to a search warrant of the property. The agency searched Trump's resort Aug. 8 as an attempt to recover classified documents that the former president had taken with him when he left the White House in January 2021.",

        "description": "Justin Verlander threw only three innings and 60 pitches before leaving today&#8217;s start against the Orioles due to right calf discomfort.  It was Verlander&#8217;s shortest outing and lowest pitch count of the season.\nMore will be known about the right-hander&#8217;s condition after the game, and presumably after the Astros medical staff runs a battery of tests on Verlander&#8217;s calf.  At least for now, the team&#8217;s description of the injury as just &#8220;discomfort&#8221; is a good sign, as there was no immediately apparent strain.\nThe Astros have off-days on both Monday and Thursday this week, so unless Verlander&#8217;s issue turns out be very minor, Houston can skip his next turn in the rotation without any larger reshuffling within the pitching staff.  Of course, the Astros have arguably the sport&#8217;s best and deepest pitching staff, so if Verlander had to visit the injured list, Cristian Javier could step right back into starting duty after his recent move to the bullpen.  While a short-term fill-in situation is no problem, naturally losing Verlander for any significant length of time would be a severe blow to the Astros and their chances of a return trip to the World Series.\nAfter Tommy John surgery forced Verlander to miss virtually all of the 2020 and 2021 seasons, he has returned at age-39 to post one of the very best seasons of his already legendary career.  Verlander entered today&#8217;s action with a MLB-leading 1.87 ERA over 149 innings, showing no ill effects from his two-year layoff and looking like a favorite to capture the AL Cy Young Award (which would be the third CYA of Verlander&#8217;s career).",

        "description": "The Yankees have signed Chasen Shreve to a minor league contract, according to the club&#8217;s official MLB.com transactions page.  Shreve hinted on his Instagram page Friday (hat tip to Conor Foley of the Scranton Times-Tribune) that he was headed for a return stint with the Yankees organization.\nThe left-hander previously pitched for the Yankees from 2015-18, until he and Giovanny Gallegos were dealt to the Cardinals for Luke Voit and $1MM in international bonus pool money in July 2018.  Shreve also returned to New York in two separate stints with the Mets, both in 2020 and earlier this season.\nThe Mets released Shreve in July, after the lefty posted a 6.49 ERA over 26 1/3 innings.  This tenure ended in particularly disastrous fashion, as Shreve was crushed for 10 runs over the last 5 1/3 of those frames.  Opposing batters have hit six home runs off Shreve in those 26 1/3 innings, a resurgence of the homer problem that has periodically hampered him during his nine years in the majors.\nBetween the homers and some command issues, consistency has often hard to come by for Shreve, but he has been quite effective when at his best.  It was just last season that Shreve had a 3.20 ERA over 56 1/3 innings with the Pirates, as despite mediocre strikeout and walk rates, Shreve was one of the league&#8217;s best at limiting hard contact.\nShreve had a 3.92 ERA over his 174 2/3 previous innings with the Yankees, exhibiting some of those same ups and downs that have defined his career.  He is the second experienced left-hander added by the Bronx Bombers in two days, with Anthony Banda signed to a Major League deal today.  The Yankees look to be adding southpaw depth in advance of the postseason, and in the wake of Aroldis Chapman&#8217;s placement on the 15-day injured list yesterday.",

        "description": "1:23PM: The Yankees officially announced that Banda was signed to a Major League contract.  To create roster space, right-hander Luis Gil (who underwent Tommy John surgery in May) was recalled from the minors and moved to the 60-day injured list.\n1:01PM: The Yankees have agreed to a deal with left-hander Anthony Banda.  ESPN&#8217;s Marly Rivera was among the reporters to note earlier today that Banda was present in the Yankees&#8217; clubhouse.\nWith Aroldis Chapman going on the 15-day injured list yesterday, New York quickly filled that void with another left-handed reliever.  Banda joins Wandy Peralta and Lucas Luetge as the southpaw options in an injury-plagued bullpen, though Chapman and Zack Britton are expected to be back at some point in September.\nThe Yankees will be the ninth different organization of Banda&#8217;s career, and he has been action at the MLB level with five of those teams.  That includes a combined 26 innings with the Pirates and Blue Jays this season, with a 5.88 ERA to show for Banda&#8217;s 2022 resume.  Advanced metrics paint a much more favorable picture of Banda&#8217;s performance than his ERA, as a gigantic .446 BABIP might be to blame for many of Banda&#8217;s struggles.\nBanda was a notable prospect early in his career before he was waylaid by injuries, and the second act of his career has seen the left-hander now convert to full-time relief pitching.  He has a 4.98 ERA over 59 2/3 innings since the start of the 2021 season, though a 3.90 SIERA in that same span is perhaps a better reflection, given Banda&#8217;s lack of batted-ball luck.\nToronto acquired Banda from Pittsburgh in early July, and Banda than chose free agency rather than accept an outright assignment to Triple-A in early August.  That led to a new minors deal with the Mariners, but he made only four appearances with Seattle&#8217;s Triple-A affiliate before enacting an opt-out clause earlier this week.",

        "description": "Dodgers left-hander Clayton Kershaw threw around 70 pitches in a simulated game yesterday, and feels ready to make his return from the 15-day injured list.  Lower back pain forced Kershaw to the IL on August 5, and the Dodgers took a cautious road to recovery with their veteran ace.\n&#8220;The situation we’re in, this is more kind of a roster decision more than anything,&#8221; Kershaw told reporters, including Bill Plunkett of the Orange County Register.  &#8220;I’ve felt pretty good for a while now.  We took it slow, did two sim games and now ready to go.  Sometimes you can’t decide when you get to pitch.  They tell you.&#8221;\nHowever, Kershaw now seems on track for a slightly earlier return than expected, considering the initial plan was to activate him from the IL around the second week of September.  Now, Kershaw is likely to pitch on either Thursday (against the Mets in New York) or on Friday when the Dodgers open a homestand by facing the Padres.\nThere is plenty of reason for the Dodgers to take a measured approach to Kershaw&#8217;s return, given his checkered health history &#8212; that history includes another IL stint earlier this season, when Kershaw missed a little over a month this season due to hip inflammation.  While the Dodgers would certainly be careful with Kershaw under any circumstances, the team&#8217;s runaway lead in the NL West does allow some extra luxury when it comes to managing workloads and keeping players healthy for the postseason.\nTo that end, manager Dave Roberts told reporters (including The Athletic&#8217;s Fabian Ardaya) today that Los Angeles will use a six-man rotation for &#8220;a couple weeks at the bare minimum&#8221; once Kershaw is activated.  This will allow Julio Urias, Tony Gonsolin, and Tyler Anderson a bit of extra rest between starts, and since Dustin May and Andrew Heaney are both back from lengthy injury absences themselves, they&#8217;ll get to stay in the rotation and stay stretched out, rather than be relegated to bullpen work.\nNow in his 15th MLB season, Kershaw is still a top-tier starter when healthy, posting a 2.64 ERA, 26.2% strikeout rate, and 4.5% walk rate over 85 1/3 innings.  The left-hander&#8217;s first-half performance earned Kershaw an All-Star nod for the ninth time in his outstanding career.",

So let me clear that, yes, I know all the possibilities and I&#8217;ll do you one better by noting that I&#8217;ve seen all the countless examples showing that Donald Trump is ready to betray his country at the drop of his hat to advance his own ends.

        "description": "Four organizations representing European judges filed a lawsuit Sunday against the Council of the EU over its decision to greenlight Poland’s recovery plan despite ongoing rule-of-law concerns.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe judges’ groups argue that the Council approved Warsaw’s Recovery and Resilience Plan in a way that disregards judgments from the Court of Justice of the EU and harms both Polish judges and the European judiciary system.\n\n\n\nIn June, the Council signed off on a plan that could allow Poland to access billions in coronavirus recovery funds if it meets a set of “milestones,” including reforming a controversial disciplinary regime for judges. And while Warsaw has yet to receive funds under the plan, the blueprint itself is now being challenged.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe four organizations suing the Council — the European Association of Judges, the Association of European Administrative Judges, Judges for Judges and MEDEL, an association representing European judges and prosecutors — said that the plan’s targets are problematic.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These milestones fall short of what is required to ensure effective protection of the independence of judges and the judiciary and disregard the judgments of the CJEU on the matter,” the groups wrote in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Court of Justice, the organizations note, “has ruled that the Polish judges affected by unlawful disciplinary procedures should be reinstated at once, without delay or a procedure, while the third milestone would introduce a procedure of more than a year with an uncertain outcome.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit’s aim is in part to prevent Poland from accessing funds until it complies with court rulings.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The reason for asking the annulment of the EU Council’s decision is to make explicit the principle that judgments of the CJEU on the subject of the independence of judiciaries should be enforced without delay and in full,” the judges said. The “Council decision violates this principle, because there is no full — i.e. unconditional — enforcement of CJEU judgments,” they added.\n\n\n\nThe Good Lobby Profs, an academic-led initiative which provided support for the legal action, said in its own statement that the European Commission and the Council of the EU have both breached their duties when it comes to the Polish plan. The Commission and the Council have a duty, the group said, “not to treat judgments of the Court of Justice as bargaining chips and adjustment variables for reasons of political convenience.”&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/how-to-chromebook-calendar-widget-monday",
        "description": "Ever since Google introduced the Calendar View widget to ChromeOS in version 104, many discussions have been had about how to improve it. One of the most requested features for it, besides having the ability to integrate all of your Google Calendars, is how to change the starting day of the week to Monday instead of Sunday. Many thought this setting could be controlled by changing your weekly start day directly in Calendar, but unfortunately, this did not translate to switching it on the widget.\n\n\n\nChromeOS Calendar View widget in the U.S. showing Sunday as the first day of the week\n\n\nFortunately, the question came up again on Reddit, where u/guzman77 offered a solution he came across by trying to do the opposite and changing his start day to Sunday instead. This solution was spotted by About Chromebooks, who reported on it. The trick relies on changing your Chromebook&#8217;s device language to that of a location where Monday is considered the first day of the week.\n\n\n\nThis realization took me down an interesting rabbit hole. As an American, I&#8217;ve always known Sunday to be the first official day of the week in the calendar, while Monday is the first day of the working week. But, unbeknownst to me, there are places in the world where Monday is actually the first official day of the week. It all has to do with ISO 8601 &#x2013; an international standard covering the worldwide exchange and communication of date and time-related data &#x2013; which established that the first day of the week is Monday in the Gregorian calendar. However, although the United States uses the Gregorian calendar as well, it follows the ancient and religious custom of considering Saturday (the Sabbath) the last day of the week and Sunday the most important and thus the first day.\n\n\n\nThis solution, thus not officially one or a problem that affects anyone outside of the U.S., requires that you choose a language other than &#8220;English (United States)&#8221; in your language settings. Here&#8217;s how you do it:\n\n\n\nChange your ChromeOS device language\n\n\n\nIn your Chromebook settings, navigate to the &#8220;Languages and inputs&#8221; section. Once there, tap on the first option, which is for the device language, not to be confused with your input and keyboard language. This will bring up a popup to select a language from a long list. For English speakers, type in &#8220;English&#8221; in the search field, and select &#8220;English (Canada)&#8221; from the search results. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou will be prompted to confirm and restart for the change to take effect. Once your Chromebook restarts, you will notice that the calendar view widget will now show Monday as the first day of the week, as well as show the order in which the date appears underneath in &#8220;Day Month&#8221; format instead of &#8220;Month Day&#8221; as customary in the U.S.\n\n\n\nChromeOS Calendar View widget using &#8220;English (Canada)&#8221; language showing Monday as the first day of the week\n\n\n\nI just want the steps!\n&#x200B;\n   In your Chromebook&#8217;s settings, navigate to the &#8220;Languages and inputs&#8221; section.\n   Tap on the first option, which is for the device language.\n   For English, type in &#8220;English&#8221; in the search field.\n   Select &#8220;English (Canada)&#8221; from the options.\n   Confirm and restart your Chromebook.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

As someone who’s spent the past year working on the Broderick report into the culture of NSW parliament, I’ve frequently reflected upon how strange it is to have to say this. No one should have to feel “lucky” that they avoid being regularly abused, bullied or assaulted as part of their work. But such is the daily reality for too many employees in parliament.Elizabeth Broderick’s damning report represents a year of difficult, emotional and important work. It also represents an important crossroads at which we can choose to either weaponise and undermine that work for political gain or actually create a better, safer future for staff and the 135 MPs in this workplace.

Jet lag still feels the same, regrettably, but there are still rich and rewarding experiences to be had out there. As a nation we certainly seem keen to get on with it. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Dfat) has received record numbers of passport applications in recent months, and outbound trips have far exceeded arrivals.The caseload of Dfat’s consular service – the small team of professionals who respond when Australians face serious difficulty overseas – tells us that some of our fellow citizens are facing significant disruption and other challenges during their travel. The number of Australians travelling has not yet reached half the rate recorded in pre-pandemic 2019, and yet the number of travellers turning to the consular network for help in the last few months has been up by between 5% and 15%.

        "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/28/privacy-bill-triggers-lobbying-surge-by-data-brokers-00052958",
        "description": "Congress has never been closer to passing a federal data privacy law — and the brokers that profit from information on billions of people are spending big to nudge the legislation in their favor. Five prominent data brokers boosted their collective spending on lobbying by roughly 11 percent in the second quarter of this year compared with the same period a year ago, according to lobbying disclosure records reviewed by POLITICO. The $180,000 lobbying bump came as House Democrats and Republicans reached a compromise on a bipartisan bill aimed at giving consumers new powers to limit the collection and sharing of their data. The brokers, including U.K.-based data giant RELX and credit reporting agency TransUnion, want changes to the bill — such as an easing of data-sharing restrictions that RELX says would hamper investigations of crimes. Some data brokers also want clearer permission to use third-party data for advertising purposes. Privacy advocates say these requested changes would entrench practices in the data broker industry that have raised years of concerns about information collected en masse and shared without proper consent. Hundreds of companies have reported lobbying on the American Data Privacy and Protection Act, H.R. 8152 (117), including drugmakers, nonprofits and tech giants such as Microsoft and Amazon. But no industry is potentially more affected by the bill than the data brokers, which rely largely on third-party data — information collected by companies that users have no direct relationship with. For example, location data brokers can collect information on people’s whereabouts through apps, and can gain access to data that websites collect on people’s demographics and online shopping activities. This unregulated flow of data fuels an estimated $240 billion market, and lawmakers have raised concerns that the collections are being used to surveil protesters and influence specific groups with targeted ads. The bill, sponsored by House Energy and Commerce chair Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), would give people the right to demand the deletion of data that companies collect about them, while imposing restrictions on data being collected and shared with third parties. It would also put special protections on sensitive data like geolocation.  In total, the five data brokers reported spending about $1.73 million on lobbying during the quarter ending June 30, compared with $1.55 million during the same quarter of 2021. While that’s just a small fraction of what largest tech companies collectively paid for lobbying during the same period, it is comparable to the $1.9 million that Apple reported spending on similar issues during the second quarter of this year. (Apple, Microsoft, Facebook and Amazon combined spent nearly $15 million on lobbying during the same period.) In addition to lobbying on the House bill, the five brokers also indicated in their filings that they are lobbying on issues such as data security, children’s privacy, algorithmic bias and artificial intelligence. Privacy advocates are already criticizing the House bill for offering loopholes for data brokers, such as an exemption for “de-identified” data and carve-outs for brokers working on behalf of law enforcement agencies. Brokers often say they only offer data that has been stripped of information that could be used to identify specific individuals, but privacy researchers have found that this data can easily be linked to people when combined with other sources. Law enforcement agencies have also bought data from brokers as a way to circumvent Fourth Amendment restrictions on government searches. But data brokers don’t think these exceptions go far enough. Three brokers that lobbied on the bill told POLITICO that they are seeking more exemptions for third-party data and are pushing to block states from passing privacy protections stronger than those Congress enacts. “ADPPA has moved farther through Congress than any privacy bill has in many years,” said Caitriona Fitzgerald, deputy director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, one of D.C.’s best-known privacy advocacy groups. “Data brokers are likely responding to the fact that Congress seems serious about passing privacy regulations.” She said the data brokers’ requests would mean no changes to a problematic status quo, while the bill in its current form would limit the industry in significant ways. All five data brokers that lobbied on the privacy bill spent at least as much during the second quarter as they did during the same period in 2021. RELX, the parent company of digital identity services such as ThreatMetrix and LexisNexis, spent 26 percent more — making up the bulk of the industry’s lobbying bump. The company said it has been in touch with lawmakers about the bill, and raised concerns about how the legislation would restrict the use of third-party data for public safety purposes. RELX chief privacy officer Michael Lamb said the company collects and shares data with law enforcement agencies for crime prevention in areas like money laundering, fraud and human trafficking. And a federal privacy law allowing people to opt out would open the door for criminals to do the same, he said. While law enforcement agencies must get warrants to gather digital evidence on people, they can get around that requirement by buying the same kind of data from brokers. Lawmakers have proposed legislation to prevent government agencies from doing this. Lamb said the bill’s deletion rules also shouldn’t cover data that is primarily used for investigating illegal activities. “We obtain our data indirectly, and we would be subject to a blanket opt-out rule where any criminal or anyone else planning a crime is free to opt-out of these services that are really vital for law enforcement and for fraud prevention,” Lamb said. Larry Cosme, the president of the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, agreed with RELX that the bill would have a severe impact on criminal investigations. Cosme, a retired agent for the Department of Homeland Security, said information from data broker services had aided him in solving and preventing child exploitation cases, a tool the legislation would remove. “It helps provide this data to connect the dots,” he said. Cosme said investigators often need data immediately, and getting a warrant for the information can take too long. RELX collects data from a plethora of sources, including public records — which the House bill would exempt — as well as apps and third parties such as other data brokers. It told investors in April that “hundreds of millions of records” are added to its holdings every day. Its data includes information from 5 billion devices and 2 billion digital identities, according to its presentation for investors. RELX says it does not use its third-party data for advertising purposes. Privacy researchers say RELX’s massive data collection needs more oversight, not more exemptions, even if the data is being used for public safety purposes. “Law enforcement and fraud prevention shouldn’t be a free pass to collect and sell disproportionately excessive data on the whole population,” said Wolfie Christl, a researcher who investigates the data industry. He pointed to how closely RELX and its subsidiaries work with law enforcement agencies, and said the fact that its database contains “extensive personal information about almost every American citizen” puts an entire population under surveillance. Immigration advocates filed a lawsuit last week against the company’s subsidiary LexisNexis Risk Solutions over its $22 million contract with U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement, alleging the company violated Illinois law by collecting and selling state residents’ data without consent. Similar objections to the House bill come from TransUnion, the quarter’s second-largest spender among the five data brokers, which boasts insights on about 98 percent of U.S. adults. TransUnion also owns the data broker Neustar, which says it receives third-party data from more than 200 providers. Neustar uses its data collection for both marketing and fraud prevention purposes. Eli Peterson, TransUnion’s deputy general counsel, said in an emailed statement that its lobbying was to help “ensure that fraud prevention products can continue providing meaningful consumer protections.” TransUnion uses the data it collects for digital marketing as well. EPIC’s Fitzgerald said the House bill already makes exceptions for fraud prevention, and that the bill is focused on regulating commercial data brokers, not government agencies. A section in the bill says government agencies can work with brokers, though the legislation wouldn’t allow for selling data to government entities. “ADPPA doesn’t upend the ability of law enforcement to conduct investigations or obtain information through appropriate, legal processes,” Fitzgerald said. “What it does do is drive a stake through the shady practices of data brokers.”  Other data brokers are open about pushing for exemptions for marketing purposes. Those include Acxiom, a data broker that says it has a collection of data from more than 2.5 billion people. It takes issue with how the bill would restrict third-party data. “The current draft does not adequately protect businesses not categorized as ‘first parties,’ and we encourage legislators to amend to include an express recognition of the responsible use of third-party data for advertising as a permissible purpose,” Acxiom’s chief privacy officer, Jordan Abbott, said in an email. The other two data brokers that reported lobbying on the House bill, LiveRamp and Experian, didn’t respond to requests for comment. While each data broker may differ in what it’s seeking, each of them has made one request for the House bill: Keep its provisions that would preempt state privacy laws. The proposed legislation is facing opposition from California Democrats who want to preserve the state’s privacy law. Privacy groups and attorneys generals have argued that if Congress blocks states from passing laws on data privacy, the tech industry will find new ways to collect data that the federal bill doesn’t address. But lawmakers see preemption as an important compromise for the bill to receive bipartisan support. Republican lawmakers who support the House bill have said any attempts to provide states like California with exemptions for their privacy laws could mean losing their vote. All three data brokers who responded to POLITICO said they support preempting state laws, while LiveRamp has also called for a national standard that overwrites state regulations. The brokers argue that state laws put a significant burden on businesses that must comply with multiple standards instead of a unified set of rules. “It’d be very problematic if we don’t preempt state laws trying to do the same things but in different ways,” RELX’s Lamb said. The House bill would preempt state laws, a compromise that is drawing ire from California lawmakers as well as privacy advocates. While it’s an obstacle for the bill’s passage, the legislation’s bigger roadblock comes from Senate Commerce Chair Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.). She has criticized the bill as too weak on privacy protections — and if the data brokers get their wishes, it’s even more unlikely that she’ll back the legislation. A person familiar with the House Energy and Commerce committee said the data brokers’ lobbying has not affected the bill, saying that universal distrust of the industry exists among the committee’s members. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the behind-the-scenes deliberations. Skeptics of the data brokers’ attempts to latch themselves onto public safety have noted that criminals have sometimes made use of the same data. In 2020 and 2021, the Justice Department charged three other data brokers with selling elderly Americans’ data to known scammers, and in 2002 a murderer found his victim’s workplace through information he bought from a data broker. RELX said it carefully vets potential customers, including through in-person visits, before allowing them to access its services. In a statement, TransUnion said it \"employs a range of practices, from customer credentialing to contract obligations, to ensure that data is used appropriately.\" Even if the bill doesn’t pass, it could still be chalked up as a win for the data broker industry, by maintaining a status quo that privacy advocates say should cease to exist. “Just because data brokers have spent the last 20 years making millions of dollars off of our personal data because Congress hasn’t passed a privacy law doesn’t mean it should continue to be legal,” EPIC’s Fitzgerald said. “The bipartisan consensus behind ADPPA is that we need to rein in these abusive data practices, not codify them into law.”",

        "description": "Democratic prospects in the November midterms might not be as bad as predicted earlier in the year, with Republicans' projected gains shrinking in the House of Representatives, according to a CBS News poll released Sunday.  Republicans are still poised to win back a majority in the House, but their predicted lead is down to 226 seats, a 12-seat gain. In July, CBS News' election tracker predicted Republicans could win 230 seats, and some Republicans through the year have suggested the GOP could end up with 240 seats or more. \"That momentum is real,\" Democratic National Committee Chair Jaime Harrison said Sunday on CBS' \"Face The Nation.\"  However, keeping Democratic prospects strong until November is far from guaranteed. The president's party typically loses seats in Congress in the midterms: 2006, 2010, 2014 and 2018 saw huge gains for the opposition party. Also, redistricting has likely put some seats out of the reach of Democrats. The margin of error in CBS News' seat estimate for each party is +/- 18 seats, and a majority in the chamber is 218 seats.  According to CBS' election tracker, the apparent shift can be attributed to voters attention on abortion rights, falling gas prices and what the network dubbed \"the Donald Trump factor.\" The former president has once again dominated headlines at times this month, following the FBI's search of his Mar-a-Lago home, which was part of an investigation into the alleged mishandling of White House documents. \"Abortion is going to be extremely important,\" Harrison said, adding that the issue is \"about freedom.\" In the same poll, President Joe Biden's approval rating rose three points to 45 percent compared with 42 percent in July, and his disapproval rating — still a majority — fell by the same amount, from 58 percent to 55 percent, in the same period. Biden's job ratings on the economy, gas prices and inflation all improved, though only a third of Americans believe Democrats have a plan to fight inflation, as \"Face the Nation\" host Major Garrett noted Sunday.  Democrats have been heartened in recent months by unexpectedly strong performances in special elections, including Pat Ryan's victory in a special election in upstate New York on Tuesday. In Alaska, Democrat Mary Peltola remains ahead in a special election for the state's congressional seat, though the state's ranked choice voting could ultimately knock her out of the lead. The CBS News/YouGov survey was conducted with a nationally representative sample of 2,126 registered voters interviewed Aug. 24 to 26, with a margin of error +/- 2.4 points. CBS' House seats estimates were based on a multilevel regression and post-stratification model that incorporated voter responses.",

We must use them as a warning to actAcross Britain, the woods are turning orange. Drifts of dry leaves are growing on forest floors and eddying into street corners. Hawthorn and rowan, elder and holly berries are all ripening, and the ferns are fringes of gold. From a distance, it is beautiful. But the air is still warm and summery.And all of it is two or three months early. Holly berries usually ripen in November or December. Blackberries, traditionally a late August treat, began ripening at the end of June. This turning and leaf fall is not the usual gradual preparation for winter in temperate zones but a stress response by trees trying to conserve water.

Muscular, yet thin; a lean package that is capable of packing a mean punch. It’s Chris Hemsworth’s glistening nudity in the latest Thor, or Natalie Portman’s much-talked about bulging biceps, or the star-spangled curvature of “America’s ass” (Chris Evans’). While Marvel stars, like Elizabeth Olsen, have defended the studio for never explicitly telling their actors to “get into shape”, the pressure on them to appear powerful has been sculpted over time.“I want to look like someone who can take on Thor or Captain America, or any one of those people,” Kumail Nanjiani told GQ magazine, about his decision to beef up to play Kingo in Eternals. Motivated by his own desire to portray a strong south Asian hero, he gained about 28 pounds (12 kilograms) of muscle – against the wishes of director Chloé Zhao, who had cast him for his “mix of humility and charisma”.

We must use them as a warning to actAcross Britain, the woods are turning orange. Drifts of dry leaves are growing on forest floors and eddying into street corners. Hawthorn and rowan, elder and holly berries are all ripening, and the ferns are fringes of gold. From a distance, it is beautiful. But the air is still warm and summery.And all of it is two or three months early. Holly berries usually ripen in November or December. Blackberries, traditionally a late August treat, began ripening at the end of June. This turning and leaf fall is not the usual gradual preparation for winter in temperate zones but a stress response by trees trying to conserve water. We are now in a false autumn, caused by heat and drought. And it feels wrong. Continue reading...",

To an M-series MacBook user, the above paragraphs sound like they must have been written years ago.

The code can be hard to write, time-consuming to maintain, and full of edge cases. RevenueCat makes it simple so you can focus on building features, not a subscription back end. \n\nWith RevenueCat, you also get out-of-the-box subscription metrics and charts that you can’t get from App Store Connect. Plus, prebuilt integrations make it easy to sync customer events and revenue data to every tool in your stack.\n\nI know a slew of developers who swear by RevenueCat for their subscriptions. It’s so much better than rolling your own solution. Learn more at revenuecat.com and see why thousands of the world’s best apps trust RevenueCat to power subscriptions on iOS, Android, and the web.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

The Pakistani prime minister, Shehbaz Sharif, visiting Jaffarabad on Sunday, was told that at least 75% of Balochistan, which covers half of Pakistan’s land area, was partially or completely affected by flooding.

        "description": "A marked shift in the pattern of small boat arrivals shows how necessary an evidence-based, multilateral approach isIf the tenor of debate about asylum seekers arriving via small boats is somewhat less fevered than in previous Augusts, that is because it is not the main theme of the Tory leadership race. The severity of the cost of living crisis, the war in Ukraine and an alarming drought mean that minds are focused elsewhere. Thankfully, there have not been recent drownings following the tragic sinking in which more than 30 people died in November.But the politics surrounding this issue remain as dispiriting as ever. The outcry surrounding the government’s deal with Rwanda to send asylum seekers there – a proposal that would have seemed inconceivable just a few years ago – proved insufficient to deter ministers from going ahead. It emerged on Thursday that a new attempt at a deportation flight is under way, after the first was cancelled in June following legal action. In September the government will defend the scheme in a high court challenge brought by charities and the Public and Commercial Services Union. So far, nothing either Tory leadership contender has said suggests that they plan to do anything other than press on with this inhumane and impractical operation. With a huge backlog of asylum claims, which stood at 125,000 in July, the whole system remains in a state of disarray, including its indefensible practice of detaining people in de facto prisons.

        "description": "In a short posting that Moritz F. Fürst calls a parable, we learn about some of the mundane episodes in the work of EMT or ambulance workers. Some calls for an ambulance are episodes of crisis, but many others appear to be little more than routine acts of transportation. He examines the ways workers think and talk about the mundane parts of their work, which sparked a series of thoughts here.\nI once served on our university's Information Technology committee, where faculty members were meant to guide the IT department in its service of the teaching and research work being done on campus. Over time I gathered the impression that the IT director thought the university's computer network would be just about perfect if only she could keep humans from touching any part of it. In those years, there was a professor who was said to keep his coffee cup on the slid-open cd-rom drive of his office computer, so I could understand a certain amount of frustration on the director's part with human beings using the gear. Still, as I reflect upon Moritz's essay or parable, I remind myself that our expertise is sterile if it hopes to exclude the humanity of those we are supposed to serve.\nIn different fields, you hear stories of professionals trying to remind themselves of this vital insight, and trying to train newcomers to understand it. Medical schools sometimes ask students to read literary works by Chekhov, W.C. Williams, Coles, eg., for that purpose.\nAt a military museum once, I photographed all the places on large pieces of artillery that were meant to be held or operated by a human hand. After about an hour of doing so, having located places all over the equipment meant to be held or squeezed or pushed or pulled by the soldiers, I had the feeling of a ghostly presence of soldiers moving ant-like all over and around and under the artillery pieces. A chilling thought came to me that piece of equipment relentlessly trains up a person into being a part of the machine, even part of a killing machine.\nMany things in our training try to sharpen us, to narrow us. Amazing skills can arise from that, as well as indifference or even blindnesses to other parts of life.\nDifferent things help us resist the narrowness of our training. Interdisciplinary study, where we learn the tools for seeing used by many fields, can help. The arts, which are about rejiggering our perceptions, our hearts and minds, can help. Identifying with the other person, which can be a psychological or spiritual practice, can help.\nIn academic fields, the opportunity to write not just about the tools of the field, but about the field's human context as well, seems vital, though this may not be common. Moritz's essay is an important example.\nHis essay acknowledges that a technician must not pretend there are no emotions in doing the work. Must not pretend that there is no boredom, no anger, say, for the technician, or no emotional need being felt by the medical patient, eg.\nIn a tiny short story called \"The Use of Force,\" William Carlos Williams tells about a family doctor much like himself becoming angry with the parents who have delayed getting help for their child because they didn't have money to pay for it, and angry too at the frightened child who fights back against the doctor. Both things put the child at risk of a potentially fatal illness.\nThat doctor's desire to merely carry out the life-saving technical task is being thwarted, and the doctor sees his own emotions rising unprofessionally. At that moment, the practice of medicine is deeply interwoven in a very flawed but understandable humanity.\nAll of which is to say that reflections about the human context of one's profession, as in the essay or parable by Moritz, are very important. Much is at stake.",

Larry Hogan (R) on Sunday said he isn’t satisfied with the current level of transparency regarding the FBI’s search of former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property, but sidestepped questioning about whether he agrees with fellow Republicans who allege the move was politically motivated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Many Republicans believe this is a political effort to harm and tarnish the reputation of former President Trump. Do you agree with them? And do you think the government has been transparent enough in this extraordinary set of events?\" chief Washington correspondent Major Garrett asked Hogan on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\"\n\n\n\n“It is an extraordinary set of events. It's never happened before with a former president and so the very first day I– I called for more transparency,” Hogan replied.\n\n\n\nThe Republican governor lauded Attorney General Merrick Garland making brief but public comments on the case against Trump as well as the release of an affidavit by the Justice Department justifying the FBI search.\n\n\n\n\"But we still don't know a whole lot. I mean, most of it was redacted. It didn't give us a lot of color. And so I think some Republicans are saying without you showing us more to it, we don't- we think it may be political,\" Hogan said without clarifying if he was among those posing such questions about the investigation's motives.\n\n\n\nA noted Trump critic within the Republican party, Hogan separated himself after the search from Republicans \"just reacting, just defending\" the former president. He's said the search was justified, but has been vocal in calling for transparency on the matter from federal authorities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn&nbsp;unsealed warrant&nbsp;indicates Trump is under investigation for possible violations of the Espionage Act and other laws in relation to documents kept at Mar-a-Lago after the end of his presidential term, including 11 sets of classified material recovered by the FBI during its search of Trump's Florida resort earlier this month.\n\n\n\nThe affidavit used to apply for the Mar-a-Lago search warrant was&nbsp;released&nbsp;in redacted form last week but revealed that authorities recovered 184 classified documents from the property.\n\n\n\n\nRepublican Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan weighs in on the FBI’s search of Mar-a-Lago after more documents were unsealed this week.&quot;It&#39;s hard to believe that the Justice Department and the FBI would take steps unless they had something pretty serious they were investigating.&quot; pic.twitter.com/i1JUNAP5TF&mdash; Face The Nation (@FaceTheNation) August 28, 2022\n\n\n\n\n“On the one hand, it could be, as some Republicans think, just, you know, just a political witch hunt. On the other hand, it could be really serious, you know, federal felonies. We don’t know that yet,” Hogan said.\n\n\n\nPressed on whether he sides with Republicans who believe the probe into Trump’s document handling is a witch hunt, Hogan said not enough information has been released, but hinted at some trust that the FBI had justifications for the investigation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I don't know that we have enough information yet. I think– it’s hard to believe that the Justice Department, the FBI, would take steps unless they had something pretty serious that they were investigating. We just don't know the facts yet,” Hogan said.",

        "description": "Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan (R) said he won't endorse anyone in the race to replace him. \n\n\n\nDuring an appearance on CBS’s “Face The Nation,” moderator Major Garrett asked Hogan about the race between Trump-backed GOP nominee Dan Cox and Democratic challenger Wes Moore.\n\n\n\nHogan has called Cox, a state lawmaker, a “Qanon whack job” and “a nut”. Cox beat Hogan's preferred candidate, former Commerce Secretary Kelly Schulz, in the GOP primary. \n\n\n\n“When people ask me a question, I usually give them a direct answer. And I you know, made it very clear that this guy should not be the nominee and he shouldn't be governor,” Hogan told Garrett.\n\n\n\n“I'm not getting involved in endorsing in the race. But this is not just Maryland. This is happening across the country. This is something that, it's why Mitch McConnell is saying that we may not win the Senate,” Hogan added of the success of pro-Trump election deniers in this year's primary cycle. \n\n\n\n“It's why we were hoping to pick up seats in governor's races and now we're not. It's why we're- we're the margin in the House is so much smaller.”\n\n\n\nMcConnell drew Trump's ire last week when he predicted the fight for control of the Senate would be tight, citing the importance of candidate quality in the statewide races. \n\n\n\nWhat was once expected to be a \"red wave\" in the midterms, due to soaring inflations and President Biden's low approval ratings, is now expected to be a much smaller GOP gain in the House, and a toss-up in the Senate. \n\n\n\nHogan, whose second term as governor ends in January, has been an outspoken Trump critic amid speculation that he is considering a 2024 presidential run. \n\n\n\nHowever, he reiterated on Sunday that he’s focused on finishing his term as governor.",

        "description": "Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) on Sunday defended former President Trump in the wake of an FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago property but noted Trump “should have turned over all” of the classified documents authorities said he kept after he left the White House.\n\n\n\n“I understand he turned over a lot of documents. He should have turned over all of them. I imagine he knows that very well now as well,\" Blunt said on ABC’s “This Week With George Stephanopoulos.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBlunt avoided answering several questions about whether Trump was right to take the sensitive material from the White House to his Palm Beach, Fla., resort before conceding that the former president should have turned the documents over to the National Archives as required by the Presidential Records Act.\n\n\n\n“He should have turned the documents over and apparently had turned a number of documents over. ... What I wonder about is why this could go on for almost two years, and less than 100 days before the election, suddenly we're talking about this rather than the economy or inflation,” Blunt said.\n\n\n\nBlunt questioned the timing of the investigation so close to this year’s midterms as well as why the Justice Department and the director of national intelligence hadn’t flagged the issue to the Senate Intelligence Committee, of which he is a member.\n\n\n\n“Why hadn't we heard anything about this, in fact, if the administration was concerned that there was a national security problem?”\n\n\n\nThe FBI seized 11 sets of classified documents from Mar-a-Lago when it executed a search warrant there earlier this month. An unsealed warrant indicates Trump is under investigation for possible violations of the Espionage Act and other laws in relation to the documents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe affidavit justifying the FBI's search warrant for Mar-a-Lago was released in redacted form last week. \n\n\n\nThe Missouri senator also tried to draw parallels between Trump's case and that of Hillary Clinton, who was under FBI investigation for mishandling emails while she served as secretary of State. But he also acknowledged that sensitive government information should be handled appropriately.\n\n\n\n“You should be careful with classified documents. I’ve had access to documents like that for a long time. I’m incredibly careful,” Blunt said.",

        "description": "Transportation secretary Pete Buttigieg marked one year of parenthood with a post on Medium this weekend, recalling the day when he first discovered he and his husband Chasten would be adopting twins.\n\n\n\nThe soon-to-be parent remembered feeling both delighted and uncertain on the sunny afternoon when he got the news, after a \"share of painful false starts\" on the adoption waitlist.\n\n\n\nFast forward a year later, and Buttigieg says he experienced an \"extraordinary transformation\" in his life, along with Chasten.\n\n\n\n\"In one year, you go from someone absorbed in your own worries, hopes, and career, to having fully faced just how much in life is outside your control — and how magical it is to spend every day with someone who matters more to you than your old self could possibly have dreamed of,\" Buttigieg wrote in a reflection \n\n\n\nSince Buttigieg announced he and Chasten had adopted Penelope Rose and Joseph August last fall, the Transportation secretary has been eager to share moments from their lives. \n\n\n\nIn October, Buttigieg and Chasten shared photographs of the children dressed as traffic cones for Halloween, joking that they were \"twinfrastructure.\" And in January, Buttigieg said becoming a father for the first time lit a fire inside him.\n\n\n\nButtigieg said in his Saturday post that parenting has been a cause of great celebration in his life, but has not always been easy for the former South Bend, Ind., mayor and former 2020 presidential candidate.\n\n\n\nWhen he got the news that a mother was putting her twins up for adoption, Buttigieg immediately took a red-eye flight to the hospital while Chasten quickly hopped in the car and drove to meet him there. \n\n\n\nPenelope and Joseph were \"perfect\" and \"heart melting,\" Buttigieg writes, but they were born premature and underweight. They weren't discharged from the hospital until two weeks later, and Penelope continued to struggle with a severe reflux, sometimes turning purple when she couldn't breathe properly.\n\n\n\nBoth Penelope and Joseph, who the parents have nicknamed Gus, were hospitalized in October after a respiratory virus infection. Doctors said the children were in critical condition at one point, and Buttigieg wrote the hospital turned into a \"new home base\" for he and Chasten. \n\n\n\n\"Parenting is lots of things, and one of those things is terror,\" Buttigieg writes on Medium. \"You watch your infant, sedated and surrounded by wires and tubes and monitors and medical personnel coming and going constantly, and wonder how we could live in a universe where a few weeks could be all that a child gets on this earth.\"\n\n\n\nButtigieg was also combatting a national crisis as supply chains were disrupted across the country, and as President Biden was pushing to get his bipartisan infrastructure law passed in Congress. \n\n\n\nWhile Buttigieg worked everyday from the hospital, some conservatives criticized him for not working harder while his infants were hospitalized, in comments many said were homophobic.\n\n\n\nBy the end of October, the twins had recovered. However, the normal struggles of parenthood, such as \"sleepless nights, blown-out diapers, late-night bottle warmings in the glow of the refrigerator light,\" were still around, he said. \n\n\n\n\"After a presidential campaign, a wartime military deployment, and eight eventful years as mayor of my hometown, I was no stranger to very hard work. But this was a completely new level of sustained sleep deprivation,\" the Transportation secretary wrote. \"Every parent probably has a memory of a moment that shows you just how deep the sleep loss is running. \n\n\n\n\"For me, it was when I reached for a cup of coffee, put it to my lips, and suddenly realized it was not a mug but a baby bottle,\" he added.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Pete and Chasten celebrated the twin's birthdays in Michigan. Penelope was photographed stuffing her mouth with cake and smearing the blue-and-white icing across her face, with Gus joining in. \n\n\n\n\"It was hard to believe these were the same infants we had stared at in disbelief one year earlier at that little rural hospital,\" Buttigieg wrote. \"Here they were, four or five times the size they started, delighted by the world around them, boisterous and alive in every sense of the word.\"",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/3618671-kinzinger-republicans-in-real-trouble-because-we-have-no-leadership/",
        "description": "Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) on Sunday said that Republicans are in \"real trouble\" ahead of the midterm elections because the GOP lacks strong leadership from both House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.).\n\n\n\n\"Republicans are in real trouble because we have no leadership. This is the problem,\" Kinzinger said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" \"Kevin McCarthy isn’t leading, he’s asking, 'What does [Republican Rep.] Marjorie Taylor Greene [Ga.] want me to do?' \n\n\n\n\"Mitch McConnell’s just trying to save the Senate,\" Kinzinger added. \"We have no leaders, and no wonder our base basically believes everything Donald Trump says.\"\n\n\n\nWith the midterm elections coming up, the race for control of Congress is heating up between Democrats and Republicans. \n\n\n\nWhile GOP candidates slam the Biden administration with accusations of mishandling the economy and causing high inflation, Democrats are campaigning heavily on abortion rights and are seeking to paint Republicans as extremist on the issue.\n\n\n\nA bellwether race in New York last week showed the odds may be tipping in favor of Democrats. In the special election for the House of Representatives, Democratic candidate Pat Ryan, who had focused on abortion rights in his campaign, eked out a victory over Republican Marc Molinaro.\n\n\n\nPolls also show Republicans, who earlier this year enjoyed a healthy advantage headed into November, are now losing ground while forecasts are shifting toward Democrats.\n\n\n\nThe GOP is also experiencing in-fighting between former President Trump and McConnell. After the Senate minority leader said the House is more likely to flip control than the Senate, Trump called for McConnell to be ousted from his leadership post.\n\n\n\nThe former president has dubbed McConnell with the nickname \"Old Crow\" and has called for his ouster since the Senate leader denounced Trump for his role in the Jan. 6, 2021, rioting at the U.S. Capitol.\n\n\n\nKinzinger, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, said on Sunday another concerning issue with the GOP headed into November is the 2020 election, which many continue to falsely claim was rigged.\n\n\n\n\"Republicans that are running against even left-wing Democrats that believe in democracy and believe in voting, that person should be elected over somebody who basically would overthrow the will of the people and ultimately destroy this country,\" the Illinois lawmaker, who announced his retirement last October, told NBC. \"This country cannot survive outside of democracy. It will turn into a power struggle between groups of different races, of different ethnicities, of different religions, because the thing that holds us together is this belief that we can self-govern.\"",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/3617922-the-abortion-emergency-in-the-federal-courts/",
        "description": "It is now notorious that the criminalization of abortion, in the wake of the Supreme Court’s overruling of Roe v. Wade, doesn’t do much to lower the abortion rate but has had devastating effects on the ability of doctors to treat pregnancies that go wrong.  Horror stories accumulate. Opponents of abortion have claimed that the press has exaggerated the danger. Yet two recent lawsuits have made clear that this harm is very real. Efforts to preserve women’s health are being resisted, with some success, even in cases where the fetus is doomed.\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court indicated in Dobbs v. Women’s Health Center that it wanted to stay away from the abortion issue. Yet it is certainly coming back there, and soon, because of a new division between two lower federal courts.\n\n\n\nThe Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), enacted in 1986, requires that emergency rooms examine every patient who comes there. If the patient has an \"emergency medical condition,\" the hospital must “stabilize” them, assuring that the patient's condition won't worsen when they're discharged or transferred. The statute defines an emergency as a condition that in “the absence of immediate medical attention could reasonably be expected to result in “placing the health of the individual (or, with respect to a pregnant woman, the health of the woman or her unborn child) in serious jeopardy,” “serious impairment to bodily functions” or “serious dysfunction of any bodily organ or part.” Sometimes, to prevent these harms, the doctor must terminate a pregnancy.\n\n\n\nUnder the supremacy clause of the Constitution, federal law preempts state law when they conflict. \n\n\n\nSome of the new state abortion restrictions squarely contradict EMTALA. In Idaho, abortions are prohibited unless they are “necessary to prevent the death” of a woman — meaning, as a federal district court just observed, that “severe sepsis requiring limb amputation, uncontrollable uterine hemorrhage requiring hysterectomy, kidney failure requiring lifelong dialysis, hypoxic brain injury” are not sufficiently serious to protect the doctor from prosecution. In Texas, doctors who terminate pregnancies can go to prison, possibly for life, unless they can prove that the woman “has a life-threatening physical condition” that places her “at risk of death or poses a serious risk of substantial impairment of a major bodily function unless the abortion is performed.”\n\n\n\nIn a guidance letter to health care providers, Health and Human Services Secretary Xavier Becerra wrote that if a patient “is experiencing an emergency medical condition as defined by EMTALA, and … abortion is the stabilizing treatment necessary to resolve that condition, the physician must provide that treatment. And when a state law prohibits abortion and does not include an exception for the life and health of the pregnant person—or draws the exception more narrowly than EMTALA’s emergency medical condition definition—that state law is preempted.”\n\n\n\nThis week, two federal judges reached opposite conclusions about the conflict. At the behest of the Biden administration, Judge B. Lynn Winmill blocked the Idaho law.  EMTALA, he noted, “demands abortion care to prevent injuries that are more wide-ranging than death.” The Idaho law requires that doctors allow their patients’ conditions to deteriorate disastrously before they can intervene. “Healthcare providers can seldom know the imminency of death because medicine rarely works in absolutes.” It is often scientifically impossible to determine whether death is certain if the pregnancy continues. EMTALA, like medical practice generally, aims to intervene promptly, before the patient’s life is in danger.\n\n\n\nIn Texas, however, Judge James Hendrix granted an injunction against Becerra, blocking enforcement of the federal policy. In his complaint, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton had preposterously declared that the administration’s policy would “transform every emergency room in the country into a walk-in abortion clinic.” Judge Hendrix agreed, saying that EMTALA “protects both mothers and unborn children” and “is silent as to abortion.” Nothing in the Texas statute, he declared, “makes the provision of stabilizing care impossible.”\n\n\n\nHendrix’s reasoning is unpersuasive. The statute indeed fails to mention abortion, or any other medical procedure. But it doesn’t have to: It tells the doctor to do whatever is necessary to keep the patient’s condition from worsening. In the hypotheticals he offers, in which it is possible to stabilize the woman without ending the pregnancy, it is not the case that, in Becerra’s words, “abortion is the stabilizing treatment necessary” to address the emergency. In such a situation, it would not be the necessary treatment but merely a possible treatment.\n\n\n\nHendrix ignores far more common emergency cases. The amniotic sac can rupture, leading to infection. The placenta may begin bleeding. The woman may develop pre-eclampsia, which raises her blood pressure to dangerous levels. In many such cases, the appropriate response is to end the pregnancy before the patient becomes gravely ill — and then the Texas law does make stabilizing care impossible.\n\n\n\nHe writes, quoting the Texas statute: “To the extent that the Guidance would require abortion where Texas would not, Texas law does so to ‘provide[] the best opportunity for the unborn child to survive.’” Yet in many emergency cases, there is no possibility that the fetus will survive. The Texas law nonetheless forbids doctors from intervening while its heart is still beating. That will certainly lead to avoidable deaths, but they must be endured because doctors will not be able to know in advance which lives are jeopardized.\n\n\n\nThis issue is almost certainly headed for the Supreme Court, which so recently declared that the abortion question was none of its business. We will see whether its judges will torture the statute as Hendrix did. I am not optimistic.\n\n\n\nAndrew Koppelman, John Paul Stevens Professor of Law at Northwestern University, is the author of “Burning Down the House: How Libertarian Philosophy Was Corrupted by Delusion and Greed” (St. Martin’s Press, forthcoming).&nbsp;Follow him on Twitter&nbsp;@AndrewKoppelman.",

        "description": "Democratic National Committee (DNC) Chairman Jaime Harrison avoided criticizing President Biden for his remarks in which he referred to the Republican party’s philosophy as “semi-fascist.” \n\n\n\nDuring an appearance on CBS’s “Face The Nation,” guest moderator Major Garrett asked Harrison whether he embraced the president's assessment. \n\n\n\n\"Well, it's not about the embracing –  its calling what what it is what it is, in the end of the day, we are a country built on freedom. And when you chip away at that, when you see the bullying that takes place in place like Florida with [Gov. Ron] DeSantis, when you see them chip away at privacy rights when they try to demonize the other, that the attacks on transgender kids and their families, the attacks on marriage equality that we're hearing from the Supreme Court,\" Harrison said.\n\n\n\n\"This is not who America is. We're about freedom and rights for all of America's people, not just a select few. But the Republicans are turning a blind eye  - this extreme agenda, and this is what this election is all about,\" he added. \"It is the great contrast between a party, the Democratic Party, that is standing up for the hopes and aspirations of the American people and protecting our rights as Americans and our freedoms. And a Republican party that is focused on fear, that's focused on fraud that is focused on just getting power.\"\n\n\n\nSpeaking at a DNC event in Maryland on Thursday, Biden compared the “MAGA” wing of the GOP to fascism, telling the audience in Bethesda that this is only “the beginning” or “the end” of this type of philosophy. \n\n\n\nWhen asked if Biden should run for re-election in 2024, Harrison said the DNC would fully back the president.\n\n\n\n\"The President has consistently said that his intention is to run for president in the United States. And I can tell you, the Democratic National Committee will be fully behind- behind him and Kamala Harris. This President has a record of achievement, and America needs President Biden to continue that effort,\" Harrison said.",

        "description": "Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) on Sunday criticized the Republican party for backing former President Trump in the wake of the FBI search of his Mar-a-Lago property because he said he believes they are \"defending a man who very clearly did not take the national security of the United States to heart.\"\n\n\n\nKinzinger told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" moderator Chuck Todd this was the same political base that pushed to imprison former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton over her handling of emails as a secretary of state.\n\n\n\n\"The hypocrisy of folks in my party that spent years chanting, 'Lock her up,' about Hillary Clinton because of some deleted emails or – quote/unquote, 'wiping a server' — are now out there defending a man who very clearly did not take the national security of the United States to heart,\" Kinzinger said. \n\n\n\nThe FBI searched Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate earlier this month as part of an investigation into whether the former president violated the Espionage Act and statutes involving obstruction of justice.\n\n\n\nMuch of the GOP has rallied around Trump, with a select few calling to \"defund the FBI.\" One Trump supporter earlier this month threatened FBI agents in Ohio before he was shot and killed in a standoff with police.\n\n\n\nKinzinger, a member of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, told NBC that if he or other lawmakers took home classified documents and refused to give them up, they would be in \"real trouble.\"\n\n\n\n\"This is disgusting in my mind,\" Kinzinger said, adding, \"no president should act this way, obviously.\"\n\n\n\nThe Illinois lawmaker noted that the National Archives first launched an inquiry into the missing documents in the spring of 2021 and were hampered by Trump's efforts because he was either withholding information or stonewalling requests.\n\n\n\n \"Mishandling classified information is one thing, particularly if it was unintentional. You know, if you accidentally did take something home, there may be consequences,\" Kinzinger told Todd on NBC. \"But I think you look at the intentionality of that. There is intentionality there. I mean, this thing is big.\"\n\n\n\n\"When you look at some of the president's biggest kind of cheerleaders, [Republican Reps.] Marjorie Taylor Greene, Jim Jordan, have gone kind of silent,\" he continued. \"That tells you all you need to know.\"",

Those are the jobs we're talking about,\" Ryan told Bash on Sunday. \"Those are the jobs with dignity. That's what I'm fighting for.\"\n\n\n\nRyan will face Republican Senate nominee J.D. Vance in November’s midterm election. \n\n\n\nAn Emerson College poll published last week found that Vance, who is backed by former President Trump, leading Ryan by 3 points, with 45 percent of respondents supporting Vance and 42 percent backing Ryan. ",

It wasn’t about denying them, but trying to process them in a calm way.”In the last six years, my life has imploded. My son (and only child) took his own life in 2016 after a year of prolonged stress and trauma. My husband was already in poor health, and died some 20 months later. In the last four months of his life, I learned that my clergyman and all-round good-guy husband of 34 years had in fact lived a secret, hidden existence for most, perhaps all, of those years. I had to process all of this in the context of managing to live with multiple sclerosis. Continue reading...",

Experts warn that schools could easily game the new structure Mr. Biden has created for higher education financing, cranking up prices and encouraging students to load up on debt with the expectation that it will never need to be paid in full.”",

        "description": "Photo by Jim McIsaac/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Max Scherzer was brilliant but it wasn’t enough against Colorado. The Mets were unable to complete the sweep of the Rockies and dropped the finale to the Rockies by a score of 1-0 at Citi Field. \nMax Scherzer and Germán Márquez were locked in a pitchers duel and matched zeros until the seventh inning when Scherzer blinked first. Three singles, two of which were the infield variety, loaded the bases with no outs. One sacrifice fly later brought home the Rockies lone run. Scherzer limited the damage and had a stellar outing overall. He pitched seven innings and struck out eleven, dutifully counted on the Scherzer strikeout counter giveaway by Carlos Carrasco. \nUnfortunately for the Mets, Márquez was better. He gave up one hit in seven innings and struck out five. Once he was out of the game the Mets did had a chance in the eighth to tie the game when Brett Baty reached second on a wild pitch with one out. But two straight strikeouts by pinch-hitter Starling Marte and Brandon Nimmo left him stranded. \nMychal Givens got the ninth inning and managed to help himself when he picked off Randal Grichuk who had doubled. He still put another two runners on after that but pitched out of the inning without giving up any runs.\nOther than a Pete Alonso single in the bottom of the inning, the Mets could not bring home a run and were shutout at home against the Rockies.\nSB Nation GameThreads\nAmazin’ AvenuePurple Row\nBox scores\nMLB.comESPN\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs.com\n  \nWhat’s WPA?\nBig Mets winner: Max Scherzer, +16.9% WPABig Mets loser: Brandon Nimmo, -15.0% WPAMets pitchers: +24.3% WPAMets hitters: -74.3% WPATeh aw3s0mest play: Pete Alonso single in ninthTeh sux0rest play: Randal Grichuk single in seventh",

        "description": "Former senior White House adviser Cedric Richmond on Sunday dismissed criticism that the Biden administration’s move to cancel some student loan debt is unfair, saying that “everything doesn’t benefit everybody” reiterating that the plan will help the country’s working class. \n\n\n\n“Remember, everything doesn't benefit everybody, but it's about the common good, and this president is focused on working families and empowering people to reach their full potential, and I think that this does exactly what he's trying to do,” Richmond said on \"Fox News Sunday.\"\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration announced last week it’s forgiving up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for Americans earning less than $125,000 a year and up to $20,000 in federal student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients. It also extended a pandemic-era freeze on federal student loan repayment and interest accrual until Dec. 31 for what it said was the final time.\n\n\n\nRichmond served in the Biden administration as director of the Office of Public Engagement and is now an adviser to the Democratic National Committee.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This country is not a zero-sum game where somebody has to fail for others to succeed, and so we have historic tax credits, we have business tax credits to help those who own businesses, and not everyone in America owns a business, but we help business owners because we want to promote it,” Richmond said Sunday.\n\n\n\n“We’re not picking winners and losers. America is a country about the common good, and what we’re doing here is making sure that we invest in all of America, and right now we are investing in working families.”\n\n\n\nThe former Louisiana congressman rejected a suggestion by anchor Jennifer Griffin that the plan is an “election gimmick” by Biden ahead of this year’s midterms.\n\n\n\n“It's not. What it's doing is empowering people to get an education, lift themselves out of poverty, free up the high cost of the debt that they owe to colleges so that they can invest in American dreams, buy a home, invest in their children, be better community members. This is about lifting up America,” Richmond said.\n\n\n\nHe noted that Biden’s move, which the White House says will mainly benefit Americans making less than $75,000 a year, fulfills a promise the president made on the campaign trail. \n\n\n\nThe debt forgiveness plan has been praised by progressives, while Republicans have called it unfair and economically irresponsible.\n\n\n\nAsked by reporters after last week’s announcement whether his plan is unfair to those who have already paid off loans or chose not to take out loans, Biden parried with a hit at tax cuts on the rich. \n\n\n\n“Is it fair to people who, in fact, do not own multibillion-dollar businesses if they see one of these guys getting all the tax cuts? Is that fair? What do you think?” Biden said.",

        "description": "The mayor of Jackson, Miss. has urged residents to evacuate as river waters continue to rise due to flooding.\n\n\n\n“I've already received calls from individuals wondering or questioning whether they should get out if you are capable of getting out now,” Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba (D) said in a news conference Saturday.  \n\n\n\n“Get out now get out as soon as possible to prevent any incident or challenge with people trying to leave the area all at once; or any concern over whether the river crests sooner than you may anticipate our projection.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Saturday, Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves (R) declared a state of emergency for areas that are still affected by the river flooding.\n\n\n\n“This will allow our state agencies to better assist in our response efforts and carry out their emergency responsibilities,\" Reeves said in a tweet.\n\n\n\nFlooding swept across the southwest region of the U.S. last week, as the National Weather Service (NWS) warned about a potential tropical cyclones in the region.\n\n\n\nMississippi's Pearl River is expected to crest at 35.5 feet on Monday, six inches lower than previous forecasts, a NWS hydrologist told the New York Times. Though the flooding had reached some subdivision streets in Jackson, it has yet to reach houses.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Lumumba said 100 to 150 homes could be affected in the city.",

        "description": "British actor who went on to work for the film director Stanley Kubrick as an assistant, casting adviser and ‘sort of gatekeeper’Leon Vitali, who has died aged 74, occupied a unique position in the life and cinema of Stanley Kubrick. He was assistant, facilitator, casting adviser, archivist, intermediary and dogsbody. “A sort of gatekeeper” was how Vitali put it in 2018. It could be difficult to tell where one man ended and the other began: Kubrick sometimes signed letters with Vitali’s name, while Vitali had permission to tell intransigent colleagues: “What you say to me, you say to Stanley.” The men even shared the same birthday, two decades apart.They met when Vitali was cast at the age of 24 in the director’s magisterial Thackeray adaptation Barry Lyndon (1975). Vitali gave an indignant, explosive performance as Lord Bullingdon, who rages against his stepfather, an opportunistic cad played by Ryan O’Neal, finally challenging him to a pistol duel. The confrontation, which begins with Bullingdon misfiring his gun before vomiting in a corner of the barn, is agonisingly protracted. Continue reading...",

        "description": "In a season that&#8217;s been so discouraging, the improbable has happened.\nBehind a splendid performance by starter German Marquez, the Rockies beat the Mets, and future Hall of Famer Max Scherzer, 1-0 on Sunday afternoon at Citi Field.\nMarquez not only outdueled Scherzer, but Colorado also spoiled the Mets&#8217; plans for a four-game sweep by earning one of its most satisfying victories of the season.\n&#8220;Max is one of the best,&#8221; Marquez told AT&amp;T SportsNet. &#8220;I like to face guys like that. My focus is (there) and I like to pitch a game like that.&#8221;\nMarquez, who&#8217;s been erratic this season, performed like the All-Star he was last summer. He pitched seven scoreless innings, yielding just one hit, walking two and striking out five.\nIt was a 180-degree turn from his last start when he allowed six runs on eight hits, including two home runs, over six innings against Texas at Coors Field. After that game, an emotional Marquez said he was &#8220;frickin&#8217; frustrated.&#8221;\nJeff McNeil busted Marquez&#8217;s no-hit string with a leadoff single in the fifth. McNeil advanced to second on a balk by Marquez, the only time the Mets had a man in scoring position vs. the right-hander.\nManager Bud Black was thrilled with what he thought was Marquez&#8217;s best performance of the season.\n&#8220;This was a marquee match-up for me, Max Scherzer vs. German Marquez,&#8221; Black told reporters in New York. &#8220;German has had his ups and downs this year but I had a feeling he was going to rise to the occasion in New York, against one of the premier pitchers in the game. And he did.\n&#8220;I&#8217;m very proud of him. I thought he made pitches when he had to and I thought he used his fastball well and his curve. He was, obviously, very effective.&#8221;\nThe Rockies finally busted through against Scherzer in the seventh to take the lead on a sacrifice fly by catcher Brian Serven.\nC.J. Cron led off with a solid single to left and Jose Iglesias&#8217; perfect bunt single toward third pushed Cron to second, giving the Rockies a runner in scoring position for the first time in the game. Randal Grichuk&#8217;s fortunate, swinging bunt single loaded the bases with no outs.\nScherzer struck out Sam Hilliard, but Serven whacked a first-pitch fastball to deep right to score Cron. Scherzer, who threw a season-high 112 pitches, struck out Garrett Hampson to halt Colorado&#8217;s rally. Scherzer, who&#8217;s hunting for his 200th career victory, struck out 11, gave up four hits and walked one.\n&#8220;Today was important after losing the first three,&#8221; Serven told AT&amp;T SportsNet. &#8220;You never want to go somewhere and get swept in four games.&#8221;\nServen struck out in his first two at-bats vs. Scherzer, but he was ready with the game on the line.\n&#8220;He was throwing a lot of fastballs away to righties to get to 0-1 because it has that fade-back a little bit,&#8221; Serven said. &#8220;I told myself I&#8217;m going to look out there for that pitch. Luckily I got one that I could put in play.&#8221;\nColorado&#8217;s bullpen did its job. Carlos Estevez, who&#8217;s emerging as a solid set-up man, gave up a one-out hit to Brett Baty in the eighth, and Baty advanced to second on a wild pitch. But Estevez struck out pinch hitter Starling Marte and Brandon Nimmo to end the threat.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; farm system rises up the rankings, providing hope for the future: &#8220;There is talent at every level&#8221;\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRegis Jesuit&#8217;s David Peterson outduels Thomas Jefferson&#8217;s Kyle Freeland as Mets blank Rockies\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tSaunders: A paint-by-numbers look at the Rockies&#8217; slide\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMets walk-off Rockies who blow chance for a rare road win\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMets&#8217; Jacob deGrom dominates as Rockies fall to 18-40 on the road\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\nCloser Daniel Bard gave up a one-out single to Pete Alonso but cooly struck out Eduardo Escobar and got Jeff McNeil to ground out to second to slam the door and notch his 27th save in 30 opportunities.\nThe Rockies have an off day Monday before opening a three-game series at Atlanta on Tuesday. The Rockies are in the midst of a 10-game, 11-day road trip.\nGilbreath to IL. Lefty reliever Lucas Gilbreath was placed on the 15-day injured list with a left elbow flexor strain. According to MLB.com, he&#8217;s scheduled to have an MRI on Monday to determine the severity of the injury.\nIn a corresponding move, the club activated right-hander Alex Colome from the IL. Colome had been on the IL since Aug. 11 with right lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow). Colome, who had a 4.68 ERA in 46 appearances, was struggling before going on the IL.\nGilbreath told MLB.com that he felt discomfort in his elbow when throwing his slider during Friday night&#8217;s game against the Mets. Gilbreath has a 4.19 ERA with 49 strikeouts in 47 games this season.\n\nOn Deck\nThe Rockies are off on Monday.\nTrending: Outfielder Randal Grichuk is hitting .338 (41-for-121) in 34 games since the All-Star break.

        "description": "This kid is, in the words of one of my colleagues, the CEO of White Castle (sliders), formerly known as the Mecca of drunk eating. | Eric Hartline-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  The kids played a big part in the win, namely Roansy Contreras and Tucapita Marcano Today was a glimpse of the future, hopefully.\nRoansy Contreras pitched a beautiful five innings, striking out seven, and Tucapita Marcano tied the MLB record for most assists in an inning as the Pirates got their first road shutout of the year, downing the Phillies 5-0 at Citizens Bank Park.\nFor a pleasant change, the Pirates got on the board in the first inning, with Oneil Cruz tripling and Ke’Bryan Hayes bringing him home. Roansy started strong, and the Pirates defense was just as strong despite a blip error by Michael Chavis that allowed Alec Bohm to get on base, and some of us may have taken inordinate pleasure in Bryce Harper striking out swinging.\nPhillies starter Noah Syndergaard looked off from the start, a far cry from his days with the Mets when he was legitimately scary. But another nice change is that the Pirates got three triples, all off Syndergaard—and every one of them crossed the plate. Anyone who hangs out with the Commentariat knows the number of lobster GIFS posted during an average Pirates game. The only Pirate who didn’t get a hit today was Greg Allen, but he had a couple of timely sac bunts to boost his RBI total. \nAfter the debacles that were the last two games, it was fun to watch the Pirates today, to watch the kids making the plays. Marcano was downright brilliant-looking at times at second base today. And there’s been a definite improvement in Oneil Cruz’s defense as well (hoping that doesn’t jinx him). It was small ball, but it was good small ball that resulted in a (sadly these days) rare RAISE IT.\nThe rumor’s going around that Jack Suwinski is coming up, and newly acquired pitcher Robert Stephenson will be on the mound in Milwaukee tomorrow in place of JT Brubaker, who’s on paternity leave. Let’s see what happens.",

Trump has yet to formally announce a third run for the White House, but has repeatedly hinted at a 2024 bid. \n\n\n\nNinety percent of Republican voters think Trump “is willing to use all tools at their disposal to get things done,” compared with 73 percent of Democrats who said the same of Biden.\n\n\n\nEighty-five percent of Democrats think Biden “is focused on bringing the country together and finding compromise,” compared with 70 percent of Republicans who said the same of Trump.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic Party was more likely than the Republican Party to be seen by respondents on both sides as more inclusive and \"willing to compromise to get things done,\" while the Republican Party was more likely to be seen as \"good for the economy\" and \"tough on crime.\"\n\n\n\nConducted Aug 18-22, the online survey polled 2,345 adults and has a credibility interval of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.",

        "description": "SLOVIANSK, Ukraine — Russia and Ukraine traded claims of rocket and artillery strikes at or near Europe’s largest nuclear power plant on Sunday, intensifying fears that the fighting could cause a massive radiation leak. Ukraine’s atomic energy agency painted an ominous picture of the threat Sunday by issuing a map forecasting where radiation could spread from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, which Russian forces have controlled since soon after the war began. Attacks were reported over the weekend not only in Russian-controlled territory adjacent to the plant along the left bank of the Dnieper River, but along the Ukraine-controlled right bank, including the cities of Nikopol and Marhanets, each about 10 kilometers (six miles) from the facility. Russian Defense Ministry spokesperson Igor Konashenkov said Sunday that Ukrainian forces had attacked the plant twice over the past day, and that shells fell near buildings storing reactor fuel and radioactive waste. “One projectile fell in the area of the sixth power unit, and the other five in front of the sixth unit pumping station, which provides cooling for this reactor,” Konashenkov said, adding that radiation levels were normal. The U.N.’s International Atomic Energy Agency also reported Sunday that radiation levels were normal, that two of the Zaporizhzhia plant’s six reactors were operating and that while no complete assessment had yet been made, recent fighting had damaged a water pipeline, since repaired. In another apparent attack Sunday, Russian forces shot down an armed Ukrainian drone targeting one of the Zaporizhzhia plant’s spent fuel storage sites, a local official said. Vladimir Rogov, a Russian-installed regional official, said on the Telegram messaging app that the drone crashed onto a building’s roof, not causing any significant damage or injuring anyone. Nearby, heavy firing during the night left parts of Nikopol without electricity, said Valentyn Reznichenko, the Dnipropetrovsk region’s governor. Rocket strikes damaged a dozen residences in Marhanets, according to Yevhen Yevtushenko, the administration head for the district that includes the city of about 45,000. The city of Zaporizhzhia, about 40 kilometers (25 miles) up the Dnieper River from the nuclear plant, also came under Russian fire, damaging dozens of apartment buildings and homes and wounding two people, city council member Anatoliy Kurtev said. Russian forces struck a Zaporizhzhia repair shop for Ukrainian air force helicopters, Konashenkov said. Neither side’s claims could be independently verified. Downriver from the nuclear plant, Ukrainian rockets hit the Kakhovka hydroelectric plant and adjacent city three times on Sunday, said Vladimir Leontyev, the head of the Russia-installed local administration. The plant’s dam is a major roadway across the river and a potentially key Russian supply route. The dam forms a reservoir that provides water for the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant. The radiation map Ukraine’s nuclear agency Energoatom issued showed that based on wind forecasts for Monday, a nuclear cloud could spread across southern Ukraine and southwestern Russia. Release of the map may have been meant to warn that if Russian forces were responsible for a radiation leak, their own country would suffer. In the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power plant accident, the world’s worst atomic energy catastrophe, radiation spread from Ukraine to several neighboring countries. Authorities last week began distributing iodine tablets to residents who live near the Zaporizhzhia plant in case of radiation exposure. Much of the concern centers on the cooling systems for the plant’s nuclear reactors. The systems require electricity, and the plant was temporarily knocked offline Thursday because of what officials said was fire damage to a transmission line. A cooling system failure could cause a nuclear meltdown. Periodic shelling has damaged the power station’s infrastructure, Energoatom, said Saturday. “There are risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances, and the fire hazard is high,” it said. The IAEA has tried to work out an agreement with Ukrainian and Russian authorities to send a team to inspect and secure the plant, but it remained unclear when the visit might take place. In eastern Ukraine, where Russian and separatist forces are trying to take control, shelling hit the large and strategically significant cities of Kramatorsk and Sloviansk, with no casualties reported, said Pavlo Kyrylenko, the Donetsk region’s governor. Konashenkov said Russian missile strikes killed 250 Ukrainian soldiers and reservists in and near Sloviansk. Ukrainian officials didn’t comment on the claim, in keeping with their policy of not discussing losses. Sloviansk resident Kostiantyn Daineko told The Associated Press that he was falling asleep when an explosion blew out his apartment windows. “I opened my eyes and saw how the window frame was flying over me, the frame and pieces of broken glass,” he said. Russian and separatist forces hold much of the Donetsk region, one of two Russia has recognized as sovereign states. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy vowed again Sunday to re-take the separatist areas. “The invaders brought degradation and death and they believe that they are there forever,” Zelenskyy said Sunday in his nightly video address. “But it’s a temporary thing for them. Ukraine will return. For sure. Life will return.”",

Experts warn that schools could easily game the new structure Mr. Biden has created for higher education financing, cranking up prices and encouraging students to load up on debt with the expectation that it will never need to be paid in full.”",

        "description": "Anthony Albanese says he will ‘stand by’ stage three tax cuts as Liberal MP joins calls to scrap themLabor may accelerate industrial relations reforms to ‘get wages moving’, Anthony Albanese saysGet our free news app, morning email briefing or daily news podcastPocock pushes for scrapping of stage-three tax cutsIndependent senator David Pocock was on RN speaking about the stage-three tax cuts, which he says should be “resisted” – no matter what was promised before the election.What I’ve said is that they should be revisited … [Anthony Albanese] has a really strong case to relook at these these tax cuts and see what what else that could actually be spent on, given the you know the huge amount of money that they represent.Things have changed a lot since these were where they decided. We’ve had bushfires, a global pandemic. We’ve had flooding and stagnant wages, and now people are in a cost-of-living crisis across the country. And so I just don’t think that we can justify handing out $240bn over the next 10 years to the wealthiest Australians.Ultimately, when we hit the budget in October – which is where these issues get reviewed every year – when you look at the budget, there will be things that we want to do that we can’t do. And that’s the reality of a trillion dollars of Liberal debt, particularly as inflation goes up. That debt now costs a lot more than it costs even a year ago.So there will be things that that we would want to do that people would like us to do that aren’t going to be possible as an example. It’s basically saying, ‘Yeah, this is just too too expensive.’We’re only in the second month of that new system. A lot of it was designed before we came to office and the contracts had all been signed before we came into office. So I’m still very mindful of what we can do. But the the challenges of the people who are in the system right now are exactly as you’ve described.I think to live on $46 a day is incredibly difficult if not impossible. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Beto O'Rourke, Texas' Democratic candidate for governor, will \"postpone events\" after being hospitalized with a bacterial infection, he wrote Sunday on Twitter.  \"While my symptoms have improved, I will be resting at home in El Paso in accordance with the doctors' recommendations,\" O'Rourke said. He has been discharged from the hospital, campaign communications director Chris Evans said Sunday.  The former member of Congress was hospitalized at Methodist Hospital in San Antonio after feeling sick on Friday, he wrote. He was diagnosed with a bacterial infection and received care including IV antibiotics, according to the tweet.  He said he would \"be back on the road with you as soon as I am able.\"  O'Rourke, who served three terms in Congress, rose to prominence nationally with his unsuccessful run for Senate in 2018. He also ran for president in 2020.  He has frequently clashed with his Republican gubernatorial rival, current Texas Gov. Greg Abbott, including a face-to-face confrontation at a press conference following the May school shooting in Uvalde, Texas.  Polling from the Dallas Morning News and UT Tyler, conducted among 972 registered voters in the first week of August, showed Abbott up 7 points in the race. The margin of error in the poll was +/- 2.6 points.",

A full list of where to stream the launch, including on NASA's website and social media pages, can be found here.\n\n\n\nDuring the launch ceremony, actors Jack Black, Chris Evans and Keke Palmer will make live appearances, NASA said earlier this month.\n\n\n\nJazz composer Herbie Hancock and singer-songwriter Josh Groban will perform \"The Star Spangled Banner,\" while the Philadelphia Orchestra, along with cellist Yo-Yo Ma, will perform \"America the Beautiful.\"\n\n\n\nAgency officials, including NASA Administrator Bill Nelson, will deliver remarks and answer questions at a postlaunch conference around noon.\n\n\n\nKey to the future of moon exploration \n\n\n\nMonday's test launch, called Artemis I, is the first in a series of integrated tests for NASA's Artemis program, designed to get American astronauts back to the moon for the first time since 1972.\n\n\n\nThe test will determine the capabilities of SLS, the most powerful launch rocket in the world, and the Orion exploration spacecraft, which rides on top of SLS and will one day carry astronauts to the moon.\n\n\n\nAfter launching into space on Monday morning, SLS will fall back to the planet. Orion will continue its flight around the moon before it returns and splashes back down to Earth. A full map of Orion's trajectory is available here.\n\n\n\nIf Monday's test goes well, the second test launch, called Artemis II, will include a crewed flight, with astronauts taking a ride on Orion for an estimated 10 days in space.\n\n\n\nArtemis III will finally take astronauts to the moon's south pole. NASA has a goal of sending the first woman and first person of color to the moon by 2025. \n\n\n\nOpening doors to scientific discoveries\n\n\n\nArtemis builds on the previous Apollo program, which sent astronauts to the moon from 1968 to 1972.\n\n\n\nThose manned missions to the moon paved the way for crucial technology used today, including heart monitors, solar panels and automatic pool purifiers.\n\n\n\nThe Artemis program is expected to lead to more discoveries and scientific advancements.\n\n\n\nAstronauts who journeyed to the moon with Apollo also collected 842 pounds of lunar rock samples during their space ventures. \n\n\n\nLunar rovers and unmanned vehicles cannot collect as much as a human astronaut, so sending crews back to the moon will be important to understanding geology. The moon holds key data about the formation of our planet and solar system, considering its rocky surface is relatively unchanged due to its stable environment.\n\n\n\nMike Sarafin, the Artemis I&nbsp;mission manager at NASA's headquarters in Washington, D.C., said in a statement this month that the Artemis program \"will do what hasn’t been done and learn what isn’t known.\"\n\n\n\n\"It will blaze a trail that people will follow on the next Orion flight, pushing the edges of the envelope to prepare for that mission,\" Sarafin said.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/red-sox-to-designate-austin-davis-for-assignment.html",
        "description": "The Red Sox are going to designate left-hander Austin Davis for assignment before Monday&#8217;s game against the Twins, according to Chad Jennings of The Athletic.\nDavis, 29, spent time with the Phillies and Pirates before coming over to the Red Sox last year in a deadline deal that sent Michael Chavis to Pittsburgh. After that trade, Davis pitched adequately, registering a 4.86 ERA in 16 2/3 innings, along with a 22.7% strikeout rate, 9.3% walk rate and 47.1% ground ball rate.\nAs Jennings points out, 2022 started out well for Davis, as he held a 2.55 ERA through July 8. Since that time, however, he&#8217;s been rocked to an ERA of 11.12. His 24.7% strikeout rate in that time is slightly above the 23.5% league average for relievers. However, his 12.9% walk rate is well beyond the 9.1% average.\nGiven that extended slide, it seems the Sox have decided to move on and cut Davis from the roster. It&#8217;s not known what other moves will be made in conjunction with this one, but a spot will be opened on Boston&#8217;s active roster as well as its 40-man roster. Given that we are in the post-deadline part of the season, the Red Sox will have no choice but to put Davis on outright waivers or release waivers. Davis began the year with his service time at 2.098, meaning he&#8217;s beyond the three-year mark at this point of the year, as 172 days are required to fulfill a &#8220;year&#8221; in this department. By getting beyond the three-year threshold, he&#8217;s earned the right to reject an outright assignment in favor of electing free agency.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/diamondbacks-reportedly-promoting-corbin-carroll.html",
        "description": "The Diamondbacks are planning on promoting outfield prospect Corbin Carroll for Monday&#8217;s game, reports Steve Gilbert of MLB.com. Carroll is not currently on the club&#8217;s 40-man roster, though they already have a vacancy there. A corresponding move will be required to get him onto the active roster.\nThis will be something of a belated birthday present for the youngster, who just turned 22 years old a week ago. Selected with the 16th overall pick in the 2019 draft, Carroll has been one of the most intriguing prospect in Arizona&#8217;s system ever since. Baseball America ranked him 5th in the organization and 90th in all of baseball in 2020, before Carroll jumped to Arizona&#8217;s #1 slot in 2021. He&#8217;s currently ranked 5th overall by BA, 3rd by FanGraphs, while ESPN and Keith Law of The Athletic consider him the best prospect in the sport.\nThe fact that Carroll is so highly regarded is hardly surprising, given his tremendous performance on the field thus far in his career. After being drafted in 2019, at just 18 years of age, he got into 42 games between rookie ball and low-A, hitting .299/.409/.487 in that span. The pandemic wiped out the minors in 2020, but Carroll reportedly continued to impress at the club&#8217;s alternate training site that year. 2021 was a mostly lost season, as Carroll tore the capsule of his non-throwing shoulder, ending his campaign after just seven games.\n\nHowever, Carroll has gotten right back on track here in 2022, showing no ill effects from the shoulder surgery he underwent last year. Through 58 Double-A games, he hit 16 home runs, stole 20 bases and walked in 14.8% of his plate appearances. His .313/.430/.643 batting line was 66% better than league average by measure of wRC+. He was promoted to Triple-A and has played 33 games there thus far, hitting seven more long balls, swiping 11 more bags and hitting .287/.408/.535, wRC+ of 135.\nDefensively, Carroll has primarily played center field in the minors, though with some time in the corners as well. It&#8217;s unclear where the Diamondbacks intend to play Carroll in the majors, but they will have an embarrassment of young talent in the outfield either way. Alek Thomas, himself a highly regarded prospect coming into the year, was promoted in May and has been getting the lion&#8217;s share of playing time in center. He&#8217;s hit just .243/.294/.369 through his first 92 MLB games for an 84 wRC+, though his glovework has been highly rated across the board.\nBeside Carroll and Thomas, the club has many options to fill out the remainder of its outfield picture. Daulton Varsho and Jake McCarthy are both having strong seasons as well and each comes with at least four years of club control beyond this one. Stone Garrett was also recently called up, having hit very well in a five-game showing so far. Jordan Luplow is also on hand due to his strong numbers against lefties. He&#8217;s slumped a bit in that regard this season but could be retained via arbitration for another two seasons if he still fits into Arizona&#8217;s plans. Assuming Carroll sticks with the big league club the rest of the season, he will earn just over a month of service time, putting him on track to reach free agency after the 2028 campaign, unless future optional assignments end up pushing that back.\nIt&#8217;s been a rough few years in the desert, with the D-Backs currently 59-67, likely to finish below .500 for a third straight season. However, they have already guaranteed themselves a record well ahead of last year&#8217;s 52-100 mark, with plenty of reasons to be excited about the future. Their stockpile of young, cheap and controllable outfield talent is perhaps the best reason to feel hopeful, with Carroll considered by many to be the most exciting of the bunch. Over the remaining few weeks of the schedule, the club will give him a chance to show his skills at the sport&#8217;s biggest stage and potentially lock down a place on the grass for years to come.\nImage courtesy of USA Today Sports.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/3617574-five-midterm-lessons-from-this-years-special-elections/",
        "description": "This year’s special elections have offered a glimpse into how voters may behave in November.\n\n\n\nWhile Republicans saw an early success in a Texas House district, Democrat Pat Ryan’s win in New York on Tuesday was a major boon for the party.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, special elections are an imperfect indicator. Turnout tends to be lower, political winds can shift quite a bit before November’s midterms and the special elections were held using pre-redistricting maps.\n\n\n\nBut, taken together, they can provide an early look at the national mood and what political forces the parties will need to contend with.\n\n\n\nHere are five lessons from this year’s special elections:\n\n\n\nThings may not be as bad for Democrats as once feared\n\n\n\nThe election outlook for Democrats, particularly in the House, has been bleak for most of the year. Republicans appeared on track to make significant gains in the lower chamber, banking on a poor national environment for President Biden and congressional Democrats, along with the historic advantage a first-term president’s opposing party has during the midterms. \n\n\n\nWhile Democrats are still projected to lose the House, a series of special elections this summer brought a newfound optimism that any “red wave” could be smaller than expected. \n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report declared Wednesday that the “Red Wave Looks More Like a Ripple,” while the election handicapper FiveThirtyEight posted the headline “Yes, Special Elections Really Are Signaling A Better-Than-Expected Midterm For Democrats.”\n\n\n\nDemocrats have outperformed expectations in all four special elections since the Supreme Court struck down federal abortion protections, including Ryan’s win over Republican Marc Molinaro in New York’s 19th District, considered a bellwether for November.\n\n\n\nAlso on Tuesday, in the Empire State’s 23rd Congressional District, Democrat Max Della Pia came up short against Republican Joe Sempolinski but performed much better than expected in the rural House district.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn Alaska, a state former President Trump carried by 10 points in 2020, Democrat Mary Peltola leads the field for the at-large House seat, though the state’s new ranked-choice voting system means the race has not yet been called.\n\n\n\n“We have had a summer of strength, and we're going to buck history by making history,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chairman Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) said in an interview on NBC’s \"Meet the Press\" last week. \n\n\n\n“The other side has had a summer of stumbles, obstructing veterans' health care, ripping away 50 years of reproductive freedom, and now trying to defund the FBI and ignore a serious threat to our national security with Trump's latest scandal,” he said. “We're going to address real problems. We think that's going to bring it home.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbortion could be a galvanizing issue for voters in the general\n\n\n\nPolitical experts and observers were skeptical about the impact the issue of abortion would have on midterm races.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile polls showed that a clear majority of Americans disagreed with the Supreme Court decision, economic issues continuously topped the list of voter concerns and priorities. \n\n\n\nA vote on a Kansas ballot measure that would have stripped abortion protections from the state’s constitution was the first sign of the issue’s strength. In a red state, the measure went down by double digits.\n\n\n\nBut skeptics pointed out that the vote involved a direct yes or no question for voters. It remained unclear whether a candidate could galvanize voters on the issue alone.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe results of the race in New York’s 19th District appeared to answer that question.\n\n\n\nRyan leaned heavily into the issue, while Molinaro messaged on the state of the economy and crime. Ryan rolled out his first television ad of the campaign cycle, which focused on abortion, less than an hour after the Supreme Court announced its decision to strike down protections for the procedure. Since the district is considered a bellwether going into the general, Democrats say Ryan’s victory shows the issue of abortion access could extend beyond their base voters to swing voters. \n\n\n\nOn top of that, Democrats have improved their standing on the generic ballot since Roe was overturned, going as far as to hold a small lead over the GOP. A Politico-Morning Consult poll released last week showed Democrats with a 4-point lead over Republicans on the generic ballot. \n\n\n\nOf course, there could be other external factors at play, and the environment could shift between August and November. However, Democrats are already signaling how confident they’re feeling on the issue. \n\n\n\nIn the Texas gubernatorial race, Democrat Beto O’Rourke rolled out his first general election ads of the cycle choosing to focus on abortion restrictions in the state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSuburban voters remain key&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe special elections have shown that suburban voters continue to remain a crucial voting bloc. \n\n\n\nThe election in New York’s 19th District was a key example. The current district spans the mid-Hudson Valley region and other areas south of Albany. It stretches to the northernmost part of the greater New York metropolitan area.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe suburbs represent an interesting conundrum for both parties this election cycle. While many suburban voters could be considered fiscally conservative and more attracted to Republican candidates on issues of economics, many also say they lean more liberal on social and cultural issues — such as abortion access. \n\n\n\nAdditionally, experts argue that Trump’s involvement in the midterms, in general, may not help his party’s standing with suburban voters. Suburban voters play an integral role in propelling Democrats to the House majority in 2018, while they also propelled them to the Senate majority and White House in 2020.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, suburban voters cover a wide swath of views, and it’s unclear how the results in the 19th District will transfer to other areas. On top of that, Republicans are going to up the ante in terms of making the election more about inflation and Biden rather than abortion and Trump. \n\n\n\nRepublicans see gains with Latino voters\n\n\n\nThe GOP has seen significant progress in recruiting both Latino candidates and Latino voters, and that dynamic was on full display in the special election for Texas’s 34th Congressional District.\n\n\n\nRepublican Mayra Flores defeated Democrat Dan Sanchez by nearly 8 points in the South Texas, majority-Latino district.\n\n\n\nWhile Republicans have made slow but steady progress in the border districts, Flores’s win represented a pretty dramatic shift for the district. Biden won the district by 4.2 points in 2020, while former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton won it by 21.5 points in 2016. \n\n\n\nFlores’s win came less than two years after Florida Republicans flipped key House seats by winning the Latino vote and after Democrats blamed their losses in Texas on a lack of outreach to Hispanic voters. The GOP aims to continue that trend.\n\n\n\nFlores’s win also appears to reflect the success of Republican messaging on inflation, crime and the flow of migrants over the southern border as well as the increased GOP investment in Latino voters. \n\n\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee says it has recruited a total of 102 Hispanic candidates in this cycle, while the Republican National Committee launched an initiative earlier this month that aims to help immigrants prepare for the naturalization test.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Latino voters are by no means a monolith, the issue of abortion could end up playing well for Republicans in among large swaths of the voting bloc, considering its historically social conservative lean.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump, Biden effects unclear\n\n\n\nTrump’s effects on the primaries have been clear, but a big question remains: What impact will Trump and Biden have on the midterms?\n\n\n\nThis year’s special elections do not give a clear answer. According to FiveThirtyEight, Biden currently has a 41.6 approval rating, while Trump clocks in at a 41 percent favorability rating.   \n\n\n\nWhile Biden’s approval ratings are still relatively low, a number of down-ballot Democrats, including those who ran in special elections this year, appeared to perform better than expected or win. \n\n\n\nTrump does not have great approval ratings either, and Democrats are increasingly looking to tie GOP candidates up and down the ballot to him. \n\n\n\nNeither played a major role in the special elections this year, instead opting to focus more on the primaries and the general election.&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/3618895-nfls-aaron-rodgers-says-joe-rogan-helped-him-develop-covid-19-game-plan/",
        "description": "Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers said podcaster Joe Rogan helped him develop a game ahead of his COVID-19 diagnosis last year, which ultimately revealed that he had misled the public about his vaccination status. \n\n\n\nRodgers and Rogan have been prominent COVID-19 vaccine skeptics. The four-time NFL MVP claimed ahead of last season that he had been \"immunized\" against COVID-19, which was interpreted as confirmation that he was vaccinated, until he contracted COVID-19 and was forced to miss a game due to being unvaccinated. \n\n\n\nDuring an appearance on the “Joe Rogan Experience” podcast, Rodgers thanked Rogan for his advice on treating COVID-19, also noting that he appreciated hearing previous guests on the show discuss “their own ideas about COVID.\"\n\n\n\n“I really appreciate you and you helping me out during that time,” Rodgers told Rogan on Saturday’s episode, saying that he reached out to the podcast host about COVID at the start of the last season. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“And you know, you helped me with…a game plan to be ready in case I did get COVID. And I followed it to a tee and when I got COVID, you know within 36 hours I was, you know, symptom-free and feeling amazing,” Rodgers said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRogan and Spotify, which has an exclusive deal to distribute his podcast, faced fierce backlash earlier this year for spreading disinformation on COVID-19 and vaccines. Spotify added a warning to some episodes, but did not remove them. \n\n\n\nRodgers also told Rogan that he calculated his now infamous “immunized” response to the media last season, saying that he didn't want to dodge the question because it would have conveyed that he wasn't vaccinated. \n\n\n\n“I thought there’s a possibility that I say, ‘I’m immunized,’ maybe they understand what that means, maybe they don’t. Maybe they follow up. They didn’t follow up,” Rodgers added. “So then I go&nbsp;[into] the season, them thinking, some of them, that I was vaccinated.”\n\n\n\nWhen the media did follow up with questions suggesting they interpreted the response as Rodgers being vaccinated, asking what he thought about unvaccinated teammates, Rodgers responded that he had no judgement about what others did with their bodies. \n\n\n\n\"But I knew at some point if I contracted COVID, or if word got out, because it's the NFL and there's leaks everywhere, it was possible I'd have to answer the questions,\" he said. \n\n\n\n\"And then sure enough, I contract COVID...and that's when the shit storm hit. Because now I'm a liar and I'm endangering the community, my teammates, all these people, and you know, the attempted take down of me and my word and my integrity began.\"",

        "description": "Rock legend Ozzy Osbourne said he is \"fed up\" with gun violence in America and plans to move back permanently to England.\n\n\n\nOsbourne told The Guardian in a story published Sunday that he plans to sell his Los Angeles, Calif., home in Hancock Park and move to a 350-acre estate in southeast England by February.\n\n\n\nThe metal singer said he was making the move because \"everything's ridiculous\" in the U.S.\n\n\n\n\"I’m fed up with people getting killed every day. God knows how many people have been shot in school shootings,\" Osbourne said, explaining he does not want to \"die\" in America and that it was time to return to his home country. \n\n\n\nOsbourne, who was born near Birmingham, England, has listed his Los Angeles home in Hancock Park for $18 million, according to recent reports. \n\n\n\nIn March, he said he would move to his estate in Buckinghamshire because of high California taxes, according to the Daily Mirror.\n\n\n\nOsbourne, 73, has a host of health issues, including a struggle with Parkinson's disease. He underwent a surgical operation this summer. \n\n\n\nBut Osbourne's wife, Sharon, said their decision to move was not based around his health.\n\n\n\n\"America has changed so drastically,\" she told The Guardian. \"It isn’t the United States of America at all. Nothing’s united about it. It’s a very weird place to live right now.”\n\n\n\nExtreme polarization has been highlighted by investigations into former President Trump and the Supreme Court's overturning of Roe V. Wade and the nearly 50-year constitutional right to abortion. \n\n\n\nOsbourne is a pioneer in the rock and metal world, having co-founded the band Black Sabbath in 1968 before launching a successful solo career.\n\n\n\nThe singer's new album, Patient Number 9, is slated for a Sept. 9 release and features other musical legends, including Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Black Label Society's Zakk Wylde and the late Foo Fighters drummer&nbsp;Taylor Hawkins.",

        "description": "Marijuana use reached a record high in new polling, as for the first time more Americans said they smoke marijuana than reported smoking cigarettes in the last week. \n\n\n\nSixteen percent of Americans in a new Gallup poll reported smoking marijuana, up from 12 percent last year and more than double the all-time low of 7 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFewer Americans, at 11 percent, reported smoking cigarettes in the past week, down from 16 percent last year and a far fall from a peak at 45 percent in the 1950s.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s the highest percentage of reported marijuana use and the lowest percentage of past-week cigarette use since Gallup started asking those questions in 2013 and 1944, respectively.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNearly half of U.S. adults now report having tried marijuana, up from 4 percent when Gallup first surveyed about its use in 1969. \n\n\n\nDespite increasingly common use of the drug, Americans remain evenly split on whether marijuana is having a negative or positive effect on society. \n\n\n\nYet more than two-thirds of Americans, at 68 percent, think the drug should be legal, a record-high maintained from last year’s polling.\n\n\n\nSix states could vote on ballot measures legalizing marijuana in the November midterm elections, and should they pass, will join 19 others in legalizing recreational marijuana.\n\n\n\nConducted July 5-26, the surveys on marijuana and tobacco use polled 1,013 U.S. adults and had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4 percentage points at the 95 percent confidence level.",

        "description": "On the Beach\n\nStriking photograph by John Darch who, like the fine photographer he is, waited until all the ingredients &#8212; including the reflection of the horse in the wet sand &#8212; were present before pressing the shutter.\n\nQuote of the Day\n\n&#8220;The first rule of tinkering is: Save all the parts&#8221;\n\n\nDavid Mamet\n\n\nMusical alternative to the morning’s radio news\nMiles Davis | It Ain&#8217;t Necessarily So\nLink\n\nVideo of the Day\nThis is an extraordinary short film written by James Graham which was originally screened on the Financial Times site. I’m struck by it because I’m a Professor of the Public Understanding of Technology and this seems to me to be a brilliant example of how to foster that understanding in a compelling way.\nIt’s 18 minutes long, and really worth it.\nSo click here to see what I mean.\n(And thanks to John Thornhill for helping me locate a copy.)\n\nLong Read of the Day\nA small slice of networking history\nThe precursor of the Internet we use today was the ARPAnet, a packet-switched network funded by the Pentagon’s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the late 1960s. Much to the astonishment of the military-industrial complex of the time, the contract to build the experimental network went to Bolt, Beranek and Newman (BBN), a small tech company based in Boston, Mass.\nThe purpose of the ARPAnet was to link a number of large, expensive mainframe computers that ARPA had funded in various research labs across the US. One of the defining (and to ARPA’s bosses, infuriating) characteristics of these behemoths was that they could not communicate with one another. They were all build by different manufacturers and, in a sense, incompatible by design. So the BBN team decided to build a number of identical minicomputers — called Interface Message Processors or IMPs — that would sit alongside the mainframes. Each IMP would be programmed to communicate with its neighbouring giant, but would also be able to communicate with its fellow-IMPs on other sites. So at the core of the new network was a set of IMPs.\nThe IMPs were actually modified versions of a minicomputer manufactured by Honeywell, and the software for them was written by three programmers at BBN — Bernie Cosell, Will Crowther and Dave Walden.\nThe first IMP was shipped to UCLA in September 1969, followed by the second one, which went to the Stanford Research Institute (SRI) a month later. The story of the first message exchanged between these two IMPS became famous in computer lore. Here’s how I told it in my history of the Net. The IMP, I wrote,\n\nwas about the size of a refrigerator, weighed over 900 lbs. and was enclosed in battleship-grey steel, exactly to military specifications &#8211; to the point where it even had four steel eyebolts on top for lifting by crane or helicopter. The UCLA crew manhandled in to its assigned room next to the UCLA host machine &#8211; a Scientific Data Systems Sigma-7 &#8211; and switched it on. The IMP worked straight out of the crate, but for the moment it had nothing to talk to except the Sigma-7. It takes two nodes to make a network. A month later, on October 1, 1969, the second IMP was delivered to Stanford Research Institute and hooked up to its SDS 940 time-sharing machine. With both IMPs in place and both hosts running, a two-node network existed &#8211; at least in principle. The moment had arrived to see whether it worked in practice.\nWhat happened was the kind of comic event which restores one’s faith in the cock-up theory of history. The UCLA and SRI sites were linked by telephone, so human dialogue accompanied this first step into the unknown. It was decided that the UCLA side would try to log on to the SRI machine. Years later, Leonard Kleinrock, in whose UCLA Lab the first IMP had been installed, related what happened in an E-mail message to the New Yorker writer, John Seabrook:\n\n”As soon as SRI attached to its IMP, under my directions, one of my programmers, Charley Kline, arranged to send the first computer-to-computer message. The setup was simple: he and a programmer at SRI were connected via an ordinary telephone line and they both wore headsets so they could talk to each other as they observed what the network was doing. Charley then proceeded to ‘login’ to the remote SRI HOST from our UCLA HOST. To do so, he had to literally type in the word ‘login’; in fact, the HOSTS were smart enough to know that once he had typed in ‘log’, then the HOST would ‘expand’ out the rest of the word and add the letters ‘in’ to it. So Charley began. He typed an ‘l’ and over the headset told the SRI programmer he had typed it (Charley actually got an ‘echo’ of the letter ‘l’ from the other end and the programmer said “I got the l”.) Then Charley continued with the ‘o’, got the echo and a verbal acknowledgement from the programmer that it had been received. Then Charley typed in the ‘g’ and told him he had now typed the ‘g’. At this point the SRI machine crashed!! Some beginning!\n\n\nI love this story. It is about a hinge of history; and yet the drama is undermined by farce which brings everything back to earth. It was the beginning of the wired world &#8211; a moment as significant in its way as the moment Alexander Graham Bell muttered “Mr. Watson, come here, I want you” into his primitive apparatus. When Charley Kline typed his L he was taking mankind’s first hesitant step into Cyberspace. And the first result of his step was a crash!\nWhen BBN shipped the IMP to UCLA, Bernie Cosell went with it just to make sure that nobody messed with it. I’ve often wondered what he did afterwards, which is why it was lovely the other day to stumble on this story by Randy Walker in Cardinal News, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news site that serves Southwest and Southside Virginia.\n\nTurns out that Bernie worked at BBN until he and his wife retired, bought 72 acres in rural Virginia, built a dream house (inspired by Frank Lloyd Wright’s Fallingwater) on it and started keeping Merino sheep.\nHe won’t go down in history as one of the Internet pioneers — like Vint Cerf or Bob Kahn or Leonard Kleinrock or Donald Davies or Paul Baran. But then that’s also true of the many graduate students who worked on the project. “I will”, he told Randy Walker, “be at best a footnote”.\nWell, yeah. But the UCLA IMP worked out of the box. And footnotes matter too. Ask any academic.\n\nTwitter’s whistleblower has pitched up at a very inconvenient moment\nYesterday&#8217;s Observer column&#8230;\n\nEx-Twitter exec blows the whistle, alleging reckless and negligent cybersecurity policies,” said the CNN headline. My initial reaction? Yawn… so what’s new: a social media company playing fast and loose with its users’ data? And who’s this whistleblower, anyway? A guy called Peiter Zatko. Never heard of him. Probably another tech bro who’s discovered his conscience…\nBut what’s this? He has a nickname – “Mudge”. (Cue audio of pennies dropping.) The mainstream media calls him a “hacker”, which is their usual way of undermining a gifted software expert. Which this Mudge certainly is. In fact, in that line of business, he has blue-chip status. He was the highest-profile member of a famous hacker thinktank, the L0pht (pronounced “loft”) and a member of the well-known cooperative Cult of the Dead Cow. In that sense, he was a pioneer of “hacktivism” who has spent much of his life trying to educate the world on cybersecurity and has a long list of discovered vulnerabilities to his credit.\nDuring the Clinton administration, he was apparently sometimes involved in national security council briefings of the president&#8230;\n\nDo read the whole thing.\n\nThis Blog is also available as a daily email.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3618966-student-loan-forgiveness-should-backfire-on-biden/",
        "description": "President Biden has&nbsp;announced&nbsp;that the federal government will forgive $10,000 in student loan debt for Americans making less than $125,000 annually as well as extend the student loan repayment moratorium.&nbsp;This plan is&nbsp;estimated&nbsp;to cost taxpayers $330 billion and should be seen as the most unfair, outrageous, and disgraceful decision in many years.&nbsp;The president is telling Americans that they do not have to bear any responsibility for their voluntary obligations in borrowing money or going into debt. His proposal is also regressive and inflationary, and possibly unconstitutional.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nForgiving student loans disproportionately benefits those with higher incomes. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, more than 70 percent of the debt forgiveness would be&nbsp;given&nbsp;to households who are in the top 60 percent of income distribution.&nbsp;The president’s proposal will force middle and low-income Americans who have paid off their student loans or never attended college in the first place pick up the tab for higher-income Americans who decided to take on substantial student loan debt and have not yet fully paid off their loans. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublicans and conservatives are not the only ones concerned about this fiscally reckless proposal. Larry Summers, an economic adviser to former President Barack Obama and secretary of the Treasury under former President Clinton,&nbsp;said&nbsp;“the student debt relief is highly regressive as higher income families are more likely to borrow and to borrow more than lower income families.&nbsp;Adults with student loans have much higher lifetime incomes than those without.”&nbsp;Former Obama Council of Economic Advisors Chairman Jason Furman,&nbsp;said&nbsp;that forgiving student loan debt benefits recent college graduates at the expense of both the rich and poor.&nbsp;&nbsp;He&nbsp;tweeted&nbsp;that it would be reckless to add gasoline on the inflationary fire and the loan forgiveness would go beyond the president’s campaign promise of $10,000 in student loan relief while violating his promise his proposals would be paid for.&nbsp;In April 2022, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.)&nbsp;said&nbsp;that President Biden does not have the power to forgive student loans.\n\n\n\nThe White House’s plan to forgive student loan debt is just another example of Democrats completely shunning fiscal responsibility. Almost immediately upon taking office, President Biden and Democrats in Congress authorized $1.9 trillion in the unnecessary and wasteful American Rescue Plan Act of 2021&nbsp;(ARPA), which was followed by the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act&nbsp;(IIJA). Just two weeks before his student loan forgiveness plan was announced, Congress passed and President Biden signed into law the so-called&nbsp;Inflation Reduction Act&nbsp;of 2022, which authorized $433 billion in new government spending and raised taxes by $739 billion. It supposedly would reduce the deficit by $300 billion, but that would be completely offset by the cost of the student loan forgiveness plan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe unfairness of student loan forgiveness was highlighted in a series of articles that demonstrated the personal sacrifice made by tens of millions of Americans who took the responsibility to pay off their loans. Michelle Schroeder-Gardner, who&nbsp;accumulated&nbsp;$40,000 in debt to obtain her master’s degree from the University of Missouri, paid off her loan in eight months by working beyond her 40-hour weekly job. Rutgers University&nbsp;graduate&nbsp;Pathik Oza had $70,000 in loans and started a used book business to earn enough income to pay it off within two years.&nbsp;And a Florida couple who had a combined $203,000 in student loan debt set up a&nbsp;budget&nbsp;system that allowed them to pay it all off in 27 months.&nbsp;Instead of congratulating and emulating these hard-working Americans who have demonstrated fiscal, personal, and moral responsibility, the White House is spitting in their faces along with everyone else who has paid off their loans or their children’s loans. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nCitizens Against Government Waste has long been arguing against student loan forgiveness, including naming both Rep. Alexandria&nbsp;Ocasio-Cortez&nbsp;(D-N.Y.) and Education Secretary Miguel&nbsp;Cardona&nbsp;as Porkers of the Month for their support of this terrible idea.&nbsp;President Biden’s announcement is the latest, and likely not the last, example of how he and Democrats in Congress have completely given up on any sense of fiscal sanity. This regressive plan would force those who never attended college or have paid off their loans to bail out those higher-income Americans who have failed to pay off their completely voluntary debts. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Biden’s decision is both pandering to progressives and pushing for votes in the congressional elections in November 2022 and presidential election in 2024. But the plan may backfire, as the motivation to oppose candidates who are forcing voters to pay for someone else’s loans could end up being far stronger than the White House may think.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEric Maus is Federal Affairs Associate at CAGW.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/red-sox-designate-hirokazu-sawamura-for-assignment.html",
        "description": "The Red Sox are evidently taking multiple steps to shake up their bullpen, with right-hander Hirokazu Sawamura designated for assignment, according to Pete Abraham of the Boston Globe. That&#8217;s the second such move of the night, as lefty Austin Davis is reportedly being designated as well. Chad Jennings of The Athletic tweets that Zack Kelly and Kaleb Ort will take the open roster spots. Alex Speier of the Boston Globe had previously mentioned Kelly as a possibility.\nSawamura, 34, had pitched in 10 seasons in Japan’s Nippon Professional Baseball before signing a two-year deal with the Red Sox prior to the 2021 campaign. Coming into today&#8217;s action, he had thrown in 103 games with a 3.16 ERA between last year and this year. His 22.5% strikeout in that time is around league average, though his 12.8% walk rate is definitely on the high side. He has been able to limit damage by keeping the ball on the ground, as evidenced by his 51.9% ground ball rate.\nThere are some reasons to be somewhat bearish on Sawamura, as his .267 career BABIP is below the .290 league average. That might be somewhat related to his ground ball tendencies, but he&#8217;s also been hit hard. His 45.9% hard hit rate is about ten points above league average and only in the fifth percentile among MLB pitchers. He&#8217;s also been trending in the wrong direction, having registered a 2.48 ERA through July 23 this year but a 5.40 mark since.\nBetween the Sawamura and Davis moves, it seems the club felt it necessary to make changes to a relief corps that has been fairly disappointing. The club&#8217;s combined bullpen has a 4.49 ERA that ranks 26th in the majors. Although some advanced metrics are a bit kinder, none of them view the group as elite.\nSawamura&#8217;s contract came with a split option for 2023, with various escalators in play. MLBTR&#8217;s Anthony Franco recently looked at that option, noting that the club option had already increase to $3.6MM. Since that writing, it has ticked up to $3.7MM and still had room to climb. If the club had declined that option, Sawamura would have had the ability to trigger a player option, which had reached $1.9MM as of today and could still have grown further. It seems the Red Sox didn&#8217;t intend to trigger their end of the deal and are cutting Sawamura loose.\nSince the trade deadline has now passed, the Sox will have no choice but to put Sawamura on outright waivers or release waivers.  If he were to pass through waivers, the Sox would remain on the hook for the remainder of his salary for this season, as well as the $1MM buyout on the 2023 option. As Sawamura has less than three years of MLB service time and has not been previously outrighted in his career, he would not have the ability to reject an outright assignment.\nOrt, 30, is already on the club&#8217;s 40-man roster, having thrown 15 innings this year with an ERA of 9.00. But as for Kelly, this will be the first addition to a big league roster for the 27-year-old. Having previously spent time in the systems of the Athletics and Angels, he was released and signed a minor league deal with the Red Sox prior to the 2021 season. This year, he&#8217;s spent the entire season in Triple-A, throwing 49 2/3 innings with a 2.72 ERA and excellent 34.4% strikeout rate, though a high walk rate of 12%. Boston will give him a chance to see if he can carry any of those strong numbers over to the majors.",

He sent a message on Signal to a friend: “Am I imagining this? I may be being paranoid, but why am I having access difficulties with Twitter?” He was not paranoid. Myanmar’s Twitter block had accidentally cut Twitter access to at least half a billion internet users. The same dynamic was repeated in March 2022, when Russia inadvertently cut access to Twitter across Europe with a block designed for its own people.The mechanics of the internet mean that blocks on access imposed by one country may leach over the borders on to neighbouring populations, or even be felt half a world away by users in different continents.

        "description": "Zelenskiy holds secret meeting with armed forces and intelligence chiefs; towns across river from Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant fired upon, Ukraine saysSee all our Ukraine war coverageVolodymyr Zelenskiy, Ukraine’s president, held a secret meeting with representatives of Ukraine’s defence and security sectors on Sunday. “All the issues we considered are important, but secret, I cannot go into detail,” he said. The meeting was attended by the heads of the armed forces, intelligence agencies, the ministry of defence, the ministry of internal affairs, the Ukrainian security service as well as other defence forces.Russian artillery fired at Ukrainian towns across the river from the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, local officials said on Sunday. The regional governor, Oleksandr Starukh, said Russian forces struck residential buildings in the main city of Zaporizhzhia and the town of Orikhiv farther east. Ukraine’s military reported shelling of nine more towns in the area on the opposite side of the Dnieper river from the plant.The UN nuclear watchdog is waiting for clearance for its officials to visit the plant “to help stabilise the nuclear safety and security situation there”. The Energoatom head, Petro Kotin, told the Guardian a visit from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) could come before the end of the month, but the Ukrainian energy minister, Lana Zerkal, told a local radio station she was not convinced Russia was negotiating in good faith.The US has said Russia does not want to acknowledge the grave radiological risk at Ukraine’s Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, adding that was the reason it blocked a nuclear non-proliferation treaty deal’s final draft. “The Russian Federation alone decided to block consensus on a final document at the conclusion of the Tenth Review Conference of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Russia did so in order to block language that merely acknowledged the grave radiological risk at the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant in Ukraine,” said a US state department statement.Concern about the potential risk of radiation leaks at the plant persists. Ukrainian and Russian authorities issued fresh warnings about the risk of radioactive leaks, after shelling that the sides blamed on each other. Ukraine’s state energy operator warned there are “risks of hydrogen leakage and sputtering of radioactive substances”. Russia has ignored widespread international calls for the area to be demilitarised.Ukrainians are likely to experience their coldest winter in decades, its gas chief has said, as the thermostats on its Soviet-era centralised heating systems are set to be switched on later and turned down. Yurii Vitrenko, the head of the state gas company Naftogaz, said indoor temperatures would be set at between 17-18C, about four degrees lower than normal, and he advised people to stock up on blankets and warm clothes for when outdoor temperatures fall to and beyond the -10C winter average.Germany is replenishing its gas stocks more quickly than expected despite drastic Russian supply cuts and should meet an October target early, the government has said. Europe’s largest economy is heavily dependent on Russian gas and has raced to bolster its reserves before winter, crediting energy-saving measures in recent weeks and massive purchases of gas from other suppliers.EU foreign ministers are expected to suspend Russian tourist visa facilitation next week. The EU move falls short of an outright ban but would make getting travel documents significantly more complicated and expensive. The EU foreign policy chief, Josep Borrell, said a ban would lack the necessary support. “I don’t think that to cut the relationship with the Russian civilian population will help and I don’t think that this idea will have the required unanimity,” he told Austria’s ORF TV on Sunday.

        "description": "A 24-year-old man from Memphis, Tenn., was the latest American killed in the conflict in Ukraine, according to reports that he died fighting Russian forces in the contested Donbas region.\n\n\n\n\"American mercenary was destroyed in Ukraine,\" Russian official Oleg Kozhemyako in a Telegram post, Newsweek reported. \n\n\n\nThe governor of Russia’s eastern Primorsky Krai region, Kozhemyako reportedly said Primorsky \"Tiger\" Detachment volunteers killed the U.S. citizen “in the first clash literally immediately after arriving at the front line!\" \n\n\n\nReports say Kozhemyako also shared images of a U.S. passport and Ukrainian military card, but outlets have not named the victim.\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the State Department for more information. State confirmed the death of an American to USA Today, but declined to confirm his identity. \n\n\n\nThe American is said to have been killed in the Donbas region, where much of the recent fighting has been focused.\n\n\n\n“Donbas is almost destroyed by Russian strikes, devastated. The proud and glorious Ukrainian Donetsk was humiliated by the Russian occupation and robbed,” Ukrainian President Zelensky said Sunday in an address.\n\n\n\n“Russia brought the most terrible thing there — absolute disregard for the value of any life, absolute disrespect for anyone. The invaders brought degradation and death.”\n\n\n\nA number of American deaths have now been reported in Ukraine during the war, including video journalist Brent Renaud, U.S. Marine veteran Willy Joseph Cancel, Stephen Zabielski and Jimmy Hill, who was killed while waiting in a bread line.\n\n\n\nVolunteer soldiers Luke Lucyszyn and Bryan Young were reportedly ambushed by Russian tanks and killed in the Donetsk region in eastern Ukraine in July.&nbsp;",

The lawyers have offered up a variety of arguments on his behalf that have yet to do much to fend off a Justice Department that has adopted a determined, focused and so far largely successful legal approach.”\n\n\n\n“Often tinged with Mr. Trump’s own bombast and sometimes conflating his powers as president with his role as a private citizen, the legal arguments put forth by his team sometimes strike lawyers not involved in the case as more about setting a political narrative than about dealing with the possibility of a federal prosecution.”",

        "description": "Alice Ingabare&nbsp;leads the development of the World Benchmarking Alliance’s Access to Seeds Index, which advances sustainability in the seeds industry.\n\n\n\nClimate change is already causing famine.\n\n\n\nThe Horn of Africa is currently in the grip of&nbsp;one of the worst hunger crises of the last 70 years, and global warming has a direct impact on this catastrophe, as rising temperatures mean the region’s also suffering one of the most devastating droughts in decades. Millions of people’s lives are currently at risk due to failed harvests, mass livestock deaths and water shortages.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs this unfolding disaster demonstrates, the climate emergency and starvation are linked. After all, you can’t farm arid, infertile or flooded land, and extreme weather patterns are making it harder for farmers to produce food all over the world. The problem is worse in the Global South, however, where the climate is already hotter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKicking off today, Africa Climate Week will feature food security high on its agenda. We need an urgent global effort to improve food security and shape climate resilience, thereby preventing more mass famine. And it’s not just governments and politicians who need to act, the private sector bears a big responsibility too.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs things currently stand, 350 companies account for more than half of the world’s food and agriculture revenue — and many of them have a presence in the Global South. Directly employing over 23 million people, these influential businesses have a disproportionate impact on food systems through their supply chains.\n\n\n\nAt the World Benchmarking Alliance, we hold the world’s most powerful companies to account for their climate change efforts, giving them the tools to measure their progress toward meeting the United Nations’ goal of achieving “Zero Hunger.” And our research shows these 350 influential food and agriculture businesses aren’t on track to transition to a sustainable food system, which would keep the planet healthy and everyone fed.\n\n\n\nMany companies are simply continuing to operate as if it’s business as usual. And too many of them that dominate our global food system aren’t putting people at the heart of their business, or addressing their environmental impact. \n\n\n\nA boy seeds his family&#8217;s land in the village of Wereb Michael, a rural area 15 km from Bahir Dar, Ethiopia | Eduardo Soteras/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\nProviding sustainable livelihoods for farmers, decent employment for workers and nutritious choices for consumers — without depleting natural resources — is essential. Yet, most key companies perform very poorly in these areas. For example, only 26 out of the 350 have even set reduction targets for greenhouse gas emissions aligned with the Paris Agreement, while 189 of them are yet to set deforestation targets.\n\n\n\nWithout these companies, we can’t drive the changes that will create a fairer, greener and more efficient food system. And as temperatures continue to rise, global food and agricultural businesses need to recognize the inextricable link between tackling climate change and eradicating hunger. Put simply, the private sector has an essential role in ensuring everyone has enough to eat.\n\n\n\nThe way for big corporates to improve food security and climate resilience in Africa is to empower farmers — especially smallholders, who make up the continent’s primary food producers. They should be supported to increase food production, meet future food demands and end hunger without depleting natural resources.\n\n\n\nThis can all realistically be achieved. For a start, companies should provide these farmers with access to good quality seeds, as well as agrochemicals like fertilizers and pesticides. They must introduce them to other reputable global traders and buyers as well, so they can widen their customer base. Crucially, global companies should also support African farmers’ transition to regenerative agriculture — a conservation approach to farming, designed to work in harmony with nature by prioritizing soil health and biodiversity.\n\n\n\nAs well as helping achieve the U.N.’s Sustainable Development Goals, this strategy is also the best way forward economically. Companies can double food production and income, while creating more resilient supply chains. It’s an environmental and socioeconomic win.\n\n\n\nHowever, this support must be offered in a spirit of partnership. As the power of developing economies grows, world geopolitics are shifting, and Africa is fast moving from climate victim to climate vanguard. With 60 percent of its population aged under 25, the continent has a growing young workforce and unparalleled expertise in terms of food production on the very frontline of the climate crisis. There is much the West can learn here.\n\n\n\nWe are living in unstable times, and feeding the world is becoming harder. Ongoing conflicts and the COVID-19 pandemic have disrupted the global food system, and supply chains have been broken or altered. Food prices are rising, and climate change is making the situation much worse.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAll these issues contributed to the current famine in East Africa. And all these issues will continue to converge and create more hunger in other parts of the world — unless we act now.\n\n\n\nThe consequences of not doing so are unthinkable.",

        "description": "MUNICH — Beneath the Bavaria statue which towers above the Oktoberfest, a coronavirus testing facility has been replaced by a beer tent.\n\n\n\nFurther along the Theresienwiese — the Meadow of Therese — where the Oktoberfest is set to welcome millions of guests after a two-year pandemic hiatus, drought and baking summer heat have left patches of grass scorched and yellow.\n\n\n\nThese traces of the world&#8217;s big crises remain visible in Munich, where they&#8217;ve sparked a debate about whether the time is right for Oktoberfest revelry.\n\n\n\nThe historic beer gathering welcomes millions of visitors from around the world, drives the Bavarian economy, occasionally provides tales of tax fraud and substance abuse, assumes an air of importance by welcoming international celebrities like the Clintons, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Usain Bolt, and has inspired a Netflix miniseries &#8220;Oktoberfest: Beer &amp; Blood.&#8221;\n\n\n\nBeer festival chiefs, for their part, are raising a glass now that a third successive cancellation is essentially off the table. \n\n\n\n&#8220;In Bavaria, we can currently see that people are not deterred from visiting fairs and beer festivals after a two-year break,&#8221; said Clemens Baumgärtner, a local politician from the conservative Christian Social Union (CSU) and the city&#8217;s official &#8220;Oktoberfest boss,&#8221; who supervises the event.\n\n\n\nBavaria&#8217;s state premier, Markus Söder, also from the CSU and a former coronavirus hard-liner, has been advocating a return of the beer festival, an attitude some have ascribed to his thirst for beer drinkers&#8217; approval one year ahead of Bavaria&#8217;s next state election. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n&#8220;I&#8217;m very confident that we will have a very well attended Oktoberfest this year,&#8221; Baumgärtner said, pointing to the success of Munich&#8217;s spring festival.\n\n\n\nBeer backlash\n\n\n\nBut some dark clouds are gathering ahead of the fall party. \n\n\n\n&#8220;The Oktoberfest is to take place under bad energy omens,&#8221; Bavarian public broadcaster BR said this month, referring to Germany&#8217;s gas crunch and subsequent pressure to save energy. On top of that, &#8220;we will bitterly regret the Oktoberfest,&#8221; one doctor told German media, citing the surge of infections to be expected following the fun.\n\n\n\nSeptember has traditionally marked an uptick in coronavirus cases, compelling the government in 2020 and 2021 to reimpose restrictions to try to flatten the curve of infections.\n\n\n\nIn May, German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach said it was a &#8220;bold&#8221; idea to plan the Oktoberfest without pandemic precautions, but the famously hawkish Lauterbach has no say in whether the event goes ahead. Munich city chiefs run the show, and they&#8217;re ready to get the beers in. \n\n\n\nVisitors walk through the Theresienwiese fairground of the Oktoberfest beer festival in Munich | Christof Stache/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n&#8220;I cannot imagine that before the start on September 17, drastic measures for infection control or a ban on festivals will be enacted that would make it impossible for us to hold the event,&#8221; a defiant Baumgärtner said, adding that so far, everything is going &#8220;according to plan.&#8221;\n\n\n\nChristoph Spinner, pandemic representative at Munich&#8217;s Rechts der Isar Hospital, was phlegmatic about the Oktoberfest, telling POLITICO that while &#8220;public festivals are associated with an increased risk of respiratory illness,&#8221; it&#8217;s &#8220;quite understandable&#8221; that there&#8217;s a desire to &#8220;get public life back.&#8221; \n\n\n\nAnd anyway, it&#8217;s tricky to predict the fall&#8217;s infection patterns given the wide spread of forecasts, Spinner added. \n\n\n\nDisease and inflation\n\n\n\nResistance to skipping the Wiesn —&nbsp;meadow, as locals simply call it — is as old as reasons for canceling the event.\n\n\n\nIn 1866, there was an unsuccessful petition to let the beer flow despite the Austro-Prussian War, which is one item displayed in a new virtual exhibition on the Oktoberfest.\n\n\n\n&#8220;A very interesting source, from which you can see that already in the 1860s &#8230; certainly financially dependent beer tent hosts tried to protect the event,&#8221; said Julia Misamer, coordinator of the exhibition.\n\n\n\nOktoberfest was also canceled in 1854 and 1873 due to outbreaks of cholera in Munich that left thousands dead, including King Ludwig I&#8217;s wife Therese, whose wedding had been the original occasion to launch the tradition in 1810 on her eponymous meadow.\n\n\n\nMoney has been a perpetual concern at the Oktoberfest, including when it was canceled in 1923 and 1924 because the Weimar Republic&#8217;s hyperinflation had people shopping for bread with wheelbarrows of cash, rendering the idea of a massive beer party completely absurd.\n\n\n\n&#8220;The organization of the event was probably impossible because of the currency difficulties as hardly anything could have been sold at a reasonable price,&#8221; said Matthias Bader, project manager of the exhibition.\n\n\n\nWhether the beer — which is served in famous one-liter mugs — is sold at a &#8220;reasonable price&#8221; has been the subject of fierce debate for decades. This year the price per liter ranges between €12.60 and €13.80, on average 15.8 percent higher than in 2019 amid soaring inflation around the Continent.\n\n\n\nBut Oktoberfest boss Baumgärtner is relaxed, saying he heard that many stakeholders &#8220;would be happy even with fewer guests,&#8221; an understandable view given even half the wealth poured into city coffers, hotels and beer tent hosts&#8217; pockets would amount to a handsome total. In 2018, the festival was worth €1.2 billion to Munich&#8217;s economy.\n\n\n\nWartime Wiesn\n\n\n\nWhile this won&#8217;t be the first Oktoberfest held while there&#8217;s an ongoing war in modern Europe — see Yugoslavia in the 1990s — it&#8217;s the first time a moral debate has surrounded the event because of war, said Julia Misamer of the Oktoberfest exhibition.\n\n\n\nIn Munich, Mayor Dieter Reiter said in April that he can&#8217;t imagine &#8220;enjoying a joyful folk festival atmosphere while people are dying every day &#8230; in an unlawful and inhumane war, not even two hours by plane from Munich.&#8221;\n\n\n\nMunich Mayor Dieter Reiter | Joerg Koch/Getty Images\n\n\n\nBut, he continued, he would not want to impose his opinion on others who wish to attend, in case he be accused of &#8220;moralizing and pointing the finger.&#8221;\n\n\n\nDuring historic European conflicts, Bavaria was often more actively involved — with consequences for the Oktoberfest.\n\n\n\nNapoleon caused the first cancellation in 1813 because of his &#8220;German campaign,&#8221; while King Ludwig II decided to have his army fight on Prussia&#8217;s side against France in 1870, draining Munich of young men to drink beer and be merry. \n\n\n\nDuring World War I, Germany was at the center of a four-year conflict that devastated the entire Continent and put a stop to the Oktoberfest. Twenty years later, Nazi Germany unleashed the next world war, and Oktoberfest was canceled between 1939 and 1945. \n\n\n\nAs Russian President Vladimir Putin maintains his brutal assault on Ukraine, Germany has faced calls to take a firmer stand against Moscow — particularly given the Nazis&#8217; crimes on Ukrainian soil in the global conflict.\n\n\n\nBut it&#8217;s not a reason to cancel the Oktoberfest, according to Frank Hakelberg, head of the German Association of Showmen, for whom the beer festival is one of the year&#8217;s biggest events. \n\n\n\n&#8220;As much as we regret it, there are wars and conflicts all over the world all the time and the people in the affected regions are not helped if we cancel our events,&#8221; he said.\n\n\n\nOr as the mayor put it: &#8220;In the end, everyone has to decide for themselves whether and how much they want to party at a folk festival.&#8221;",

        "description": "Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fl.) on Saturday named teachers’ union chief Karla Hernández-Matz as his running mate in his bid to unseat Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in November.\n\n\n\n“Meet the next lieutenant governor of Florida,” Crist said at a rally Sunday, announcing the addition of Hernández-Matz to the Democratic ticket.\n\n\n\nHernández-Matz is president of the United Teachers of Dade, a union representing some 30,000 employees of the Miami-Dade County School System. Crist called her a \"caring, loving, empathetic, compassionate\" running mate who would help him \"touch all of Florida.\"\n\n\n\n\"That's what we don't have in the governor's office right now. And that's what you deserve to have in the governor's office,\" Crist said.\n\n\n\nDeSantis has been a leading GOP voice in national culture wars, and polls as the strongest potential competition to former President Trump for the 2024 Republican nomination for president.\n\n\n\n“Are you sick of politicians who act like authoritarians trying to tear apart our democracy?\" Hernández-Matz said in a speech following Crist's announcement. \"Well I am, and that’s why we are here today. To defeat Ron DeSantis and bring decency and respect back to the state of Florida.\"\n\n\n\nCrist, who once held the state’s governor seat as a Republican and is on his second bid to reclaim the office as a Democrat, has focused on abortion in his campaign and promised to sign an executive order to protect abortion in Florida if he wins. \n\n\n\nDespite DeSantis leading Crist in fundraising and some polls, the lawmaker described Florida as “imminently winnable” for Democrats and argued DeSantis is preoccupied with a potential presidential bid.\n\n\n\n“When you look at Florida today it's about a third registered Republican, about a third registered Democratic, and about a third registered independent. That's really the definition of a swing state. So I think our chances are very good,\" Crist said Sunday on CNN’s “Newsroom.”",

(KTVX) - A man is dead after falling from the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park, authorities have confirmed. \n\n\n\nFriday afternoon, the Grand Canyon Regional Communications Center received a report of a visitor who fell from the rim west of the Bright Angel Point Trail on the North Rim of Grand Canyon National Park.\n\n\n\nResponding rangers located the body of a 44-year-old man approximately 200 ft. below the rim. The visitor was reportedly off the trail when he accidentally fell off the edge.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tPart of a foot, in a shoe, spotted floating in Yellowstone hot spring\t\n\n\n\n\nThe man has not yet been identified, and additional details have not yet been released. An investigation into the incident is being conducted by the National Park Service and the Coconino County Medical Examiner's Office. \n\n\n\nRangers say visitors should remain on designated trails and walkways, staying a safe distance from the edge of the rim. \n\n\n\nEarlier this summer, a Tennessee woman died in the park after falling into the Colorado River while on a commercial river trip. A few days prior, another woman died after rangers received reports of a hiker in distress.",

        "description": "New York Times: “As the partial release of the search warrant affidavit on Friday, including the May 25 letter, illustrated, Mr. Trump is going into the battle over the documents with a hastily assembled team. The lawyers have offered up a variety of arguments on his behalf that have yet to do much to fend off a Justice Department that has adopted a determined, focused and so far largely successful legal approach.”\n\n\n\n“Often tinged with Mr. Trump’s own bombast and sometimes conflating his powers as president with his role as a private citizen, the legal arguments put forth by his team sometimes strike lawyers not involved in the case as more about setting a political narrative than about dealing with the possibility of a federal prosecution.”",

        "description": "The Cubs will be traveling to Toronto for a three-game series that begins tomorrow, though left-hander Justin Steele and right-hander Adrian Sampson will not be making the trip. They will instead be placed on the restricted list, tweets Gordon Wittenmyer of NBC Sports Chicago. That&#8217;s standard procedure for players unvaccinated against COVID-19, as current health restrictions prevent such individuals from crossing the American-Canadian border.\nNormally, the club wouldn&#8217;t be able to make corresponding moves right away, as league rules dictate starting pitchers aren&#8217;t eligible to be replaced until four days after they last pitched in these circumstances. Sampson started today&#8217;s game, though Meghan Montemurro of the Chicago Tribune tweets that he will indeed be eligible to be replaced due to having thrown less than four innings today. Steele, on the other hand, threw 5 1/3 innings on Friday, meaning the Cubs should be able to bring in someone else to take his spot by Tuesday.\nAlthough no moves have been made official just yet, Montemurro relays that left-hander Brendon Little and right-hander Jeremiah Estrada are with the team. Neither are currently on the club&#8217;s 40-man roster, but they will likely be added as COVID &#8220;substitutes&#8221; and subsequently removed after the series without having to be exposed to waivers.\nThe 26-year-old Little was selected by the Cubs 27th overall in the 2017 draft. That high draft selection got him onto Baseball America&#8217;s list of top prospects in Chicago&#8217;s system in 2018 and 2019, though he&#8217;s since lost his spot on that list. This year, he&#8217;s thrown 39 Triple-A innings with a 4.15 ERA, 23.8% strikeout rate, 11.6% walk rate and 62.6% ground ball rate.\nEstrada, 23, was a sixth-round pick in 2017. He&#8217;s spanned three levels this year, from High-A to Triple-A, faring well at each stop. Through 48 1/3 combined innings for the season, he has a 1.30 ERA with an incredible 40.4% strikeout rate, along with a 10.4% walk rate.",

        "description": "Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) on Sunday warned of “riots in the streets” if former President Trump is prosecuted for his handling of classified materials found when the FBI searched his Mar-a-Lago home.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If there's a prosecution of Donald Trump for mishandling classified information, after the Clinton debacle… there'll be riots in the streets,” Graham told former South Carolina congressman Trey Gowdy, who now hosts Fox News’ “Sunday Night in America.”\n\n\n\nTrump shared a clip of the interview on Truth Social later Sunday evening. \n\n\n\nGowdy was chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, which probed the 2012 terror attacks in Libya that left four Americans dead and uncovered a private email server used by Clinton.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGraham expressed concern that Trump is treated with “a double standard” and repeated his warning of riots regarding the Georgia special grand jury investigating attempts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 election results in the state.\n\n\n\nGraham himself has been subpoenaed in that probe in connection with phone calls made to Georgia election officials seeking to change the election results in the state. \n\n\n\nThe South Carolina senator on Sunday also talked about claims that the FBI was told to “back off” investigating Hunter Biden's laptop to keep stories about the president’s son out of headlines ahead of the 2020 election.\n\n\n\n“Most Republicans, including me, believes when it comes to Trump, there is no law. It's all about getting him,” Graham said.\n\n\n\n“I've never been more worried about the law and politics as I am right now,” he added. \n\n\n\nUpdated: 11:13 p.m.",

        "link": "https://www.politico.eu/article/mi6-russia-hackers-used-a-pro-brexit-ex-mi6-boss-and-a-left-wing-labour-firebrand-in-its-ukraine-war/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication",
        "description": "LONDON — In the disinformation drive around the war in Ukraine, even eccentric academics lunching with their grandsons can become collateral damage.\n\n\n\nAt first glance, Gwythian Prins, a professor at the London School of Economics, seems an unlikely target for Russian hackers seeking to discredit the British government. Yet the faceless hackers who broke into and published Prins&#8217; personal emails revealed not only harmless discussions of his day-to-day life — including family lunches in rural England — but also extraordinary claims about an establishment plot to control the British government.\n\n\n\nThe hackers&#8217; real target, it seems, was Prins&#8217; retired friend and supposed co-conspirator, Richard Dearlove, with whom he frequently exchanged encrypted emails. Dearlove, an ardent Brexiteer, is a former boss of MI6, the top British spy agency made famous by the James Bond movie franchise.\n\n\n\nFurther attacks on prominent British political figures have followed. Suspected Russian hackers also targeted the Marxist activist Paul Mason, a former economics journalist on British TV news, and now a well-known political commentator who has urged fellow left-wingers to back British efforts to face down Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\n\nBoth hacks are now subject to intensive investigations by the British security services, POLITICO can reveal. \n\n\n\nAnd both targets — though on opposite ends of the political spectrum — have one thing in common: Their personal emails swiftly appeared on fringe far-left websites, alongside forcefully-written narratives attacking the victims&#8217; motives but bearing questionable relation to the actual contents of the emails. These claims were then noisily amplified across like-minded corners of the internet, damaging the reputations of all involved.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&#8220;We’ve seen the Russian playbook enough times to know what it looks like — and this is it,” said one person caught up in the hacks. “It&#8217;s low-tech, but it’s sophisticated.”\n\n\n\nRoss Burley, co-founder of the Centre for Information Resilience, explained: &#8220;Each day, the Kremlin and actors linked to it use disinformation, cyber attacks and propaganda to confuse and disrupt. No one is immune from the threat.”\n\n\n\nHe added: “They are constantly adapting new techniques and channels to target journalists, politicians, government officials, academics and civil society actors with a variety of influence operations — including so-called ‘hack and leak’ operations.”\n\n\n\nPicking targets\n\n\n\nExperts warn that state-linked hackers, or even freelancers who sell their illegally-obtained wares to higher powers, frequently stalk LinkedIn and other social networks with fake profiles to figure out who is talking privately to whom, before launching attacks on multiple targets within groups of friends or colleagues.\n\n\n\nIn the case of the Brexiteers, the outspoken Professor Prins appeared a good bet. \n\n\n\nA passionate pro-Brexit thinker, boasting contacts both inside the U.K. government and among hardline backbench Conservative MPs during the Brexit battles in the wake of the 2016 referendum, Prins was sure to have a colorful inbox.\n\n\n\nThe MI6 building at Vauxhall is the headquarters of the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) | Chris Ratcliffe/Getty Images\n\n\n\nPrins is an unusual figure in the academic world. He has written articles for Net Zero Watch, a fringe campaign group that boasts the famously climate-skeptic former chancellor, Nigel Lawson, as a board member. He has also peddled unsubstantiated claims that Putin could have Parkinson&#8217;s disease.\n\n\n\nPrivate emails he sent at the height of Britain&#8217;s Brexit drama in 2018 and 2019 were first published in April 2022, a few weeks after Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine, on a tailor-made pop-up website. As you&#8217;d expect, the emails are full of humdrum references to his home life — trips out with his grandson, a concert in rural Herefordshire, his exercise regime. Such private details are now public property, thanks to hackers clearly seeking a grander target.\n\n\n\nThe leaks website, named &#8220;Sneaky Strawhead&#8221; in an apparent attempt to link the emails to Britain&#8217;s blonde-haired prime minister, Boris Johnson, also claimed the messages contained sensational proof that &#8220;coup plotters&#8221; now ran the U.K. government. The website alleged that ex-MI6 chief Dearlove &#8220;together with his former colleagues and CIA cronies conducted [a] successful intelligence operation against No. 10.&#8221; The implication was that Johnson — Ukraine&#8217;s closest ally since the invasion — had been installed as prime minister following a secret plot by the elderly Brexiteers.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the emails reveal no such thing. \n\n\n\nWhat is undoubtedly clear from reviewing the scores of leaked messages is that Prins and others in their network were indeed discussing ways to secretly discredit then-Prime Minister Theresa May at the height of the struggle over Brexit. \n\n\n\nPrins and his pen pals were frustrated that the Brexit deal May was negotiating would have left Britain closer to the EU than alternatives pushed by Euroskeptics, and were desperate to influence the process before it was too late. But taken together, they reveal little more than a group of well-connected but hapless senior citizens proposing outlandish ideas, while lacking the levers to bring about change.\n\n\n\n&#8216;Maximum intelligence&#8217;\n\n\n\nSomewhat incredibly, the emails include talk of retired MI6 boss Dearlove commissioning research operations against the most senior British officials involved in the negotiations. Dearlove complains about the &#8220;mafia of disloyal civil servants (cardinals of the old church)&#8221; overseeing the Brexit talks — but in the end, the chatter comes to nothing, after the former spook reports his sources have no valuable intelligence.\n\n\n\nElsewhere, Prins claims that Dearlove wants to get the “maximum intelligence” on anti-Brexit campaign group Best for Britain “and their co-conspirators.” He enthuses about suggestions Dearlove could even get former CIA colleagues involved. &#8220;He says that the people he has in mind are highly expert at this sort of espionage,&#8221; Prins tells an associate, excitedly. Again, the proposal appears to come to nothing.\n\n\n\nThere is also excitement around a set of supposed leaked notes of an alleged conversation between May and then-German Chancellor Angela Merkel, suggesting the British side ultimately hoped to return to the 27-nation bloc.\n\n\n\n“Is this maskirovka [a term for Russian military disinformation]? Is it genuine? Is it fake kompromat?&#8221; Prins asks his friends, and briefly mulls using the document to hold the prime minister to ransom, signing off his email with a flourish: &#8220;Yours bloodthirstily.&#8221; But the group soon decide the so-called leak was indeed “poisoned bait for us to eat.”\n\n\n\nIndeed, at times Prins appears to be seeking a conspiratorial coup even more shocking than the overblown writeup of his operation suggests. Yet in the end, the group is powerless, and their exchanges are laced with paranoia. At one point, Prins even questions whether Dearlove, the former intelligence boss, can be trusted as “one of us.” \n\n\n\nPrins declined to speak to POLITICO. Dearlove could not be reached, although has published an article in the Spectator confirming the hack was genuine.\n\n\n\nSir Richard Dearlove was the director of Secret Intelligence Service operations | Cate Gillon/Getty Images\n\n\n\nFrom rogue site to hard-left debating circles\n\n\n\nAfter weeks of sitting on the internet, the cache of Brexiteer emails was picked up by fringe website the Grayzone, which promises &#8220;original investigative journalism&#8221; on &#8220;politics and empire&#8221; and has earned praise from Hollywood director Oliver Stone, famous for his interest in — and occasional embrace of — conspiracy theories.\n\n\n\nThe Grayzone has a reputation for pushing stories that match some of the narratives of Kremlin propaganda, as well as the propaganda of authoritarian regimes such as China and Syria.\n\n\n\nThe leak was written up by Kit Klarenberg, a British-born reporter working in Serbia, who has credits on Kremlin-controlled sites Russia Today and Sputnik, among others. His article sought to amplify the significance of what had been uncovered. “These efforts could amount to charges of TREASON,&#8221; he wrote.\n\n\n\n&#8220;I do have a rather dramatic way of writing, I suppose, but I&#8217;ve certainly not consciously set out to exaggerate the significance of this,&#8221; Klarenberg told POLITICO in a phone interview.\n\n\n\nHe argued that the Brexiteer group was undoubtedly discussing how to undermine a democratic process through &#8220;subversive&#8221; means, and that even if the plans came to nothing, the actors involved do hold influence in government. He also suggested the leak shone an important light on how Westminster pressure tactics can actually work. \n\n\n\n&#8220;To someone like yourself, who&#8217;s been writing about politics from the inside — in the Westminster village or whatever you want to call it — this is probably very normal,&#8221; Klarenberg said. &#8220;To the average person, this is quite sociopathic, actually.&#8221; \n\n\n\nDearlove&#8217;s take, as told to the Spectator, is very different. &#8220;A number of citizens, concerned that the Brexit vote of 2016 was being subverted, met in a pub to see whether they could do something about it,&#8221; he wrote. &#8220;You might think this was a perfect example of grassroots democracy — except that nothing came of it, and the little group never met again.&#8221;\n\n\n\nThe experience, he added, has been unsettling for friends who saw their private lives and messages published online. &#8220;Given my professional formation, I am not particularly phased by this sort of thing,&#8221; Dearlove wrote. &#8220;But for others involved it was both a novelty and provoked a mixture of anger, worry and farce. One told me it felt like being in a real-life Ealing comedy&#8221; — a reference to the much-loved farcical British movies of the 1940s and 50s.\n\n\n\nCampaign against Mason\n\n\n\nThe leaks to Klarenberg did not end there.\n\n\n\nSince the start of June, the Grayzone has published a string of his articles based on leaked emails from former Channel 4 journalist Mason, and those around him. The pieces appear intent on discrediting Mason, suggesting he is a propaganda mouthpiece for the British secret services.\n\n\n\nThe site highlights Mason’s efforts to fight pro-Russia narratives online, among academics and on the far left. It cites his private communications with an official working on disinformation in the U.K. Foreign Office as evidence of a nefarious plot.\n\n\n\n“Are his activities influenced by shadowy state actors?” Klarenberg asked readers of Mason in June.&nbsp;A later Grayzone article questioned whether an attempt by Mason to become a member of parliament was “part of a U.K. intelligence operation to destroy the anti-war left,” given his past contact with the Foreign Office. Mason has refused to comment on the content of the emails, which he said &#8220;may be altered or faked,&#8221; and warned that &#8220;Grayzone’s publication has the effect of assisting a Russian state-backed hack-and-leak disinformation campaign.&#8221;\n\n\n\nExperts assume both hacks were classic phishing scams — and point to a hacking outfit named Cold River | Andrew Milligan &#8211; WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\n\n\nSome who have studied the Mason hack argue the motive was to paint all left-wing opposition to the invasion of Ukraine as an establishment stitch-up. Mason has vocally supported sending British arms to Ukraine to help its defense against Russia — a controversial view among some on the far left.\n\n\n\n&#8220;The circumstances of the attack suggest it is highly likely that a Russian state or state-backed unit carried out the attack,&#8221; Mason wrote in a personal blog. He declined to comment when approached by POLITICO.\n\n\n\nWartime propaganda\n\n\n\nIndeed, the working assumption among those who have studied both hacks is that Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine provides the underlying motivation for the entire operation, seeking to undermine figures across the British landscape who have spoken out against Putin.\n\n\n\n“In targeting Dearlove, what [the hackers] were trying to do was destabilize Boris Johnson,” said one observer who has studied the hack-and-leak tactics. “It was about suggesting he was brought to power by a bunch of former spooks in a coup.”\n\n\n\n“Some of our Brexiteers have been quite outspoken in defending Ukraine and criticizing Russian aggression,” Dearlove noted in his article following the hack.\n\n\n\nExperts assume both hacks were classic phishing scams — and point to a hacking outfit named Cold River, which has worked against firms operating in the Middle East and ramped up its work since the Ukraine invasion.\n\n\n\nAlso known as Callisto and the Reuse Team, the group has targeted U.S. think tanks, NATO offices and militaries in Eastern European nations, according to Google hacking experts and other tech assessors.\n\n\n\nThe group is thought to use “credential harvesting” plants in emails and online documents, which trick people into submitting usernames and passwords on sites that appear genuine, according to an assessment POLITICO has seen. In both the U.K. cases, ProtonMail inboxes were hacked — despite the email provider&#8217;s reputation for security.\n\n\n\n“Expert examination, since confirmed by Google’s security teams, indicates that this was not some spare-bedroom hacker, but an operation so sophisticated that it could only have been done by a state actor,” wrote Dearlove.\n\n\n\nOnce the content is obtained, it is shared by foreign sites and on social media platforms like Telegram, before ending up on custom-made U.K.-focused sites, or handed to blogs known for spinning source material through an anti-Western prism. \n\n\n\nKlarenberg said the leaks came to him via burner email accounts. \n\n\n\nHis position is that the origin of the material is irrelevant, so long as it is real. &#8220;If the material is factually accurate, then irrespective of the source, I think it should be published,&#8221; he argued, insisting both stories contained enough red flags to be newsworthy.\n\n\n\nHe also dismissed the focus on whether the leaks were linked to the Kremlin. &#8220;If the CIA hacks Chinese, Russian or Iranian government computers, and then releases the content, do journalists sit there thinking — &#8216;this is coming from an agency that has been engaged in all manner of morally reprehensible skulduggery all over the world for decades?'&#8221; he asked. \n\n\n\n&#8220;I don&#8217;t think journalists in the Western world have those kinds of considerations.&#8221;\n\n\n\n&#8216;The threat will only increase&#8217;\n\n\n\nEfforts to counter hacking and its fallout are now an industrial-sized operation inside the British government. “The scale of malevolent cyber activity is so great that it’s hard to keep track of,” admitted one former security minister. \n\n\n\nThe work now spans great swathes of Whitehall. Serious incidents are investigated by its National Cyber Security Centre, while the Home Office is responsible for prosecuting people where relevant. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office monitors hostile states, while the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport tries to increase resilience against fresh attacks. \n\n\n\nSecurity officials refused to comment on the record for this piece, but a government aide noted: “There is a massive Russian campaign to hack individuals everywhere — both personal and work emails. That has been the case long before Ukraine.”\n\n\n\nNevertheless, that Russian campaign only appears to be growing in the wake of the Ukraine invasion, with Moscow intent on sowing seeds of doubt about the actions and motives of its enemies. “&#8217;Hack and leak&#8217; is a classic technique to cause embarrassment and discombobulation,” said an ex-Cabinet minister.\n\n\n\nBurley, from the Centre for Information Resilience, said: “As the pressure ramps up in Ukraine, we can expect those on the front line of the information war to be targeted. I imagine the threat will only increase.”\n\n\n\nHe added: “It’s all about creating chaos, like the Joker in the Batman film &#8216;The Dark Knight,&#8217; who wants to burn the world down. It’s about seeing what sticks.”\n\n\n\nMark Scott contributed reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of&nbsp;POLITICO Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one-stop-shop solution for policy professionals fusing the depth of POLITICO journalism with the power of technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive, breaking scoops and insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomized policy intelligence platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-level public affairs network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY GO PRO\n\n\n\nLOG IN",

        "description": "KOHTLA-JÄRVE, Estonia — Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine is prompting Estonia to turn back to dirty oil shale as it deals with soaring energy prices and the need to replace energy imports from Moscow.\n\n\n\nEstonia is the only country in the world where oil shale historically supplied a majority of energy, accounting for 73 percent of primary energy supply in 2018. But burning oil shale, which has a higher carbon intensity than coal, gave Estonia the second-highest per capita carbon dioxide emissions in the EU in 2020.\n\n\n\nThe oily rock can be mined and burned for power or heating like coal, transformed into liquid fuels, or used for chemical manufacturing.\n\n\n\nWhen Prime Minister Kaja Kallas came to power last year, hot on the heels of the EU’s Green Deal, she pledged to end oil shale use for electricity production by 2035 and to stop using the solid fossil fuel in the entire energy sector by 2040. \n\n\n\nThe country had been making rapid progress, with consumption of oil shale extracted by the state-owned Eesti Energia falling from 16.6 million tons in 2016 to 7.9 million tons last year.  \n\n\n\nBut then came war in Ukraine, and the government&#8217;s decision to use oil shale to produce electricity and for home heating this winter rather than importing Russian gas and power. \n\n\n\n&#8220;Extraordinary measures must be used in exceptional circumstances. Fortunately, we have an alternative fuel,&#8221;&nbsp;Economy Minister Riina Sikkut&nbsp;said last month.\n\n\n\nThe government insists it will still hit its climate targets, but any reprieve for oil shale is welcomed by the industry.\n\n\n\n“This situation shows that having our own oil shale power stations is needed for Estonia — and I think this [reasoning] will apply for a long time,” said Andrei Zaitsev, chairman of the Narva Energia trade union representing oil shale workers in the northeastern region of Ida-Virumaa.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHando Sutter, the CEO of Eesti Energia, said his company is ready to boost production to 10 million tons.\n\n\n\n“This energy naivety era is over,” he said. “We very clearly understand in Europe today that we can&#8217;t rely so much on … not-so-friendly neighbors.”\n\n\n\nThe company had to “ramp up” extraction in its current mines, he said, and Eesti Energia will also open a new mine in around five years, depending on how fast current oil shale stocks are depleted.\n\n\n\nAndrei Zaitsev | Victor Jack/POLITICO\n\n\n\n“Our hope is that this war will be over very very soon,” he said, adding that for now the company is treating current needs as a “short-term crisis.” He insisted it “will not give up” on its aim to stop producing electricity from oil shale by 2030 and that the company is investing €2.5 billion over the next five years to quadruple its renewables capacity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Sutter admitted “there is a chance” that the company&#8217;s longer-term strategy could change if the war in Ukraine drags on.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClimate concerns\n\n\n\nThe country’s oil shale revival is also worrying local climate campaigners.\n\n\n\n“It’s a very backward move,” said Madis Vasser, a climate expert at the Estonian Green Movement NGO, adding that it could set back the country’s progress on emissions by five years. The current energy crisis admittedly is “a bad situation,” he said, but “for the NGO sector it looks like just another reason to … continue the status quo.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEstonia&#8217;s environment ministry did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\n\n\nHowever, the rethink is good news for miners in Ida-Virumaa, Estonia’s historical oil shale heartland that lies along the border with Russia. Eesti Energia has begun hiring 500 new workers in the sector since the war began, Sutter said.\n\n\n\n“Of course locals in Ida-Virumaa also want a greener environment and so on but they also want to eat and live somewhere,” said Sander Vaikma, president of the Energy Workers Union that represents over 1,200 workers in the sector.\n\n\n\nThat&#8217;s a big change from recent years, when decarbonization policies forced a downsizing. The national industry, which has five mines in operation, two of them owned by Enefit Power, an Eesti Energia subsidiary, has seen employment fall from about 6,500 people in 2019 — a level that hadn&#8217;t changed much in recent years — to about 4,800 at the end of 2020.\n\n\n\nJob cuts were done to “meet those climate targets,” set by the government, said Andres Vainola, Enefit&#8217;s chairman, adding that the company spent “millions” — along with the state — to pay redundant workers at least one-third of their salary for six months while they looked for new work.\n\n\n\nThat hurt the mining city of Kohtla-Järve, once a Soviet industrial powerhouse due to its abundant supplies of oil shale.\n\n\n\nExtraction there began at scale during World War I, but it was under Soviet occupation that the city&#8217;s mining capacities exploded. At its peak in the 1980s, the city had 90,000 residents, many coming from across the Soviet Union to work in the mines. It produced over 30 million tons of the solid fossil fuel a year.\n\n\n\nBut in recent years, the population in the economically depressed Ida-Virumaa area, where unemployment is more than double the national average, has shrunk by two-thirds. \n\n\n\nA mine in Ida-Virumaa | Victor Jack/POLITICO\n\n\n\n“It has been a very neglected area … it&#8217;s considered somehow alien by the mainstream Estonian elite,” said Eeva Kesküla, an anthropology professor at Tallinn University, “dirty, polluting foreign — and potentially disloyal.”\n\n\n\nJan, 72, a pensioner from Kohtla-Järve, has noticed the impact as oil shale downsized.\n\n\n\n“Of course it’s sad … there’s few people here now,” he said.&nbsp;“Young people left across the border to go work,” he added, including his son, now living in Finland. \n\n\n\nFor Zaitsev, the union leader, the shift in policy &#8220;is a favorable situation” for the sector. \n\n\n\nThe current EU energy security crisis, he said “clearly demonstrates” that the bloc’s “sudden transition” to carbon neutrality by 2050 is “likely not possible.” \n\n\n\n“Electricity is needed,” he said, “it’s only going to get worse.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of&nbsp;POLITICO Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one-stop-shop solution for policy professionals fusing the depth of POLITICO journalism with the power of technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive, breaking scoops and insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomized policy intelligence platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-level public affairs network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY GO PRO\n\n\n\nLOG IN",

During these dark times, I too need some joy, light and fun. And that involves all sorts of photos and videos which I would not like to see, and I know you would not like to see. It’s private, it’s joyful and it’s life,” Marin said in a tearful address after the video surfaced, per translations. \n\n\n\n“But I have not missed a single day of work, a single task, and I never will,” she added. \n\n\n\nThe prime minister admitted to partying and drinking alcohol at the event, but denied doing any drugs and took a drug test to prove it. The test was negative, according to The Guardian.\n\n\n\nShe told a Finnish newspaper that “it should be accepted that even decision-makers are dancing, singing and partying.”\n\n\n\nClinton praised Marin back in 2019, when she was sworn in as the world's youngest prime minister.\n\n\n\nMarin's popularity rating is near a record high, the New York Times reported.

        "link": "https://www.politico.eu/sponsored-content/five-reasons-europe-needs-to-do-better-on-biofuels/?utm_source=RSS_Feed&utm_medium=RSS&utm_campaign=RSS_Syndication",
        "description": "Crop-based biofuels are capped at a maximum of 7 percent of EU Member States’ transport energy mix.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe EU has taken important steps towards strengthening EU energy independence and food security while sticking to ambitious commitments in the fight against climate change. But it risks failing by overlooking an immediate, cost-effective and socially inclusive solution to all these challenges: sustainable biofuels.\n\n\n\nThe EU’s biofuels sector — including producers of renewable ethanol and biodiesel from crops, wastes, and residues — is well-placed to play a major role in these efforts. It operates at the crossroads of food and feed production, fossil-fuel substitution and European energy independence, greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) savings and the domestic bioeconomy.\n\n\n\nDespite this, the EU continues to restrict the use of this proven solution — and some are seeking further restrictions. Crop-based biofuels are capped at a maximum of 7 percent of EU Member States’ transport energy mix. This would have dire consequences for Europe’s goals for energy, food security and emissions-reduction.\n\n\n\nAs the European Parliament’s plenary prepares to vote on revising the Renewable Energy Directive, the question of whether the EU will make the best use of sustainable biofuels remains a crucial issue. There are many reasons why the EU should do better on biofuels. Here are five of them:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiofuels are strategically important for the EU energy independence\n\n\n\nSustainable renewable ethanol and biodiesel are proven to significantly reduce greenhouse-gas emissions from the petrol, diesel and hybrid cars, vans, trucks, and buses that continue to predominate on Europe’s roads. Sustainable biofuels deliver results now, without requiring new infrastructure investments. They are already making the biggest impact in displacing imported fossil fuel for road transport — and should be included in the EU’s strategy for reducing dependence on Russian oil. According to European Environment Agency’s monitoring of the fuels put on the road in 2019, renewable ethanol consumption helped displace about 3.6 Bl of fossil petrol, while biodiesel and Hydrotreated Vegetable Oil (HVO) helped displace about 17.3 Bl of fossil diesel.\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Biofuels contribute to Europe’s food security\n\n\n\nEU biofuels production creates food, feed and fuel, significantly strengthening Europe’s strategic autonomy by offsetting the need to import animal feed and displacing the use of crude oil in transport. For every liter of renewable ethanol made from cereals, 1 kilogram of highly Digestible Dried Distiller Grain with Solubles (DDGS) is produced. Similarly, every liter of biodiesel results in 1.5 kilograms of highly digestible rapeseed meal. Our sectors are vital to ensuring that the EU has additional domestic sources of high-protein and cellulosic animal feed as they produce critical renewable liquid fuels for the transport sector. There does not have to be a trade-off between the EU’s food security goals, its climate goals, and its independence objectives.\n\n\n\n3. European biofuel production is sustainable\n\n\n\nThe European Commission regularly confirms that biofuel production in the EU is sustainable. Cultivation of feedstock used in biofuel production compared to total agricultural commodities availability is limited and related environmental impacts are low. As the Commission has stated in the context of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, and its effects on global markets, there is no problem of food supply in Europe, but rather of food affordability. With increased production, use of fallow land and continued domestic supply of animal feed, EU agriculture can rise to the challenges of production and global food security.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor every liter of renewable ethanol made from cereals, 1 kilogram of highly Digestible Dried Distiller Grain with Solubles (DDGS) is produced. Similarly, every liter of biodiesel results in 1.5 kilograms of highly digestible rapeseed meal.\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Biofuels empower everyone to take part in the fight against climate change\n\n\n\nNot all Europeans can afford a new electric car, and not every EU country has infrastructure in place yet to support a fully electrified auto fleet. The transition to carbon neutrality must be socially inclusive. Even as the EU debates the specifics of ending sales of cars with internal combustion engines — whether petrol, diesel or hybrid — these vehicles will be everywhere on Europe’s roads for many years to come. Sustainable biofuels are the only way to immediately reduce emissions from vehicles — delivering tangible results in today’s infrastructure. They also bring significant economic benefits, boosting agricultural productivity and rural development.\n\n\n\n5. The EU needs to meet its climate targets\n\n\n\nThe equation is simple: without biofuels in the transport mix, Europe would be even more reliant on imported fossil fuels and more exposed to global market fluctuations. Crop-based biofuels represent today only 4.5 percent of EU’s transport energy mix, yet more than 60 percent of all renewables consumed in transport. With additional (and increasingly significant) biofuels from wastes and residues, biofuels accounted for over 90 percent of renewables in transport. They are by far the main renewable energy source in EU transport. Restricting the contribution of biofuels to achieving climate targets only opens the door for even more reliance on fossil fuel.\n\n\n\nThe entire EU Biofuels Value Chain — from farmers to processors to refiners — remains committed to delivering sustainable solutions to strengthen EU energy, food and feed independence. Biofuels are vital in decarbonizing the European transport sector and contribute to the EU’s long-term vision of achieving carbon neutrality by mid-century.\n\n\n\nThe question is whether EU policymakers are willing to make the same commitment.",

        "description": "Johnny Depp made a surprise appearance on the MTV’s Video Music Awards stage Sunday night, about two months after winning a defamation case against his ex-wife Amber Heard.  \n\n\n\n“I just want you guys to know that I'm available for birthdays, Bar Mitzvahs, weddings, wakes — any old thing you need,” Depp said, his face appearing on the face of the VMA’s iconic Moonman hovering above the stage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn another commercial break, Depp said, \"I needed the work.\"\n\n\n\nA Fairfax County Circuit Court jury awarded Depp $15 million in damages after finding Heard had defamed him in a 2018 Washington Post op-ed about sexual violence. Heard won $2 million in her countersuit.\n\n\n\nDepp left the courthouse to perform a concert in England while the jury deliberated, and wasn’t in the room when the verdict was read.\n\n\n\nDepp shared the clip from MTV's award show on Instagram with the caption “guess who?” \n\n\n\nDepp claimed that Heard’s accusations against him “had a seismic impact” on his Hollywood career, according to a statement from the “Pirates of the Caribbean” star after the ruling. \n\n\n\n“Six years later, the jury gave me my life back. I am truly humbled,” Depp said of the verdict.\n\n\n\nHeard maintains that her op-ed, which did not name Depp, did not defame him — and her legal team has appealed the decision.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"I’m heartbroken that the mountain of evidence still was not enough to stand up to the disproportionate power, influence, and sway of my ex-husband,” Heard said after the verdict.",

        "description": "The Rockies announced that left-hander Lucas Gilbreath has been placed on the 15-day injured list due to a left elbow flexor strain. In a corresponding move, right-hander Alex Colome went the other direction, getting reinstated from the IL. Patrick Saunders of the Denver Post tweets that Gilbreath will undergo an MRI.\nWhile the severity of the issue still isn&#8217;t known, it&#8217;s at least enough for Gilbreath to miss the next couple of weeks. An issue to a pitcher&#8217;s throwing elbow is always somewhat worrisome, though the club will surely get more information before deciding how to proceed. The Rox are in the basement of the National League West and won&#8217;t be in contention down the stretch, meaning there will be little incentive to rush him back to the mound.\nGilbreath has been an effective southpaw for Colorado over the past couple of seasons, registering a 3.78 ERA, not too shabby for someone who plays their home games at Coors Field. In 85 2/3 career innings, he has a 25% strikeout rate and 45.7% groundball rate, though an elevated 13.2% walk rate.\nSome other injury notes from the Senior Circuit&#8230;\n\nPhillies right-hander Zach Eflin is still trying to get back on the mound this season, having been on the injured list since late June due to a right knee bruise. Scott Lauber of the Philadelphia Inquirer tweets that Eflin might be able to throw a bullpen this week, with the aim of eventually returning as a reliever. Given that there&#8217;s just over a month remaining in the regular season, it would be difficult for him to build back up to a starter&#8217;s workload in time to make a significant contribution. The righty has quietly been an effective member of the rotation, having registered a 4.21 ERA over 98 games, 93 of them starts, going back to the beginning of the 2018 season. He is highly likely to reach free agency this year, as he and the Phils have a mutual option for 2023, with those provisions almost never being triggered by both parties. The club currently holds the second of three Wild Card spots in the National League and a postseason run could give Eflin more time to showcase his health before reaching the open market.\nReds righty Hunter Greene is set to head out on a rehab assignment, reports Bobby Nightengale of the Cincinnati Enquirer. He&#8217;s been out of action for over three weeks now due to a strain in his throwing shoulder, though appears to be slated to return after a couple of rehab outings. The highly-touted rookie is known for his tremendous velocity, though he&#8217;s yet to put it to great use at the big league level. He currently owns a 5.26 ERA after 102 2/3 innings in the majors, despite a strong 28.8% strikeout rate. When batters don&#8217;t strike out, they appear to be making good contact, as Greene&#8217;s barrel percentage is only in the league&#8217;s 10th percentile while his hard hit rate is in the 30th percentile. He&#8217;ll look to finish the season on a positive note before the winter begins. Greene, Nick Lodolo and Graham Ashcraft are all under 25 years old and showed intriguing skills in their debuts this year. The Reds will surely be hoping to maximize the talents of that trio in order to have a strong foundation of starting pitching to build around in the future.\nRighty Jack Flaherty is going to throw another rehab start on Wednesday before rejoining the Cardinals on Labor Day, tweets Jeff Jones of the Belleville News-Democrat. After an elite season in 2019 wherein he threw 196 1/3 innings with a 2.75 ERA, Flaherty is now in his third straight injury-limited campaign. He&#8217;s made just three starts this year in between IL stints due to shoulder injuries. If he&#8217;s able to return and flash his 2019 form, he&#8217;d be a tremendous difference maker for the Cards down the stretch and into the postseason. The club is currently 5 1/2 games ahead of the Brewers in the race for the division crown. Flaherty hasn&#8217;t allowed more than one earned run in each of his last three rehab outings.\nCubs lefty Wade Miley is still looking to make his way back to a mound before the season is out, speaking to Maddie Lee of the Chicago Sun-Times about his year. &#8220;I can’t shut it down,&#8221; Miley said. &#8220;If I want to keep playing baseball beyond this year, I have to prove to people that I’m not broke. And I don’t feel like I’m broke by any means.&#8221; After throwing 163 innings with a 3.37 ERA with the Reds last year, he was claimed on waivers by the Cubs but has been limited to just four starts and 19 innings here in 2022, due to various ailments, primarily in his throwing shoulder. He will be hoping to return to action and show some effectiveness before the end of the season, when he will become a free agent and turn 36 years old in November.",
