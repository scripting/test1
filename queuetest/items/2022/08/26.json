        "description": "Hayling Billy trail, Havant, Hampshire: These striking insects are clearly enjoying the heat – but there’s only so much of it they can standIt’s hot and humid, and without even a whisper of a breeze to temper the heat, the short walk into town feels like an effort. I’m not the only one struggling with the extreme temperature. Bumblebees usually throng the feral buddleia bushes and clumps of red dead-nettle that grow along the path, but today they’re conspicuous by their absence – their furry bodies make them susceptible to heat exhaustion and unable to forage or fly. The gregarious flocks of house sparrows that inhabit the hedgerows have fallen silent, two carrion crows are paddling listlessly in the shallows of the Lymbourne stream and a young blackbird lies prone on the path, wings splayed, head cocked and panting.But some like it hot. A stand of common hogweed is swarming with hundreds of common red soldier beetles (Rhagonycha fulva). These soft-bodied leatherwings are so-called as their orangey-red and black colouration is reminiscent of the red-coated uniform of the British army, but these insects prefer to make love, not war. They dedicate a significant proportion of their short lives to mating and are more popularly known as hogweed bonking beetles. True to form, pairs of insects cover the mattress-like umbels of white flowers, the smaller males piggybacking their paramours. A few females are attempting to shake off their suitors, curling their abdomens to avoid genital contact, but most couples are copulating. Continue reading...",

But call at cocktail hour and the same space feels deeply decadent, its 1970s bar and vast, butter-coloured sofa perfect for fun evenings. It is also a great advert for how to make a plain, rented flat feel like a home, without major renovations.A first viewing left interior designers Tatjana von Stein and Gayle Noonan distinctly underwhelmed. “It was a tired, unloved white box when we found it,” Von Stein says of the flat, which occupies the top two floors of a five-storey early 20th-century block in north London. Two bedrooms, a bathroom and the kitchen are on the lower level, while the spacious open-plan living-dining room is above. Continue reading...",

Its director and stars discuss the rich history of the format – and why it always returns in trying timesHold on to your deerstalkers: the whodunnit is back, with its trail of clues, its lineup of suspects and its well-timed doses of British bloody murder. It arrives when the country is sickly, like a bustling matron, to reassure us that evil will out and that justice prevails in the end. The genre abides by its own strict set of rules. Its predictability has become its USP. “It’s a whodunnit,” says the world-weary narrator at the start of See How They Run. “You’ve seen one, you’ve seen them all.”We have long since reached the point where every whodunnit is a whodunnit-this-time, another tour of the same old crime scene. Tom George’s spry, supple See How They Run is smart enough to acknowledge this, with a script that pokes fun at the grinding monotony of Agatha Christie’s The Mousetrap and a set of characters so schooled in the tropes of the genre that they are practically running on rails.

Unfortunately, I had not. I went into it blind and was soon in a state of nervous collapse from which I do not expect to recover any time soon.To explain. Selling Sunset was – still is, in fact, as it’s now in its fifth Netflix season and has been renewed for a sixth and seventh – a reality TV show set in the glitzy LA offices of high end real estate brokerage firm the Oppenheim Group, owned and run by twins Brett and Jason who have the looks and vibes that suggest worryingly close genetic ties to Voldemort. The Gucci-clad agents survive and seem somehow even to thrive in a maelstrom of ambition, personal enmities, borderline affairs, treacheries, bitching and Botox of an intensity that would fell any English person – and possibly quite a few non-Californians.

        "description": "Here’s the list of tech, entrepreneur, and nerd events for Tampa Bay and surrounding areas for the week of Monday, August 29 through Sunday, September 4, 2022. That’s right: we’re into September this week!\n\n\n\nEvery week, with the assistance of a couple of Jupyter Notebooks that I put together, I compile this list for the Tampa Bay tech community.\n\n\n\nAs far as event types go, this list casts a rather wide net. It includes events that would be of interest to techies, nerds, and entrepreneurs. It includes (but isn’t limited to) events that fall under the category of:\n\n\n\nProgramming, DevOps, systems administration, and testingTech project management / agile processesVideo, board, and role-playing gamesBook, philosophy, and discussion clubsTech, business, and entrepreneur networking eventsToastmasters (because nerds really need to up their presentation game)Sci-fi, fantasy, and other genre fandomsAnything I deem geeky\n\n\n\nBy “Tampa Bay and surrounding areas”, this list covers events that originate or are aimed at the area within 100 miles of the Port of Tampa. At the very least, that includes the cities of Tampa, St. Petersburg, and Clearwater, but as far north as Ocala, as far south as Fort Myers, and includes Orlando and its surrounding cities.\n\n\n\nThis week’s events\n\n\n\nI try to keep this list up-to-date. I add new events as soon as I hear about them, so be sure to check the latest version of this week’s list on Global Nerdy!\n\n\n\nMonday, August 29\n\n\n\nGroupEvent NameTimeLet&#8217;s Go!Job Interview Practice ~ Résumé &amp; Cover Letter Writing Help ~ Find A JobSee event pageLet&#8217;s Go!Job Interview Practice ~ Résumé &amp; Cover Letter Writing Help ~ Find A JobSee event pageJobFairXTampa Job Fair &#8211; Tampa Career Fair11:00 AM – 2:00 PM EDTYoung Professionals  Networking JOIN in and Connect!In person at Fords Garage St Pete11:00 AMChristian Professionals Network Tampa BayLive Online Connection Meeting- Monday11:30 AMEntrepreneurs &amp;  Business Owners of Sarasota &amp; BradentonVirtual Networking Lunch Monday11:30 AMProfessional Business Networking with RGAnetwork.netVirtual Networking Lunch11:30 AMThinkful TampaThinkful Webinar || Data Analytics: Tools of the Trade12:00 PM – 1:30 PM EDTTampa St Pete Stocks and Options  Trading GroupSuccess in Stagflation: Learn to Protect Your Wealth4:00 PMSCIPS, a 50+ Tampa Bay Singles ClubEUCHRE, Rummy Q and other Board Games for ENTHUSIASTIC GAME PLAYERS4:00 PMSuccess Strategies for Business OwnersHabilidades digitales para tareas cotidianas5:00 PMBeginning Web DevelopmentWeekly Learning Session6:00 PMCritical Hit GamesMTG: Commander Night6:00 PMBoard Game Meetup: Board Game BoxcarMonday Weekly Board Game Night!

Even in a year where energy prices have dominated the news agenda, this is a significant day: Ofgem, the UK industry regulator, is due to announce a change to the energy price cap – with prices expected to go up from October to an annual maximum of more than £3,500. That number could be a staggering £5,300 by the new year.For almost anyone, those prices will make a difference to their standard of living. But for the most vulnerable, such exorbitant costs will have a profound impact, and in many cases make an already difficult situation impossible.Education | Headteachers in England are calling on ministers to delay the return of pre-pandemic exam conditions for another year, after GCSE results showed a disturbing gap in attainment between pupils in the north and south.Ukraine | Volodymyr Zelenskiy has said the world narrowly avoided a “radiation disaster” as the last regular line supplying electricity to Ukraine’s Russian-held Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant was restored hours after being cut by shelling.Health | The health secretary has been confronted outside a hospital by a woman who angrily criticised the government for doing “bugger all” to fix record-high ambulance wait times. Steve Barclay was told the Conservatives had had “long enough” to fix the NHS by a visibly angry member of the public.Crime | Police say they have identified the second man seen fleeing the gunman who shot dead nine-year-old Olivia Pratt-Korbel. They said there had been “a number of very positive lines of inquiry” that could lead to identifying the gunman, who is still at large.Lobbying | A Conservative hereditary peer, the Earl of Shrewsbury, is under investigation for a second time by the House of Lords standards watchdog over allegations that he misused his parliamentary position to lobby for a firm that was paying him.Michael Cragg hails the return of Britney Spears, whose comeback single Hold Me Closer (a duet with Elton John) is a sign of “what could have been if Spears’ megawatt pop-superstar shine hadn’t been dimmed”. Hannah J Davies, deputy editor, newslettersBroadcaster Emily Maitlis delivered an excoriating lecture this week on the state of the BBC, criticising “both sidesism”, the “pacifying” of government officials and interference from “an agent of the Tory party” at her former employer.

Instead of revenge, she found a touch of transcendenceFive years ago, while on assignment in the Adirondacks – a New York state park with 2m acres of protected land – an over-confident outdoorsman attempted to dazzle me with his recent adventures. He mentioned that he’d just finished the Seven Carries, a historic canoe route through the Saint Regis Canoe Area.I was annoyed by the conversation – the notes of toxic masculinity, the sense that he was waiting for me to fawn – but intrigued by the route, and decided I would one day complete the Seven Carries myself.

Their main gripe is sameness: too blue, too green, too straight, too twee. Sometimes they say it’s not “real” enough, by which they mean they prefer the grot and slog of mud and mountains. I defy any of these people to walk from Seaton to Seatown and not admit they are, at least sometimes, completely wrong.Here on the Devon-Dorset border drama abounds. For centuries, the constant assault of waves and wind has warped the land and kept cartographers in work. Between Seaton and Lyme Regis, a series of landslips produced a five-mile undercliff, a rocky shoulder of clefts and gullies. The largest slump, on Christmas Eve 1839, dragged down a portion of wheatfield, somehow sufficiently undamaged for harvest the following summer. Farmers tried to keep the land in use, particularly with sheep, but the uneven terrain made things impractical and, after eventual abandonment, the place went wild – truly wild. Continue reading...",

In Maggie O’Farrell’s imagining of 16th-century Italian courtly life, manners make the man, clothes make the woman, and an image is more durable than a person.In 1558, Lucrezia, daughter of Cosimo de’ Medici, was married to Alfonso d’Este, the Duke of Ferrara. A year after entering her husband’s court in 1560, aged just 16, she died. Poison was suspected. Several portraits of Lucrezia survive. Nearly 300 years after her death, Robert Browning wrote My Last Duchess, a dramatic monologue in which Duke Alfonso displays a portrait of his late wife and allows the reader to deduce that – insanely jealous – he murdered her. Now O’Farrell has shuffled historical fact, portraiture and poetic fantasy together and used them as the basis for a piece of fiction in which a simple tale, of a girl forced too young into a dynastic marriage, is overlaid and embellished with elements from fairytale and myth.

        "description": "Today, legal news about the former president and members of his team revealed a group of people who appear to have ignored the law.&nbsp;&nbsp;The stories began with the release of the Department of Justice (DOJ) memo written for Trump&#8217;s attorney general Bill Barr arguing that Trump should not be charged with obstruction of justice over his attempts to shut down the Russia investigation despite his firing of Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) director James Comey, urging of witnesses not to &#8220;flip,&#8221; hints of pardons to those who stayed quiet, and so on. The memo seems clearly to have been a whitewash to justify Barr&#8217;s predetermined decision not to prosecute, illustrating the dangerous politicization of the DOJ.&nbsp;&nbsp;The memo argued that because special counsel Robert Mueller did not find enough evidence to charge Trump with conspiring with Russia, there was no crime committed, and thus Trump could not be charged with obstruction. In fact, Mueller noted in the report that the investigation was hampered by the president&#8217;s allies who refused to cooperate. Andrew Weissman, a 20-year veteran of the Department of Justice who worked on the Mueller investigation, concluded: &#8220;Key &#8216;reasoning&#8217; of&#8230;memo: if you successfully obstruct an investigation, you cannot be charged with obstruction as you were not charged with the crime under investigation. Future defendants will have a field day with this memo unless DOJ repudiates it soon.&#8221;Harry Litman, former U.S. attorney and now legal affairs columnist for the Los Angeles Times, noted that the principal author of the memo, Steven Engel, &#8220;is too good a lawyer not to have known what was going on. In a way, the most important words in the memo are the first 3: &#8216;at your request.&#8217; This was a political mission.&#8221;&nbsp;And then there is the attempt of Republican operatives to smear their opponents. Today, the U.S. attorney&#8217;s office for the Southern District of New York announced that two people have pleaded guilty to stealing the diary and other personal property of then-candidate Joe Biden&#8217;s daughter and selling it for $40,000 to James O&#8217;Keefe&#8217;s Project Veritas. In the process, they transported the material across state lines and then, at the request of the person to whom they sold it, went back to get more. They pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit interstate transportation of stolen property, and will cooperate with authorities.The attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election results is also in legal news.&nbsp;Senator Lindsey Graham (R-SC) is arguing in court that the judge should not let a grand jury question the senator &#8220;on all the topics&#8221; covered by its recent subpoena of his testimony in the investigation of the Trump campaign&#8217;s attempt to overturn the 2020 presidential election results in Georgia. Graham argues that the Speech or Debate Clause of the U.S. Constitution, which says that congress members &#8220;shall in all Cases, except Treason, Felony and Breach of the Peace, be privileged from Arrest during their Attendance at the Session of their respective Houses, and in going to and returning from the same; and for any Speech or Debate in either House, they shall not be questioned in any other Place,&#8221; means he cannot be questioned about his two phone calls to Georgia secretary of state Brad Raffensperger about throwing out mail-in ballots in that state.&nbsp;For Graham&#8217;s argument to prevail, he will have to convince the court that his calls to Raffensperger were part of his legitimate congressional work, rather than part of the efforts of Trump&#8217;s campaign to overturn the election, actions outside the scope of Graham&#8217;s congressional duties.&nbsp;Lawyer Kenneth Chesebro, who helped to invent the false electors plan to overturn the results of the 2020 election, is refusing to talk to the grand jury, arguing that he has an attorney-client relationship with the Trump campaign and saying the campaign had &#8220;instructed&#8221; him to maintain confidentiality. But Chesebro never received any payment, and it is unclear whether he was officially working for the campaign.&nbsp;Meanwhile, Fulton County, Georgia, district attorney Fani Willis filed petitions today to require Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, Meadows ally James &#8220;Phil&#8221; Waldron, and Trump campaign advisor Boris Epshteyn to testify before the special grand jury next month.&nbsp;Finally, the top secret documents Trump stole from the government: Today the DOJ submitted to the court a redacted version of the affidavit it used to obtain a search warrant for Trump&#8217;s Florida property Mar-a-Lago earlier this month. The judge has ordered the release of the document by noon tomorrow. Trump had publicly demanded the release of the affidavit but had not actually asked the court to release it. Instead, he has whipped up his followers against the FBI.&nbsp;With these headlines from the Republican Party, and coming on the heels of a spectacular few months for the Democrats, the Biden administration came out today swinging against MAGA Republicans.First, after a day of Republican congress members railing against yesterday&#8217;s educational loan forgiveness of up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients and $10,000 for others, the White House tweeted a thread of those members alongside the amount of Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) money those individuals were forgiven.&nbsp;Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) said: &#8220;For our government just to say ok your debt is completely forgiven.. it&#8217;s completely unfair.&#8221; Greene had $183,504 in PPP loans forgiven.Representative Vern Buchanan (R-FL) said: &#8220;Biden&#8217;s reckless, unilateral student loan giveaway is unfair to the 87 percent of Americans without student loan debt and those who played by the rules.&#8221; Buchanan had more than $2.3 million in PPP loans forgiven.Representative Markwayne Mullin (R-OK) said: &#8220;We do not need farmers and ranchers, small business owners, and teachers in Oklahoma paying the debts of Ivy League lawyers and doctors across the U.S.&#8221; Mullin had more than $1.4 million in PPP loans forgiven.Representative Kevin Hern (R-OK) said: &#8220;To recap, in the last two weeks, the &#8216;Party of the People&#8217; has supercharged the IRS to go after working-class Americans, raised their taxes, and forced them to pay for other people's college degrees.&#8221; Hern had more than $1 million in PPP loans forgiven.Representative Mike Kelly (R-PA) said: &#8220;Asking plumbers and carpenters to pay off the loans of Wall Street advisors and lawyers isn&#8217;t just unfair. It&#8217;s also bad policy.&#8221; Kelly had $987,237 in PPP loans forgiven.Representative Matt Gaetz (R-FL) said: Everyone knows that in a $60 Billion+ European land war, it's always the last $3 Billion that kicks in the door&#8230;.&#8221; Gaetz had $482,321 in PPP loans forgiven.&nbsp;Then Biden gave a barn-burning speech to the Democratic National Committee in Rockville, Maryland, clearly dividing the Republican Party between the MAGAs and mainstream Republicans. The MAGA philosophy is &#8220;semi-fascism,&#8221; he said, and we are seeing either its beginning or death knell.&nbsp;&#8220;I want to be crystal clear about what&#8217;s on the ballot this year. Your right to choose is on the ballot this year. The Social Security you paid for from the time you had a job is on the ballot. The safety of our kids from gun violence is on the ballot&#8230;. The very survival of our planet is on the ballot. Your right to vote is on the ballot. Even&#8230;democracy.&#8221;&#8220;The MAGA Republicans don&#8217;t just threaten our personal rights and economic security,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They&#8217;re a threat to our very democracy. They refuse to accept the will of the people. They embrace&#8230;political violence. They don&#8217;t believe in democracy.&#8221;&#8220;This is why in this moment, those of you who love this country&#8212;Democrats, Independents, mainstream Republicans&#8212;we must be stronger,&#8221; he said.&#8212;Notes:Andrew Weissmann &#127803; @AWeissmann_Key \"reasoning\" of Barr/Engel/O'Callaghan memo: if you successfully obstruct an investigation, you cannot be charged with obstruction as you were not charged with the crime under investigation.\n\nFuture defendants will have a field day with this memo unless DOJ repudiates it soon.August 25th 20221,712 Retweets5,539 Likeshttps://www.justice.gov/usao-sdny/pr/florida-residents-plead-guilty-conspiracy-commit-interstate-transportation-stolenThe White House @WhiteHouseCongressman Matt Gaetz had $482,321 in PPP loans forgiven.\n\nRep.

        "description": "Energy prices in the U.K. will increase by over 80 percent for the average household, after energy regulator Ofgem on Friday announced the price cap will rise to £3,549 per year, from £1,971, on October 1.\n\n\n\nThe new cap sets the maximum price energy providers can charge per unit of fuel between October and December, and reflects what it costs to buy energy on the wholesale market and supply it to households. Ofgem’s CEO Jonathan Brearley said he expected the price cap will rise again after this period, compounding the cost-of-living pressures facing U.K. households.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the BBC&#8217;s Today program minutes after the Ofgem announcement, Brearley said: &#8220;We accept there is significant pricing pressure, not only from today, but also through January and potentially into next year.&#8221; He would not indicate the extent to which prices are likely to continue jumping, saying: &#8220;What we don’t do is give figures, because things changed massively.&#8221;\n\n\n\nBrearley acknowledged the surging energy prices, driven in large part by Russia&#8217;s war on Ukraine, would cause significant hardship over the winter and called on the new prime minister and their Cabinet to provide an &#8220;urgent response.&#8221;\n\n\n\n&#8220;This is beyond the capacity of the regulator and the industry to address,&#8221; Brearley told the BBC. “The prime minister with his or her ministerial team will need to act urgently and decisively to address this.&#8221;\n\n\n\nBritish Conservative Party members are currently in the process of choosing a new leader to replace Boris Johnson — and become the next prime minister, with a winner to be announced on September 5. Liz Truss and Rishi Sunak are the two candidates in the runoff for the top job.\n\n\n\nChancellor Nadhim Zahawi said in a statement that he knew the higher cap will “cause stress and anxiety for many people.&#8221; Zahawi added that &#8220;help is coming,” pointing to a series of measures the current government has confirmed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of&nbsp;POLITICO Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one-stop-shop solution for policy professionals fusing the depth of POLITICO journalism with the power of technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive, breaking scoops and insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomized policy intelligence platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-level public affairs network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY GO PRO\n\n\n\nLOG IN",

        "description": "The potential PM’s plan to cut benefits and boost defence spending merely serves her craving for the theatre of conflictWas anything learned? On the first anniversary of Britain’s defeat in Afghanistan there is only silence. The previous defeat in Iraq saw a searing public inquiry in 2016. It concluded that Iraq had posed “no imminent threat”. The war was “unnecessary”, and based on dodgy intelligence, dubious legality and feeble attempts at avoidance. But Iraq was the “bad” war. Afghanistan was always the “good” one. Hence no public inquiry.Afghanistan was the worst fiasco of British foreign policy since Suez. Eager to curry favour with George W Bush in his craving for revenge for 9/11, Tony Blair lost his senses and went on a post-imperial romp. Under Nato auspices and using mercenaries from the Northern Alliance, the Taliban were driven south out of Kabul in 2001. Strategists including America’s secretary of state Colin Powell and defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld warned against “owning” and “nation-building” Afghanistan. But with “mission accomplished”, Bush and Blair could not resist.

Does the 6ft 7in shortstop have what it takes to be baseball’s next star?On Wednesday, Pittsburgh Pirates shortstop Oneil Cruz did something we’ve never seen an MLB player do before. Well, not that we know about, seeing as the StatCast era didn’t begin until 2015. Against the Atlanta Braves, Cruz cracked a base hit that clocked at 122.4mph off the bat, which surpassed New York Yankees slugger Giancarlo Stanton’s previous record of 122.2mph.It was an impressive “exit” velocity, even if Cruz’s record-setting hit only went for a single in PNC Park. He may have hit it too hard to get a double out of it, though it would have been a home run in most ballparks. Still, it might have been the highlight for hometown fans who watched their team get blown by the Braves, not a shocking result for a Pittsburgh team trapped in the cellar of the NL Central.

        "description": "At this year’s city-shaking, weekend-long bash, a triangular pavilion will be appearing amid the floats and dancers. Revellers can sneak inside for a rest – or climb on top and partyAlvaro Barrington is recalling his first ever festival experience in Grenada: “I was maybe five years old and my cousins took me to J’ouvert,” he says, referring to the day that acts as a precursor to the main party in Caribbean culture. “I have a memory of one of my older cousins holding my hand as we walked through the streets. We found a sound system and I climbed up on it and immediately fell asleep with the music blasting. A few hours later, I woke up to my cousin carrying me home while I laid on his shoulder.”He may have missed out on the good stuff, but the sleepy experience has inspired his latest project. Because amid the floats, sound systems and food trucks at this year’s Notting Hill carnival there will also be a pavilion designed specifically for people who need to take a bit of time out from the action. Located next to where the carnival’s judges are based on the Great Western Road, the approximately three-metre high structure is made from a series of interlocking plywood components. The pavilion will be completed during the carnival’s opening parade by members of the community who will carry elements of the building, slotting them into the roughly pyramid-shaped construction themselves at the end of the procession. Once finished, party-goers will be able to rest inside Barrington’s pavilion, or clamber up the outside in order to better see the procession. “Carnival can be a place for many different types of culture,” he says. “For the Caribbean community, it has a long history of being a space in which art gets produced. I thought maybe we can bring architecture into that too.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "After time away from social media while on holiday, I&#8217;ve come to the decision to leave fosstodon.org and return to social.coop. You can now find and follow me at &#x64;&#x61;&#x6a;&#x62;&#x40;null&#x73;&#x6f;&#x63;&#x69;&#x61;&#x6c;&#x2e;&#x63;&#x6f;&#x6f;&#x70;!\n\n\n\nThere are several reasons for this decision:\n\n\n\nHome timeline — Fosstodon has grown in membership quite a lot over the past couple of years, which is great in and of itself. However, the &#8216;local&#8217; timeline is important to me, and as Fosstodon has grown I&#8217;ve found it&#8217;s less relevant to my context. Reply-guys — there are some people (mostly middle-aged white guys) who seem to think it&#8217;s their duty in life to point out that a particular thing isn&#8217;t 100% FLOSS (Free, Libre, Open Source Software). There&#8217;s only so much of this I can tolerate.Co-operation — while I&#8217;m still very much interested in making the world more open in every way (including Open Source) I think what the world needs more than anything is more co-operation. I&#8217;m a founding member of a co-op, and part of a network of co-ops. This is how the world gets better and, right now, I want to have my home timeline full of ways we can do that.\n\n\n\nI was part of social.coop for a year from 2017-18. I left after some drama, which was ultimately resolved. In my interactions with the team while applying for membership, I&#8217;ve been informed that it was very much a learning experience and things are in place now (see the wiki!) to prevent such things happening again.\n\n\n\nFor those keeping track, I&#8217;ve now gone mastodon.social → social.coop → fosstodon.org → social.coop. It&#8217;s easy to migrate accounts, although posts don&#8217;t come with you (I delete them every three months anyway!)\n\n\n\nMany thanks to Kev Quirk and Mike Stone for setting up Fosstodon, and for the excellent moderation team! I&#8217;m looking forward being a member of the social.coop community again and, of course, still being part of the Fediverse 🤘The post Returning to social.coop first appeared on Open Thinkering.",

First, the person had not recently traveled, indicating that he got infected with the virus in the U.S., not overseas. Second, the strain of polio that infected him (type 2) causes paralysis in about 1 in 2,000 infections, suggesting there have been hundreds and possibly thousands of persons recently infected with the virus in New York. Third, genetic analysis indicated that the strain of polio is one that evolved from an oral polio vaccine &#x2014; which uses a weakened live virus &#x2014; and is identical to the strain that has caused community transmission in London and Israel, indicating this is problem in multiple countries that were previously considered polio-free.Read the rest&hellip;",

        "description": "Today’s fluff is recalibrating after the summerThere is not long to go until the transfer window “slams shut” for a few months but while summer is still with us, so too is the scent of cash being readied to thrash out last-minute deals. The first whiff we got on Friday morning took us to the London Stadium, where David Moyes is desperate to bring in a midfielder good enough to keep Declan Rice happy at West Ham for another season. The Brazil and Lyon trickster Lucas Paquetá is the target, but they will have to raise an opening bid of £42m to make it a reality. Arsenal and Newcastle also have the hots for the 24-year-old. Moyes recently bemoaned his bad luck in this window and after Club Brugge rejected a £10m bid for experienced Belgium midfielder Hans Vanaken he will have had more reason to feel sorry for himself.In the most tedious transfer saga this summer, Chelsea are preparing a 1,374th bid for the Leicester centre-back Wesley Fofana. They’re also going to try to snaffle Anthony Gordon from Everton for an improved offer of £60m because the last time they signed a talented young scouse midfielder from Goodison Park it went so well. Isn’t that right, Ross? If Gordon does make the move south, Everton will try to replace him with Brighton’s Neal Maupay. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Updated: 8:26 a.m.For most current and former students, the Biden administration&#x27;s proposals this week on student debt were good news. But now borrowers are in a scramble to find which proposals they qualify for. Biden&#x27;s announcement generated a huge amount of interest. Shortly after, the federal student aid website crashed and has since required a waiting room for people visiting the site because of the volume. Student Henri Wingo said that her loans from four years at Minneapolis College already cause her anxiety as she gets ready to look for a job. She is carrying $5,500 in student debt, a number she expects to grow. Wingo plans to graduate with a graphic design degree in the spring.Before Wednesday’s announcement, she worried she would have to jump at the first job offer just to pay off the loans.&quot;It it allows me so much freedom from this massive burden on my back that I&#x27;ve been carrying for the last four years,&quot; Wingo said.Students from two-year technical or community colleges bear the biggest financial burden from loans, according the U.S. Department of Education. While their debts may be smaller than those who went to four year schools, the group sees loan defaults at the highest rate.&quot;This gives them some breathing room, that&#x27;s going to allow them to, quite honestly buy groceries, allow them to maybe start thinking about moving from an apartment to a house, that&#x27;s gonna allow them to have transportation freedom of buying a car,&quot; said Michael Dean, executive director, Lead MN, a group that represents community and technical college students across the state.To qualify for relief, individuals have to earn less than $125,000 a year or less than $250,000 for households.Loans must have been originated before July 1 of this year. The administration is proposing reducing minimum payments for people on income-based repayment plans and proposing forgiving those loans after ten years of regular payments rather than 20.&quot;We have close to 782,000 Minnesotans that hold an open federal loan right now. That total cumulative debt represents about $26.7 billion,&quot; said Dennis Olson, Minnesota&#x27;s higher education commissioner.But that relief is relative. Daphne Berlin-Fish has more than $100,000 in loans for her degrees in archive management and public history — degrees she&#x27;d hoped to use to work in museums. But that hasn&#x27;t panned out yet. She&#x27;s working at a labor union and trying to pay down her debt.Berlin-Fish was hoping for the $50,000 in debt relief some Democrats had been advocating for when Biden first announced his plan.&quot;This is a drop in the bucket for me. Personally, this knocks me down from basically $105,000 to $95,000. And then once interest kicks back in at the end of the year, that $105,000 is going to come back in no time,” she said.Minnesota would have to change its tax code to prevent people from having to pay taxes on the loans that are forgiven, which could be up to $20,000.The administration is expected to roll out more details and information on how to apply for loan forgiveness in the coming weeks.MPR News Reporter Brian Bakst contributed to this story.Correction (Aug. 26, 2022): An earlier version of this story incorrectly stated Daphne Berlin-Fish&#x27;s employer. The story has been updated.",

        "description": "Caring for her infant son changed Furman’s concept of community. It’s a force she believes can save us from hopelessness, as she explores on her rousing new album‘The future is a text message sending,” Ezra Furman declares on Forever in Sunset, the synth-scorched first single from her new album, All of Us Flames. On the face of it, the lyrics tell a classic American tale: two people in a car – one of them “trouble” – pulling on to a highway with a full tank and the sun in their eyes. The backing is a groundswell of power chords and crashing percussion, recalling Bruce Springsteen’s Born to Run, with its depiction of underclass dreams bursting out of the confines of material reality. But Furman completely turns her back on society. As the collapse of civilisation feels increasingly inevitable, she heads for a new frontier where rugged individualism and systemic failure are vanquished by interdependence and resilience. The passengers ditch the unavoidable for the unknown, with nothing but friendship on their side, Thelma and Louise, suspended in midair.“I was trying to [say], there is no end of the world,” Furman explains, sipping a small beer in a quiet garden in east London. It is a few days after the UK’s first bout of extreme heat, when record-breaking temperatures left parts of Essex on fire and bin bags melted on the pavement, and a sense of doom hangs in the air. “Your rights being taken away by the government is not the apocalypse. Not being able to buy food at the supermarket any more is not the apocalypse. Or maybe it is – but then we’ve got to figure out how to grow food ourselves and bring it to our neighbours. We’ve got to keep taking care of each other.” Continue reading...",

Donnenfeld is a lawyer who lives in upstate New York with his wife and daughters.

        "description": "NEW CASTLE, Ind. — Dressed in gray suit slacks, black work boots and a blue hard hat, the congressman from Silicon Valley one recent morning in a steel factory here stood and looked at a big, roaring furnace so hot it was glowing orange. For Ro Khanna, the progressive Democrat and third-term House member who represents the district singularly synonymous in the country with big money and high tech, this was the first stop of a four-day, three-state tour through the more downcast Midwest, meeting with local officials, factory workers and union retirees in perennially depressed one-time auto-industry strongholds. Khanna, who turns 46 next month, is still young, but he’s been at this a long time. He worked as a volunteer on Barack Obama’s first state senate campaign before eventually working in his presidential administration. He modeled Howard Dean’s 2004 presidential run in his own precocious, even pushy initial try for Congress going on 20 years back. He was a national co-chair of Bernie Sanders’ 2020 bid, and his new book got kudos on Twitter from Bill and Hillary Clinton. And in the conference room here at New Castle Stainless Plate, the audience made up of the company’s CEO plus a clutch of his right-hand men, Khanna had road-tested pieces of a message he’s been honing for years. “Make more stuff here,” he said. “Build our productive capacity,” he said. “Buy American,” he said.    These, of course, are not new ideas. But the combination of the messenger and the locale was unusual. In August, when most members of Congress are in their respective districts or perhaps off elsewhere to raise funds, Khanna was here — not only not at home but in a red part of a red state, not asking for their money, and not asking for their votes (at least not yet). Instead, he was here in Indiana, then Wisconsin, then Iowa, sharpening a key plank of his overall political pitch, attempting to rehab his party’s reputation in an area of the country that’s become increasingly inhospitable, and also very obviously laying seed for his own evident presidential ambitions. And maybe the most surprising part of this surprising scene? It appeared to be working. Because now out on the factory floor, the supply chain manager sidled up to me to express some mixture of confusion and pleasant surprise. Fred Centner thought former president Donald Trump had had “a lot of good ideas.” The former president also, unfortunately, was “an idiot,” Centner said. He wishes he would just go away. Before this visit from Khanna, he had looked him up, pegging him as a “typical liberal.” The way Khanna was talking, though, sounded to Centner a lot like … Trump. Make more stuff here? “That’s what Trump wanted,” he said over the noise of the heavy machinery. Buy American? “It’s a Trump concept. It’s a Republican concept,” he said. “So, to hear a Democrat coming out and saying, ‘Hey, we want the same things’ … it’s good to hear.”     As Democrats look ahead to 2024 and beyond, it’s an article of faith that they’ll only keep the White House if they field a candidate — like Joe Biden, even Bernie Sanders — who can speak to enough Rust Belt voters to keep them in the Democratic fold. But Khanna, polished, coastal and almost omnipresent on cable TV, including regular hits on Fox, is still an unknown quantity to people like the Republican mayor of nearby Rushville. Mike Pavey came to see Khanna mainly because he wanted to know what he was doing here. Khanna was sitting in a meeting room in a Hampton Inn most specifically because of Robin Johnson. A part-time political science professor, the host of a radio show called “Heartland Politics” and an informal adviser to outgoing Democratic congresswoman Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Johnson earlier this year had read Wall Street Journal&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-tech-revival-for-americas-hometowns-11642690787&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-dd62-d9e7-ab9e-ff73b89e0006&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-dd62-d9e7-ab9e-ff73b89e0007&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">something Khanna wrote for the Wall Street Journal. It piqued his interest, so Bustos connected him with Khanna, which led to Khanna coming to talk at the college where Johnson teaches and eventually this convening of a handful of mayors from the area and from both parties. The subject line of Johnson’s emailed invites: “Bringing tech jobs to the Heartland.” Pavey, the mayor from Rushville, admitted during introductions he and the two city and county officials who joined him had made the hour-or-so drive somewhat skeptically. “I said, ‘What’s he up to?’” granted the local economic development director. Another Republican mayor Johnson had approached but who had not come, Pavey said, had been blunt: “Why would a representative out of California come to Indiana to take jobs away from his area and promote them here?”  Khanna had anticipated that wariness. “Look, you people in this room will disagree on where I stand on abortion, on gay marriage. But why can’t we find the place where we do agree?” he said. “I just think we’ve got to wake up as a country across the political divide and come together on how we build the next generation of manufacturing in America. And we’ve got to get these jobs not just in Silicon Valley, or New York, or Austin, but around the country,” he said. “We have forgotten what won World War II. It was a victory of production. I mean, it was obviously the men who sacrificed their lives in Normandy, and our amazing military, but the way we really won is we outproduced Japan and Germany by orders of magnitude.”    Khanna, according to former and current advisers and aides, is at heart something of an academic and a policy wonk. But he’s keen, too, on the language of politics and persuasion even to the point of bumper-sticker slogans. It matters what you say, he believes, but realistically, it might matter even more how you say it. “He’s just very good from a messaging perspective,” Steve Spinner, a friend and mentor and Khanna’s campaign chair for the past decade, told me. “That’s an area that Democrats historically struggle with, from the White House on down, and it’s something that Ro is actually quite good at.” “He is one of the few people,” said Jane Kleeb, a board member of Our Revolution, the progressive political action organization launched by Sanders in 2016, “that get how to talk about rural economic development without sounding like they’re reading off a talking-point sheet.” “And it’s so ironic,” said Johnson, “that it’s coming from somebody who represents Silicon Valley.” He’s good at it because he works at it. Which is why being with Khanna at times can feel like a real-time catch-phrase workshop. “Economic patriotism,” Khanna said not once but three times in the two-hour roundtable with the mayors at the Hampton Inn. “Economic patriotism,” said Brian Sheehan, Rushville’s community development director, repeating it back to Khanna. He told Khanna to trademark the term. “Awesome,” he said. “I think that’s the kind of thing that connects to everyone.” “I was impressed by the fact that it seemed like his goal was to help our region and do it in a bipartisan way,” Pavey told me. “I’m encouraged.” “I hope that you’re running for a higher office,” Greg York, the mayor of New Castle, told Khanna. York is a Democrat, but in 2016, he told me, he voted for Trump. He voted for Joe Biden in 2020. In 2024, though, he wants to vote for somebody else. “I hope that’s why you’re visiting us,” York said.     Now we were in Anderson, Ind., in a back booth of a Texas Roadhouse just off Interstate 69, tinny, too-loud country music blaring from a speaker on the ceiling. Khanna ordered a half slab of ribs with green beans and corn. I suggested this “economic patriotism” message sounds different coming from him rather than, say, white, more immediately identifiably “Rust Belt” candidates like Tim Ryan in Ohio or John Fetterman in Pennsylvania. Khanna concurred. “I think people underestimate biography and identity in people’s perception.” The Hindu grandson of a freedom fighter in the Mahatma Gandhi-led independence movement and the son of Indian immigrants, his father a chemical engineer and his mom a substitute teacher addressing the functional needs of children with disabilities, Khanna was born in 1976 in Philadelphia — in America’s bicentennial year, in the home of Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell, a historical coincidence I’m emphasizing only because he so frequently does. He grew up in Pennsylvania’s Bucks County, long a microcosmic, middle-of-the-road chunk of political territory, watching Rocky movies, rooting for the Eagles of the NFL and playing Little League and Strat-O-Matic baseball. “That was my upbringing,” Khanna told me as we ate dinner. “Americana.” His ninth grade English teacher told him he was “going to be the first Indian American president.” The valedictorian of his class at Council Rock High, Khanna started college at Duke, graduated from the University of Chicago with the highest honors in economics and then went to Yale Law. As an undergrad in Chicago, with close friend and eventual law-school roommate Renato Mariotti, Khanna organized in April 1998 a conference called “The Challenge of Modern Democracy” — a three-day affair that drew to campus notables such as the former prime minister of Canada, the former president of Haiti, the presidents of Morehouse College and MIT, and a preeminent federal appellate judge. “He is definitely,” said Mariotti, a former federal prosecutor who now is the legal affairs columnist for POLITICO Magazine, “one of the most ambitious people that I’ve ever known.”    He ran for Congress in 2004, then again in 2014, then again in 2016, challenging beloved, long-standing incumbents. In between, in addition to teaching at San Francisco State, Santa Clara and Stanford universities, the intellectual property attorney was a deputy assistant secretary in Obama’s Commerce Department, and then wrote a book about it. “As I traveled the country, I learned that manufacturers remain at the cornerstone of our economy and our national security, and are indispensable to American greatness,” Entrepreneurial Nation: Why Manufacturing is Still Key to America’s Future&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.google.com/books/edition/Entrepreneurial_Nation_Why_Manufacturing/mCk7EwgRU64C?hl=en&amp;gbpv=1&amp;dq=khanna+As+I+traveled+the+country,+I+learned+that+manufacturers&amp;pg=PA9&amp;printsec=frontcover&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-dd62-d9e7-ab9e-ff73b89f0008&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-dd62-d9e7-ab9e-ff73b89f0009&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">he wrote in Entrepreneurial Nation: Why Manufacturing is Still Key to America’s Future. “Democrats and Republicans must find common ground to keep America a manufacturing leader,” he added. He got the book blurbed by boldface names ranging from the late labor leader Richard Trumka to SpaceX and Tesla tycoon Elon Musk. “I’ve spent a lifetime thinking about policy issues,” Khanna told SF Weekly when he was 27 years old. “I will be one of the most impactful players in Washington from day one,” he told the publication India Abroad three years before he won Silicon Valley’s seat in Congress, “because of the constituency I represent, which I honestly believe is the greatest, most influential constituency in the country, in the world.” It was getting late at the Texas Roadhouse. “I think when people look at me, they’re like, ‘All right, he’s an Indian American guy from Silicon Valley, he understands wealth generation, and the future, and the global economy’ — and then this is a guy who’s saying, ‘We can produce this stuff in America, and we can produce the future in America,’” he told me. “It’s taken me a lot of thinking to get to the point about how Bucks County and Pennsylvania relate to California and how both are important,” he said. “It’s the combination” — melding Silicon Valley and Bucks County out here in the vast, vexed left-behind in-between — “that makes it, I think, intriguing. And the first thing is you’ve got to capture people’s imagination before they’ll listen to you.”     The union hall the next morning felt like a cross between a museum and a senior center. On the walls of the old UAW building in Anderson was a portrait of President John F. Kennedy, framed, black-and-white, yellowing newspaper clippings from the ’60s and ’70s, and a bulletin board with tips on how to handle Alzheimer’s and spot scams that target the elderly. Khanna sat surrounded by a dozen or so General Motors retirees Johnson again had helped convene. He all but apologized. “We made a huge strategic mistake as a country. We just let our production go offshore. It was a mistake by, frankly, everyone in power over the last 40 years,” Khanna said. “And I’ve been trying to work at figuring out how we get new manufacturing into every part of this country.” The CHIPS act, which allots some $50 billion to stateside semiconductor production and research, was a start, said Khanna, who helped shepherd the recently Biden-signed legislation along with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer as well as a pair of Republicans — Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin and Sen. Todd Young of right here in Indiana.    But Khanna argued for much more support from the federal government. “With interest-free loans, with financing, with capital … I think we’ve got to have the government back in the process of building things in America,” he said. “I think with the pandemic people say, ‘We aren’t making our masks in this country? We’re not making our PPE in this country? We’re not making antibiotics in this country? We’re not making the chips that are in our cars in this country? We aren’t making baby formula enough in this country?’ People say, ‘What the hell’s going on?’” he said. “You guys,” Khanna said, “knew this a long time ago.” It’s not just all the factory jobs that went away, said the group gathered at the union hall. It’s all the other kinds of jobs, which existed in the area because of all the factory jobs — so many of which kept going away, in the ’70s, in the ’80s, in the ’90s, into the new century, until there were nearly none. It’s the depression, it’s the divorces, it’s the drugs, they said, because of all that loss over all that time. “I’m 80 years old,” one of them said. “I’ve seen this stuff go on and on and on and on.” “Indiana’s a great place. It’s home,” said another. “But it’s not what it was.” It was drizzling when we walked outside. Johnson drove Khanna out of Anderson, past empty storefronts, past parking lots with weeds, past a church called Promise Land.     Back in New Castle, inside the Henry County Democratic headquarters with brown wood walls, simple white tables and an Obama-Biden ’08 sign in the corner, Khanna took the mic. This wasn’t even on the itinerary at the beginning of the day, but the mayor had made some calls, and now about 20 locals were here to listen to the congressman from Silicon Valley. I texted a picture to Mark Longabaugh, a senior adviser to Sanders during his 2016 presidential campaign who sees a potential successor in Khanna. “As a political professional who would be advising somebody like Ro, my advice would be: Be ready. Launching a presidential campaign, you don’t do it with a snap of the fingers,” Longabaugh told me. Khanna says he’s not planning on running for president in 2024. “The other thing that I’ve said to him,” Longabaugh said, “is really 2028 is not that far away.” “I don’t think he is just interested in having positions for positions’ sake,” said Mariotti, his college classmate and law-school roommate. “But I think it’s fair to say that a congressman from California traveling around the country and building a nationwide network is something that you only do if you have presidential ambitions.” “I personally,” said Spinner, “look at him as the future of the party.”    Now, here at the headquarters of the county party, Khanna said much of what he had said at the steel factory, and at a factory that makes gym equipment and window shades and projection screens, and at a factory that makes seats for cars, and at a sparse Chrysler auto lot, and at the Hampton Inn with the mayors, and at the union hall with the retirees, floating again to this group this new favorite phrase. “Economic patriotism,” he said. “An Indian American from Silicon Valley says, ‘We’ve got to make things in America,’ people don’t think it’s xenophobic,” he said. “Make stuff in America. Invent it here, produce it here, buy it here …” Khanna’s new book, Dignity in a Digital Age: Making Tech Work for All of Us, is too early and a little too nerdy to be seen as the kind of familiar, almost obligatory offering from somebody running for something, but this impromptu evening event fairly quickly did turn into what felt to me like a rough-cut town hall of a proto-presidential campaign. He painted an explicit contrast with Trump. “He sold false hope,” he said. “We actually have a real vision.” And here in the late summer of a midterm year, Khanna worked his way toward the sort of closing I’ve come to expect at a different point in the political calendar before walking out into the cold in some dot on the map in Iowa or New Hampshire.    “People love this country. They want America to win. They want us to lead because we’re a great nation. And they know we’re a great nation because of stories like mine,” Khanna said. He acknowledged sometimes it was hard growing up with immigrant parents and brown skin and the name Rohit. “But that’s not what I remember about growing up in Bucks County, Pa.,” he said. “I remember Little League coaches who believed in me. I remember the local paper, the Bucks County Courier Times, that published my letters to the editor in a community that was 95 percent white. I grew up believing I could do anything in this country. That’s the story of America. That’s the essence of America, whether in Bucks County, Pa., or New Castle, Ind.” After the people clapped, I went to the rear of the room to talk to a woman wearing a Sanders shirt. “I don’t know why he’s here,” Jessika Feltz, the vice chair of the county party, said of Khanna, “but I like that he’s here.” I wondered if she would vote for Khanna for president. “Hundred percent,” she said. “Over Biden?” I asked. “Hundred percent.” Khanna came over to thank her for coming. “Run for president,” she said. He laughed. She laughed. But it didn’t sound like they were joking. A few days later, following stops in Janesville, Wis., and Dubuque, Iowa, I got a text from Khanna. “I have refined my pitch to a new economic patriotism,” he said. “The word new is key as it gives a sense of future and technology.” Coming from him, coming from Silicon Valley, he added, “it’s something fresh, with a fresh pair of eyes and thinking that is resonating.”",

        "description": "PHILADELPHIA — Mehmet Oz sees an opening to rescue his floundering Senate campaign: After largely refraining from making his opponent’s health an issue, the celebrity doctor has decided to go there. Oz’s Democratic opponent, John Fetterman, suffered a stroke in May and since then, has largely avoided public events and been noncommittal about debates. Instead, he’s been relentlessly trolling Oz on social media and dominating the airwaves with campaign ads. Meanwhile, Oz has struggled to consolidate support from the conservative base, despite former President Donald Trump’s endorsement. Until now, Oz — a TV physician popularly known as Dr. Oz — hasn’t directly made Fetterman’s health challenges an issue in the race. But in the last week, Oz has changed tactics. This week, his campaign put out two statements ridiculing Fetterman’s diet and accusing him of being too ill to withstand debates. Oz and his campaign have also been working behind the scenes to convince prominent conservative figures — including those who were once detractors — to publicly rally around him. Republicans hope that delayed support from influential conservative commentators will help him persuade unenthused rank-and-file GOP voters to come home to him. “He has turned the corner,” said John Fredericks, a conservative radio host and Trump ally who encouraged the former president to endorse Oz in the primary. “One of the key reasons he’s done that is he has been able to now meld together the entire MAGA movement, which is coming behind him because they don’t want Fetterman.”    Oz’s efforts have led to a much-needed show of support for him among voices trusted by Republican voters, including on social media, where he has been hammered by Fetterman as an out-of-touch carpetbagger from New Jersey. But the fact that he is still working to shore up his standing with the GOP rank-and-file this late in the summer underscores his challenges in the election, and could detract from his efforts to win over independents. Oz hobbled out of a bitter, expensive primary — one that went to a recount after millions of dollars of attack ads targeted him — with 31 percent of the vote and a major problem on his hands: Much of the Republican base did not like him. That has helped Fetterman take the lead in the polls. Fredericks said he encouraged Oz to reach out to high-profile conservative figures. A person familiar with Oz’s conversations also confirmed he has recently been making calls to them. A second person, who is in Trump’s orbit, confirmed that the former president’s aides have also solicited help from top Republican operatives to attempt to help Oz in a race they believe is still winnable. “Trump world is going to try to save Oz’s ass,” regardless of if they’ve been disappointed with his post-primary performance, the person said. The people were granted anonymity to speak frankly about internal campaign deliberations.   Multiple nights this week, Fox News host Laura Ingraham has devoted segments to blasting Fetterman in an effort to boost support for Oz among Pennsylvania’s Republican base — after openly criticizing Oz throughout the spring primary. Conservative commentator Ben Shapiro released a seven-minute video Sunday attacking Fetterman, followed by a segment on his podcast this week doing the same. And despite speaking ill about Oz as recently as last week, far-right personality Jack Posobiec has rapidly upped his attacks on Fetterman.  Similar messaging in recent days has come from other notable conservatives, including Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle, Stephen Miller, Steve Bannon, Newt Gingrich and others. At the same time, Oz’s campaign has dramatically escalated its attacks on Fetterman, including over his health and spotty appearances on the campaign trail. Fetterman held his first rally since his stroke in Erie earlier this month, and gave remarks in Pittsburgh this week at the United Steelworkers’ international headquarters, his second official public event of the general election. He didn’t take questions from the media at either stop.   Oz has challenged Fetterman to five debates. The Fetterman team has said he is up for debating, but not on Oz’s terms, and has not RSVPed to anything specific. On Monday, the Oz campaign used Fetterman’s unwillingness to commit to debates as a way to draw attention to his health. “If John is too sick to debate and is concerned he cannot stand in front of cameras for more than 10 minutes, then he should just say so,” Oz spokesperson Brittany Yanick said Monday. On Tuesday, the campaign took it to another level, with spokesperson Rachel Tripp saying, “If John Fetterman had ever eaten a vegetable in his life, then maybe he wouldn’t have had a major stroke.” Many Republicans have been animated by the attacks on Fetterman’s health and debate-dodging. Conservative media widely circulated footage of Fetterman’s speech to union workers on Tuesday, in which he sometimes paused awkwardly and missed words, including during a special segment on Fox News Wednesday morning. An edited video showing various clips from the event has been viewed more than 1 million times on Twitter.    But some GOP consultants question whether it’s a good strategy for Oz. Republican strategist Doug Heye said that it’s fair for Oz’s staffers to highlight Fetterman’s disappearance from the campaign trail, but their attempts to politicize his health this week need work. “I think there are ways to do it while still running quality campaign messaging,” Heye said. “If the campaign makes over-the-top attacks like we saw [Tuesday], that has the effect of making Fetterman more sympathetic to voters, a lot of whom have health issues.” Joe Calvello, a spokesperson for Fetterman, said that the Oz vegetable remark was “extremely insensitive and frankly unhinged,” and charged that “Dr. Oz literally does not know how to talk about the real issues that matter to Pennsylvanians.” Calvello said Fetterman has been honest about his health problems, acknowledging that he is in speech therapy and is having “trouble with some hearing and auditory processing.” Oz campaign manager Casey Contres and campaign adviser Barney Keller said they called moderators of the debates that Oz agreed to on Monday and all said they had heard nothing from the Fetterman campaign. The Oz team also said that there have been no behind-the-scenes negotiations with the Fetterman campaign about debates. The Fetterman campaign did not answer a question about whether it had responded to the debate moderators. “His health is not an issue. We hope he has a speedy recovery, we hope he gets better,” Keller said. “The issue is he keeps lying about his health. I think the reason is clear: He won’t debate because he had a major stroke.” Democratic strategists said Oz’s attacks on Fetterman’s health come from a place of weakness, in particular a need to appeal to the GOP base. They said his team’s latest criticism about eating vegetables also shows that Oz doesn’t understand Pennsylvania, the land of cheesesteaks and pierogies. A Democratic pollster who conducts focus groups for campaigns in Pennsylvania said that swing voters don’t bring up Fetterman’s health problems themselves while discussing the Senate race, but when they are asked about it, they tend to find it relatable. The pollster was granted anonymity to describe proprietary research. A letter from Fetterman’s physician released in June, which not-so-subtly chastised him for not following doctor’s orders before his stroke, resonated in particular. “50-year-old women from Delco, they’re like, ‘Oh yeah, that’s my husband,” said the pollster, referring to a Philadelphia suburb. “‘Oh God, are all men this way?’” At the same time, Oz’s attacks about Fetterman’s health have turned off voters, the person said: “We heard it in our groups over and over. People just intrinsically don’t like the idea of attacking somebody for their health.”  While Oz struggled for months after the primary to raise money — and at one point reportedly vacationed in Ireland, drawing criticism from GOP insiders that he wasn’t taking the race seriously enough — Republican operatives are now trying to spread the message that all is not lost in Pennsylvania. Following weeks of Fetterman posting double-digit leads in public and internal polling, including by as much as 18 percentage points, Republicans saw a flicker of hope this week in two new polls that found Oz down by only 4 points. “We’re lightyears away from Election Day, and the Oz campaign is stepping up,” said Ward Baker, a Republican strategist and past executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee. “Remember, the Republican primary was a bruising one not that long ago, and wounds are healing. No one has yet fully prosecuted Fetterman, but the advertising gap has been reduced. Pennsylvanians will find out how liberal he is — that he’s even more radical than Bernie Sanders.” The Senate Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, announced earlier this month it was increasing its fall ad buy in Pennsylvania to $34 million, including launching its first spot three weeks ahead of schedule. Late last week, Trump announced he would be holding a rally for Oz and Republican gubernatorial nominee Doug Mastriano over Labor Day weekend — his first general election rally of the midterms. “Pennsylvania voters deserve to hear from [Fetterman] vs. Oz in debates” and after Fetterman’s recent public appearances “now they will demand it,” said David Urban, a GOP strategist who worked on Trump’s 2016 campaign and supported Oz’s top opponent in this year’s Republican primary. “I think Oz has a path if he gets to debate and talk about issues and the differences” between him and Fetterman. Added Dave Ball, chair of the Washington County GOP in western Pennsylvania: “I’m sure the Democrats would like to believe the Republicans have written this race off, but that’s anything but true. This is an important race and we have a good candidate and the Democrats do not have a good candidate, and it’s winnable.”",

        "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2022/08/26/dan-rapoport-putin-critic-was-it-suicide-00053836",
        "description": "The mysterious death last week of a prominent critic of Vladimir Putin’s invasion of Ukraine in Washington’s West End neighborhood is drawing fury from some of the Kremlin’s best-known global detractors — but scant notice in Washington, where police say they don’t suspect foul play was behind Dan Rapoport’s fall from a luxury apartment building on the night of Aug. 14. “I think the circumstances of his death are extremely suspicious,” says Bill Browder, the formerly Moscow-based American financier who became a crusader for sanctions after the killing of his Russian lawyer, Sergei Magnitsky. Browder got to know Rapoport in Moscow years ago, before they both fell out of favor with the Russian regime. “Whenever someone who is in a negative view of the Putin regime dies suspiciously, one should rule out foul play, not rule it in.” According to a Metropolitan Police Department incident report, officers responding to a call about a jumper found the 52-year-old Rapoport’s body on the sidewalk. He was wearing orange flip flops and a black hat and had a cracked phone, headphones and $2,620 in cash on him, but no wallet or credit cards. The police say the case remains open, even without a suspicion of foul play. As is standard for suspected suicides, a medical examiner’s report — which would typically reference medical or other records, include a toxicology screen and incorporate X-rays and other posthumous forensics to determine if there was a struggle before the fall — is pending. The deceased was no mere exile. A Latvian-born U.S. citizen, Rapoport moved back to the U.S. in 2012 after making a fortune in Moscow but running afoul of the Russian government. Settling in Washington, he rubbed elbows with mover and shakers, living in a Kalorama manse that his family later sold for $5.5 million in 2016, when it became the home of Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. By then, Rapoport had relocated again, setting up shop in Kyiv, where he became a frequent contact of U.S. media. In the eyes of Rapoport’s political allies, the history of untimely deaths of Kremlin critics makes the police’s initial no-foul-play conclusion seem naive. “He was a well-known critic of Putin in the West and had been an effective critic,” Browder says. “He was also an open supporter of [the jailed opposition leader] Alexei Navalny. And he had all these connections in the elite of Washington, D.C. The immediate response of the Washington, D.C. police, I think, is a premature and unhelpful conclusion.”  “Nothing adds up,” says David Satter, a longtime Moscow correspondent in Soviet and post-Soviet times who in 2013 became the first U.S. reporter booted from Russia since the Cold War. Satter, now a frequent Wall Street Journal contributor and the author of several books about Putin’s Russia, had stayed with Rapoport in Kyiv. “This is why it has to be investigated. But everything we do know is very, very strange.” Rapoport’s death has been the subject of major coverage overseas, but is oddly off the radar in Washington, where there has been little major media attention. It’s a strange and possibly telling omission from our midterm-absorbed city’s water-cooler conversation: A number of high-profile figures are implying that a foreign government may have killed an American citizen in the capital of the United States. Even if their conjectures are overblown, it ought to be news. The suspicions, Browder says, began when the news of Rapoport’s death first broke on the Telegram channel of a former editor of Russian Tattler, via a convoluted story that claimed Rapoport’s dog was let loose with a suicide note and cash attached to him. Because intelligence services often put out information through gossip sites, the location raised antennae. “How the hell did she [the ex-Tattler editor] learn about Dan’s alleged suicide?” asks Vlad Burlutsky, a Russian expat who met Rapoport through his work supporting Navalny. In a Russian media interview, Rapoport’s wife denied the story about the note — and the suicide, saying her husband had been making plans and that she expected to be in Washington to see him. (The police report also makes no mention of a note or a dog.) “I’ve talked several times to Alyona, his widow, and she says she is absolutely certain that it’s not a suicide,” says close friend Ilya Ponomarev, the only member of the Russian Duma to vote against the annexation of Crimea and now a strident Putin critic also living in Kyiv. Ponomarev says he’s less certain. But he fears a repeat of what happened in 2015, when Putin’s former media czar died in odd circumstances in Washington and, in his view, U.S. authorities soft-pedaled the investigation. “I would not be surprised that it would be the same thing, that people don’t want to deal with some crazy Russians,” he says. (Alyona Rapoport did not respond to my messages, and has only been quoted in a single Russian media story since confirming his death on Facebook.) The case for suspicion involves some more basic practical questions: What was up with the wad of cash? Why would Rapoport have been making plans for the next few days? Why was he wearing a hat? But mainly the suspicion has to do with Russia. “There’s an old saying that anyone can commit a murder but it takes brains to commit a suicide,” says Satter. “The version of suicide is for the irrelevant people who will simply accept it and move on without raising questions.” Born in the USSR, Rapoport came with his parents to the U.S. at age 11, settling in Texas. After graduating from college, he moved to Russia in the wild post-Soviet days, settling in Moscow after a stint in Siberia. He made his fortune there as a stockbroker, eventually opening Soho Rooms, one of the city’s top nightspots. But in 2012, he announced that he was leaving Russia, declaring on Facebook that life there had become “unbearable and disgusting.” In Washington, Rapoport and his Russian-born wife settled into the exclusive Kalorama neighborhood, enrolling a child at Maret, a top local private school. Acquaintances here describe a frenetic, intense personality, someone with ups and downs. He dabbled in the dining industry here, too, says Winston Bao Lord, a tech entrepreneur whose investments are largely in the hospitality space. He met Rapoport, who at the time had some money invested in an Alexandria restaurant, to pitch an idea that never panned out. Lord says Rapoport was a jocular social presence. “He was a big partier when I knew him,” Lord says. “He was a confident guy that felt very strongly about his views.” Rapoport appeared occasionally in the media with Kremlin-critical posts. In 2018, the open-source investigative platform Bellingcat reported that Rapoport was behind the Facebook page of David Jewberg, purported to be a senior Pentagon analyst. The entirely made-up Lieutenant Colonel Jewberg was frequently quoted in Russian and Ukrainian media (and by some of Rapoport’s Washington friends) as a real U.S. defense insider. Mostly in Russian, the posts were critical of the Obama administration’s insufficiently aggressive stances toward Russia and Facebook’s alleged pro-Russia bias. “Dan is likely the most intelligent person I’ve ever met,” says Yuri Somov, who struck up a friendship with Rapoport in Washington. “And I’ve met people like Kissinger and Greenspan. I’m a professional interpreter. He was incredibly intense and very much larger than life, but in a good way.” Somov describes himself as apolitical, but says his friend was different: “He was a romantic. He believed things could be changed and he believed he could be a part of those changes.” Washington, Somov says, was probably not Rapoport’s natural milieu. In 2016, after divorcing, he left town, moving to Kyiv, where the tumultuous scene might have represented an opportunity for someone whose first experience was in crisis-racked post-Soviet Moscow. His ex-wife and kids stayed here. “He was too different from the world of U.S. business,” Somov says. “He probably felt closer to home in Ukraine than in the U.S.” Somov, who says he’s been devastated by Rapoport’s death, is among those who thinks the suicide story is completely plausible. “Not every unexplained death in Russia is the KGB or the GRU bumping someone off,” says Fiona Hill, the former senior Russia specialist at the White House, who met Rapoport through Somov. Rapoport had remarried in Kyiv to a Ukrainian virologist; they’d started a new family. After the war began, Rapoport relocated his wife and child to Denmark but stayed in Ukraine — and then came to Washington this summer, shipping his dog as well. Missing them, friends say, left him distraught. “He was having to start over again for the third time in 10 years,” Somov says. “We did not meet up, which I will regret for the rest of my life because he probably needed me. When he asked me, ‘lunch tomorrow?’ after not seeing each other for several years, I should have read between the lines. I must have asked him something, but I remember the answer, which is still in my phone: ‘It has been a very difficult three months.’ From him, particularly, that’s saying a lot. More than notable, it was extraordinary. No matter how things worked, he kept up appearances.” Ponomarev also says Rapoport didn’t seem great when they barbecued in Washington during a visit this summer. He said Rapoport had cut way back on drinking after his second marriage, but was drinking heavily when they met up. “It was very clear he was depressed that he was not with his family,” he says. Still, it didn’t seem desperate. “I cannot exclude that it was a suicide, but in general nothing pointed in this direction when we met. If I would feel like something like this could happen, I would talk to him more.” But for a number of people in Rapoport’s anxious political circles, it’s hard to put stock in coincidences. “He was making plans for the future. He had plans for the next week and the week after,” says Jason Jay Smart, a Kyiv-based American political consultant who says he spoke weekly with Rapoport over the past half-decade. “It’s not something someone who was planning on jumping off a building would do.” And there’s history to make Russian skeptics suspicious of Washington authorities’ investigative chops. In 2015, Mikhail Lesin, a former media aide to the Russian president, died in Washington’s Dupont Circle Hotel. Initially reported as a heart attack, the medical examiner later determined that he had died of blunt force trauma. But the report was later amended to say that the death had been an accident, the injuries sustained possibly from falling off a bed after he returned to his hotel room extremely drunk. Prosecutors closed the case. “That was outrageous,” Ponomarev says. Closer to Rapoport — but further from politics — his partner in Soho Rooms died in an apparent suicide after his own fall from a building, in Moscow in 2017. One Rapoport friend speculated that foul play could be business-related rather than political, though Satter says the two aren’t so easily separated. “Even if it was just business interests, that doesn’t mean the Russian intelligence service wasn’t involved,” he says. “They often use these disputes.” The Russian embassy did not respond to a request for comment by deadline. The FBI says it does not comment about whether it is investigating alongside the locals. And the medical examiner’s report, alas, may not be here to clear things up anytime soon: All “unnatural” deaths, even open-and-shut suicides, get sent for a report. They can take up to 90 days. In the meantime, people who find the death fishy — as well as people who merely find it heartbreaking — can probably see evidence in Rapoport’s final Facebook post, three days before his death. It was a photo of Marlon Brando’s Apocalypse Now character, accompanied by the character’s haunting last words: “The horror, the horror.”",

        "link": "https://www.franchisewire.com/akt-fitness-franchise-is-spreading-its-wings/",
        "description": "Clients Get Hooked on the Company’s Dance-Based, Aerobic Workouts&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe AKT franchise offers a dance-based, full-body fitness concept for clients with all fitness levels and body types. AKT, one of 10 boutique fitness brands under the Xponential Fitness franchisor umbrella, plans major growth as franchisees sign on for an enticing investment opportunity.\n\n\n\nPresident Melissa Chordock says her company’s trump card is to make fitness fun so that clients keep coming back for more. AKT’s cardio workouts push members to sweat, dance and burn calories in a high-energy, supportive atmosphere. Cardio dance is interspersed with strength and toning activities during AKT workouts, which improve circulation, bone health and flexibility.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy AKT Appeals Now\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChordock believes AKT’s expansion is perfectly timed. She points out that Americans were cooped up for months during the worst of the Covid pandemic, but today it’s bye-bye, couch potato and hello, workouts. “After years of Zoom calls and social isolation, people are clearly ready to move their bodies in a fun, expressive and communal way.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother factor is increased stress. People are having to commute to their offices again, inflation is a concern, and they still have stress arising from the many responsibilities in their lives – from property upkeep to parenting. AKT members defuse that stress with endorphin-releasing workouts that simultaneously build a sense of community during group fitness sessions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Most of our members use AKT as their primary fitness facility, enjoying four types of classes – bands, circuit, tone and dance,” Chordock says. “Women make up the majority of AKT membership, but you’ll often find men in our higher-intensity bands and circuit classes.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow Covid Affected AKT\n\n\n\nChordock says the pandemic both hurt and helped the AKT franchise. “When Covid struck, we had only four newly opened franchise locations and nearly 20 in development. We were on the cusp of substantial expansion. And with shutdowns mandated by government officials, plus social distancing recommendations as lockdowns began lifting, people were cautious or apprehensive about returning to fitness facilities.”\n\n\n\nAs a brand, we had to learn to adapt quickly, to be scrappy, resilient and persistent, to build awareness and momentum.\n\n\n\nThrough months of Covid cases spiking and receding, AKT had to get comfortable reassessing and reworking to continue growing. “As a brand, we had to learn to adapt quickly, to be scrappy, resilient and persistent, to build awareness and momentum,” Chordock says. “Along with our sister brands across Xponential Fitness, we had to become masters of detail and work diligently with each studio in development to tweak the process to best fit what was going on in their individual communities. The adversity has resulted in stronger strategies and operations because we were forced to tweak and try new things early on.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAKT Franchise’s Staying Power&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter rising to the pandemic challenges, Chordock is confident that AKT is here to stay. “With four distinct class varieties and new content debuting every three weeks, there is something for everyone at AKT. Its appeal is rooted in movement and influenced by dance, both of which have been embraced by many cultures for centuries as an expression of joy and celebration. We have the advantage of not being tied to a single piece of equipment. We incorporate various props such as foam rollers, hand weights and gliders.”\n\n\n\nIn addition, Chordock thinks the community spirit that’s integral to AKT has supported its sustained success and will help drive its ongoing expansion. “Community is at the core of every successful studio. We bring people together to realize the best version of themselves and celebrate the small and big wins alike. The variety of class offerings and ever-evolving content ensures our clients remain engaged and loyal.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Snapshot of AKT Franchise History\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAKT was founded in 2013 in New York City and opened its first franchise site in 2019. Entrepreneur magazine ranked AKT among its 2021 and 2022 Top New Franchises.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAKT has more than doubled in size since the pandemic began, Chordock says, and franchisees are turning profits within just one year in business. “AKT is a great opportunity for anyone looking for a semi-absentee business investment. We provide dedicated support at all times, and our onboarding and opening strategy is heavily focused on the training, development and empowerment of studio general managers. This allows owners to spend a lot less time a week operating a studio.”\n\n\n\nAKT leaders and trainers guide franchisees through the entire buildout process from layout and construction to interior design, music and technology. AKT provides comprehensive, continuing sales training and marketing assistance, with phone calls and expert guidance from day one. This assistance extends to helping franchisees hire and develop their teams to cover all business needs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Ideal AKT Franchisee\n\n\n\nAn AKT franchise owner is a high-energy person who wants to own their own business, Chordock says. The ideal franchisee possesses skills necessary for operating a business, including managerial duties and team-building. Franchisees should be:&nbsp;\n\n\n\n•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Passionate about fitness.•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Respectful communicators.•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Able and willing to follow the franchise’s proven operational guidelines.•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Decisive.•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Critical thinkers.\n\n\n\nIt costs roughly $320,000 to $500,000 to launch an AKT dance fitness studio. The franchise fee is&nbsp;$60,000. &nbsp;The franchisee should have a net worth of $500,000 and have at least $100,000 in cash on hand.

        "description": "Establishment Democrats had a good night Tuesday — results that could be interpreted as a sign their voters want to play it safe in the midterms as they battle to hold on to the House and Senate majorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn New York, Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.) defeated a progressive challenger by more than 30 percentage points.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Tonight, mainstream won,” the chairman of the House Democrats campaign arm&nbsp;said in his victory speech. “Common sense won. Democrats want candidates who get results and bring home the win.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn another House primary, former Democratic impeachment counsel Dan Goldman, who came under criticism for not being liberal enough, outpaced several progressive challengers, including Rep. Mondaire Jones, whose congressional career he halted at one term.\n\n\n\nProgressives did clinch a notable win when gun control activist Maxwell Alejandro Frost (D) beat out a slew of candidates for an open seat in Florida left vacant by Rep. Val Demings (D), who is running for governor.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Democratic voters sided with the establishment favorite, Rep. Charlie Crist (D-Fla.), over state Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried (D) to take on Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in November.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOverall, Democratic voters on the season’s final major primary night did what Democratic voters have done throughout the year: They gave progressives glimmers of hope but as a whole put their faith behind the establishment.\n\n\n\nDemocratic strategist Jon Reinish said that’s because voters are weighing who has the best chance of winning a general election and the establishment candidates were able to build “broader electoral coalitions.”\n\n\n\n“Especially given where Democrats need to win to either hold the majority, or at least keep losses, as low as possible. You know, it tends to be suburban districts, rural districts, ex-urban districts,” Reinish, a former aide to Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“And that is where a center or center left candidate who's more unifying will do well,” he added.\n\n\n\nProgressives have had some good wins over the spring and summer, most notably when Lt. Gov. John Fetterman (D) won the primary to run for a Pennsylvania Senate seat, as well as Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes’ (D) victory in Wisconsin’s Senate primary.\n\n\n\nBut there have also been a number of disappointments, and establishment voices like Maloney’s were doing some crowing in the aftermath.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn Ohio, former Bernie Sanders campaign co-chair Nina Turner lost her second House bid to Rep. Shontel Brown, who had establishment support. In a member-on-member primary for Michigan’s redrawn 11th District, moderate Rep. Haley Stevens ousted progressive Rep. Andy Levin.\n\n\n\nAnd in Texas, progressives were furious when Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) helped propel nine-term Rep. Henry Cuellar (D-Texas), considered the last anti-abortion Democrat in the House, to a narrow win over progressive challenger Jessica Cisneros in a closely watched race.\n\n\n\nCuellar’s supporters argued a progressive candidate couldn’t win his district and House leadership was eager to keep his seat in a lower chamber that Democrats control by only five seats and is widely expected to flip in November.\n\n\n\nIn another race, though, Pelosi endorsed Jones, a progressive incumbent.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, not all Democrats chalked Tuesday night up as an unmitigated win for centrists, or a statement about the Democratic landscape as a whole.\n\n\n\nAngelo Greco, who was a senior campaign adviser to Turner’s congressional campaign, argued that Crist’s win in Florida was in part because progressives coalesced around his candidacy. Democratic strategist Rodell Mollineau noted that Crist had already been a mainstay in Florida politics and had “a better mastery of the political Democratic machine.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn New York, Mollineau said Maloney had “access to funding, to establishment support, to democratic infrastructure.” And he said Goldman prevailed, at least in part, because several more progressive candidates split the vote.\n\n\n\nGoldman, a Levi Strauss &amp; Co. heir, had also poured millions of dollars into the race and had name recognition from his time as Democrats’ lead Trump impeachment counsel.\n\n\n\n“Being known for something and having a financial advantage is always important in a crowded Democratic field,” Mollineau said, adding “and he had both.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, Mollineau said many Democrats’ perceptions of anti-establishment candidates do play a role.\n\n\n\n“I feel as though, you know, those folks who have an anti-establishment, who have a ‘let’s go outside of the system, let's tear this down’ mentality when it comes to their … ideas, their legislative ideas, so on and so forth, their worldview …&nbsp; there are a growing number of people that are more … that are coming to believe that ideology, but it's not a majority of the country, and it's not a majority of Democrats,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNatalia Salgado, director of federal affairs for the Working Families Party, pointed to eight candidates, among others, they endorsed — including Becca Balint for Vermont’s at-large congressional district and Jamie McLeod-Skinner, who ousted President Biden-endorsed Rep. Kurt Schrader (D-Oreg.) — as key wins in competitive races.\n\n\n\n“The victories from our champions, even when dramatically outspent, are not just notable --&nbsp; they are unprecedented. Because of those wins, the next Congress will be more responsible to working people than the last,” she said.\n\n\n\nStill, progressives’ most prominent wins have come from Fetterman and Barnes, who Reinish says “run, in terms of their messaging, as very broadly uniting figures.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They're not bomb throwers. They're not confrontational. They're very uniting in the way that they message policy and how they conduct themselves and promote themselves as candidates.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "The Biden administration has committed nearly $13 billion worth of military assistance to Ukraine since Russia invaded six months ago.\n\n\n\nThe scope and power of those weapons has increased over time, with Ukrainian officials arguing that firepower is crucial to defend not only their country, but democracy worldwide.\n\n\n\n\"Finally it is felt that the Western artillery — the weapons we received from our partners —&nbsp; started working very powerfully,\" Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said last month.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, the United States greenlighted another military assistance package to Ukraine, preparing to send nearly $3 billion in arms and equipment to meet Kyiv’s medium- and long-term needs as it beats back Russia's military.\n\n\n\nMajor weapons\n\n\n\nHigh Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (HIMARS) and ammunitionThe U.S. has committed 16 HIMARS since late-May. It is a lighter wheeled system that can allow Ukrainians to hit Russian targets within Ukraine from further distances.1,500 Tube-Launched, Optically-Tracked, Wire-Guided (TOW) missilesManufactured by Raytheon, the TOW missiles are long-range precision, anti-tank and assault weapons that can hit targets up to 4,500 meters away.155mm HowitzersA towed field artillery piece that can hit targets up to 30 km, or 18 miles away. The U.S. has sent 126 of these howitzers, along with 806,000 155mm artillery rounds and 126 tactical vehicles to tow the howitzers.&nbsp;&nbsp;105mm HowitzersThe U.S. committed to sending 16 105mm howitzers and 108,000 105mm artillery rounds to go with the howitzers. The United Kingdom has already provided the&nbsp;L119 model, which is a light weight howitzer that can provide direct fire support at armored vehicles or buildings or indirect fire to support combat arms in ranges over 10 km, or 6 miles.120mm mortar systemsThe U.S. Army uses three versions of the 120mm mortar systems, but they are designed to provide close-range, quick-response indirect fire during tactical combat. The U.S. has sent 20 of these systems, as well as 85,000 rounds of 120mm mortar ammunition.National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems (NASAMS);The&nbsp;National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, also known as the Norwegian Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System, are advanced air-defense systems that can hit targets up to 100 miles away.&nbsp;The U.S. has committed to sending&nbsp;eight NSAMS, along with munitions for the systems.Phoenix Ghost Tactical Unmanned Aerial SystemsThe U.S. has committed approximately 700 Phoenix ‘Ghost’ drones to Ukraine between April and July. The systems, made by AEVEX Aerospace, are designed to attack targets.Switchblade Tactical Unmanned Aerial SystemsThe U.S. has sent over 700 Switchblade drones to Ukraine since March. There are two types of Switchblade drones and the U.S. has sent both, those its unclear how many of each type Washington has sent.The Switchblade 300 weighs about five pounds and can fly roughly 6 miles, and is intended to target personnel and light vehicles. However, the Switchblade 600 can fly more than 24 miles and can stay in the air for 40 minutes.Puma unmanned aerial systemsThe Pentagon awarded AeroVironment $19.7 million in April to produce the&nbsp;Puma AE RQ-20 system&nbsp;for Ukraine. Designed for reconnaissance and surveillance, it has a range of 20 km, or about 12 miles, and has over three hours of flight endurance.Mi-17 helicoptersThe U.S. has provided 20 of the Soviet-era transport helicopters that can also be used as a helicopter gunship. Can carry as many as 30 passengers or 9,000 pounds of cargoHarpoon coastal defense systemsThe U.S. announced in June that it would provide two vehicle-mounted Harpoon systems, which are intended for coastal defense. The U.S. said in June that it would provide the launchers, while allies and partners would provide the missiles.Scan Eagle Unmanned Aerial SystemsThe U.S. sent 15 Scan Eagle systems as part of its Aug. 19 package to Ukraine for reconnaissance, surveillance and target acquisition. These systems are just under four feet in length, and have an altitude of 16,000 feet above ground level. The Aug. 24 weapons package included support equipment for these systems.VAMPIRE Counter-unmanned aerial systemsThe U.S. first committed to providing the VAMPIRE system in its $2.98 billion weapons package announced Aug. 24.

        "description": "KYIV, Ukraine — Mykhail Podolyak barely flinched as air raid sirens wailed in Kyiv, signaling incoming Russian missiles.\n\n\n\nSitting in his office at the heavily fortified presidential administration building in Ukraine’s capital, the adviser to the head of the office of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the sirens have become a normal part of life six months into the war with Russia.\n\n\n\n“We’re getting used to this new lifestyle — we are used to the wailing sirens now and to the bombardments, because the Russian Federation is mostly aiming at the civilian population and civilian infrastructure,” he said in an interview with The Hill, through a translator.\n\n\n\nThe interview took place on Wednesday, which also marked Ukraine’s Independence Day, the anniversary of its sovereignty after the fall of the Soviet Union 31 years ago.\n\n\n\nHours after the interview, Russian missile attacks in the eastern city of Chaplyne killed 25 people and wounded 50 others, when rockets hit a train station and residential areas. Air raid sirens sounded through much of the country on Wednesday signaling incoming Russian missiles.\n\n\n\nPodolyak, speaking before the attack on the train station, called the threat of Russian attacks “the usual situation. Today’s not different than any other day.”\n\n\n\nBut Wednesday was different, in particular with the announcement by President Biden that the U.S. is providing Ukraine with $3 billion in additional assistance to the war effort, marking a significant tipping in the scales at the six-month mark of the fighting.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This means that we’ll be in a position now to effectively counterattack, to launch a counteroffensive,” Podolyak said, referring to the influx of assistance. “And we can defeat the enemy with the new equipment and with the new numerical value that is attached to our capacity and our capabilities.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainian military is working overtime to strike deep into Russian-occupied Ukrainian territory with U.S.- and Western-provided heavy artillery — targeting arms depots, cutting off supply lines and destroying command and control posts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe attacks serve several purposes: taking the fight to Russia, strengthening Ukrainian morale while sending a signal or resiliency to the West, and bringing pain to Russian President Vladimir Putin.\n\n\n\nAt least 16 U.S.-provided High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS) are on the ground to help in the effort.\n\n\n\nUkrainian officials and troops say these weapons can quickly turn the tide of the war, if they can get more of them faster. Maintaining strength on the battlefield and defense against Russia allows them to push back on Putin’s attempts to start negotiations — what Podolyak describes as a death sentence for Ukraine.\n\n\n\n“President Zelensky is definitely against it [negotiations], and the Ukrainian society is adamant there, because we fully appreciate the risks,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPodolyak warned that Russia would use any pause in fighting to remobilize and launch an even stronger attack on Ukraine. Absent negotiations, Podolyak said Putin is likely to focus on a war of attrition to grind down international support until his troops can get the upper hand.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They will start to manipulate, behind the scenes, moods, activities, to profess and to deepen this war fatigue,” he said, warning Russia is capable of manufacturing crises like sending an overwhelming number of migrants to Europe’s borders. He warned Moscow could also “think of some terrorist attacks against infrastructural facilities in Europe, so that they can arrive at some negotiation position, or standing for their own benefits and their own plans.”\n\n\n\n“We understand this option very well and keep discussing it with our partners,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWearing track pants, sneakers and a traditional Ukrainian tunic, Podolyak leans over the large circular table in his office during the interview. His aide says he never sits at his desk, which is strewn with papers, books and folders.\n\n\n\nThe high-ceilinged, stark white walls of his office are almost bare. Of the only two photos hung up, one shows two wounded soldiers who were part of the defense of the Azovstal steelworks in Mariupol — standing on crutches in the darkened tunnels of the plant, each with an amputated leg — that marked the last stand of the city before it fell under complete Russian control in May.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There are people who I most admire and they actually surprise me, astonish me with their courage because they are at the front line. The front line is different,” Podolyak said, reflecting on his own role in the war.\n\n\n\n“Ukraine is a unique country. This is a country that is capable of mobilizing itself especially when the hard times, dire straits come. So I can dedicate as much time and effort as I should, and as I physically can, to help such a country, because it deserves my contribution.”\n\n\n\nPodolyak has been by Zelensky’s side since the start of Russia’s invasion on Feb. 24.\n\n\n\nWhen Zelensky stepped outside of the presidential bunker on the second day of Russia’s assault to show the world proof that he was alive and in the capital, he highlighted Podolyak’s presence.\n\n\n\nLooking to the next phase of the war, Podolyak said the $3 billion in U.S. assistance goes farther than just providing physical aid. It’s a call to mobilization and meant to “encourage other, more cautious, Western powers to join the hunt, so to speak.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They all should appreciate what this war, waged by the Russian Federation, means for the people, and how it should be conducted, and what should be the correct outcome for this war,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPodolyak said the problem with “so-called traditional Europe,” and highlighted Germany, France and Italy, is with the “promptness of the decisionmaking,” criticizing them as too slow in sending the needed assistance to Ukraine compared to the speed of the United States.\n\n\n\n“We have to state clearly that they are pro-Ukrainian, of course,” he said of these countries, but added that “the power of the decisionmaking, which is now demonstrated by the United States, the old Europe can follow suit making their decisions more expedient.”\n\n\n\nPodolyak also addressed how Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has elevated himself to a role as intermediary between Russia and Ukraine, acknowledging Erdoğan as largely motivated by Turkey’s own domestic politics.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Turkish Bayraktar drones have proven extremely effective in Ukrainian counterattacks against Russian forces, Erdoğan, as mediator, successfully brought Russia to an agreement to allow the export of grain from Ukrainian ports in Odesa — critical for Ukraine’s economy and essential to address the global food crisis.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nErdoğan last week traveled to the Ukrainian city of Lviv, where he met with Zelensky. It followed a meeting he held with Putin in Sochi. Erdoğan reportedly offered to host peace talks between the two. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPodolyak,&nbsp;aiming to reinforce the strength of the Ukrainian position, stressed how Ukrainian attacks inside Russian-held territory are meant to strike a psychological blow to the Russians on top of depressing their military capabilities.\n\n\n\n“We clearly see some kind of panic is piling up, is building up in the Russian Federation, because [instead] of a blitzkrieg they’ve had this six months of continuous and, seemingly, endless special operation,” he said, referring to Putin’s refusal, and Russian law banning “war,” to describe the fighting in Ukraine.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInternational officials observing the Ukrainian military strategy say attacks inside Russian-held territory could rattle Putin. They are aimed at increasing the cost for him to continue the war.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast week, Putin replaced the commander of Russia’s Black Sea Fleet, and that followed a series of significant attacks against Russian military installations on the occupied Crimean Peninsula.\n\n\n\nUkrainian military officials have reportedly claimed responsibility for at least one attack, on Russia’s Saki Air Base on Aug. 9, which destroyed at least seven Russian war planes. One person was killed and nine people reported injured.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPodolyak, when asked what his assessment of what Putin’s goals are given the state of fighting, answered that while he’s not a “mind reader when it comes to the Russian side,” he said they clearly overestimated their capabilities.\n\n\n\n“Russia is traditionally an irrational state, with a very low analytical capability. Russia, very clearly, overappreciated their own understanding of who is who in this world.”&nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "description": "Republicans are fighting against a social movement in the financial sector meant to address systemic issues like climate change. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nGovernmental initiatives in Florida, West Virginia and Texas are targeting powerhouse Wall Street firms that they say are engaging in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, which they view to be harmful to their states' economies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLetters dated Aug. 10 were sent out this month by the Texas Senate Committee on State Affairs to Wall Street firms Blackrock, Vanguard, Institutional Shareholder Services and State Street, asking for details about the companies’ ESG practices and how they could affect the state’s public pensions, including retirement funds for teachers and state employees.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe letter to Blackrock requested “all documents and communications relating to the actual or potential effects of ESG integration practices on the financial outlook, risk/return profile, performance, or profitability of any of your funds, portfolio companies, or institutional accounts of ESG integration practices.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTexas State Affairs Committee Chairman Bryan Hughes (R) said in an interview with The Hill that numerous public pension funds, endowments and retirement accounts could all be affected by ESG investing practices.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The Teacher Retirement System of Texas and the Employees Retirement System of Texas, all of our university endowment funds and various other pension funds, as well as the millions of investors who are trusting these firms with their 401(k)s, and then of course all the Texas companies that are being bullied and being manipulated by these firms – for all those reasons, this is important for the Texas legislature to do something about,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The people of Texas are finding out that a handful of Wall Street firms are using other people’s money to push a narrow agenda and we’re pushing back,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile ESG doesn’t have a hard and fast definition, it generally aligns with the United Nations’s sustainable development goals (SDGs), a massive international&nbsp;program&nbsp;of environmental and social equality objectives agreed to by all of the U.N.’s 193 member states, including the U.S.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As of December 2020, over two thirds of the world’s GDP was being generated in places with actual or intended ‘net zero by 2050’ targets, covering over half of the world’s population and emissions,” a&nbsp;write-up&nbsp;on the latest SDG status report from the U.N.’s statistics agency says, referring to the goal of reaching net-zero carbon emissions, which are produced in abundance by the fossil fuel industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Environmental Protection Agency&nbsp;says&nbsp;that “the main human activity that emits CO2&nbsp;[carbon dioxide] is the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, natural gas, and oil) for energy and transportation.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFossil fuels are a major industry in Texas, where oil and gas make up more than a third of the state’s economy, according to Texas Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nA representative for Blackrock indicated that the company had received the letter requesting documents and “[plans] to respond” but did not provide further details.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Blackrock does not boycott fossil fuels – investing over $100 billion in Texas energy companies on behalf of our clients proves that,” the company said in a statement, adding that “elected and appointed public officials have a duty to act in the best interests of the people they serve. Politicizing state pension funds, restricting access to investments, and impacting the financial returns of retirees, is not consistent with that duty.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFossil fuels are also a big industry in West Virginia, where coal mining has long played a leading role in the state’s economy. Similar moves by state officials there have also gone after ESG investing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There is a campaign that’s being waged through ESG on multiple fronts – rating agencies, asset managers, the big banks. They’re all pushing their agenda through our capital markets,” West Virginia state Treasurer Riley Moore (R) said in an interview with The Hill. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s coercive capitalism and a distortion in the marketplace. They are pushing policies they can’t achieve in the ballot box, and they’re using the power of their capital to achieve their goals by other means.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“All of this is tied to the fossil fuel industry,” he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn July, West Virginia blacklisted Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan Chase, Blackrock, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo by adding them to the state’s list of restricted financial institutions. They wouldn’t be removed until they had “ceased all activity that boycotts energy companies,” according to&nbsp;a proclamation&nbsp;signed by the treasurer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I’m the tip of the spear on this, but there’s an army behind me. Texas, Kentucky, Oklahoma, Tennessee. Their own lists will likely come out this year or next. There are fifteen states with upcoming legislative sessions. We are proud to be leading, but we are not the only ones. We are looking also at proxy voting on our pension boards,” Riley said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) banned ESG investing from the state’s pension funds, voting for a resolution mandating that investment decisions “must be based only on pecuniary factors [which] do not include the consideration of the furtherance of social, political, or ideological interests.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We are reasserting the authority of Republican governance over corporate dominance and we are prioritizing the financial security of the people of Florida over whimsical notions of a utopian tomorrow,” the governor said in a Tuesday statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile ESG may be in the crosshairs of Republicans, it’s not clear that the financial initiative from multinational corporations is making any difference when it comes to fighting the causes of climate change.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.N.’s&nbsp;latest SDG report&nbsp;found that fossil fuel emissions rebounded to a record high in 2021 as the global economy bounced back from the coronavirus pandemic, wiping out pandemic-related declines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe report found that “With the phasing out of COVID-related restrictions, demand for coal, oil and gas increased. Consequently, energy-related emissions for 2021 rose by 6 percent, reaching their highest level ever and completely wiping out the pandemic-related reduction seen in 2020.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEconomists aren’t certain that market dynamics and targeted investment practices are even capable of dealing with climate change. Former World Bank chief economist Nicholas Stern wrote in 2007 that “greenhouse gas emissions are externalities and represent the biggest market failure the world has seen.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Emissions are not ordinary, localized externalities. Risk on a global scale is at the core of the issue,” he wrote in an academic paper. “These basic features of the problem must shape the economic analysis we bring to bear; failure to do this will, and has, produced approaches to policy that are profoundly misleading and indeed dangerous.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, the trend of ESG in the private sector appears set to continue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA&nbsp;March report&nbsp;from the Harvard Law School Forum on Corporate Governance said recent proxy voting seasons, which are the times when activist investor shareholders can make their moves to influence how companies are run, was “unpredictable” and&nbsp; “unprecedented, with record support for shareholder proposals on environmental and social issues, growing opposition to director elections, and significant support for governance proposals.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Major institutional investors, especially those with large passive index funds, have embraced these shifts toward a focus on ESG and a multistakeholder model, and that is coming through in their support for E&amp;S [environmental and social] shareholder proposals,” the school’s report said.&nbsp;",

        "description": "President Biden is facing calls to allow Col. Yevgeny “Eugene” Vindman, who alongside his twin brother Alexander blew the whistle on former President Trump’s July 2019 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to retire with the title of colonel. \n\n\n\nVindman was promoted to colonel in March of last year by Biden after his career was sidetracked by a bad review — something the Defense Department’s inspector general later determined was likely a reprisal for his involvement in expressing concerns over Trump’s actions on the phone call.\n\n\n\nBut to officially retire as a colonel, one must hold the rank for three years. \n\n\n\nLawyers Defending American Democracy, which wrote the letter to Biden, said the move would have significance beyond a formal title. \n\n\n\n“In granting this waiver, you will reinforce a critical message: those who stand up with courage for the constitution and the rule of law will be rewarded, and retaliation will not be tolerated,” they write.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo days after Trump was acquitted of impeachment charges over his dealings with Ukraine in the Senate, both Vindman brothers were escorted out of the White House. Their promotions to colonel were delayed. While Alexander Vindman retired, Eugene Vindman received a career-damaging negative performance review from a superior who, one year earlier, had praised him as one of the best military lawyers and officers he had ever worked with. \n\n\n\nEugene Vindman is set to retire this coming Wednesday. \n\n\n\n“His one goal, as he faces a retirement he would not have chosen had his career not been thwarted, is to retire with the rank of Colonel. This would require, by statute, that you approve a waiver of the requirement that he serve three years in rank prior to retirement; he has served more than a year as Colonel. A waiver would not raise his pension, rather, it would provide him with only the honor and recognition due for his service to the country,” the letter adds. \n\n\n\nThe group has gotten 5,000 signatures on its letter, which was sent to Biden late Thursday.\n\n\n\n“There are military heroes. There are legal heroes. Then there are those like Colonel Vindman who are both. He deserves to retire with the rank that he has so well earned,” Norm Eisen, an attorney who served as co-counsel for the House Judiciary Committee during Trump’s first impeachment. \n\n\n\nLegal scholar Lawrence Tribe is also backing the effort.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Eugene Vindman, like his brother, Alex, is a profile in courage. He blew the whistle on a president who tried to extort a foreign leader and got impeached for it. We should award Eugene his rank in retirement and honor ourselves by doing so. This is about who we are as a country. Do we honor heroes who stand up for the rule of law, or do we watch in silence while they walk away without our thanks?” he said in a statement to The Hill.&nbsp;",

There is an enormous fatigue, resignation and sheer exhaustion in the entire scientific community. People are quitting their jobs, or when they are keeping their jobs, they are keeping their heads down,” he said.\n\n\n\nIt’s striking to think of how different things seemed just a couple of years ago.\n\n\n\nAt the outset of the pandemic in early 2020, Fauci was largely seen as a reassuring national presence. The White House briefings he led became required viewing for many Americans as COVID-19 took hold.\n\n\n\nA New Yorker magazine article in April 2020 carried a headline about how Fauci had become “America’s doctor.” The story noted that Fauci’s approval rating in one poll was close to 80 percent.\n\n\n\nIn time, however, he would be lambasted as a “disaster” by then-President Trump, the sixth of seven presidents he served; he would require a personal security detail to protect him and his family from numerous threats; and he would become one of the leading targets of conservatives in general.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, two days after Fauci announced he would soon end his 38-year stint as the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) told an Orlando rally, “Someone needs to grab that little elf and chuck him across the Potomac.”\n\n\n\nSen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.), who has frequently crossed swords with Fauci over the specifics of U.S. funding for research in Wuhan, China, complained that if the scientist had been “a family doctor in Peoria,” then the allegedly baleful effects of his advice would have affected only “the people foolish enough to choose him as a doctor.”\n\n\n\n“Once you put him in charge of the world, it all trickles down,” Paul added, according to a series of tweets from NBC News reporter Kate Santaliz.\n\n\n\nConservative media figures have piled on too.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMegyn Kelly, complaining about an equivocal answer Fauci give about whether he would comply with a hypothetical subpoena from Republicans in Congress, told her podcast listeners on Wednesday , “F--- you, Dr. Fauci.”\n\n\n\nGiven commentary like that, it’s no surprise that 80 percent approval ratings are a thing of the past.\n\n\n\nAn Economist-YouGov poll in June found 43 percent of Americans viewed Fauci favorably, but 41 percent viewed him unfavorably. Among Republicans, he was viewed favorably by just 18 percent and unfavorably by 70 percent.\n\n\n\nFauci’s defenders don’t claim that he has been omniscient or infallible.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the pandemic’s earliest days, he argued against the need for the general public to wear masks, later changing his tune dramatically.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe pros and cons of other initiatives, notably the widespread shuttering of schools, will be debated for years, perhaps decades — though in that case, Fauci has noted that he himself spoke of the need to try to minimize negative impacts on children.\n\n\n\nEven so, most people in the public health sphere note, firstly, that Fauci was faced with an almost impossible task: Trying to communicate clear messages about a new and deadly virus about which much was unknown.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSecondly, they say instances where recommendations changed — such as on mask-wearing — demonstrate scientists doing exactly what they’re supposed to do: incorporate new information into their views.\n\n\n\n“Changing guidance is the bedrock of sound public health policy,” said Dr. Leana Wen, a former Baltimore City Health Commissioner. “When new research comes out, the guidance would change accordingly, or when circumstances change, the guidance would also change.”\n\n\n\nFor figures such as Wen, the kind of attacks aimed at Fauci — and at her, as she became a prominent media presence during the pandemic — are far from abstractions.\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, a Texas man was sentenced to six months in prison for threatening Wen. Prosecutors said the man, 52-year-old Scott Eli Harris, was outraged by her backing for COVID-19 vaccines and sent her a message threatening she would be shot. \n\n\n\nIn the message, Harris allegedly claimed to be an Army veteran and a sniper, according to a CBS News report.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, charges were unsealed in another case where a man allegedly threatened Wen.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, a West Virginia man received a three-year prison term for emailing a death threat to Fauci.\n\n\n\n“It’s really hard,” Wen told this column. “We are trying to do our jobs, we are trying to advise our patients about how they can keep themselves and their families safe … [and] we are threatened with our lives and worried about our own families.”\n\n\n\nThreats aside, the sheer intensity of the divide around Fauci disconcerts plenty of political experts too.\n\n\n\n“It is one of the best exhibits of just how deep this polarization is, because you take someone who would not normally be viewed through a political lens, and instead that seems to be almost the only way he is viewed,” said Grant Reeher, a professor of political science at Syracuse University’s Maxwell School.\n\n\n\n“He is a folk hero among Democrats and a milder version of Satan among Republicans.”\n\n\n\nFauci, who is 81, has said that it is time to “pursue the next chapter of my career.”\n\n\n\nBut the nation won’t so easily close the book on the currents that have swirled around him during COVID.\n\n\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage.",

        "description": "Liberal lawmakers are pressing Democratic leaders in the House to not include a side deal undercutting environmental reviews worked out with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in a short-term measure funding the government.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHouse Natural Resources Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) is circulating a&nbsp;letter asking&nbsp;leadership to separate the Manchin deal out from a continuing resolution that would temporarily avert a government shutdown.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Don’t attach it to a budget, to a CR, must-pass legislation and therefore take this essential Republican agenda and have Democrats pass it,” he told The Hill earlier this month.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe issue is expected to come to a head in September, when lawmakers return from recess, as Democrats try to secure funding for the government and prevent a shutdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe deal was part of the agreement Manchin made with Democratic leaders as they won his support for their now-passed climate, tax and health care bill.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnder the deal with Manchin, worked out by President Biden, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the trio agreed “to pass comprehensive permitting reform legislation before the end of this fiscal year,” which ends on October 1.&nbsp;The provisions are designed to expedite energy and infrastructure projects subject to environmental reviews.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat sets up a potential shutdown crisis if progressives block a funding bill over the inclusion of the permitting reform language and Democrats can’t find the votes elsewhere.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats do not want to shut down the government months before the midterm elections, so an actual shutdown is highly unlikely. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nGrijalva acknowledged that it would likely be difficult for many members to vote against funding the government.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is not trying to torpedo anything. This is saying the [continuing resolution] and the budget is critical, yes, but let’s do this other one where everybody is accountable,” he said.&nbsp;While Grijalva’s office declined to say Thursday how many lawmakers are signing his letter, at least a few others have signaled resistance to the deal.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If we want to streamline permitting for critically important projects that help solve the climate crisis there’s absolutely a conversation to be had and maybe a bill that would help with that, but this framework that came out of the smoke-filled room with Manchin and Schumer doesn’t work for me,”&nbsp;Rep. Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) told The Hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe also argued the standoff likely wouldn’t cause a shutdown, suggesting a clean measure known as a continuing resolution or “CR” could be approved to fund the government. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You can tell members ‘if you vote against this you’re shutting down the government,’ but most of us are a little smarter than that and we know that you can have a backup CR ready to go that funds the government without all the fossil fuel baggage,” Huffman said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf progressives do make a stand, it will complicate life for House Democratic leaders. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats enjoy a very narrow majority in the House, meaning even a handful of progressive votes could block a measure to fund the government&nbsp;— if there's not the Republican support to make up the difference.&nbsp;The more signatures on the Grijalva letter, the more leverage progressives could have. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocratic leaders would face a difficult choice&nbsp;between&nbsp;passing a clean continuing resolution and potentially angering&nbsp;Manchin;&nbsp;convincing their own members to shed their environmental concerns and back the Manchin side deal;&nbsp;or&nbsp;leaning on GOP votes to prevent a shutdown.\n\n\n\nGetting Republicans on board to counter any liberal defections is a very real possibility — dozens of GOP lawmakers supported a CR to prevent a shutdown last September — although Pelosi’s style has been to unite Democrats before bringing virtually any legislation to the floor, thereby avoiding a reliance on votes across the aisle. A wild card in the debate could be the inclusion of funding for natural disasters, which could sweeten the package for on-the-fence lawmakers in both parties.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA number of GOP members do support the permitting changes advanced by Manchin. Whether they’ll want to back a Democratic funding measure that includes them&nbsp;— or allow Democrats to fight it out internally ahead of the elections —&nbsp;is another question. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the Senate, Democrats will need 10 GOP votes to back a package and overcome a filibuster. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSenate Republicans felt spurned by Manchin’s agreement with Schumer on the Inflation Reduction Act, which was passed under special budget rules in the Senate that avoid a filibuster. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe deal was announced immediately after the Senate approved a separate bipartisan bill to strengthen the semiconductor industry. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) had previously threatened not to support the semiconductor bill if Democrats pursued their partisan package, and that measure moved at a time when the larger climate, tax and health care bill looked dead.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has pledged to vote against the permitting deal on principle, even if he may actually like the policies included in it.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I will not vote for a continuing resolution that is part of a political payback scheme,” Graham said in a press conference this month. “Senator Manchin, if you think you’re going to get 60 votes to get the sweeteners that can’t be done in reconciliation, you need to think long and hard about what you’re doing.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement to The Hill on Thursday, Republican Conference Chairman and top GOP senator on the Energy and Natural Resources Committee John Barrasso (Wyo.)&nbsp;signaled that there could be another&nbsp;barrier to Manchin's deal: The permitting language, which&nbsp;may not be&nbsp;strong enough to win GOP support.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This narrow proposal does not go nearly far enough. It will not prevent the Biden administration from continuing its war on American energy,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA summary of the agreement released by Manchin’s office said the deal would direct the president to keep a list of 25 high priority energy and infrastructure projects that would get prioritized permitting.&nbsp;Infrastructure projects in general would also be expedited&nbsp;under maximum timelines for environmental reviews&nbsp;and limits to&nbsp;state and tribal authorities from blocking projects that run through their waters.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe summary also includes the completion of the Mountain Valley Pipeline, a controversial pipeline that would bring natural gas from West Virginia to Virginia.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA separate&nbsp;summary that has circulated among Senate Democrats in recent days. It makes a climate case for backing the deal. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe summary, which was obtained by The Hill, provided new details: saying that a certain number of these 25 projects have to be either renewables, electric transmission, critical minerals, hydrogen or fossil fuel projects that “significantly reduce emissions.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt also said that the deal does not change federal environmental law requirements, instead setting “target timelines” for environmental reviews.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The proposed Senate Permitting Package would help expedite the nationwide buildout of power sector transmission infrastructure that is critical to deploying the cleaner generation needed to hit President Biden’s climate goals,” the summary said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe fight over passing the measure to keep the government open is likely to take more twists and turns in September as lawmakers scramble to get their work done and return to their home districts ahead of the midterms. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nCongress will return to a lame-duck session in November, when it will likely need to approve another package funding the government into the new year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "description": "A watery route with plenty of fishing is among author Martin Dorey’s favourite UK wilderness road tripsWales and I have history. It began on camping holidays in Pembrokeshire as a kid, then, as I discovered surfing, took me to sleeping in vans between waves on the Llŷn peninsula. The van made it easy to follow the surf and stay warm and dry at the same time: a safe space on wheels.More recently I set off on another Welsh trip as part of my research for a new guidebook about offbeat campervan adventures in England and Wales. Rather than the sea, a river would be the focus this time – the Teifi, which I planned to follow from outdoorsy, hip Cardigan to the Teifi Pools, a series of high lakes in the Cambrian Mountains, at 455 metres above sea level, with fishing and canoeing stops along the way. It’s only about 70 miles from sea to source but it takes you from a tiny beach, through a stunning gorge that’s recovering from Wales’s industrial past and into one of the UK’s last wildernesses. My fishing partner Andy and I did it over three days but could have easily hung about for much longer. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Enlarge / In a subtle troll at its rival, Audi says this will be the first F1 engine built in Germany for more than a decade. (credit: Audi)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAudi will race in Formula 1 in 2026 with engines built at its Audi Sport factory in Neustadt, Germany. After years of rumors, Friday's announcement was not entirely unexpected; in May then-Volkswagen Group CEO Herbert Diess confirmed it would enter the sport in four years when the next set of engine regulations come into effect.\nVW Group will actually fund two F1 programs, one with Audi and a second with Porsche, which is in the process of acquiring a 50 percent stake in Red Bull Technologies. The Porsche announcement was supposed to take place at Red Bull's home race in Austria in July, but the sport only ratified the 2026 engine rules in mid-August.\nThat deal may still need some i's dotted and t's crossed, but with the new rules now confirmed, Audi has taken the opportunity of this week's Belgian Grand Prix to reveal its show car and to formally launch its F1 effort.Read 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Amer has created one of the most hilarious, touching and honest sitcoms in years. He talks the reality of seeking US citizenship, his father’s death – and growing up near Beyoncé‘Just pretend you and I are in a barbershop”, says the Palestinian American comedian Mo Amer. “We’re talking on a video call, amid the sound of intricate scissor work and the occasional buzz of clippers, as he has his hair and beard trimmed in preparation for press interviews for his new film, Black Adam. He’s in the US, while I’m in Amsterdam. “You’re in one of my favourite cities in the world!” he says, before launching into tales of his standup adventures in the city.This is what it’s like to speak to Amer. He is best known for two Netflix standup specials in which he delivers sharp routines on the intricacies of hummus preparation, the perils of travelling with refugee papers and the intensity of Arabic swear words. In person, there is a charming authenticity to him, a desire to turn every conversational twist into a way to establish a genuine connection. His persona as a performer makes this less than surprising – particularly when you see his new Netflix sitcom Mo. Its approach to honesty and connection doesn’t exactly see Amer maintaining a standoff-ish distance from his audience. Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/how-to-add-gift-cards-google-wallet",
        "description": "Google has prepared a blast from the past in the form of its efforts to revive the Google Wallet app and branding. The idea is to offer users a more card-centric, user-friendly experience that&#8217;s not centered on peer-to-peer payments and transaction management like Google Pay.\n\n\n\nWallet allows you to add credit and debit cards, passports, loyalty cards, event tickets (Disney, concerts, movie tickets, etc.) and even your COVID-19 vaccination record (depending on what state or country you live in. Ultimately, it&#8217;s a fantastic way to lighten the load on your wallet and stop carrying around so many keychain items, and that alone makes it worth using each day. \n\n\n\nHowever, something I&#8217;ve noticed has been left out of the mix when others pitch or use the service is gift cards. Today, I&#8217;m going to give you a quick and straightforward tutorial on how to add all of the gift cards you&#8217;ve got stuffed in your wallet or laying around the house into a beautiful, vertical display for quick and clutter-free checkout on the go!\n\n\n\nTaking stock of your gift cards\n\n\n\nFirst and foremost, go ahead and get all of the gift cards your family and friends gave you last year that you either spent part or none of into a pile near you. From there, you&#8217;ll want to be certain to check their balance by Googling something like &#8220;Best Buy gift card check balance&#8220;, and replacing &#8220;Best Buy&#8221; with the card provider&#8217;s name. All companies have such a tool and by punching in the 16 digits on the back of the card as well as the PIN code (you may need to grab a coin and scratch off what&#8217;s covering it!) you can quickly discover how much money you&#8217;re sitting on.\n\n\n\nSource: Best Buy\n\n\nTake a sharpie marker and write the allocated amount per card on the back, but be sure you don&#8217;t cover the bar code. Until you get comfortable with checking out on the go with Google Wallet, you may want to keep these in your physical wallet. If for some reason the provider doesn&#8217;t scan gift cards or decides they won&#8217;t accept a digital version, you&#8217;ll still have all of your bases covered. This may defeat the purpose of digitizing them in some ways, but you still won&#8217;t need to reach for your wallet in most instances, and over time, you will no longer need to keep them physically handy.\n\n\n\nAdding gift cards to Google Wallet\n\n\n\nIt&#8217;s time to open the Google Wallet app on your Android device. Now, tap the &#8220;+ Add to Wallet&#8221; button at the bottom right of the screen and choose &#8220;Gift card&#8221;. Then, a long list of card providers will populate the screen. Things like Target, Amazon, Panera Bread, Walmart, Starbucks, and so on. Go ahead and choose the brand of the gift card you&#8217;re holding or use the search bar at the top of the screen.\n\n\n\nThe very next screen will let you enter the card&#8217;s 16-digit number, the PIN code (also found on the back), the balance you wrote in permanent marker as previously discussed, and any notes you may want to include about it. Lastly, the blue &#8220;Add to Wallet&#8221; button will finalize your choices, and the gift card itself will appear just under your primary debit or credit card in the vertical list!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just want the steps!1. Open the Google Wallet app on your phone2. Tap &#8220;+ Add to Wallet&#8221; at the bottom right3. Select &#8220;Gift Cards&#8221; from the list4. Select a gift card provider or search5. Enter the card number, PIN, card balance, and your notes6. Tap &#8220;Add to Wallet&#8221; to finalize\n\n\n\nThe Final Result\n\n\n\nAlright, that&#8217;s that! Let&#8217;s go back to the homescreen of Google Wallet and see your gift cards. As previously mentioned, they appear just beneath your primary payment cards in the vertical list as shown below. In the example, I have Barnes &amp; Noble, Best Buy, and Starbucks added. My card number and security code have been blurred out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you visit the store, all you need to do is open Wallet, tap the card from the list, and let the employee there scan your phone screen.

        "description": "All Points East festival, Victoria Park, LondonKevin Parker and his five-man crew channel the energy of 60s psychedelia and  90s club culture to dazzle a wild crowdWhat an unusual proposition Tame Impala are. Kevin Parker, a genial Australian with a laissez-faire look that might be described as surfer rave Jesus, started out in the late 2000s as a one-man psychedelic rock band who pretended he didn’t play every note himself because he worried he wasn’t interesting enough to be a solo artist. Now he’s the platinum-selling producer called on to make a song with Diana Ross for the soundtrack to Despicable Me 3 and remix Elvis for Baz Luhrmann. His five-man live show, meanwhile, has become enough of a draw to headline Coachella in 2019 when Justin Timberlake dropped out, where they staged such an expensively brain-melting production that Parker actually lost money.That show was intended to promote his fourth album, The Slow Rush, but it wasn’t ready yet (perfectionism is a beast). As soon as it finally came out, in February 2020, the pandemic put Tame Impala on ice. It was all too ironic for a record about how time always seems to pass too quickly or too slowly. This return to London, then, has been a long time coming. “I can’t tell you how fucking long I’ve waited for this,” he says with feeling. “I thought this day would never come.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "At this year’s city-shaking, weekend-long bash, a triangular pavilion will be appearing amid the floats and dancers. Revellers can sneak inside for a rest – or climb on top and partyAlvaro Barrington is recalling his first ever festival experience in Grenada: “I was maybe five years old and my cousins took me to J’ouvert,” he says, referring to the day that acts as a precursor to the main party in Caribbean culture. “I have a memory of one of my older cousins holding my hand as we walked through the streets. We found a sound system and I climbed up on it and immediately fell asleep with the music blasting. A few hours later, I woke up to my cousin carrying me home while I laid on his shoulder.”He may have missed out on the good stuff, but the sleepy experience has inspired his latest project. Because amid the floats, sound systems and food trucks at this year’s Notting Hill carnival there will also be a pavilion designed specifically for people who need to take a bit of time out from the action. Located next to where the carnival’s judges are based on the Great Western Road, the approximately three-metre high structure is made from a series of interlocking plywood components. The pavilion will be completed during the carnival’s opening parade by members of the community who will carry elements of the building, slotting them into the roughly pyramid-shaped construction themselves at the end of the procession. Once finished, party-goers will be able to rest inside Barrington’s pavilion, or clamber up the outside in order to better see the procession. “Carnival can be a place for many different types of culture,” he says. “For the Caribbean community, it has a long history of being a space in which art gets produced. I thought maybe we can bring architecture into that too.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "President Biden on Thursday kicked off his party’s drive to get Democratic candidates elected in November with a national message warning that Republicans are taking away reproductive and voting rights while bowing to special interests, extremists and the toxic influence of former President Trump.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“What we’re seeing now, is either the beginning or the death knell of an extreme MAGA philosophy,” the president told a crowd of donors outside Washington in a Maryland suburb before a subsequent rally. “It’s not just Trump, it’s the entire philosophy that underpins the — I’m going to say something, it’s like semi-fascism.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn 2020, Biden told voters his mission was to save the middle class while uniting the country. Two years later as president, the question is whether he can save his party while overcoming voters’ pessimism that the country is on the wrong track.\n\n\n\n“This fall will be a choice between these two visions,” he said as a heckler momentarily interrupted his remarks. “In 18 months, COVID no longer controls our lives. A record number of Americans are working. … Businesses are growing.”\n\n\n\nThe president, who shared his stage with Wes Moore, Democrats’ candidate for governor in Maryland, raced through a script packed with references to conservative blockades in Congress, “climate deniers,” “MAGA Republicans” and Big Pharma. “They lost,” he shouted.\n\n\n\nBiden is viewed by some Democrats as an awkward standard-bearer, in part because a majority of Americans disapprove of his performance amid high prices, an exhausting pandemic and relentless partisanship. Some in his party hope he hangs up his political career after one term. Some are not hiding their disinterest in his help as they campaign.\n\n\n\nBiden’s message: Think again. “Things are beginning to change a little bit,” he told supporters on Thursday. “We’re heading in the right direction.”\n\n\n\nUntil a few weeks ago, Republicans were optimistic they could flip the House, send Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) packing, and tilt control of the Senate in their favor next year. But as Election Day approaches, the GOP concedes it has a case of political jitters as Biden and congressional leaders tout their newly enacted Inflation Reduction Act and its historic climate change provisions and drug pricing pluses. At the same time, record-high gasoline prices have fallen, and states’ restrictive abortion laws are mobilizing female voters to think about keeping Democrats in power in Washington.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s job approval has inched up to 44 percent, the highest it’s been in a year, according to a Gallup survey released on Thursday (The Hill).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe president and many Democratic candidates are opting to revive some of the same themes they successfully used in 2020. It’s a risk, since midterms are usually a referendum on the party in power in the White House. Most of America says the nation is on the wrong track. It’s Biden’s job before Nov. 8 to persuade them otherwise.\n\n\n\nHeading into the 2010 midterms, former President Obama also attempted to nationalize the off-year stakes to help Democratic candidates. His job approval was 45 percent. His party lost 63 House seats and control of the lower chamber and barely held onto a Senate majority after a loss of six seats. Obama glumly called it a “shellacking” the day after the elections. Biden remembers those results, and also the script.\n\n\n\n“If you want to know what will happen if the other party takes over Congress, all you've got to do is take a look at what they've done the last 18 months,” Obama told a Miami audience at a Democratic National Committee event almost exactly a dozen years ago. “On issue after issue, they've sided with special interests over the middle class. They voted to give tax breaks to companies that ship jobs overseas. … We've got to start asking, what's good for America?”\n\n\n\nSimilarly, former President Clinton in 1994 responded to Republicans’ nationalized campaign for divided government with a narrative about Democrats’ achievements in Washington. His job approval at the time was 39 percent. He accused conservatives of being “out there with all their pie-in-the-sky schemes and all their no-saying and now a lot of their denial about what they did and didn't do when they were up here. We have a record.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These elections can be our friend,” he told his party during a September 1994 fundraiser.\n\n\n\nThe result, however, was a “Republican sweep” in which Clinton’s party lost 52 House seats (plus two in special elections earlier that year) and eight Senate seats. The GOP captured the House majority for the first time in four decades, gained 12 governorships and regained control in 20 state legislatures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor the next 75 days, Biden, 79, will test the campaign messages he knows by heart in search of winning results. He’ll make his pitch on Sept. 9 in red-state Ohio, where there’s an open Senate race and a groundbreaking for a new Intel semiconductor plant. He’ll also raise some campaign money in New York City on Sept. 19 while he’s there for a United Nations speech about uncertainties in the rest of the world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Establishment Democrats crow after latest victories.\n\n\n\n▪ The Cook Political Report: Red wave looks more like a ripple.\n\n\n\n▪ The New York Times analysis: Biden steps back onto the campaign trail.\n\n\n\n▪ Split Ticket: Temperature check: U.S. Senate.\n\n\n\n▪ Politico: Mehmet Oz shifts strategy in Pennsylvania as his campaign ails.\n\n\n\n▪ The Associated Press: Herschel Walker skips details in bid to oust Sen.

The documents, which include batches that are considered “classified” by the FBI as part of the National Archives’ case that he removed materials that are not his to keep (CNN).\n\n\n\n▪ CNN: Inside Trump's public bravado and private resistance over Mar-a-Lago documents.\n\n\n\n▪ Politico: Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows ordered to testify in Fulton County probe of Trump election overturn efforts.\n\n\n\n▪ The New York Times: Georgia Gov.

In the early days of the pandemic, Fauci’s approval rating was near 80 percent and media headlines proclaimed the infectious disease expert in charge of the government’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases as “America’s doctor.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLeading to his decision to depart government in December, Fauci has often been asked about the impact of polarization on public health and on his approach to public messaging during the pandemic. Is he the victim of political forces outside his control, or were there missteps that contributed to the change?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES\n\n\n\n➤ STATE WATCH\n\n\n\nThose who live in four more GOP-led states – Idaho, Tennessee, Texas and North Dakota – this week experience the beginning of “trigger laws” restricting abortion rights, while litigation continues in some cases. Of the four states, all but North Dakota already had anti-abortion laws in place that largely blocked patients from accessing the procedure. Many clinics that provided abortions have either stopped offering those services or moved to other states where abortion remains legal. The Associated Press updates current situations in the four states.\n\n\n\n➤ ADMINISTRATION\n\n\n\nThe largest student loan forgiveness plan in U.S. history, announced at the White House on Wednesday, also leaves plenty of questions as borrowers try to navigate the administration’s new policies.

A 36-page plan, laid out by the Department of Defense, ​​titled the “Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan,” calls for sweeping changes in military planning, training, doctrine and policy for all future conflicts, according to Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder, the Pentagon’s top spokesman.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRyder noted to reporters that the idea is to install at all operational levels individuals “who are trained to have an understanding of civilian harm, the aspects of civilian harm mitigation, and operational planning,” from the outset of any mission (The Hill).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDefense Secretary Lloyd Austin approved the plan earlier in the week.\n\n\n\n“We will ensure that we are well prepared to prevent, mitigate and respond to civilian harm in current and future conflicts,” Austin wrote of the plan. “Importantly, this plan is scalable and relevant to both counterterrorism operations and large-scale conflicts against peer adversaries” (The New York Times).\n\n\n\nCNN: U.S. carries out additional airstrikes in Syria following rocket attack that injured US troops.\n\n\n\nThe Health and Human Services Department today is facilitating a flight from Europe and the Netherlands to the United States to deliver the equivalent of 862,000 eight-ounce bottles of baby formula for use under medical supervision.

The move to increase the number of troops by 137,000, or 13 percent, to 1.15 million by the end of the year came amid chilling developments on the ground in Ukraine, including fears of a nuclear catastrophe and missile strikes aimed by Russia on Wednesday against civilians (The Associated Press).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant controlled by Russia in Ukraine was temporarily cut off from the electrical grid for the first time on Thursday, forcing a momentary blackout in the surrounding areas after a power line was damaged. Moscow is using the plant as a base from which to launch attacks (The Associated Press).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInspectors with the International Atomic Energy Agency, who plan to enter the plant before Sept. 5, will be given wider latitude than initially sought. IAEA officials had originally planned to try to ensure that enriched-uranium stockpiles had not gone missing from Europe’s largest nuclear power plant during the course of the six-month war.

        "description": "A Chipotle sign hangs outside the chain restaurant in Pittsburgh on Feb. 8, 2016. In June 2022, employees of the Augusta, Maine, Chipotle filed a petition with the National Labor Relations Board asking to hold a union election at the store. The NLRB had scheduled a hearing July 19, 2022. But Chipotle announced the same day it was permanently closing the store.Keith Srakocic/APA Chipotle restaurant in Lansing, Mich., voted Thursday to unionize, making it the first of the chain&#x27;s nearly 3,000 locations to do so.The employees are seeking improved schedules and higher wages, and first filed for a union election July 5.&quot;Today&#x27;s victory is an amazing moment for our team that has worked so hard and spent many months organizing,&quot; said Samantha Smith, 18, a crew member who has worked at the location for over two years. &quot;We set out to show that our generation can make substantial change in this world and improve our working conditions by taking action collectively.Employees at the location first filed for a union election July 5. They are being backed by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a union with 1.2 million members across professions such as warehouse workers, pilots, public defenders and more.&quot;Forming a union will allow us to have a true voice on the job and force Chipotle to address our concerns,&quot; said Harper McNamara, 19, a crew member who, like Smith, has also been there for more than two years. &quot;I am so proud of all those who were involved in this effort, and showed the courage needed to take on a huge corporation.&quot;An Augusta, Maine, location filed a union election petition in July, but Chipotle permanently closed the restaurant later that month, according to reports.A Chipotle spokesperson acknowledged the employees&#x27; action, saying the company was &quot;disappointed&quot; by the vote.&quot;At Chipotle, our employees are our greatest asset, and we are committed to listening to their needs and continuing to improve upon their workplace experience,&quot; Chipotle&#x27;s chief corporate affairs officer Laurie Schalow said in a statement. &quot;We continue to believe that working directly together is best for our employees.&quot;Schalow touted various employee benefits at Chipotle, such as tuition reimbursement, health care and quarterly bonuses that totaled $37 million between 100,000 employees.The vote in Lansing is the latest move in unionization efforts at some of the country&#x27;s largest companies, such as Starbucks, Amazon and Apple.

        "description": "Call center specialist Michael Colluccio works on a team that answers 988 calls from people whose phones have area codes for the suburban Philadelphia region. If needed, Colluccio also can answer calls from other parts of the state or country, part of a system that makes sure someone is always available to talk.Brett Sholtis/WITFOn a Friday evening at a call center in southeastern Pennsylvania, Michael Colluccio stirs his hot tea, puts on his headset, and starts up his computer. On the screen, calls are coming in to the suicide prevention lifeline from around the state. The 38-year old Colluccio says he knows what it&#x27;s like to be on the other end of one of those calls.  &quot;So I had a suicide attempt when I was about 10, 11 years old,&quot; Colluccio says. &quot;And we do get callers who are about that age, or quite young, and they are going through similar stressors.&quot;For people having a mental health crisis, calling 988 can be a life-saving decision. But what happens after you call depends on where you are. The new 988 system launched in mid-July, and one early estimate says calls went up 45 percent nationally during the first week. With calls expected to increase more as people learn about the helpline, some call centers say there are limits to what they can accomplish without more local resources.Colluccio says callers in this area — Bucks County, a suburb of Philadelphia — have access to more services than in many parts of the state. His job with the Family Service Association, which runs the hotline, sometimes involves connecting them with services such as homeless shelters, therapists or drug and alcohol counselors.More than anything, his job is to listen. &#x27;If you did not pick up, I&#x27;d have killed myself&#x27;Colluccio&#x27;s first call of the evening is from a woman who sounds panicked. Her partner has been using drugs and has started making violent threats. He spends a lot more time listening than talking. He says by listening closely to what she has to say, he offers relief, validation and human connection. When he does talk, he usually asks questions — gently searching for specific ways to help. In this case, his questions lead him to connect the caller with local domestic abuse services and a social worker. One service he rarely turns to is 911. Part of the idea behind 988 is that it offers an alternative to involving police or an ambulance for a mental health crisis. He would typically use 911 only if someone was an immediate threat to themselves or others. After talking with the woman for a half hour, Colluccio asks her a few key questions to determine whether she feels suicidal. Colluccio says this is an important step to make sure each caller is safe after they hang up.What happens next is surprisingly common. At the start of the call it seemed like the woman wanted help for her partner. But when he asks her directly on a scale of one to five how suicidal she is, she says she&#x27;s a two or maybe a three — and she&#x27;s attempted suicide before.Before they end the call, Colluccio asks her if she would like a call back tomorrow. She says yes, so he schedules one. Colluccio has just enough time for a sip of tea when another call comes in. It&#x27;s a young man in college, overwhelmed by stress. They talk for over an hour.This is a pretty typical evening. &quot;Sometimes it&#x27;s more of an immediate intervention because sometimes people call with pills in hand and are actively considering ending their lives,&quot; Colluccio said. &quot;There are people who have called and said, if you did not pick up, I&#x27;d have killed myself.&quot;He says that&#x27;s why having a national network of call centers works so well. There are more than 200 call centers like this one across the country. Calls are tied to area codes. If nobody picks up locally, the call gets kicked to somewhere else.The promise is to always have someone pick up the phone. Jayne Wildasin runs True North Wellness Services Crisis Intervention in Hanover, Pennsylvania. Because of limited resources in the area, sometimes call center workers do in-person visits, a job that is usually handled by mobile crisis teams.Brett Sholtis/WITFStrained resources for in-person helpIn some places, like Bucks County, there are options for callers who need more help than counselors can offer on the phone. Colluccio says he can even dispatch a mobile crew of mental health workers to visit someone at their home. But that&#x27;s not the case everywhere. In Hanover, a small town a few hours west, the 988 call center doesn&#x27;t have that option. Jayne Wildasin runs that center and says workers sometimes have to put down their headsets, get in their cars and go meet with people sometimes as far as an hour away.&quot;So right now if there&#x27;s a crisis at someone&#x27;s house we could potentially go there,&quot; Wildasin says.In rural Centre County, the local 988 call center relies on volunteers — mostly college students from Penn State University. Denise Herr McCann runs the operation and says that her team can call in mobile mental health experts, but there need to be more of them. Plus there&#x27;s a gaping need for other mental health professionals to continue helping people once the crisis has passed. &quot;Sometimes those resources are other counseling services, and they don&#x27;t have capacity,&quot; Herr McCann says. &quot;People are calling, and providers are six weeks out if they&#x27;re lucky. That&#x27;s not any good.&quot;For decades, suicide prevention call centers have had to scrape together funding from local, state and federal sources. Now with the switch to 988, they have to meet new federal regulations, such as data collecting and licensure requirements, says Julie Dees, who oversees the call center in Bucks County. That all costs money. &quot;There are increased responsibilities that are being put on the call centers, but there&#x27;s really no additional funding being put on that,&quot; Dees says. It&#x27;s an issue around the U.S., according to a recent analysis from The Pew Charitable Trusts. The group notes that states are largely left to foot the bill for the change to 988 — and many of the call centers doing the actual work have been underfunded for years. It recommends that state policymakers evaluate funding needs to ensure that crisis services connected to 988 will be sustainable.The Biden administration has dedicated $432 million toward building the capacity of local and backup call centers and providing associated services. But the expectation is that states will come up with the main funding streams. The 2020 law enacting the 988 number also allows states to pass legislation to add a small fee to cell phone bills as a permanent source of funds for 988 and associated mental health services. So far, only four states have done so, and only two more have proposed legislation.Pennsylvania is not one of those states, and doesn&#x27;t have any other funding plan implemented. That worries Kevin Boozel, who heads the County Commissioners Association of Pennsylvania.&quot;This is life or death,&quot; Boozel says. &quot;And you can&#x27;t halfway do it.&quot;He pointed out that Pennsylvania has decided to hold back on publicizing the new 988 number until next year. The fear is that too many calls could flood the system, and counties need more time to set up funding, hire workers and build capacity for things like those mobile crisis teams.Challenges aside, In Centre County, Herr McCann emphasizes that calling the hotline works. In most cases, just talking with someone is enough to defuse a crisis.&quot;When they have someone who is empathetic and who listens, that connection helps them,&quot; she said. That lets people know that &quot;it isn&#x27;t hopeless. There is hope out there. There is help out there.&quot; The 988 Suicide &amp; Crisis Lifeline provides 24/7, free and confidential phone &amp; text crisis support. Call or text 988 to get started.Copyright 2022 WITF.

        "description": "A pedestrian wears a mask while walking past a sign for a Whole Foods Market in San Francisco, Tuesday, March 31, 2020.Jeff Chiu/APSeveral consumers are suing Whole Foods, claiming traces of antibiotics were found in their beef products labeled antibiotic-free, according to a lawsuit filed in California this week.Whole Foods uses the slogan, &quot;Our Meat: No Antibiotics, Ever&quot; in its marketing materials, such as on packaging, signs in the store and on its parent website, Amazon.But one of the plaintiffs, Farm Forward, a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending factory farming, said it did its own testing in 2021 and 2022 and found traces of monensin sodium, a growth antibiotic, in one sample of a Whole Foods beef product, and fenbendazole, an antiparasitic, in five Whole Foods beef products.The organization said it shared its findings with the CEO of Whole Foods, but received no response. The organization also alleges it emailed a Whole Foods executive in 2017 suggesting a testing method to verify the supermarket&#x27;s antibiotic-free claims, but were told &quot;the repercussions for having a positive result were beyond ridiculous.&quot;A spokesperson for Whole Foods said the company does not comment on pending litigation.The lawsuit also claims Whole Foods financially exploited its customers by charging significantly more for its meat products compared to competitors, under the guise that their products are healthier.&quot;Consumer Plaintiffs would not have purchased Beef Products, or would not have paid the prices they did, had they had known the truth that cattle used in the Products were raised with antibiotics,&quot; the complaint says.Some of Whole Foods&#x27; cattle are sourced from the Global Animal Partnership (GAP) Animal Welfare Certified program. A study published on Science.org in April found that in an independent lab test, 26 percent of these cattle tested positive for antibiotics.A Whole Foods spokesperson told Consumer Reports at the time: &quot;We have extensively reviewed the information made available to us and have no reason to believe that the cattle tested in this study ended up in products in our stores. We take compliance very seriously and never hesitate to act if a supplier has failed to meet our rigorous quality standards.&quot;  Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "Macy&#x27;s, the nation&#x27;s largest department store chain, has scaled back its sales forecast for the year.Wilfredo Lee/APShoppers are making fewer purchases and fewer trips to stores. But when they  do check out at the register, they often spend more, revealing the impact of inflation. Many lower-income shoppers are cutting back on non-essentials like home decor and spending big at discount dollar stores.These are some of the takeaways from a spate of mid-year financial report cards  released by America&#x27;s leading retailers, including Walmart, Macy&#x27;s and Dollar Tree. They reflect a deep uncertainty that has set into the U.S. economy, with inflation running at the highest rate in decades. Department store chains Macy&#x27;s and Nordstrom, as well as Victoria&#x27;s Secret this week joined a growing list of retailers cutting their forecasts for the rest of year. Companies are flagging fewer visits from shoppers compared to a year ago, though some retailers, including home goods seller Williams-Sonoma on Wednesday and Home Depot last week, continued to report growing sales despite slower store traffic. At Dollar General and Dollar Tree, inflation had the result of boosting sales, the companies reported Thursday, as shoppers sought cheaper groceries, smaller packages and more deals on essentials. Some retailers seeing a dip in sales have blamed their race to discount and sell off unwanted inventory: an unexpected glut of things like pajamas and kitchen appliances that were hot in the pandemic until suddenly shoppers became more interested in travel and outings to restaurants. People are still shoppingAll this comes against a backdrop of a massive, record-blasting shopping spree that marked 2020 and 2021. This year, as pandemic restrictions lifted, people turned back toward experiences rather than things. And then, as prices for gas and food boosted inflation, more shoppers began to switch to private brands or skip discretionary items. In surveys, people say they feel extremely anxious about finances. Still, in July, retail sales, when adjusted for inflation, edged up both compared to June and to July 2021 as prices somewhat eased. &quot;Every metric I see is that the economy is pretty resilient,&quot; said Sucharita Kodali, an analyst with Forrester, pointing to higher wages, low unemployment, decent savings levels and retail spending remaining above pre-pandemic levels. &quot;Retail spend, even in spite of inflation, is at a record high.&quot;Shoppers are ‘under pressure’This week, Macy&#x27;s, the largest U.S. department store chain, scaled back its forecast for the full year. The company said its shoppers are not switching to less expensive brands, as other retailers have seen, but rather seeking out discounts and prioritizing purchases such as office clothes as more people return to the workplace in person. The consumer &quot;is actually still healthy, but they&#x27;re under pressure. Wage rate is not keeping up with the pace of inflation,&quot; CEO Jeff Gennette told Bloomberg on Tuesday, suggesting that upscale shoppers were less affected and luxury goods were selling well. Kodali points out that many retailers — particularly department stores — had wobbled long before the pandemic, particularly as many malls declined and big brands raced to sell directly to shoppers online.Economists at Wells Fargo are warning that back-to-school shopping was a major factor boosting retail spending in recent months. &quot;Once the kids return to school and the bills come due, households will begin to tighten their belts,&quot; the company wrote in a report last week. &quot;Even as inflation is showing signs of moderating, it will do so only slowly.&quot;Meanwhile, Walmart — whose vast footprint and low prices make it much more of an economic bellwether — has done an about-face from warnings about the rest of the year to signal better times ahead. In July, the company alerted Wall Street to slumping profits, as people&#x27;s high grocery bills made products in other aisles less appealing. But last week, Walmart improved its forecast, noting that its stores were drawing more middle-income and higher-income shoppers. Walmart&#x27;s biggest rival Amazon, for its part, last month said it had seen no inflation impact on demand at all, with the company&#x27;s shoppers continuing to spend more.  Copyright 2022 NPR.

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/fuchsia-nest-hub-max-rollout-finalized",
        "description": "Google&#8217;s new operating system, &#8220;Fuchsia&#8221; remains mostly a mystery today. However, one thing is clear and that&#8217;s the fact that the company hopes to make it the driving force behind its smart display hardware. Back in June, the Nest Hub Max followed suit in offering a Preview Program for Fuchsia after the original Hub started using the new OS successfully a year prior.\n\n\n\nNow, as of version 6.20211109.1.3166243, as reported by 9to5Google, this is no longer a preview, but rather a full release. All Nest Hub Max devices that have been updated (apparently, this occurs while you&#8217;re sleeping) will now run Fuchsia exclusively. Before, Nest devices ran CastOS, the same technology that Chromecast operated on.\n\n\n\nIf you&#8217;d like to check and verify whether or not your Hub Max has been updated, just navigate to the System Settings and then to &#8220;About device&#8221;. As you can see below, the &#8220;Fuchsia Version&#8221; should be listed just under the device&#8217;s name.\n\n\n\nCredit: 9to5Google\n\n\n\nFor now, there&#8217;s not really much information on what benefits this offers you as a consumer, but I do have my sneaking suspicions. Call me crazy, but I still believe in the dream of one operating system that unifies all of Google&#8217;s hardware devices. Smartphones, Chromebooks, smartwatches, refrigerators, Android Auto head units, smart displays &#8211; the list goes on. When you look back at what Google was trying to do with &#8220;Andromeda&#8221;, Fuchsia still fits the bill. The only difference is that Google has been working with its head down to make it a viable OS that can one day replace Android, ChromeOS, and CastOS.\n\n\n\nOnce you replace the source code for these devices, as is the case with the 1st generation Nest Hub and Nest Hub Max, there&#8217;s virtually no difference in how they look or feel. I believe that this is exactly the point. Replace these aging, incongruent operating systems across all hardware with a one-size-fits-all OS that can stretch, scale, and morph based on the form factor, but that is more efficient, unified, clean, and scaleable for the future, and you&#8217;ve got a recipe for success the next several decades.\n\n\n\nGoogle doesn&#8217;t need to make Fuchsia a flashy, bombshell reveal when it can simply make it inconspicuous and fit into your daily life without notice. The real meat and juice comes in when future updates drop and you start seeing Chromebooks, Pixel phones, Pixel and Wear watches, car displays, smart displays and more do some truly interesting and unique things in ways that don&#8217;t feel disparate from one another. The future is unified, and Google has known it for a long time.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Orlando Ramirez-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Catch up on all the Mets prospects in yesterday’s minor league action! *All results from games played on Thursday August 25, 2022\n\nTriple-A: Syracuse Mets (51-68)\n\nWORCESTER 9, SYRACUSE  1 (BOX)\nThis was a game to forget for virtually all of the Syracuse roster. They amassed just four singles in the loss, with their only run coming in the bottom of the ninth on a Nick Dini single when the game was well out of reach. They struck out 14 times as a team, as their offense was completely handcuffed by the Worcester pitching staff.\nHarol Gonzalez had a rough go of it surrendering six runs in four innings. Sam Clay and Bryce Montes de Oca combined for three scoreless innings, and Phillip Diehl followed in Gonzalez’s footsteps by struggling in the eighth and ninth.\n\nCF Travis Jankowski: 1-4, 3 K\n1B Dominic Smith: 0-3, BB, 2 K\n3B Mark Vientos: 1-4, 2 K\nDH Daniel Palka: 0-4, 3 K\nLF Nick Plummer: 0-2, K\nPR-LF Terrance Gore: 0-1\nRF Khalil Lee: 0-2, BB\n2B Gosuke Katoh: 1-4, R, K\nC Nick Dini: 1-4, RBI, K\nSS Deven Marrero: 0-4, 4 K\nRHP Harol Gonzalez: 4.0 IP, 7 H, 6 R, 6 ER, 2 BB, 1 K, L (0-2)\nLHP Sam Clay: 2.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 1 K\nRHP Bryce Montes de Oca: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 3 K\nLHP Phillip Diehl: 2.0 IP, 4 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 1 BB, 0 K\n\n\nDouble-A: Binghamton Rumble Ponies (16-29/44-71)\n\nBINGHAMTON 7, READING 3 (BOX)\nThe Rumble Ponies and the Fightin Phils traded runs in the early going, with Reading jumping out to a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the first, only for Binghamton to get them both back with a two run home run off the bat of Luke Ritter. Binghamton went ahead 3-2 in the fifth, by way of a Jeremy Vasquez single, but a solo shot in the bottom of the frame tied it.\nBinghamton broke the game open in the sixth, scoring four in the frame. Ritter drove in two more with a two RBI single, and a two run homer by Brandon McIlwain capped off the scoring, which proved to be more than enough for the Binghamton bullpen.\n\n2B Wyatt Young: 0-4, BB, K\nCF Jake Mangum: 0-5, K\nSS Ronny Mauricio: 2-5, R, SB (16)\nDH Carlos Cortes: 2-4, 2 R, 2 K\n3B Luke Ritter: 2-4, 2 R, HR (11), 4 RBI, K, SB (5)\nRF Rowdey Jordan: 0-2, RBI, BB, 2 K\nC Nick Meyer: 1-4, R, 3B, K\nLF Brandon McIlwain: 1-4, R, HR (4), RBI, K\n1B Jeremy Vasquez: 2-4, RBI\nRHP David Griffin: 4.2 IP, 3 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 2 BB, 3 K\nRHP Hunter Parsons: 3.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 5 K, W (1-2)\nRHP Dedniel Nunez: 1.1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 2 BB, 2 K\n\n\nHigh-A: Brooklyn Cyclones (27-22/58-58)\n\nBROOKLYN 8, JERSEY SHORE 5 (BOX)\nBrooklyn’s offense was humming, with every starter outside of William Lugo notching a hit, and four starters notching two. They scored in every inning sans the first, fourth, and ninth, including a four spot in the second to put themselves out ahead, a lead they would never relinquish. Perhaps the biggest note — despite top five organizational prospect Alex Ramirez going 3-5 with two doubles, something you always love to see — is Eduardo Escobar getting two hits and playing shortstop in his rehab assignment, which is perhaps a good sign for Brett Baty’s roster spot in the short term.\nChristian Scott had a strong first three innings but faded in the fourth, surrendering three runs in the frame before getting pulled for a Brooklyn bullpen that did more than enough to stave off Jersey Shore.\n\nLF Matt Rudick: 1-4, 2B, RBI\n\nREHAB ALERT: SS Eduardo Escobar: 2-4, R, RBI\nPH-2B Gregory Guerrero: 0-1\nCF Alex Ramirez: 3-5, R, 2 2B\n3B Jose Peroza: 2-5, 2B, 2 RBI\n1B JT Schwartz: 2-5, R, HR (5), RBI, 2 K, E (8)\nRF Stanley Consuegra: 1-5, R, 2B, K\nC Jose Mena: 1-5, R\nDH William Lugo: 0-4, R, BB, K\n2B-SS Shervyen Newton: 2-4, 2 R, 2B, HR (7), 2 RBI, 2 K\nRHP Christian Scott: 3.2 IP, 3 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 3 BB, 5 K\nRHP Franklin Sanchez: 2.1 IP, 4 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 1 BB, 1 K, 2 WP, W (1-0)\nRHP Nolan Clenney: 3.0 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 4 K\n\n\nSingle-A: St. Lucie Mets (26-23/67-48)\n\nPALM BEACH 11, ST. LUCIE 5 (BOX)\nWhile it is hard to take away a ton of positives from an 11-5 loss — outside of D’Andre Smith and Omar De Los Santos having good games, the offense was mostly stagnant — it is important to note the opener for today’s loss.\nJose Lucchesi made another appearance since coming back after Tommy John surgery last year, which is something you absolutely love to see. He was consistently throwing his fastball at 90-91 MPH, which is right in line with his career norms. His patented Chruve was also doing its thing, as he tossed a scoreless frame in the first, striking out two. \nThe rest of the game was largely forgettable, with Tyler Stuart, Benito Garcia and Layonel Ovalles all getting hit around in the loss.\n\n2B D’Andre Smith: 2-4, 2 R, BB, SB (1)\nCF Omar De Los Santos: 2-4, RBI, BB, K, SB (66)\nRF Carlos Dominguez: 1-4, BB, K, SB (22)\nDH Tanner Murphy: 0-2, R, 2 RBI, BB\n1B Eduardo Salazar: 0-4, K\n3B Justin Guerrera: 1-3, R, HR (11), RBI, BB, K, E (16)\nSS Branden Fryman: 0-3\nSS Brad Malm: 0-1\nLF Blaine McIntosh: 0-1\nPH-LF Raul Beracierta: 0-2, K\nC Gregory Leal: 1-4, R, 2 K\n\nREHAB ALERT: P Joey Lucchesi: 1.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K\nP Tyler Stuart: 1.1 IP, 3 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 2 BB, 2 K, 1 WP, 1 HBP\nP Jace Beck: 0.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 0 K\nP Benito Garcia: 2.2 IP, 6 H, 6 R, 5 ER, 0 BB, 5 K, 1 WP, L (2-3)\nP Layonel Ovalles: 4.0 IP, 3 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 1 BB, 5 K\n\n\nComplex: FCL Mets (33-22)\n\nFCL RAYS 7, FCL  METS 4 (BOX)\n\nCF Nick Morabito: 2-4, R, 2B, BB, 2 K\nSS Jett Williams: 3-3, R, 2 BB, SB (1)\nC Vincent Perozo: 1-4, 2 RBI, K\n3B Jacob Reimer: 0-4, R, BB, 3 K\nLF Rhylan Thomas: 1-4\n2B Kevin Villavicencio: 0-3, RBI, E (1)\nRF Dyron Campos: 0-4, RBI, K, E (1)\nDH Wilfredo Lara: 0-4, K\n1B Luis Castillo: 0-3, R, BB, 2 K\nLHP Javier Atencio: 2.2 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 3 BB, 4 K, 1 WP\nRHP Robert Colina: 3.1 IP, 0 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 2 BB, 2 K, 1 WP\nLHP Brian Gursky: 0.2 IP, 2 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 2 BB, 1 K, 1 WP, BS (1)\nRHP Luis Rodriguez: 0.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 3 BB, 0 K\nRHP Christopher Vasquez: 1.0 IP, 3 H, 3 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 1 K, 1 WP, L (0-1)\nRHP Luke Bartnicki: 0.1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K\n\nStar of the Night\nLuke Ritter\nGoat of the Night\nBenito Garcia",

        "description": "Monkey Barrel Comedy, EdinburghPugh shambles his diffident way into the spotlight with a stealthy, clever and heartwarming showIncompetent, negative, a follower not a leader: Josh Pugh is highly conversant with his own shortcomings. His Edinburgh show chronicles the Coventry man’s diffident journey through life – getting things wrong, shrinking into the background, “not even the headliner,” as he jokes, “at my own therapy sessions.” But there are exceptions: Sausage, Egg, Josh Pugh, Chips and Beans (for so it’s called) also traces Pugh and his wife’s five-year efforts to have a baby, a story given significance here and in which Pugh can’t help but be the leading man. Then there’s his Edinburgh comedy award nomination, which propels this shambling bit-part player firmly into the standup spotlight.He deserves it, for a show that’s heartwarming and studded with real gems of jokes. Many of them cast Pugh himself as the fall-guy, like the keeper about his wife diagnosing him with ADHD. Some of the very best combine his own haplessness with stealth commentary on the state of the world, like his peachy routine about his text correspondence with a 15-year-old kickboxer. As the show proceeds, details are added to the picture of a man whose faced some challenges in life: broken home (there’s a great gag about meeting his stepdad), mental health difficulties, visual impairment. But the brushwork is never heavy handed. Pugh isn’t trite about that stuff, but his eye is always out for the (usually clever) gag.Josh Pugh: Sausage, Egg, Josh Pugh, Chips and Beans is at Monkey Barrel Comedy, Edinburgh, until 28 August.All our Edinburgh festival reviews.

This weekend I'll be traveling to the Artemis I launch in Florida on Monday. It's remarkable that launch day is finally here for NASA's big rocket and a big moment for the space agency, which has not launched its own rocket since 2011, and the final flight of the space shuttle. Here's hoping everything goes well with the launch and Orion's flight to the Moon.\nAs always, we welcome reader submissions, and if you don't want to miss an issue, please subscribe using the box below (the form will not appear on AMP-enabled versions of the site).

The Texas-based launch company announced this week the launch window for the second flight of its Alpha rocket. The window for the launch from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California opens at 3 pm local Pacific time (22:00 UTC). Alpha's first test flight, in September 2021, ended in failure 150 seconds into the flight after a problem with one of the rocket's four main Reaver engines.Read 24 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Not all gastropubs are the same. This is an exceedingly good restaurantEn route to the recently revamped The Baring in Islington, I wondered if we need a newer, better word for “gastropub”, not least because nobody ever liked that word anyway. In the noughties, it was synonymous with the vanishing of old-fashioned, often cherished things: printed menus, affordable burgers, sticky carpets and packets of Big D peanuts glued to a card behind the bar that, with every purchase, revealed more of a near-naked woman called Bev. None of them survived the great gastropub purge. That said, if you liked poussin, wild rocket, blackboards, Farrow &amp; Ball paint, côtes du rhône and eating on 1950s crockery while sitting on a very stiff, hardbacked chair, this was a golden age.In the UK in 2022, however, almost all new pub ventures are “gastro” to some extent, with the chef’s name and CV being announced at the same time, and with the same weighting, as the landlord’s. All these gastropubs are not the same, though, and many are just chain pubs in disguise and with a good microwave. The Baring, however, is an exceedingly good restaurant that serves the likes of quail shish, and pig’s cheek and smoked eel terrine, and has taken root inside an old, previously loved building. The chef is Rob Tecwyn, formerly of Dabbous, which was a cool, Fitzrovia restaurant revered at the highest level by the food crowd. “Shall we go to Dabbous on Saturday?” someone would suggest on a Wednesday circa 2015, and I’d collapse in peals of mirth because the place was booked solid for the next 20 weeks at least. Tecwyn has also cooked at a number of dependably brilliant restaurants where I often send people asking for advice: the Bull &amp; Last in Highgate, Moro, Morito and Kerridge’s Bar &amp; Grill to name a few.

        "description": "Trey Mancini homered for a second straight game, a three-run shot that led the Houston Astros to a 6-3 win and a three-game sweep of the slumping Minnesota Twins on Thursday night.Mancini, who hit a two-run homer Wednesday, has six home runs and 16 RBIs in 18 games since being traded from the Orioles.“That’s why he’s batting where he’s batting, because I was hoping he’d have some runners on in front of him,&quot; manager Dusty Baker said. “That’s why I hit (Christian) Vazquez ahead of him, because he gets on base and has been getting base hits. But that was huge.&quot;The Twins have lost a season-high six games and finished 0-6 against the AL West-leading Astros this season.“We&#x27;ve got to go out there and play that complete baseball that we’ve been talking about,&quot; manager Rocco Baldelli said. “The glimpses of things, you’d rather see that than some of the things that we’ve seen lately. But we need to put it together.&quot;The game was tied at 1 in the first when Mancini connected off Chris Archer (2-7) on his shot to the seats in left field.“If I could have executed one or two pitches it would have been a lot different,” Archer said. “So, yeah, I’m disappointed, for sure.&quot;Jeremy Peña hit an RBI double with two outs in the Houston eighth to make it 6-3.Luis Garcia (11-8) yielded five hits and three runs with five strikeouts in five innings for his third straight win. Rafael Montero struck out one in a scoreless ninth for his eighth save.“That was the best bullpen night we’ve had in a while,&quot; Baker said. “It was relatively clean, guys had clean innings. I don’t think we had many walks. Vazquez directed them through the game very good; that was an outstanding job by him.”Carlos Correa had a forgettable series in his first games against Houston since leaving the Astros after seven seasons to sign with the Twins. He went 0 for 4 Thursday night to end the series 1 for 11.Jorge Polanco gave Minnesota a 1-0 lead with his homer to right field with two outs in the first inning.Jose Altuve hit a leadoff double in the bottom of the inning and Yuli Gurriel had an infield single. Yordan Alvarez then grounded into a double play that scored Altuve to tie it at 1.Alex Bregman and Vazquez hit consecutive singles before Mancini’s homer gave the Astros the lead.Nick Gordon tripled to start the second and scored on a wild pitch by Garcia to cut it to 4-2.Bregman doubled with one out in the third and the Astros extended the lead to 5-2 on an RBI single by Vazquez.Gary Sanchez doubled before advancing to third on a single by Gilberto Celestino with no outs in the fifth. A sacrifice fly by Luis Arráez sent Sanchez home to get Minnesota within 5-3.Archer allowed eight hits and five runs in four innings.Trainer’s roomTwins: In the wake of the injury to OF Byron Buxton, Minnesota signed speedy OF Billy Hamilton to a minor league contract Thursday.

        "description": "Derek Chauvin has been moved from a Minnesota state prison where he was often held in solitary confinement to a medium-security federal prison in Arizona, where the former police officer convicted in George Floyd&#x27;s killing may be held under less restrictive conditions.Chauvin was taken Wednesday from a maximum-security prison in a Minneapolis suburb, where he often spent most of his day in a 10-by-10-foot cell, to the Federal Correctional Institution in Tucson, according to the Bureau of Prisons. The Tucson facility houses 266 inmates, both male and female, as part of a larger complex that includes a high-security penitentiary and a minimum-security satellite camp. Derek ChauvinHennepin County Sheriff&#x27;s Office via AP, FileBureau of Prisons spokeswoman Randilee Giamusso declined to detail the circumstances of Chauvin&#x27;s confinement, citing privacy, safety and security concerns. Experts said earlier that Chauvin was likely to be safer in the federal system. It typically houses less-violent inmates, and he&#x27;d be less likely to mix with inmates he had arrested or investigated as a Minneapolis police officer.“It’s dangerous to be an officer in any prison,” former U.S. Attorney Tom Heffelfinger said after Chauvin was sentenced last month. “It’s even more dangerous in state prison because of the nature of the inmate population. There are gangs, for example. And police officers just don’t do well there. Those risks are reduced in a federal prison.”The federal prison system does house many high-profile inmates, but it is also plagued by gangs and chronic violence. The entire federal prison system was put on a nationwide lockdown in January after two inmates were killed and two others were injured during a gang altercation at a federal penitentiary in Texas. The Bureau of Prisons has also faced increasing scrutiny of violent incidents and serious misconduct in its ranks. Associated Press investigations have uncovered abuse, neglect and leadership missteps, including rampant sexual abuse by workers, severe staffing shortages, inmate escapes and the mishandling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Chauvin was sentenced last month in U.S. District Court in St. Paul to 21 years on federal civil rights charges after pleading guilty in an agreement with prosecutors. He was already serving 22 1/2 years for his conviction in state court on murder and manslaughter charges; a condition of the agreement called for the sentences to be served concurrently and in federal prison. Chauvin, who is white, killed Floyd by pinning the unarmed Black man to the pavement with his knee for 9 1/2 minutes as bystander video captured Floyd struggling to breathe and crying out for help. Floyd was suspected of passing a counterfeit bill at a nearby grocery store. Floyd&#x27;s death on May 25, 2020, touched off a firestorm of protests around the world and refocused attention on police brutality and racism. U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson suggested when sentencing Chauvin that he be placed near family who live between Iowa and Minnesota. But federal officials are not bound by judicial requests. Last month Magnuson also sentenced ex-Minneapolis police Officer J. Alexander Kueng to three years in prison and former Officer Tou Thao to 3½ years on criminal civil rights charges related to the Floyd killing. They intend to appeal their sentences. Earlier in July, former officer Thomas Lane was sentenced to 2½ years. He&#x27;s been ordered to report to a low-security federal prison camp in Colorado later this month. The three former officers were on trial at the same time three men were in court in Georgia, facing federal hate crime charges in the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, who was Black. They were eventually convicted.Two of the men agreed to plead guilty in the case in exchange for serving their sentences in federal prison, saying they feared for their safety in state prison. The judge rejected the deal in part because Arbery&#x27;s family strongly opposed it.",

        "description": "The Jim Bridger coal plant in Point of Rocks, Wyo., powers more than a million homes across six Western states. It consumes more water than any other coal plant in the West, according to the federal government.Julia Simon for NPRDriving through the Wyoming sagebrush west of Cheyenne, the clouds of dust rising from the road give way to giant plumes of steam shooting into the warming sky.This is the Jim Bridger power plant, one of the largest coal-fired power sources in the nation and an enormous emitter of carbon dioxide pollution. At the plant&#x27;s edge there&#x27;s a reservoir, lined with rocks and clumps of drying grass. The plant sucks up about 16 million barrels of water each day, using it to power more than million homes across six western states, all the way to Oregon.But there&#x27;s a problem that looms for the coal plant operator and the customers that rely on it for electricity. This water is piped here from the Green River, a tributary of the rapidly shrinking Colorado River. Now, amidst a decades-long drought and a shortage of water downstream across the Southwest, future conservation in the basin could mean industrial users like Jim Bridger see their water shut off, says Wyoming State Engineer Brandon Gebhart.&quot;They would be likely the first one shut off. Unless they were able to find a different source of water, we would have to just shut off their water and not allow them to divert,&quot; Gebhart says.The western U.S. hasn&#x27;t been this dry for more than 1,200 years, but 30 western coal plants continue to suck up 156 million gallons a day of the region&#x27;s scarce water, according to the Energy Information Administration. Now the very plants whose emissions help drive climate change are at risk of shutdowns, because the water they need to operate has fallen to unprecedented levels.Some utilities are already sending warnings, telling federal regulators that the drought could threaten coal plant operations. But there&#x27;s uncertainty at the state level over which officials are responsible for managing drought risk to power plants and the threat of brownouts and blackouts.Old coal plants like Jim Bridger have for decades been critical to the grid, says David Eskelsen, spokesman for Rocky Mountain Power, a division of PacifiCorp, which operates the Wyoming plant. &quot;With all the concerns about the use of fossil fuels, climate change, and the use of water in this way,&quot; Eskelsen says, &quot;that has to be balanced against the role that these particular power plants play in the stability of the regional transmission system.&quot;But rising water scarcity in the West means the stability of coal plants like Jim Bridger is no longer a sure thing, says Joe Smyth, research manager at the Energy and Policy Institute, a utility watchdog group.&quot;If you don&#x27;t have water to cool it, you can&#x27;t run it, right? Like it&#x27;s not a minor risk. It is a very disruptive event,&quot; he says, &quot;If you&#x27;re not aware of those risks, then you are not really operating your power plants responsibly.&quot;The coal plant sources its water by pipeline from the Green River, a tributary of the shrinking Colorado River.Julia Simon for NPRWho ensures that coal plants have enough water?Drought threatens coal plant operations and customers across the US. Earlier this year in its reliability assessment, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation issued a warning that drought in the Missouri River Basin could affect power plants, including coal plants, that use river water for cooling. In the west, the risk of low water is leading to new alerts for Wall Street investors.In its latest filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, New Mexico utility PNM outlines the risks of drought to its coal plants on the San Juan river, a tributary of the Colorado. &quot;If inadequate precipitation occurs in the watershed that supplies that region, PNM may have to decrease generation at these plants,&quot; the utility writes, &quot;Drought conditions or actions taken by the court system, regulators, or legislators could limit PNM&#x27;s supply of water, which would adversely impact PNM&#x27;s business.&quot;But for a coal plant like Jim Bridger, it can be unclear who is regulating this risk at ground-level, where power shortages could affect millions of Americans.The Wyoming Public Service Commission (PSC) officially regulates plant operator Rocky Mountain Power, but the PSC&#x27;s chief counsel John Burbridge tells NPR his office has not taken steps to ensure there&#x27;s enough water to keep the power on. He says the PSC defers to the state engineer. &quot;We trust that once [the utilities] have the state engineer&#x27;s permit they do have enough water,&quot; Burbridge says, &quot;You know it&#x27;s the old Ronald Reagan thing, &#x27;Trust, but verify.&#x27;&quot;But the state engineer Gebhart says a water right isn&#x27;t a promise of water forever for coal plants. &quot;The granting of a water right does not guarantee an amount of water,&quot; he says. &quot;It allows them to use water when it&#x27;s available.&quot;Rocky Mountain Power spokesperson David Eskelsen says the Jim Bridger coal plant uses water mostly for the cooling cycle. The plant uses about 16 million gallons of water each day.Julia Simon for NPRGebhart&#x27;s office gave Jim Bridger its water rights from the Green River in 1968 – the coal plant started operating in 1974. In the scheme of Wyoming&#x27;s Green River Basin, that isn&#x27;t very old. Some local farms have water rights dating back to the 1880s, and they would have the seniority to keep their water over relatively newer users like Jim Bridger, Gebhart says.Last week Wyoming and other upper basin states of the Colorado River missed the federal government&#x27;s deadline to propose cuts to help with the low water levels downstream at Lake Powell and Lake Mead.It&#x27;s still unclear when this possible diversion of Colorado River water from the upper basin could happen. Eskelsen notes that Jim Bridger has a &quot;contingency&quot; at another nearby reservoir – although it, too, is on the Green River and also could be at risk. Ultimately while coal plants like Jim Bridger can ask the state engineer for guidance, they&#x27;re on their own to make sure they have water supplies to keep operating into the future, says water expert Patrick Tyrrell, the former Wyoming state engineer. &quot;That&#x27;s not the state engineer&#x27;s job,&quot; he says, &quot;The primary responsibility is on them themselves.&quot;Jim Bridger doesn&#x27;t plan to close until 2037. It&#x27;s considering new technology to capture carbon emissions. The utility tells regulators that carbon capture would use about 35-40% more water.Julia Simon for NPRFuture plans for Western coal plants The Jim Bridger coal plant isn&#x27;t scheduled to close for good until 2037. The Biden administration is aiming for a fossil-free electric grid by 2035. While some Western states like Colorado have committed to shutting down all their coal plants in the next decade, others are considering a different direction.States like Wyoming, which produces about 40% of the country&#x27;s coal, hope to keep their coal plants running using new technology that would compress and trap their carbon emissions underground before they escape and cause global warming. In recent years, Wyoming&#x27;s legislature has mandated that utilities with coal plants explore installing &quot;carbon capture and sequestration&quot; technology. And landmark federal climate legislation features new incentives for carbon capture and storage, including upping the tax credit for storing carbon emissions underground from $50 to as much as $85 per ton.But installing this technology in a mega-drought that shows no signs of relenting poses serious risks, says Avner Vengosh, professor of environmental quality at Duke University. Carbon capture requires even more water than these Western coal plants already use. In a recent filing with the Wyoming Public Commission, PacifiCorp estimates that carbon capture increases a coal plant&#x27;s water usage by about 35-40%.Regardless of what happens with carbon capture and storage, Rocky Mountain Power plans to convert two of Jim Bridger&#x27;s four units from coal to natural gas in 2023. But even with gas as a fuel instead of coal, the plant would still use the same amount of water, says Eskelsen. &quot;The boiler is still the same and the cooling cycle is still the same,&quot; he says.The Buckboard Marina on the Green River in Wyoming is about 50 miles southwest of the Jim Bridger coal plant. The sagebrush turns to sand marking where the Green River water has fallen. The falling water also means the marina owners must continuously adjust the ramp to the boats.Julia Simon for NPRLocals push for less water-intensive energyAbout 50 miles southwest of the Jim Bridger coal plant on the Green River is the Buckboard Marina. Families drive their boats down a long steep road to get to the shore.Because of the drought, the water has dropped about six feet from a year ago, says Tony Valdez, co-owner of the marina, pointing to the old waterline where the sagebrush abruptly turns to sand. Now Valdez and his wife and co-owner, Jen Valdez, must continuously gauge the water to adjust the ramp to the boats. &quot;It&#x27;s just straight down,&quot; she says. &quot;It&#x27;s like a slip and slide.&quot;Last month, the Valdez family attended a meeting at a local middle school with farmers, ranchers, and another marina owner about the shortage of water in the Colorado River Basin. &quot;With our water dropping, you know our concern is, where&#x27;s our marina go?&quot; Tony Valdez asks, &quot;Where&#x27;s the water come from, if it ain&#x27;t falling from the sky?&quot;This drought has forced new questions about the water intensity of energy sources throughout the Colorado basin, says Wahleah Johns, the director of the office of Indian energy policy at the Department of Energy. She says that&#x27;s particularly true in the Navajo or Diné Nation, which is shifting away from coal. The Four Corners power plant, scheduled to close until 2031, draws from the San Juan River, part of the dwindling Colorado River basin. Johns says as the Diné consider alternative energies, they&#x27;re thinking about the legacy of coal, water, and pollution.&quot;The biggest question that communities had is, &#x27;How much water is this gonna use?&#x27; And particularly around solar power in comparison to coal.&quot; While solar needs some water in the production of the panels, it doesn&#x27;t have a water footprint once it is installed. &quot;We had to show, you know, very little water is gonna be used.&quot;Johns is a member of Diné nation, &quot;My family, we haul water, we don&#x27;t have access to water. I mean [close to] 40% of my nation has to haul water every other day,&quot; she says, &quot;Those folks have an understanding of how precious water is.&quot;Earlier this year in a filing to federal regulators New Mexico utility PNM wrote that their coal plants, including the Four Corners Coal Plant, &quot;may have to decrease generation&quot; because of the drought.Susan Montoya Bryan/APBack at the marina in Wyoming, Tony Valdez remembers his life working in coal plants, including Jim Bridger. &quot;My dad worked in &#x27;em, my brother worked in &#x27;em, I worked in &#x27;em.&quot; Valdez knows how much water coal plants use and says that&#x27;s why he&#x27;s interested in renewable energy.&quot;So why are we still pushing that sh*t up in the air when we have wind, we have solar, we have all this stuff that does not impact water?&quot; he asks, &quot;We&#x27;re pumping water through pipes to power plants to produce power, when there&#x27;s so many other things that you could possibly do.&quot;This reporting was supported with a grant from The Water Desk at the University of Colorado Boulder.

In this scenario, Democrats would still lose their majority, but what would that mean for Pelosi-Hoyer-Clyburn, all three of whom are now in their 80s? Would they stick around for the presidential election in 2024, hoping to win the House back? How would this impact younger Democrats who have been positioning themselves to take over next year?”",

        "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/26/democrat-abortion-virginia-00053801",
        "description": "Endangered Rep. Abigail Spanberger (D-Va.) is going on air Friday with a TV ad focusing on abortion rights — the latest sign that a growing number of swing-district Democrats view it as a winning issue in the fall. The spot, her first television ad of the general election, which was shared first with POLITICO, comes three days after a Democratic upset in a New York special election, where Rep.-elect Pat Ryan made access to abortion a central theme of his campaign. The 30-second ad takes aim at Spanberger’s GOP opponent, Prince William County Supervisor Yesli Vega, warning that she supports a total ban on abortion with no exceptions, such as those for rape, incest or the life of the mother.   Vega handed Spanberger a rare opening when she was caught on tape casting doubt on the idea that women can get pregnant from rape. The spot warns that Vega once said only God can decide the life of the mother. \"Yesli Vega cheered the Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade,\" a narrator says in the ad, adding: \"Yesli Vega is too extreme for Virginia.\" Spanberger was first elected in 2018 when she ousted Republican Rep. Dave Brat from his central Virginia seat. Redistricting left her in a seat that President Joe Biden would have carried by 6 points and she is considered one of the more endangered Democrats. The initial buy, backed by nearly $560,000, will run from Friday to Sept. 5 on broadcast and cable in the Washington, D.C. and Charlottesville, Va. markets. The incumbent has a staggering $4.9 million in her war chest as of July. Vega had less than $250,000. Spanberger joins a handful of vulnerable Democratic women who have aired TV ads on abortion rights since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and erased the constitutional right to an abortion. Reps. Kim Schrier (D-Wash.), Susie Lee (D-Nev.) and Cindy Axne (D-Iowa) have all messaged on the issue, as have a slew of candidates. Lee went on air almost immediately after the Dobbs ruling with an abortion rights-focused buy. But it wasn’t immediately clear how many Democrats would use paid advertising to stress their commitment to abortion access. Voters in Kansas declined to roll back abortion rights in a referendum earlier this month, in another powerful sign that moderates and independents did not agree with the ruling. Ryan’s triumph in New York only boosted that signal. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee has painted it as an issue that can juice up Democratic base voters and persuade moderates, especially after the special election on Tuesday. Ryan leaned heavily into abortion rights and beat Republican Marc Molinaro by 2 points in a district that backed Biden narrowly in 2020. “We see this as a powerful issue in swing districts, not the only issue — People still care a lot about the economy and inflation,” said DCCC Chair Sean Patrick Maloney. “But the abortion issue has changed the equation. There's no doubt about it. And we're seeing the impact more every day.”",

        "description": "President Joe Biden plans to establish a new ambassador-at-large position focused on the Arctic region, an area of growing geostrategic concern to the United States — as well as Russia and China. The decision will be unveiled by the State Department on Friday, according to an announcement obtained in advance by POLITICO. The position will be subject to Senate confirmation.  It was not immediately clear who the nominee for the role will be, but a State Department official familiar with the issue predicted a name would be submitted soon. The Arctic is of growing interest to the United States and its top rivals in part because of climate change. Though the warming of the region could have cataclysmic effects on global sea levels, the reduction in ice has opened new shipping lanes and made possible opportunities for energy extraction. With its long Arctic coastline, Russia is putting its mark on the region, including by expanding its military presence. China has eyes on the territory, too, calling itself a \"near-Arctic state\" and seeking ways to expand its access for economic and other reasons. The U.S. at the moment has an \"Arctic coordinator\" position; the State Department announcement says the plan is to \"elevate\" the coordinator role into an ambassadorship. The decision comes amid unusually tense relations between Washington and Moscow due to Russia's war on Ukraine, and it was made following consultations with U.S. lawmakers, among others. Earlier this summer, the Arctic portfolio was given on a temporary basis to State Department Counselor Derek Chollet. He told POLITICO at the time that, when it comes to the region, the Biden administration sees \"this moment as one of strategic opportunity.\" The department announcement says the new ambassador will \"engage with counterparts in Arctic and non-Arctic nations as well as Indigenous groups, and work closely with domestic stakeholders, including state, local, and tribal governments, businesses, academic institutions, non-profit organizations, other federal government agencies and Congress.\" The department also calls for a swift confirmation of whomever is nominated for the position.",

Every time they do, I’m almost sick. But talking about it is still different from it actually happening. Well, not any more. This is the day. The energy price cap rise is here, and it doesn’t bear thinking about. Why? Because there is simply no way I can even begin to think about how I could pay it. It’s a non-starter. So what do people like me do? Answers on a postcard please to Liz at Ain’t-Got-A-Bleeding-Clue Lane, SW England.In October last year, my bill went up to about £1,200 a year. As a single mum of two youngsters, getting no help from their dads, working part-time because of my disabilities, it was unaffordable. That’s when I decided I’d better get an energy meter, and pay upfront. I’ve still got a bill of £495 from my pre-meter days. I haven’t paid it yet, and I’m scared that’s going to come back on me in winter when I have to put the heating back on. You know what’s most disgusting? People like me who pay on meters are charged at a higher rate. I heard on the radio that I’ll be looking at £600 for January alone because I can’t spread out the payments through the year.As told to Simon Hattenstone.

        "description": "Despite the surprisingly gruesome source material, the new remake looks to be playing it safe with genteel morality. Will it work for the House of Mouse?How do you solve a problem like Disney’s live action remakes? Well, from the Mouse House’s point of view, it’s arguable whether there really is any problem at all. After all, Alice in Wonderland, Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin and The Lion King all took more than $1bn at the global box office, while 2016’s The Jungle Book only just fell short of that milestone.The pandemic (and poor notices for Tim Burton’s slightly pointless Dumbo) have led to subsequent remakes turning up on Disney+ instead, which makes it harder to judge their success with audiences. Mulan and Cruella both received fairly decent reviews (not so much Lady and the Tramp), yet all in all there’s an argument to be made that the studio could do with a major, transformative smash on a par with Jon Favreau’s spectacular The Jungle Book to get everyone excited again about its seemingly endless programme of remakes and origins stories.

        "description": "ALGIERS — In Paris, they dreamed of a ‘reset’ in Anglo-French relations once Boris Johnson departed as British prime minister. \n\n\n\nBut the expected arrival of Liz Truss as his successor in 10 Downing Street next month is instead sending tensions into overdrive.\n\n\n\nThe maverick U.K. foreign secretary set the tone during an explosive leadership campaign event Thursday night, vowing to judge French President Emmanuel Macron by his “deeds not words,” and warning “the jury is out” on whether he is Britain’s “friend or foe.”\n\n\n\nHer less-than-diplomatic comments — red meat to the Tory members in the audience — triggered an immediate storm on both sides of the Channel, with former U.K. Ambassador to France Peter Ricketts condemning them as “irresponsible.”\n\n\n\nSeizing the statesmanlike moral high-ground, the French president stressed the need for clarity of thought in a geopolitically chaotic world and underlined the absurdity of cheap political shots suggesting enmity between such close allies as Paris and London.   \n\n\n\nQuizzed by POLITICO on Truss’ remarks during a trip to Algiers on Friday, Macron paused, inhaled deeply, then puffed out his cheeks in mock despair. \n\n\n\n“It’s never good to lose your bearings in life,” the French president said. “We live in a complicated world, you have more and more illiberals, authoritarian democracies, destabilizing powers.\n\n\n\n“If we are not able to tell between France and the U.K. whether we are enemies or friends — the terms are not neutral — we are heading towards serious problems. \n\n\n\n“For sure I say the British people — the nation that is the United Kingdom — is a friend, a strong and allied nation, whatever its leaders.”\n\n\n\n“And,” he added waspishly, “sometimes in spite of, and beyond, its leaders&#8230; or the little mistakes they make with campaign pot shots.”\n\n\n\nThe exchange is just the first skirmish in what looks likely to be a relationship every bit as difficult as that between Macron and Johnson, which was chequered by bad-tempered comments and aggressive briefings from either side. \n\n\n\nJohnson himself tried to play down the row, insisting his relations with Macron had always been positive and describing the French president as a “très bon buddy.”\n\n\n\nBut — though Truss is not yet in power — further flash points already loom large. \n\n\n\nHer allies suggest one of her first acts as prime minister may be to trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland protocol — a mechanism to unilaterally suspend some of the controversial rules regulating trade in the region after Brexit.\n\n\n\nTriggering this so-called ‘nuclear option’ built into the Brexit agreement would further enrage Paris, given Truss, as foreign secretary, is already spearheading a U.K. threat to permanently walk away from some of those rules. Draft legislation permitting London to do so will continue its parliamentary passage in the fall, despite outrage across the EU.\n\n\n\nWith David Frost, the U.K.’s former chief Brexit negotiator and one of the loudest advocators of invoking Article 16, tipped to join Truss’ Cabinet this fall, and with a 2024 U.K. general election already looming on the horizon, few expect Truss to tone down the rhetoric against the EU assuming she becomes PM.\n\n\n\nIn Paris, patience is already thin. Relations have been badly strained in recent years by a succession of disputes including post-Brexit fishing rights, Channel migrants, a controversial security deal, the trade of sausages and other meats across the Irish Sea, and Johnson’s reported insults.\n\n\n\nThis week, France added U.K. sewage dumped in the English Channel to the list of its grievances regarding its neighbor’s behavior. French officials also harbor concerns over her foreign policy.\n\n\n\n\n Liz Truss, successeure annoncée de B. Johnson au Royaume-Uni refuse de dire si E. Macron est un ami ou un ennemi  &quot;Ce n’est jamais bon de ne trop perdre ces repères. Le Royaume-Uni est une nation amie, quel que soit ses dirigeants, parfois malgré ses dirigeants.” pic.twitter.com/XanTkgvx7S&mdash; franceinfo (@franceinfo) August 26, 2022\n\n\n\n\n‘BoJo without the jokes’\n\n\n\nInside the Elysée, Truss is seen as “BoJo without the jokes,” according to one senior official, who said their favored choice of Tory leader was “anybody but Truss.” They described her as lacking in talent, and criticized her [Margaret] “Thatcher persona.”\n\n\n\n“It’s going to be a rocky ride,” sighed another French government adviser, traveling with Macron Friday. “But she’s on the campaign trail. We’ll have to see what she does afterwards.”\n\n\n\nThey added: “There’s a populist wave in the U.K. — it’s doubtful any British politician can be totally sincere right now. But there are also some deep convictions with Truss. On Ukraine, she will fight until the last Russian soldier has left the country.”\n\n\n\nA French diplomat said Paris wants to see the U.K. taking steps to rebuild bilateral trust and show willingness to tackle disputes in a “constructive, non-political way,” including the Northern Ireland protocol row.\n\n\n\nShowing polite interest — as Johnson appeared to do — in Macron’s idea of a ‘European Political Community’ might be a start. But in July, Truss told a parliamentary committee she is not a fan. And as prime minister, she is set to miss the first informal meeting of European leaders to discuss the idea, in Prague on October 6, because of a clash with the Tory Party conference. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nA long-overdue U.K.-France summit also remains on ice. The French envoy said the event, last held in early 2018, is unlikely to take place this year given the new British prime minister will only be in post from September.\n\n\n\nBut Ricketts predicted Macron will not agree to a high-profile summit with Truss at all if she pushes through the Northern Ireland Protocol Bill in its current form.\n\n\n\n“Both sides will need time,” he said, “and the French will want to be convinced that there’s been a little bit of a change of heart in London, and that some of the aggressive approach of the last two or three years has gone.”\n\n\n\nFellow European powers are increasingly worried by the collapse in relations. \n\n\n\nMiguel Berger, the German ambassador to the U.K., urged the U.K.’s relationship with France to be “as close as possible,” especially after Britain decided to join the new AUKUS security partnership with the U.S. and Australia last year, causing France to lose a submarine deal with Canberra worth more than €50 billion.\n\n\n\n“I think there needs to be an effort to reach a good understanding and cooperation with our French neighbors,” Berger told BBC Radio 4’s Today program Friday.",

        "description": "One of Belgium&#8217;s most iconic beer brands is facing calls for a boycott after bosses began production in breweries across Russia, months after President Vladimir Putin&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nLeffe beer is now being produced in seven Russian breweries by AB InBev Efes, a joint venture between AB InBev and Turkish beer producer Anadolu Efes, according to a tweet earlier this month by the Belgian-Luxembourg Chamber of Commerce in Russia. \n\n\n\nThe announcement, coming long after many Western firms shuttered shops and factories in Russia under huge public pressure, has now sparked a backlash online and triggered calls for a boycott.\n\n\n\n&#8220;Leffe beer’s case speaks volumes,&#8221; Oleg Nikolenko, spokesperson of the Ukrainian foreign ministry, said on Thursday. &#8220;There is a growing campaign for boycotting this product in Belgium, coming from its most loyal consumers.&#8221;\n\n\n\nKatya Yushchenko, the wife of former Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko, called out AB InBev, even accusing the company of &#8220;supporting genocide.&#8221;\n\n\n\n&#8220;How Western Europeans like to lecture others about corruption when they themselves choose money over morals. Boycott #Leffe beer,&#8221; she tweeted.\n\n\n\nThe decision by the joint venture has left its parent company AB InBev  scrambling to clean up a growing PR disaster. The brewing giant, which holds a 24 percent stake in Anadolu Efes, formed the AB InBev Efes 50-50 joint venture with the Turkish company in 2018. But Anadolu Efes is operationally in control of the day-to-day management.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnadolu Efes did not respond to a request for comment, and efforts to reach the joint venture were unsuccessful. \n\n\n\nAsked whether the company opposed the decision to brew Leffe in Russia, a spokesperson for AB InBev on Thursday said the brewer was actively seeking to sell its shares in the venture to its Turkish partner, and to suspend its license to sell certain brands.\n\n\n\nThe Leuven-based firm left the Russian market a few weeks after the start of the war in Ukraine. In April, the company said it would be selling its 50 percent share in the venture with Anadolu Efes, and expected to take a $1.1 billion hit as a result. But despite saying in April that it was in &#8220;active discussions&#8221; for Anadolu Efes to buy the stake, no sale has yet been announced.  \n\n\n\nBeers, like other food products, are not targeted by European sanctions against Russia, as long as they are not produced in collaboration with people or societies targeted by the sanctions.\n\n\n\nIn Belgium, the news prompted an outcry from local politicians who say that the brand is still owned by the brewing giant, and therefore remains a money-spinner.\n\n\n\n&#8220;It raises an ethical and moral question,&#8221; said François Desquesnes, a Walloon lawmaker who sits on the agriculture committee and is a member of the opposition party Les Engagés.\n\n\n\nDesquesnes warned of &#8220;repercussions on all the actors of the brewing economic chain in Belgium,&#8221; putting jobs at risk. \n\n\n\nAllowing Belgian beers to be produced abroad is &#8220;a real threat,&#8221; Desquesnes added. &#8220;If we agree to do this for a product, we will allow relocation [&#8230;] It&#8217;s deception, it&#8217;s swindling.&#8221; \n\n\n\nAB InBev is not the only Western company struggling to sever Russian connections. French oil giant TotalEnergies&nbsp;is trying to distance itself from its Terneftegaz joint venture with Russian firm Novatek. Ride-hailing company Uber is still on the lookout for a buyer for its stake in a venture with Russian tech company Yandex.\n\n\n\nBartosz Brzezinski contributed reporting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of&nbsp;POLITICO Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one-stop-shop solution for policy professionals fusing the depth of POLITICO journalism with the power of technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive, breaking scoops and insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomized policy intelligence platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-level public affairs network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY GO PRO\n\n\n\nLOG IN",

        "description": "I&#8217;ve been saying that complexity is the worst enemy of security for a long time now. (Here&#8217;s me in 1999.) And it&#8217;s been true for a long time.\nIn 2018, Thomas Dullien of Google&#8217;s Project Zero talked about &#8220;cheap complexity.&#8221; Andrew Appel summarizes:\nThe anomaly of cheap complexity.  For most of human history, a more complex device was more expensive to build than a simpler device.  This is not the case in modern computing. It is often more cost-effective to take a very complicated device, and make it simulate simplicity, than to make a simpler device.  This is because of economies of scale: complex general-purpose CPUs are cheap.  On the other hand, custom-designed, simpler, application-specific devices, which could in principle be much more secure, are very expensive.\nThis is driven by two fundamental principles in computing: Universal computation, meaning that any computer can simulate any other; and Moore&#8217;s law, predicting that each year the number of transistors on a chip will grow exponentially.  ARM Cortex-M0 CPUs cost pennies, though they are more powerful than some supercomputers of the 20th century.\nThe same is true in the software layers.  A (huge and complex) general-purpose operating system is free, but a simpler, custom-designed, perhaps more secure OS would be very expensive to build.  Or as Dullien asks, &#8220;How did this research code someone wrote in two weeks 20 years ago end up in a billion devices?&#8221;\nThis is correct. Today, it&#8217;s easier to build complex systems than it is to build simple ones. As recently as twenty years ago, if you wanted to build a refrigerator you would create custom refrigerator controller hardware and embedded software. Today, you just grab some standard microcontroller off the shelf and write a software application for it. And that microcontroller already comes with an IP stack, a microphone, a video port, Bluetooth, and a whole lot more. And since those features are there, engineers use them.",

        "description": "By Gabriela Monasterio, Staff Writer Vol. 20\n\n\n\nThe Federal Circuit announced on February 24, 2022 that the Lanham Act’s ban on trademarking names is unconstitutional as content-based discrimination. This reversed the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board (TTAB) decision, which denied an application for the phrase “Trump Too Small” because it contained the name of a person without their consent, a violation of &nbsp;15 U.S.C. § 1052(c). The TTAB is a quasi-judicial body that decides whether an applicant has the right to register a mark or keep their registration after being challenged.\n\n\n\nHistory of the Case\n\n\n\nIn re Steve Elster arose out of Steve Elster’s trademark application for the phrase “Trump Too Small” from 2018. The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) rejected Elster’s application several times because the mark he intended to register included “a name, . . . [that identified] a particular living individual” without consent. This language comes directly from 15 U.S.C. § 1052(c), the portion of the Lanham Act which identifies what types of marks may or may not be registered. The current Trademark Manual of Examining Procedure states that if “a name, portrait, or signature in a mark identifies a particular living individual . . . the mark can be registered only with the written consent of the individual.” This requirement also includes nicknames, pseudonyms, and stage names. Elster appealed the USPTO’s decision to the TTAB in December 2019. In July 2020, the TTAB held that Elster’s trademark application must be refused for violation of § 1052(c). Elster appealed to the Federal Circuit in August 2020.\n\n\n\nLevel of Scrutiny\n\n\n\nWhile declining to establish a specific level of scrutiny for First Amendment cases involving trademarks, the Federal Circuit indicated that courts should use at least intermediate scrutiny. Generally, intermediate scrutiny requires that laws must further an important government interest by means that are substantially related to that interest. The court cited to Reed v. Town of Gilbertas an example of when a viewpoint-neutral but content-based restriction was evaluated under strict scrutiny, and Central Hudson v. Public Service Commission of New Yorkfor intermediate scrutiny, but ultimately punted the decision to the Supreme Court. The court focused primarily on the “substantial government interest” prong of intermediate scrutiny, and the government offered two interests: privacy and publicity.\n\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n\n\nThe Federal Circuit characterized Elster’s trademark application as “speech by a private party” in a forum wrought with controversial speech. The court labeled the USPTO’s rejection of Elster’s application as content-based discrimination because the application was rejected for containing the name of a person who had not consented to the application. The court rejected the government’s argument that trademarks exist in a limited public forum, stating that trademarks are too ubiquitous in American society, and any restriction would chill speech “from the Internet to the grocery store.”\n\n\n\nThe Federal Circuit relied heavily on the decisions in Matal v. Tam and Iancu v. Brunetti in its decision. These two cases took down the prohibitions on disparaging and immoral marks in&nbsp; 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a) because they constituted viewpoint-based discrimination. The court acknowledged that while Matal and Iancu did not clearly resolve the matter in Elster, they helped establish that trademarks fall under the First Amendment.\n\n\n\nThe Federal Circuit found that the First Amendment interests were strong, especially the right of criticism, and that the government’s interests were weak considering the public nature of Trump’s life. The government alleged an interest in “protecting state-law privacy and publicity rights.” It claimed that people have an exclusive right in the use of their identities, and that they also have a right to the commercial value of that identity and to prevent its misappropriation. The Federal Circuit dismissed the privacy interest, as “there can be no plausible claim that President Trump enjoys a right of privacy protecting him from criticism in the absence of actual malice.” Turning to the right of publicity, the court conceded that there is an interest in preventing misappropriation, but that was not an issue here because no party claimed that “President Trump has endorsed Elster’s product.” The court also noted that even without 1052(c), there is still a cause of action for misappropriation under 15 U.S.C. § 1052(a).\n\n\n\nThe Federal Circuit supported its ruling with a Tenth Circuit case which held that parody baseball cards had a First Amendment right to use the names and likenesses of political and sports figures. It also cited to a California Supreme Court decision which held that the First Amendment right to comment on, parody, or criticize celebrities was superior to the celebrity’s right to publicity. Ultimately, the court held that the USPTO’s denial of Steve Elster’s application was unconstitutional because, as applied, it was content-based discrimination.\n\n\n\nImpact in the Legal Community\n\n\n\nJust a few days after the decision was announced, trademark and First Amendment scholars were abuzz, debating the impact of the case. On Twitter, Professor Lisa P. Ramsey of the University of San Diego expressed her disappointment that the court didn’t consider the chilling effect of the ruling on political speech. In her blog, Professor Jennifer E. Rothman of the University of Pennsylvania wondered why the Federal Circuit did not consider whether “Trump Too Small” was even a functional mark in the first place, as it violated another part of 15 U.S.C. 1052, the bar on implying a false connection with another person or organization, and oftentimes general political slogans are not source-identifying, the main purpose of trademarks. Professor Rebecca Tushnet from Harvard opined that the ruling likely only extended to non-confusing uses of a public official’s name as a trademark, so only uses that don’t lead a consumer to believe that the product or service is connected to the public official.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean for public figures?\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because this case focused on Donald Trump, a very public figure, we can best apply the ruling to public figures. Famous people who have voluntarily lived their lives in the public eye (like reality TV stars) are more likely trademark candidates than someone who was forcibly put in the limelight but now lives a more private life (like child stars). Politicians are also better trademark candidates than non-politicians, as there is a recognized right to political speech under the First Amendment.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean for you?\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your name probably won’t get trademarked, and even if someone tries, it probably won’t be successful because your right to privacy is stronger than Trump’s. Private individuals have stronger privacy rights than people like Trump because the lives of political figures like Trump are usually considered “in the public interest,” and even before Trump became a political figure, he lived a very open and public life through social media and reality TV.\n\n\n\nBecause this case was an as-applied challenge, the scope of the ruling is limited. While a facial challenge would have struck down the law entirely, this decision only invalidates the law as it relates to trademarks of the name of very famous or publicly-known people. This case was the worst set of facts for the government – they were dealing with a very well known, very political person who was the subject of the trademark. In future cases involving less prominent figures, or people who have made greater attempts to keep their private life private, courts may go the other way, holding that their right to privacy is implicated.\n\n\n\nWhat does it mean for trademark applicants?\n\n\n\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The USPTO and TTAB are subordinate to the Federal Circuit, so until the Supreme Court rules on this issue, the In re Elster opinion is law. Applicants may use the names of public figures of a similar stature to Trump (people who are incredibly public by nature and by design) in their trademarks. However, they should be careful about using the names of less famous people and more private figures.",

In reality, though, what it took to cut off contact with my ex was waking up to screenshots of messages he had sent one of my childhood friends, at two in the morning, asking her: “does size matter?”This was his calling card, an unprovoked question I can only imagine he has sent – without exaggeration – to hundreds of women. I had received screenshots like this from dozens already, during breakups and after our ultimate split, and had even seen some uploaded publicly to Facebook by women looking to call him out. He had been bad to me during our relationship (cheating serially, hitting me sometimes), was far less attractive than I was, and had a personality people famously disliked. But until that morning, these women had typically been strangers, or people I only knew casually, making it easy to reply with performative disgust before adding them to the growing pile I discarded from my mind. Now, I had thrown someone into his wake. I had never felt more mortified by my association with this person.

        "description": "With former President Trump dominating the news due to government investigations, scandals, indictments and a range of nefarious sounding accusations, it is important to remember that the United States government has talented people at all levels, across multiple agencies, working, night and day, to keep us secure. \n\n\n\nAnd, by the way, many of them are women you&nbsp;usually hear little about but who should give you great comfort.\n\n\n\nConsider the new nominee to head the U.S. Secret Service, Kim Cheatle, selected by President Biden to be the director of any agency under intense scrutiny.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCheatle is no stranger to public service, or to the U.S. Secret Service specifically. She has served at the agency for 27 years, including a stint on Biden’s security detail when he was vice president. The only other woman to lead the Secret Service was Julia Pierson, who served during the Obama administration.\n\n\n\nCheatle, who also has corporate experience, will have her hands full in government. Scandals have plagued the Secret Service for years.\n\n\n\nIn Congress, the House investigation of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. capitol has led to charges that the Secret Service lost or deleted critical text messages. Congress has issued a subpoena for the text messages. The Department of Homeland Security’s inspector general has launched a criminal probe into the missing texts.\n\n\n\nAlso on Cheatle’s plate will be recent Secret Service incidents involving charges that agents behaved inappropriately overseas. In May, when President Biden traveled to South Korea, two Secret Service employees, while off-duty, got into a confrontation with local South Koreans, leading to them being placed on administrative leave and having to return home to the United States.\n\n\n\nIn July&nbsp;a Secret Service employee working in Israel before Biden’s visit there was sent home after being briefly arrested by the Israeli police in what the U.S. agency called “a physical encounter.”\n\n\n\nThe other bubbling new story is the continued security saga at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago home, where highly classified documents have been seized in an investigation by the U.S. Justice Department after a complaint by the National Archives, which is responsible for storage of presidential documents. Questions about how Secret Service agents guarding Mar-a-Lago conducted themselves during the raid, and whether they will have to testify, will undoubtedly involve the new Secret Service director.\n\n\n\nSpeaking of documents and the U.S. National Archives, meet Debra Steidel Wall, an American archivist who took over as the acting head of the National Archives in May after the head archivist stepped down following a decade of service.\n\n\n\nWall has spent much of her career at the National Archives — over 25 years, including as its chief of staff and deputy archivist in charge of managing and transforming the agency.\n\n\n\nThe National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) is the nation’s keeper of records conducted by the U.S. federal government, including the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and the Bill or Rights. The public can order copies of those, along with congressional records, federal court decisions and Census materials.\n\n\n\nWall is leading a federal agency that typically avoids scandals but is now caught up in likely the biggest national security story of the year — the handling (or mishandling) of hundreds of documents that former President Trump removed from the White House and stored on his private property despite repeated requests by the Archives to return them to the public domain.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHaving been unable to secure their return from an intransigent former president, the Archives turned to the Justice Department for help, leading to an FBI search and retrieval mission to seize boxes and bring them back to the Archives, where they belong. Now the matter is in court.\n\n\n\nWall finds herself engaged in an assignment that could involve major damage to intelligence sources and methods used in Special Access Programs. Those documents are now being reviewed and redacted for release to the public and assessed for national security damage given that they include materials marked “sensitive compartmented information,” meaning they must be viewed in secure government facilities. Legal decisions are pending regarding how much the public will see of the predicate for the affidavit filed in this case that led to a search warrant in the first place.\n\n\n\nSummers are supposed to be slow. But security crises, like those facing Kim Cheatle and Debra Steidel Wall, are part of the job, regardless of the season. \n\n\n\nThe same is true for America’s top diplomat at the United Nations, another powerhouse woman, Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield. She is a career foreign service officer whose life story reads like a profile in courage. Ambassador Thomas-Greenfield came back to public service at the U.N. after retiring from a 35-year career, including as director general of the Foreign Service and service in Liberia, Pakistan, Kenya, Nigeria and Jamaica, among other countries.\n\n\n\nToday she is dealing with the likes of Russian President Vladimir Putin, whose invasion of Ukraine six months ago has led to a trail of death, destruction and the dislocation of hundreds of thousands of people across Europe and the world. This week the United States sent yet another major assistance package to Ukraine — nearly $3 billion in weapons and aid just as the Russian side is increasing its force levels, bombing civilian train stations and keeping a nuclear plant near Kyiv on high alert. \n\n\n\nThomas-Greenfield will have to steer U.S. diplomacy through a complex institution with close to 200 member states with differing national objectives.\n\n\n\nRest easy, readers.&nbsp;A dangerous world is in good hands with this trio of strong, experienced, professional women.\n\n\n\nTara D.&nbsp;Sonenshine&nbsp;is the Edward R. Murrow Professor of Practice in Public Diplomacy at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University.",

        "description": "I’d deluded myself in thinking that keeping ex-partners in my life was the right thing to do. The truth was I just liked the attentionThe final straw should have been sooner. In reality, though, what it took to cut off contact with my ex was waking up to screenshots of messages he had sent one of my childhood friends, at two in the morning, asking her: “does size matter?”This was his calling card, an unprovoked question I can only imagine he has sent – without exaggeration – to hundreds of women. I had received screenshots like this from dozens already, during breakups and after our ultimate split, and had even seen some uploaded publicly to Facebook by women looking to call him out. He had been bad to me during our relationship (cheating serially, hitting me sometimes), was far less attractive than I was, and had a personality people famously disliked. But until that morning, these women had typically been strangers, or people I only knew casually, making it easy to reply with performative disgust before adding them to the growing pile I discarded from my mind. Now, I had thrown someone into his wake. I had never felt more mortified by my association with this person. But what was more humiliating was that, at the time, we were still friends.Sarah Manavis is the digital culture writer at the New StatesmanDo you have an opinion on the issues raised in this article?

        "description": "Royal Albert Hall, LondonPresenting works rarely seen at the Proms, the BBCSO were at their best, led by the magnificently brooding Fabien GabelCompleted in 1888, César Franck’s Symphony in D Minor was once very much a standard repertory work, though, for some inexplicable reason, it began to slip from favour a few decades ago and has become something of a rarity of late. Fabien Gabel’s performance with the BBC Symphony Orchestra marked its first Proms outing for nearly 20 years, and you couldn’t help but be struck by what a great and original work it is, with its dark intensity of orchestration and mood, its evolutionary structure derived from a handful of notes heard at the outset, and its absorption of the influences of Wagner and Brahms without ever seeming derivative.Gabel’s interpretation can only be described as awesome, and was characterised by a powerful, sweeping nobility, the opening motto magnificently brooding, the first movement’s allegro flung out with almost reckless defiance. The central allegretto, rolling slow movement and scherzo into one, relaxed into eloquent lyricism before the finale, recapitulating everything that had gone before, blazed with triumphant conviction. The BBCSO were at their best here, and there was some terrific playing, the great cor anglais solo in the allegretto above all. Continue reading...",

        "description": "As The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power comes to TV, its young cast talk about replacing Cate Blanchett, being the saga’s first Black main character, and going to the pub in prostheticsIf there’s one thing we know about The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, it’s that this eight-part series is big. Filmed in New Zealand and on a rumoured budget of $1bn for seasons one and two, the show sports massive battle sequences, hordes of marauding monsters and special effects that will make Peter Jackson’s films of JRR Tolkien’s trilogy look like DIY fringe theatre.But for all its monumental scale, Rings of Power is still a story about characters: from haughty elves to ale-swilling men, from thatch-bearded dwarves to a new race of eco-friendly proto-Hobbits called Harfoots. The cast that showrunners JD Payne and Patrick McKay have assembled is remarkable: a lineup that is short on bankable names (unless you count Lenny Henry) but huge on talent and promise, from indie movie mavens to theatrical darlings, from dashing former child actors to (at least) one alumnus of that other fantasy franchise, Game of Thrones.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/healthcare/3616380-we-should-have-been-able-to-contain-monkeypox/",
        "description": "For those of us at the forefront of the public health response to monkeypox, there was an overwhelming sense of whiplash watching the federal government roll out its&nbsp;new vaccine dose-sparing strategy&nbsp;earlier this month. This latest move is intended to finally get the&nbsp;country ahead of the virus — except it repeats the same strategic error we’ve seen time and again: it fails to fund implementation.\n\n\n\nSince the earliest days of the monkeypox outbreak, sexual health&nbsp;clinics have been on the front lines, meeting patients’ needs and providing equitable&nbsp;care. They have worked tirelessly to stretch their&nbsp;shoestring budgets&nbsp;to provide testing, treatment and vaccines — even taking referrals from less-equipped primary&nbsp;care providers and&nbsp;seeing patients who have been turned away&nbsp;elsewhere. But the federal government has not provided the necessary funding to maintain these services that are&nbsp;critical to&nbsp;combating infectious disease outbreaks like this one.\n\n\n\nWe should have been able to&nbsp;contain monkeypox — it was detected early and already had tests, a safe vaccine and an effective treatment. But a&nbsp;chronically underfunded public health system, often lacking even basic supplies like testing swabs and syringes and depleted by two-plus years of the&nbsp;COVID-19 pandemic, failed this most basic test.\n\n\n\nSo, as federal health officials&nbsp;continue to tout their response to the outbreak in press&nbsp;conferences,&nbsp;clinics across the&nbsp;country are pleading for help and patients are suffering the&nbsp;consequences. It did not have to be this way.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe strategic move to stretch our&nbsp;current supply of Jynneos, the safest vaccine for monkeypox, is just the latest example in this trend. The&nbsp;concerns over the&nbsp;safety and efficacy&nbsp;of this approach are real but equally&nbsp;concerning is the failure to&nbsp;consult the affected&nbsp;communities to implement this strategy in a way that builds trust and provides adequate resources. It involves a&nbsp;complex injection method that requires specialized training, unique supplies and new handling procedures — and there is little margin for error. However, thus far, there have been no resources or additional training provided to implement the new strategy.\n\n\n\nAgain and again, the government’s most meaningful steps to address this&nbsp;crisis have failed to make a difference to the patients who need them most because of a lack of funding.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen the government first made the small supply of the Jynneos vaccine available, patients trying to register for an appointment quickly learned that the supply was depleted&nbsp;in minutes. Inside&nbsp;clinic walls, providers reached into their already overstretched budgets to&nbsp;create what new appointments they&nbsp;could, triage patients and reassign staff to deliver vaccines. Later, when the government finally relented to public pressure and&nbsp;expanded access&nbsp;to vaccines, it still failed to provide the dollars to&nbsp;clinics to deliver the doses quickly — stranding desperate patients, yet again.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSimilarly, when the federal government last month&nbsp;announced partnerships&nbsp;with private commercial laboratories like to ease the backlog of tests,&nbsp;clinics were forced to make difficult&nbsp;choices about whether to&nbsp;continue using the free, public labs or utilize&nbsp;commercial labs, the latter of which would require them to either pass on&nbsp;costs to patients — who are often uninsured — or eat the&nbsp;costs themselves. Many&nbsp;clinics have&nbsp;chosen the path with the least hurdles, opting to use the public labs.\n\n\n\nAnd in recent weeks, as doctors raised issues with accessing the one available treatment for monkeypox,&nbsp;TPOXX, due to the extensive amount of paperwork the federal government requires to be filled out for each patient — 124 pages to be exact — the&nbsp;Centers for Disease&nbsp;Control and Prevention (CDC) updated its guidance to shorten the forms but didn’t provide&nbsp;clinics with the resources to provide tests or submit paperwork.\n\n\n\nThe pattern is unmistakable — but it is fixable.\n\n\n\nWith over 15,000&nbsp;confirmed&nbsp;cases, we&nbsp;can’t afford to let monkeypox become endemic in the U.S. The new emergency declaration and federal monkeypox&nbsp;coordinators are promising steps toward righting the ship of this outbreak response.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the bottom line remains: Patients and&nbsp;communities won’t start to feel the full benefit of the strides the administration has worked hard to make until the federal government provides funding to implement its strategy. Absent that, we will see history repeat itself in slow motion with predictable outcomes as&nbsp;case numbers spiral and patients wait in pain.\n\n\n\nDavid&nbsp;C.&nbsp;Harvey&nbsp;is the executive director of the National&nbsp;Coalition of STD Directors.",

        "description": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg this week told popular podcaster Joe Rogan that Facebook did limit stories on the newsfeed related to the New York Post story about President Biden’s son, Hunter, and his laptop after warnings from the FBI, but defended the law enforcement agency as a “legitimate institution.”\n\n\n\nZuckerberg said on an episode of Rogan’s podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” that was uploaded on Thursday, that the FBI reached out to his company ahead of the 2020 presidential election to warn them to take note of potentially polarizing content. This warning came after Russia used social media platforms, including Facebook, to post content intended to be polarizing ahead of the 2016 election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZuckerberg said he took the warning seriously. He said the social media platform did not ban people from sharing the Post’s story, but it took action to limit how often the story appeared on feeds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Post reported shortly before the 2020 election that the FBI obtained a laptop that allegedly belonged to Hunter Biden as part of a federal investigation into him.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer President Trump and some of his allies seized on the report at the time as showing evidence that Hunter was involved in questionable business dealings while his father served as vice president. Some of the emails on the laptop have since been confirmed as authentic, but no wrongdoing from the president or his son has been confirmed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe investigation into Hunter Biden reached a critical juncture last month as prosecutors weigh whether to bring any charges, CNN reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZuckerberg said he did not remember if the FBI specifically mentioned the Post’s story in its warning.\n\n\n\nHe said he does not want Facebook to be the “ministry of truth” in deciding what is considered misinformation.\n\n\n\nHis defense of the FBI as \"legitimate\" comes as many conservatives have criticized the agency for conducting a search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property in Florida earlier this month. Some Trump allies have called for defunding the FBI as a result.",

        "description": "A St. Cloud resident caught freshwater jellyfish on camera during a recent fishing trip Monday on Leech Lake near Walker, Minn. To pass the time waiting for his friend to arrive, James Hofmann decided he’d cast a line out and see if he could spot anything.“It was early morning, flat water, the sun was out, and I was shallow fishing,” Hofmann said. “I had polarized glasses and seeing if I could spot any fish, and I just noticed them, thinking ‘What am I looking at right now?’” Hofmann, who runs JimmyOgraphy, a video production company in St. Cloud, decided he’d flip his iPhone upside down and catch some footage of whatever it was in the water. Turns out, he spotted jellyfish.

But Minnesota DNR fisheries researcher John Hoxmeier told MPR News that “they don’t appear to have a negative impact on our lakes.” “They’ve been in [Minnesota] for decades, but people typically don’t see them because they are only around for a few weeks and the lake has to be calm in order for you to see them,” Hoximeier said. Gary Montz, a research scientist with the DNR’s ecological and water resources division, said they’re difficult to spot because they spend most of their lifecycle in a polyp stage, attached to things at the bottom of the lake.“It&#x27;s a really unremarkable non-descript stalk, maybe 4 to 5 mm long,” Montz said. “It just sits there. Throughout the season it might make new polyps, but it’s mostly just stuck to the bottom and feeds on tinier animals.”Then when the conditions are right — Montz said it’s not clear what conditions, but most researchers think it might have to do with water temperature or food availability — they move to the “medusa stage” what we might spot in the lake.A freshwater jellyfish caught on camera from Leech Lake, near Walker, Minn.Courtesy of James &#x27;JimmyO&#x27; HofmannIn this medusa stage, they range from 5 to 25 mm in diameter or the equivalent of a quarter or smaller. While they have stingers on their tentacles, it’s only useful for catching zooplankton to eat, the stingers aren’t large enough to hurt people.According to the U.S. Geological Survey, freshwater jellyfish can be found as far south as Florida and as far west as California. Montz said that the DNR is aware of a couple dozen lakes in Minnesota where these jellyfish have been spotted, but’s very likely they’re more widespread than we currently know.“You may see them one summer, and then you won’t see them again the next summer. Their appearance can be quite irregular,” Montz said. “If people aren’t there to spot the medusa stage, no one is going to notice the polyp stage at all.”While they aren’t uncommon, Hofmann said he’s visited Leech Lake hundreds of times and has never spotted them before. “Whenever I mention it, [other people] are just like ‘What are you talking about?’” he said, “until I pull up the video.”",

        "description": "Driven by moral outrage over Russia’s invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, U.S. governors and other top state officials made it clear: They wanted to cut their financial ties with Russia.A few states quickly followed through. Idaho sold $300,000 of bonds in a Russian oil company in early March. A day before the invasion, the Kentucky Teachers Retirement System sold its shares in the Russian bank Sberbank.But those examples are outliers. Six months into a war that has killed thousands of Ukrainians and displaced over 12 million more, most of the pledges to drop Russian investments — some made with great fanfare during news conferences — have gone unfulfilled, according to an Associated Press review, state retirement administrators and firms that invest state funds.Swift global reaction has cut off much of Russia&#x27;s economy from the rest of the world. That has made it nearly impossible for divestment by state pension funds, university endowments and other public-sector holdings — as well as private investments such as those in 401(k) accounts.“These pension funds want to get out, but it’s just not realistic to sell everything in the current environment,” said Keith Brainard, research director at the National Association of State Retirement Administrators. MarchWalz orders Minnesota to terminate Russian contractsBenjamin Smith, a spokesperson for the Rhode Island treasury, said the factors that make it hard to divest also show that a worldwide effort to isolate Russian President Vladimir Putin is working.“This is good news because it means that pressure from investors across the world, including Rhode Island, is succeeding in exacting a toll on the Russian economy, making it more difficult for Putin to fund his military operation, state-owned companies, and corrupt network of oligarchs,” he said in an email, noting that Rhode Island&#x27;s pension plan exposure in Russia never exceeded 0.3 percent of its assets.Any pre-war investments in Russia are now worthless, or nearly so. That&#x27;s raising questions from some officials and fund managers about whether divesting is even necessary.In Hawaii, one of a handful of states where top administration officials did not pledge to divest, Gov. David Ige said at a May 5 news conference that the state&#x27;s employee pension system had “very little to almost nothing” invested in Russia.“The few remaining investments are quite small, and so I didn’t feel compelled to just make a statement for political reasons that we would be divesting,” he said.Before Russia&#x27;s invasion in late February, many government-controlled investments had only small holdings — a fraction of 1 percent in every reported case — in Russian investments. But even that could amount to millions of dollars.The largest U.S. public-sector retirement fund, California’s CalPERS, said just 17 cents of every $100 of its portfolio was in Russian investments as the war broke out. Even so, that translated into $765 million worth of stocks, real estate and private equity.By the end of June, the value had shrunk to $194 million. The entire loss was because the holdings dropped in value; none had been sold.There is no way to know how much state government entities in the U.S. have invested in Russia or companies based there, but collectively they were worth billions of dollars before the war. Much of the money was invested in Russian government bonds, oil and coal companies as part of emerging-markets index funds.Quick to condemn the invasion, state officials said they could put pressure on Putin by dumping their Russian investments.“Our moral imperative before these atrocities demand that you act to address Russia’s aggressions and immediately restrict Russian access to California’s capital and investments,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom wrote in a letter Feb. 28 to the boards overseeing the massive pension funds that serve teachers, state and local government workers and university employees.Across the country, governors and other top officials made similar statements.Just after the invasion began, New York Gov. Kathy Hochul signed an executive order calling for divestment “to the extent possible,” while Arizona&#x27;s Board of Regents voted to exit any Russian investments.The treasurers for 36 states plus the District of Columbia and U.S. Virgin Islands signed a joint letter in March advocating divestment of publicly controlled funds from Russia. They noted a financial reason for doing so: “The current crisis also constitutes a substantial risk for states’ investments and our economic security.”A major chunk of the government holdings in Russia are in the form of index funds that investors use to mimic overall stock market performance. Russian stocks were commonly part of funds specializing in emerging markets. MCSI and other firms that decide which stocks should be in the funds quickly dropped Russian securities.But the companies that sell investment products based on those indexes were left in the lurch, still leaving pieces of Russian stocks in their investors&#x27; portfolios.As part of the sanctions, stock markets in the U.S. and elsewhere stopped the trading of Russian stocks. And the Moscow Stock Exchange was closed for nearly a month, reopening with tight controls that keep U.S. investors from selling.The assets sank in value amid the invasion, though the precise value isn&#x27;t always clear.Maryland said that as of the beginning of February, $197 million of its state retirement and pension system funds were invested in Russian assets. A month later, the state estimated the value had plunged and amounted to just $32 million. The state has been unable to unload its investments.For the handful of states in which top officials have not endorsed divestment, eroding values like that are a main reason.Shortly after the invasion, South Carolina Gov. Henry McMaster said the amount of state investments in Russia was “miniscule” and noted that the value was about to “shrink to almost nothing as the Russian economy is being virtually shut off from the world.”In Florida, Lamar Taylor, the interim executive director of the agency that oversees investments of pension funds, said during a cabinet meeting that some investment managers might seek to unload Russian assets as soon as they’re able, while others could hold on in case they’re worth more later.At the meeting, Gov. Ron DeSantis said the State Board of Administration has a legal responsibility to try to make money for the retirement system.“That would violate your fiduciary duty, if you liquidated at massive losses for political reasons rather than for the best interests of the beneficiaries,” he said.But DeSantis said there was a way to make it easier: Lawmakers passing a bill banning investment in Russia.“If the Legislature could speak clearly, that would be something we’d welcome here, just to make sure we’re not furthering investments in parts of the world that are not reflective of our interests or values,” he said.Hank Kim, executive director of the National Conference on Public Employee Retirement Systems, said he has told member pension funds that taking steps to divest is important even if it can’t be completed right away.&quot;The public has a right to know that it was debated in a serious manner,” he said.Geoff Mulvihill reported from Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Associated Press writers Kimberly Chandler in Montgomery, Alabama; Amy B. Hanson in Helena, Montana; Kimberlee Kruesi in Nashville, Tennessee; and Audrey McAvoy in Honolulu contributed to this report.",

Moderna, on its own, and the partnership of Pfizer and BioNTech were two of the first groups to develop a vaccine for the novel coronavirus. Moderna alleges Pfizer and BioNTech, without permission, copied mRNA technology that Moderna had patented between 2010 and 2016, well before Covid-19 emerged in 2019.

In it, they flip between being a curious leftwing standup exploring their own gender, and Nam Sicoresti, a cancel culture-obsessed livestreaming comic who is gearing up for an interview with Jordan B Peterson.Cancel culture is not a new topic, but discussions on free speech in comedy and the right to offend have felt closer to the surface after a Jerry Sadowitz show at this year’s Edinburgh fringe was pulled after its first performance due to “content that was considered … extreme in its racism, sexism, homophobia and misogyny”. Meanwhile, Netflix specials from Ricky Gervais and Dave Chappelle have been the subject of much controversy, with some viewers labelling them as transphobic. Some of the purveyors of anti-cancel-culture comedy, such as Nicoresti’s character Nam, could be described as edgelords – troll-like figures whose primary purpose is to antagonise. “To my mind, it’s somebody who doesn’t have the courage to stand by their opinions, who believes in nothing, where the only thing that matters is causing outrage, because outrage generates engagement,” says Nicoresti.

        "link": "https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/minnesota-set-to-become-abortion-access-island-in-the-midwest-but-for-whom",
        "description": "This article first appeared at ProPublica. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox.\n\n\n\nFor nearly three decades, long before the fall of Roe v. Wade, the blond brick Building for Women in Duluth, Minnesota, has been a destination for patients traveling from other states to get an abortion. They have come from places where abortions were legal but clinics were scarce and from states where restrictive laws have narrowed windows of opportunity.\n\n\n\nFor many residents of northern and central Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, it was faster to head west toward the Minnesota border than to go southeast to clinics in Milwaukee, Green Bay or Madison. Over the years, thousands of pregnant people climbed the stairs of the Building for Women to get abortions at WE Health Clinic, on the second floor.\n\n\n\nTreating travelers from other states is nothing new for WE Health or the other abortion providers around the state, but Minnesota’s role as a so-called abortion access island is. The state’s neighbors have either banned abortion, are poised to do so or have severely restricted the procedure.\n\n\n\nData kept by Minnesota shows that white people make up a larger share of those who travel from another state for an abortion than those who seek abortions in state, raising questions about whether certain groups — particularly people of color — will be able to make the trip.\n\n\n\nAccording to the state’s data, Minnesota residents seeking abortions are a fairly diverse group. From 2018 through 2021, on average, 31% of patients were Black, 9% were Hispanic, 8% were Asian and 2% were American Indian; an additional 6% were recorded as “other.” White patients accounted for 44%.\n\n\n\nBut among those coming from out of state, people of color made up a much smaller percentage on average of the patient population. White people made up 75% of out-of-state patients.\n\n\n\nExperts say some of the disparity results from the fact that the states bordering Minnesota are predominantly white, particularly in the rural areas adjacent to the state. But this also describes Minnesota’s population. So at least some of the difference could be tied to access to transportation or money to travel.\n\n\n\n“Minnesota is going to become a haven state, but for what percentage of people that actually need our services?” said Paulina Briggs, WE Health Clinic’s laboratory manager and patient educator. “That’s a huge thing.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen Roe was overturned in June, the small staff at WE Health Clinic was dismayed but not surprised. In fact, it was prepared to meet the estimated 10% to 25% increase in out-of-state patients.\n\n\n\n“We’ve anticipated this for a long time,” Briggs said. “So it’s not like sudden news to us.”\n\n\n\nWhile the clinicians in Duluth may have been prepared for the end of Roe, something much more unexpected happened 2 1/2 weeks later, when a district court judge delivered a surprise ruling that expanded abortion access in the state. Ruling in Doe v. Minnesota, the judge threw out measures that included a mandatory 24-hour waiting period before abortions, two-parent consent for minors and a requirement that physicians discuss medical risks and alternatives to abortion with patients. He also tossed out a requirement that only doctors were allowed to provide abortion care, including by telemedicine, and that after the first trimester, the care had to take place in a hospital.\n\n\n\nIn contrast to the tearful scenes that played out in many clinics after Roe fell, in Minnesota that Monday morning, abortion providers and their support staff celebrated. Laurie Casey, the executive director of WE Health, was behind her long, crowded desk, doing paperwork when she first got news.\n\n\n\n“It’s like, ‘Oh my God, is this real?’” she said. “Something good happened?”\n\n\n\nBriggs said: “I think I audibly cheered. Like: ‘Yeah. Hell yeah.’”\n\n\n\nLawyers for the plaintiffs in the Minnesota case, which was filed in 2019, had expected to go to trial at the end of August. Instead, the judge granted abortion supporters a big victory, leaving intact two measures: a requirement that abortion providers collect and report data on their patients to the state, and a law that dictates the rules for disposing of fetal remains.\n\n\n\nMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office represented the state in the lawsuit, announced that he would not appeal the court’s decision. Ellison also pledged that he would not prosecute abortion-seekers from other states and wouldn’t cooperate with extradition orders from outside jurisdictions.\n\n\n\nMinnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order making similar promises.\n\n\n\nBoth officials have made abortion access central tenets of their reelection campaigns.\n\n\n\nIn these early days of a post-Roe reality, it’s not yet clear who will need these protections, though the data can provide clues.\n\n\n\nStates track demographic data on abortion differently; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than two dozen publicly report the race and ethnicity of patients. Minnesota is the only access island state in the Midwest that releases those numbers; the state also separates that data into resident and nonresident figures.\n\n\n\nIllinois is projected to accept far more out-of-state patients than Minnesota, but its health department does not release statistics about the race and ethnicity of abortion patients. Kansas allows abortion up to 22 weeks, protects the right to abortion in its Constitution and reports one of the highest rates of out-of-state patients in the country, at nearly 50% and second only to Washington, D.C. But Kansas’ state health department does not combine where patients are from with demographic data.\n\n\n\nFrom 2008 to 2021, 13,256 patients who live outside Minnesota received abortion care there, an average of about 950 people a year, according to the state health department. Among that population, the racial and ethnic breakdown of patients has held fairly steady.\n\n\n\nA number of factors play into the lack of diversity, said Asha Hassan, a graduate researcher at the Center for Antiracism Research for Health Equity at the University of Minnesota.\n\n\n\n“There’s the obvious one that might be coming to mind, which is the effects of the way structural racism and poverty are interwoven,” Hassan said.\n\n\n\nCaitlin Knowles Myers, a professor at Middlebury College in Vermont who studies the economics of abortion, added, “Obviously resources like ability to take time off, ability to get and pay for child care, etc., etc. — that obviously prevents poor women from making a trip.”\n\n\n\nThen there is the cost of the procedure itself. In Minnesota, residents can use state medical assistance funds to pay for an abortion under certain circumstances; out-of-state residents cannot. According to Our Justice, a nonprofit that provides financial assistance for abortion care and travel to Minnesota, in-clinic abortion services can cost $400 to $2,000, depending on the gestational age of the pregnancy. A locally based telemedicine service and mobile clinic called Just the Pill charges $350 for abortion medication.\n\n\n\nShayla Walker, executive director of Our Justice, said her organization helps people work through the kinds of barriers to travel that pregnant people of color face every day. Undocumented patients, for instance, may not have a driver’s license or other form of identification, meaning that flying from states like Texas or Oklahoma is out of the question.\n\n\n\nOf the out-of-state patients who come to Minnesota, residents from neighboring Wisconsin make up the vast majority. And like Minnesota and its neighboring states, Wisconsin is predominantly white: 80.4% of residents identified as such in the 2020 U.S. Census.\n\n\n\nFrom 2008 to 2021, an average of 690 patients from Wisconsin received abortion care in Minnesota each year. The proportion of Wisconsinites has dropped over the years — in 2008, 80% of out-of-state abortion patients reported that they lived in Wisconsin, compared with 63% by 2021. Over that same period, South Dakota residents ticked up from 4% to 16%, and Iowa patients rose from 2% to 6%.\n\n\n\nAccording to Myers, the lack of abortion providers in western and central Wisconsin likely drives the traffic across the border to Minnesota. These parts of the state are largely rural and mostly white. Wisconsin’s more diverse urban centers are concentrated in the southern and eastern parts of the state, much closer to the Illinois border.\n\n\n\n“A lot of them are likely to end up heading south to the Chicago area,” Myers said. “The Chicago area also has a lot of providers and likely a lot of capacity. And the question for Minnesota is, if the Chicago area ends up unable to absorb an enormous influx of patients heading their way from all directions, then you would expect to see patients spilling over into Minneapolis.”\n\n\n\nLeaders of the Options Fund, which provides financial help to pregnant people in rural central and western Wisconsin who are seeking abortions, said the majority of the money they provide is for care that takes place in Minnesota.\n\n\n\n“Certainly it’s not that people of color don’t exist, of course,” said the group’s vice president, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for her safety. “But I think generally, the more rural we get, the more white it’s going to be.”\n\n\n\nOf course, the data from Minnesota is backward-looking, from years when abortion was still legal, though restricted or sometimes difficult to access, in surrounding states. There are certain to be shifts in where patients travel from, most obviously North Dakota, where the state’s lone abortion clinic moved from Fargo to its Minnesota sister city of Moorhead, just across the border. And as reproductive rights supporters across the country respond to the end of Roe, abortion funds have reported huge increases in their donations, which may bring travel and abortion care in Minnesota within the grasp of more low-income pregnant people and people of color.\n\n\n\nThe first week after the Doe v. Minnesota decision, WE Health Clinic’s patients felt the impact. Casey said she was able to tell a mother that her minor daughter could receive an abortion without the permission of her long-absent father or from a judge. Briggs was able to schedule a next-day abortion, which would have been illegal before the judge’s decision.\n\n\n\nAt some point, a clinic worker went through intake folders and pulled out all the forms certifying that “state mandated information” had been provided to patients. They were fed into the office shredder.\n\n\n\nTossing out their scripts, canceling the physician phone calls 24 hours in advance, no longer going down to the county courthouse to ask judges to grant their minor patients special permission to have an abortion — all of this will save the WE Health Clinic workers hours every week.\n\n\n\nBeyond that, the court ruling — which abortion opponents are seeking to have overturned — has the potential to increase the number of providers, as advanced clinicians like nurse practitioners and some classifications of midwives may now be able to get training, and eventually provide abortion care and telemedicine.\n\n\n\nThis pivotal moment for abortion care in Minnesota and the country at large comes at a moment of major transition for WE Health as well. Casey is looking at retirement in the coming year, which means much of the work of adapting the clinic to serve patients in a post-Roe world will fall to her staff, including Briggs.\n\n\n\nBriggs started working at the clinic six years ago, when she was just 21. She wanted to do this work after receiving her own abortion at WE Health as a college student, an experience she found at once “nonchalant” and “empowering.”\n\n\n\nShe is troubled by the disparities in who might be able to make it across the borders and climb the stairs of the Building for Women, to receive the kind of life-changing care that she did. Just keeping the doors open does not mean the care will be equitable.",

        "description": "I have it on good authority that Secretary of State Antony Blinken planned his July trip to Africa to release the U.S. Strategy towards Sub-Saharan Africa long before Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov made his four-country Africa tour to woo African allies in the face of Russia’s international isolation. And I know firsthand that U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations Linda Thomas-Greenfield’s trip to Ghana to thank the nation for its support at the U.N. Security Council to condemn Russian aggression in Ukraine was disconnected from the Kremlin’s opportunistic appeal.\n\n\n\nWhile the Biden Africa strategy comes in the wake of Russian aggression, not to mention the decades of corrupt and coercive economic exploitation by China, it is not driven by it; rather, it is a thoughtful plan, delivered by an administration whose senior leadership clearly cares about the continent and recognizes its centrality to America’s national security.\n\n\n\nI give the Biden administration credit for showing up in Africa at a time when Washington is consumed with the crisis in Ukraine and for setting the second U.S. Africa Leader’s Summit, to be held in December in Washington, D.C., which will be a demonstrable commitment of the United States to the continent.\n\n\n\nI applaud the administration for recognizing that African economies have suffered disproportionately from the COVID-19 pandemic and the breakdown in global supply chains; for accepting that the goals of COP26 must allow for a just energy transition. and for citing  Afrobarometer data affirming that Africans believe democracy is preferable to all other forms of government.\n\n\n\nAnd finally, well-done for the programmatic interventions, including the G7 Partnership for Global Infrastructure and Investment (PGII), the reboot of Prosper Africa, Power Africa 2.0, the expansion  of Feed the Future, a soon-to-be-announced initiative for digital transformation, and the implementation of the recent Global Fragility Act.\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, however well-intentioned, the plan is constrained by a lack of dedicated budget and largely characterized by marginal policy shifts when every global and demographic trend — from migration to climate change, to pandemic preparedness and population growth — demands a strategic pivot with fully-funded interventions. In short, we need a PEPFAR for our time.\n\n\n\nPEPFAR, the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, was established in 2003 under the George W. Bush administration to respond to the global HIV/AIDs crisis. PEPFAR has since been funded by ten U.S. Congresses and implemented by four presidential administrations, saving an estimated 21 million lives, supporting countries to achieve HIV epidemic control, and most recently, providing the backbone infrastructure for the COVID-19 pandemic response. \n\n\n\nThe much anticipated PGII — the re-branded White House “Build Back Better World” program — could have been a PEPFAR-like moment for the Biden administration to help close the multi-trillion dollar infrastructure gap in the developing world and provide an alternative to Chinese-backed predatory lending. But the $600 billion goal set over five years, of which the U.S. has made a commitment of one third, is an unfunded mandate built on a promise to leverage private sector funding, without offering any new financing vehicles, besides the newly constituted International Development Finance Corporation. \n\n\n\nClosing the infrastructure gap will be essential to the success of the African Continental Free Trade Agreement, which represents the clearest path yet to the economic empowerment of the continent. The AfCTA will create the largest free trade area in the world, connecting 1.3 billion people across 55 countries with a combined gross domestic product valued at $3.4 trillion. It has the potential to lift 30 million people out of extreme poverty. The AfCTA will require regulation, standardization, improved governance, innovation, and encourage cross-border competition.\n\n\n\nAfrica’s population is growing faster than jobs are being created, and whether the trend continues or can be reversed will determine if the continent realizes prosperity or instability in the coming decades. U.S. national security, not to mention the health of our planet, is at stake — and we need to rise to the moment.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. and the G-7 need to take the PGII back to their budgetary drawing boards and bring in the multilateral and bilateral lending agencies to think crisis prevention, on the scale of Ukraine. You can’t trade on a landmass of more than 30 million square kilometers — enough to cover the U.S., China, India, Japan, Mexico and much of Europe combined — if you can’t connect people, goods and services — and that means roads, waterways, bridges, airports, energy, and digitization. \n\n\n\nSecondly, the Biden administration needs to articulate an ambitious, forwarding-thinking Africa trade policy and press it to Congress. The African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA), which has been the centerpiece of US-Africa economic engagement for the last two decades, is nearing the end of its authorization. It provides eligible sub-Saharan African countries with duty-free access to the U.S. market for over 1,800 products. This is in addition to the more than 5,000 other products that are eligible for duty-free access under the Generalized System of Preferences program.\n\n\n\nWhat is the administration’s plan to assure continuity of investment, to address market disparities, to distinguish between fragile states and those approaching a near middle income, and to provide a bridge to Africa’s anchor economies?\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the promise of a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Kenya and the United States, one which would have served as a model for Africa, was not fulfilled. Instead, we have the U.S. Kenya Trade and Investment Partnership, a non-binding framework agreement, much to the disappointment of the Kenyans.\n\n\n\nNo vague promises of future billions will offer a true alternative to China's largesse, much less power the AfCTA’s ambition to lift 30 million from poverty through trade and investment.\n\n\n\nAnd no U.S. emergency humanitarian assistance program, however generous, will fill the void of a bold U.S. trade agenda and its potential to drive private sector-led growth in Africa and at home.\n\n\n\nAs for me, I’m not discouraged — at least not yet. The Africa Leaders’ Summit is four months away. There’s still time.\n\n\n\nK.

        "description": "Moderna said Friday it is suing Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, alleging patent infringement over the COVID-19 vaccine. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe move sets up a showdown between two major vaccine makers that together have helped blunt the impacts of the pandemic in the United States and other countries. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"We believe that Pfizer and BioNTech unlawfully copied Moderna's inventions, and they have continued to use them without permission,\" Moderna Chief Legal Officer Shannon Thyme Klinger said in a statement. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nModerna is seeking compensation from Pfizer for the use of technology that Moderna says it pioneered.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe move also marks that Moderna views the pandemic as being in a different phase. The company said that it previously pledged not to enforce it patents while the pandemic continued. But, it said, “in March 2022, when the collective fight against COVID-19 entered a new phase and vaccine supply was no longer a barrier to access in many parts of the world, Moderna updated its pledge.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt now says that while it will not enforce its patents in 92 low and middle-income countries, it will in other parts of the world. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We have not been served and are unable to comment at this time,” Pfizer’s media relations department wrote in an email. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nModerna said that Pfizer infringed on work on its mRNA vaccine technology dating back as early as 2010, well before the pandemic began. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This foundational platform, which we began building in 2010, along with our patented work on coronaviruses in 2015 and 2016, enabled us to produce a safe and highly effective COVID-19 vaccine in record time after the pandemic struck,” Moderna CEO Stéphane Bancel said in a statement. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nModerna said it is seeking compensation but not to block the use of the Pfizer vaccine. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Recognizing the need to ensure continued access to these lifesaving vaccines, Moderna is not seeking to remove [the Pfizer vaccine] from the market and is not asking for an injunction to prevent its future sale,” Moderna said. &nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3616623-consumer-prices-fell-incomes-rose-in-july/",
        "description": "Consumer prices fell in July and wages rose even when adjusting for inflation, according to data released Friday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.\n\n\n\nThe personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index — the Federal Reserve’s preferred gauge of inflation — fell 0.1 percent in July and rose just 0.1 percent when stripping out food and energy prices.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe PCE index was up 6.3 percent in July from the same month one year ago, down sharply from the 6.8 percent annual inflation rate in June. Annual inflation without food and energy prices, also known as core inflation, fell from 4.8 percent in June to 4.6 percent in July.\n\n\n\n\"U.S. consumers received a welcome reprieve from the sting of inflation in July, as gas prices dropped significantly. But at over 6%, inflation still remains much too high to provide any lasting comfort,\" said Scott Brave, consumer spending economist at Morning Consult, in a Friday analysis.\n\n\n\nMuch of the July dip in inflation came from a steep decline in gasoline prices, reversing a staggering June spike in oil prices that pushed the average cost of a gallon of gasoline above $5 in the previous month. Prices for energy-related goods and services fell 4.8 percent in July after rising 7.5 percent in June, according to the PCE index.\n\n\n\nWhile prices for most goods ticked downward in July, food prices continued to climb with a 1.3 percent increase last month. Prices for food were almost 12 percent higher in July than in the same month in 2021.\n\n\n\nEven so, the broader dip in consumer prices helped incomes rise 0.2 percent on the month. Disposable income adjusted for inflation also rose 0.3 percent after falling 0.2 percent in June, which BEA pinned primarily on wages rising faster than inflation last month.\n\n\n\nEasing inflation would be a major boost to the Federal Reserve's efforts to bring down price increases without stoking a recession. Top Fed officials have pledged to keep raising interest rates high enough to ensure inflation comes back down toward their 2 percent annual target, even if it means pushing unemployment higher.\n\n\n\nIf inflation continues to fall, the Fed may be able to pause its planned series of interest rates hikes soon enough to preserve a strong job market and resilient consumer spending. The bank has already raised its baseline interest rate range to 2.25 to 2.5 percent and Fed officials expect to raise it by at least 1 percentage point before the end of the year.\n\n\n\n\"The weaker July inflation data plus signs of further healing of supply chains should take some pressure off the Fed in coming months,” writes Ayers. “At least a 50 basis point increase in the Fed funds rate is still expected in September, but rate increases are likely to be more modest (or even pause) later this year,\" wrote Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide, in a Friday analysis.\n\n\n\nThe inflation dip is also welcome news for President Biden and Democrats, who are seeking to retain control of Congress amid the highest annual price growth in more than four decades. \n\n\n\n\"We have more work to do. We have to help families who have been squeezed by decades living paycheck to paycheck. But today confirms that our economic plan is building the economy from the bottom up and the middle out and we are making progress,\" Biden said in a Friday statement.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 10:02 a.m.",

        "description": "Former President Trump has been receiving legal advice related to his retention of presidential records&nbsp;from the head of Judicial Watch, a conservative legal activist group, CNN reported Friday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump began taking calls from Tom Fitton, the president of the group, soon after the National Archives confirmed it obtained 15 boxes of records from Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property earlier this year. \n\n\n\nThe Archives reportedly asked the Justice Department (DOJ) to investigate after it received the boxes, some of which contained classified information. \n\n\n\nFitton told Trump that providing the boxes to the Archives was a mistake and the records belonged to Trump, three sources familiar with the matter told CNN.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFitton said Trump should not provide any additional records if the Archives came back for more. He reportedly cited a 2012 case that Judicial Watch was involved in that he said gave Trump the authority to do what he wanted with records from his time in the White House.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne source told CNN that Trump requested Fitton brief his attorneys on the legal argument.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump has repeatedly maintained that he has fully cooperating with investigators seeking to reclaim the records. But Fitton increasingly began convincing him that he should have control over the records he possessed, according to CNN.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to representatives for Trump and Fitton for comment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe report comes as an affidavit that the FBI used to establish probable cause that a crime was being committed is set to be publicly revealed Friday. A federal judge ruled that the DOJ must release a redacted version of the affidavit by noon.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe DOJ had argued that the affidavit’s full release could compromise its investigation.",

        "description": "Artist’s childhood bedroom painting destined to become ‘art world commodity’ with auction next monthKeith Haring painting cut from artist’s bedroom wall to be sold at auctionThe Radiant Baby, painted by Keith Haring on his childhood bedroom wall, has been ripped from its tender, intimate and original context to become an art world commodity. Dead and gone, he doesn’t even have a say in what becomes of such a personal creation. This brutal intrusion captures the sadness of a genius cut short. If there had been no Aids, Haring would be in his early 60s now and, I suspect, an even greater, possibly very different, artist than the youthful icon we celebrate.There is an abundant energy and intelligence to Haring’s drawings and paintings of identical gyrating human figures, pop-eyed monsters and cartoon animals that’s not only miles ahead of most street art, but has the fluidity and curiosity of an artist who would have continued to grow. It is tragic that we must freeze Haring in time, rip his baby off the wall or call his style “iconic” when it was in reality a fast-moving talent’s unfinished symphony. Continue reading...",

And they all have my phone numbers. They don’t go through staff; they talk to me directly. I’ll probably get ten, 12 calls a day from members on an average day, maybe more.&#8221;",

        "description": "Enlarge / The 2021 16-inch MacBook Pro. (credit: Samuel Axon)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, Apple expanded its self-service repair program to M1-based MacBooks. Giving customers repair manuals and the ability to buy parts and buy or rent tools for M1 MacBook Airs and M1 MacBook Pros is a far cry from the Apple of yesteryear. After a few days of availability, the MacBook self-repair program shows welcome progress, but work is still needed before Apple is considered a true right-to-repair ally.\nThe past few days have seen numerous right-to-repair activists critique Apple's MacBook self-repair program. Perhaps most notable is a strongly worded blog from iFixit, which said the program \"manages to make MacBooks seem less repairable.\" While iFixit found the MacBook Air repair manual to be \"in-depth, mostly logical, and well worth an additional repairability point,\" it was less impressed with the MacBook Pro repair manuals.\niFixit focused heavily on Apple's approach to MacBook Pro battery replacements, citing the natural degradation of lithium batteries. Apple's 13, 14, and 16-inch 2021 MacBook Pro self-repair manuals say that to replace the battery, you need to remove far more than just the battery. The manuals instruct users to remove the entire top case, bottom case, battery management unit, flex cable, lid angle sensor, the trackpad and its flex cable, the vent/antenna module, the logic board, display hinge covers, the display, the laptop's audio board, fans, the MagSafe 3 board, as well as the USB-C boards and Touch ID board.Read 29 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Good news for the gluten-intolerant: GF beer is now actually palatable, though it pays to shop aroundWhen my beer-loving pal Rick told me a couple of years ago that he could now drink only gluten-free varieties, I felt sorry for him, having to scour the shelves to find something remotely decent. Now, though, I no longer do, because there are so many well-made beers out there that are gluten-free, it’s often hard to tell them from those that are produced conventionally.Rick is not alone: 10% of UK consumers now follow a gluten-free diet, according to Coeliac UK, and they suffer from symptoms that range from a snuffly nose to potentially life-threatening damage to the gut lining that prevents the body from absorbing key nutrients.

But both agree that even politicians have a right to a private life – and that includes Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin.A leaked video and images of Marin having fun with friends have generated huge controversy, with her detractors saying it is indecorous for the leader of a country.

        "description": "Moderna sued Pfizer and BioNTech in U.S. and German courts Friday, accusing the vaccine competitors of copying its messenger RNA technology that was the novel basis for Covid vaccines. The company said it's not seeking to have the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine removed from the market nor is it seeking an injunction preventing future sales, so the lawsuit will not affect the expected rollout of reformulated boosters in September. But Moderna said it is seeking damages for revenue Pfizer and BioNTech made from U.S. sales as of March 8, when it updated its pledge not to enforce any patents pertaining to Covid during the pandemic, and from the domestic manufacture of doses for other countries outside the Covax bloc. Moderna alleges that Pfizer infringed on two key components of its patented mRNA technology platform: the mRNA chemical modification first developed by Moderna scientists and encoding the full spike protein into the vaccine, a design Moderna says was based on its earlier coronavirus research. The lawsuit is based on three patents Moderna filed between 2011 and 2016, long before the company partnered with the National Institutes of Health to test and develop its Covid vaccine. \"We believe that Pfizer and BioNTech unlawfully copied Moderna's inventions, and they have continued to use them without permission,\" said Moderna Chief Legal Officer Shannon Thyme Klinger. Outside of 92 low- and middle-income countries that could obtain Covid vaccines through the Covax program, “Moderna expects Pfizer and BioNTech to compensate Moderna for Comirnaty®'s ongoing use of Moderna's patented technologies.” The three companies have dominated the Covid-19 vaccine market over the course of the pandemic. They secured emergency use authorizations from the FDA within a week of each other in December 2020, though Pfizer and BioNTech were first. Both vaccines boasted efficacy rates north of 90 percent against the original coronavirus strain. The FDA first issued a license to Pfizer and BioNTech for their Covid vaccine, marketed as Comirnaty, for individuals 16 and older in August 2021. The agency approved Moderna's vaccine, dubbed Spikevax, for adults on Jan. 31. Moderna “made clear that while it would never enforce its patents for any COVID-19 vaccine used in the 92 low- and middle-income countries in the GAVI COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC 92), Moderna expected companies such as Pfizer and BioNTech to respect its intellectual property rights and would consider a commercially reasonable license should they request one for other markets,” the company said in a statement. “Pfizer and BioNTech have failed to do so.” Pfizer projects it'll make $32 billion in revenue from its Covid vaccine in 2022 and many tens of billions more from unrelated products. Meanwhile, Moderna made nearly $11 billion in revenue in the first half of 2022 and is projected to make another $21 billion in sales from advance purchase agreements delivered this year, but Spikevax is the company's only approved product.  “Pfizer/BioNTech has not yet fully reviewed the complaint but we are surprised by the litigation given the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer,\" Pfizer spokesperson Sharon Castillo said. \"We remain confident in our intellectual property supporting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and will vigorously defend against the allegations of the lawsuit.”  Moderna filed its suit in U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts. The suit follows German mRNA vaccine developer CureVac, which in July filed a lawsuit against BioNTech for alleged patent infringement related to the manufacture and sale of Comirnaty.

        "description": "Inflation eased last month as energy prices tumbled, raising hopes that a surge in prices increases may have peaked. According to Commerce Department report Friday that is closely watched by the Federal Reserve, consumer prices rose 6.3% in July from a year earlier after posting an annual increase of 6.8% in June, biggest jump since 1982. Energy prices made the difference in July: They dropped last month after surging in June. So-called core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, rose 4.6% last month from a year earlier after rising 4.8% in June. The drop — along with a reduction in the Labor Department’s consumer price index last month — suggests that inflationary pressures may be starting to ease. On a monthly basis, consumer prices actually fell 0.1% from June to July; core inflation blipped up 0.1%, the Commerce Department reported. Inflation started rising sharply in the spring of 2021 as the economy rebounded with surprising speed from the short but devastating coronavirus recession a year earlier. Surging customer orders overwhelmed factories, ports and freightyards, leading to delays, shortages and higher prices. Inflation is a worldwide problem, especially since the Russian invasion of Ukraine drove up global food and energy prices.   In the United States, the Commerce Department’s personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index is less well known than the Labor Department’s consumer price index (CPI). But the Fed prefers the PCE index as a gauge of inflationary pressures, partly because the Commerce index attempts to measure how consumers adjust to rising prices by, for example, substituting cheaper store brands for pricier name brands. CPI has been showing higher inflation than PCE; Last month, for instance, CPI was running at an 8.5% annual pace after hitting a four-decade high 9.1% in June. One reason: The Labor Department’s index gives more weight to rents, which have soared this year. The Commerce Department also reported Friday that Americans’ after-tax personal income rose 0.3% from June to July after adjusting for inflation; it has fallen in June. Consumer spending rose 0.2% last month after accounting for higher prices. The Fed was slow to respond to rising inflation, thinking it the temporary result of supply chain bottlenecks. But as prices continued to climb, the U.S. central bank moved aggressively, hiking its benchmark interest rate four times since March.",

        "description": "Researchers have assembled the most complete story yet of the ancestry of manatees, which have over their long history lived along the coasts of every continent but Antarctica.\nZoologists refer to manatees and dugongs as &#8220;sea cows&#8221; but a simple internet search might return the more playful moniker &#8220;floaty potatoes.&#8221; Now, imagine a 24,000-pound version, twice the size of an elephant, swimming in the Bering Sea.\nWhile only four species of the round, slow-moving aquatic herbivores of the order Sirenia remain on Earth—and all are considered vulnerable to extinction—fossil evidence suggests that many different kinds of sea cows lived in the past, and at times numerous species coexisted.\nThe new paper is published in PeerJ.\n&#8220;The earliest known fossil sea cows are about 47 million years old, and those animals lived along the coasts of northern Africa in the proto-Mediterranean Sea,&#8221; says coauthor Steven Heritage of the Museum of Natural History at the Duke University Lemur Center.\n&#8220;Our analysis found that this first appearance was about 11 million years after the sea cow lineage diverged from their closest living relatives, the elephants.&#8221;\nThe earliest fossil ancestors of elephants are also from northern Africa and lived during the early Cenozoic, the era that followed the extinction of the dinosaurs. While modern manatees and dugongs have no hind limbs and are strictly aquatic, the oldest known fossil sea cows had four limbs and could walk on land.\nSteven Heritage holds the 33-million-year-old fossil mandible of an extinct sea cow which is related to modern manatees. (Credit: Catherine Riddle)\nThe study assembled the largest-yet dataset of living and fossil species, combining genetics, anatomy, geography, and geologic ages. The team&#8217;s analyses included time-scaled statistical models for the ancestry of sea cows and models of historical biogeography that identify the ages and directions of their migrations across Earth&#8217;s oceans.\n&#8220;Our models suggest that the direct ancestors of manatees evolved within continental South America and the migration of manatees into the Caribbean and towards the coasts of North America was a relatively recent event, says Erik Seiffert of the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California, who is also a research affiliate of the Duke Lemur Center and coauthor of the paper. &#8220;In a sense, manatees are newcomers to these West Atlantic ecosystems.&#8221;\nFor much of the past 20 million years, fresh water wetlands covered a large portion of northern South America. These eventually gave rise to the Amazon River system with drainage into the South Atlantic Ocean beginning only a few million years ago. Manatees from that vast marshland seem to have made their way out of South America after that time.\nAround 34 million years ago, a key trans-Atlantic migration from the Eastern Hemisphere towards southern North America and the Caribbean gave rise to the common ancestor of the living sea cow species.\nThe age of that migration corresponds to the Eocene-Oligocene boundary, which was a time of plummeting global sea levels, a rapidly cooling climate, and widespread and severe extinctions of numerous animal species both on land and in the sea.\nAfter that time, the ancestral sea cows of the Eastern Hemisphere faced a steep decline and eventually disappeared. But the Western Hemisphere lineage that was established near the beginning of the Oligocene gave rise to many species of sea cows that flourished and persisted for tens of millions of years, sometimes living in communities of multiple species.\nThe analysis also found that at least three Caribbean sea cow lineages migrated into the Pacific Ocean during the Miocene epoch, between 23 and 5 million years ago, before Central and South America were connected.\nOne descendant of those Pacific migrations was the gigantic Steller&#8217;s sea cow, a cold-adapted species that measured up to 33 feet. European naturalists who explored the islands of the Bering Sea during the mid-1700s observed living Steller&#8217;s sea cows, but the species was hunted to extinction shortly thereafter.\nThe researchers say the highest diversity of sea cow lineages occurred around 22 and 16 million years ago. But over the past 9 million years, the number of lineages has dropped precipitously resulting in the few species that remain today.\nSource: Duke University\nThe post Manatee history includes giant 12-ton sea cow appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "The Biden administration will meet with state and local officials on Friday about protecting and expanding access to abortion, as the White House marks an official abortion \"day of action\" on Women's Equality Day.\n\n\n\nIn addition, the Department of Health and Human Services is sending a letter to governors inviting them to design and apply for Medicaid waivers to provide increased access to care for women traveling from a state that has restricted or prohibited abortion.\n\n\n\nThe developments do not represent any new policy announcements, however. The letter builds off an executive order President Biden signed earlier this month, when he directed HHS to find a way to use Medicaid to pay the expenses for those who cross state lines to seek abortions.\n\n\n\nThe White House has been under pressure from abortion rights advocates to act more aggressively to protect abortion rights in the wake of the Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Biden will be meeting with leaders including Baltimore Mayor Brandon Scott (D); Durham, N.C. Mayor Elaine M. O’Neal (D);&nbsp; Delaware’s chief deputy attorney general Alexander S. Mackler; and Lina Hidalgo, the County Judge of Harris County, Texas.\n\n\n\n\"Often these leaders are on the front lines of protecting reproductive rights, helping their communities navigate the growing challenges surrounding access to reproductive health care, including abortion,\" a senior administration told reporters on Thursday. \"We're really looking forward to engaging them in a conversation on how states can protect access to care and how we can support their efforts at the federal level.\"\n\n\n\nAside from Medicaid funding, the letter to governors will reinforce the administration's recent guidance making clear that medical providers are required to perform an abortion if there is a medical emergency. \n\n\n\nThe letter will “underscore to our governors that state antiabortion laws don’t negate providers’ responsibilities in these states to comply with federal laws that protect access to emergency health care,” a senior administration official said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House last month updated guidance about the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), a law that the administration said requires providers to offer medically stabilizing treatment in an emergency, even if that care is an abortion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA federal judge in Texas on Tuesday night blocked the guidance, but on Wednesday a federal judge in Idaho ruled in favor of the administration, which had sued over the state's \"trigger\" law that criminalizes all abortion, even if it's done to protect a woman's health. The Justice Department argued Idaho's law was a violation of EMTALA, and state law did not supersede federal law.\n\n\n\nThe ongoing legal battles come as a patchwork of state abortion laws have emerged as a result of the Supreme Court’s toppling of Roe, which for nearly a half-century recognized a constitutional right to abortion up to the point of fetal viability.",

        "description": "Elizabeth Spiers: &#8220;All memoirs are self-serving — it’s just a matter of degree. But Jared Kushner’s memoir, Breaking History, is, at its core, an extended news release that exists primarily to exculpate its author after his role in one of the most destructive presidential administrations of my lifetime. Any reader who’s inclined to plow through the more than 450 pages of often tedious and repetitive claims will, however, get a very good sense of what Kushner is really like — what he sounds like, how he views his interactions with others and what his values are.&#8221;\n&#8220;I know this because I worked for him in 2011 and 2012, when I was the editor in chief of the New York Observer, a prestigious newspaper Kushner bought in 2006 at the age of 25. At the time, he was ostensibly a Democrat, and Donald Trump was pretending to fire people on national television&#8230;&#8221;\n&#8220;What Kushner’s book really is, however, is a portrait of a man whose moral compass has been demagnetized.&#8221;",

But both agree that even politicians have a right to a private life – and that includes Finland’s prime minister, Sanna Marin.A leaked video and images of Marin having fun with friends have generated huge controversy, with her detractors saying it is indecorous for the leader of a country.

        "description": "Israel and Turkey recently announced that, once again, they would upgrade their relations to full diplomatic status. The relationship between the two countries has never been particularly stable, but it reached a nadir after the 2010 Mavi Marmara incident in which an Israeli naval commando assault on the Turkish-operated ship seeking to enter Gaza led to the death of 10 Turkish citizens, with many more injured. Turkey broke off diplomatic relations but restored them in 2016; it broke them off again two years later.\n\n\n\nHow long the current restoration will last is anyone’s guess.\n\n\n\nIn any event, the current thaw in Turkish-Israeli relations in no way indicates that tranquility is coming to the Eastern Mediterranean. To begin with, Turkey’s foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, made clear than even with the restoration of full relations, Turkey will continue to maintain its strong support for the Palestinians, including Hamas, Israel’s bitter enemy.\n\n\n\nFor its part, Israel announced the sale of its Iron Dome air defense system to Cyprus, with which, together with Greece, it plans to complete an underwater power cable called the Euro-Asia Interconnector by 2024. In addition, those three countries concluded an agreement to construct an eastern Mediterranean gas pipeline to Europe beginning in 2025.\n\n\n\nOn the other hand, Turkey has always been hostile to these tripartite arrangements, and its claims to eastern Mediterranean gas fields conflict with those of Nicosia. Moreover, Turkey continues to station troops in northern Cyprus, to whose government it alone grants diplomatic recognition. One can only conclude that the one likely target for Cyprus’s Iron Dome missiles would be Turkish military aircraft.\n\n\n\nRising tensions with Greece\n\n\n\nTensions once again are rising between Greece, Israel’s other close partner, and Turkey. Greece has accused Turkey of some 70 violations of its air space. Earlier this week, Turkey accused Greece of interfering with its aircraft during a NATO exercise; Athens, of course, denied Ankara’s claim, asserting that the Turks had entered Greek airspace without prior notification.\n\n\n\nThere also are reports that Ankara and Jerusalem are discussing the opening of a second gas pipeline from Israel’s Leviathan field through Turkey and into southern Europe as an offset to Russian gas supplies. That pipeline would, of course, compete with Israel’s partnership with Greece and Cyprus. Not surprisingly, especially given the uncertainty of future Turkish-Israeli relations, some in Israel oppose any such arrangement.\n\n\n\nWashington has supported Israel’s warming ties with Turkey, but the Biden administration appears to be withdrawing initial American support for the Israeli-Greek-Cypriot pipeline, preferring “greener” alternatives. That opposition has remained sotto voce and has not deterred Jerusalem or its partners from moving ahead — but Washington’s relationship with Jerusalem may well hit a serious downturn if, as seems increasingly likely, it reaches an understanding with Iran to renew the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) nuclear accord.\n\n\n\nNuclear bombs and money for mischief\n\n\n\nThe JCPOA talks are accelerating, thanks to Tehran’s decision to back away from two of its three major demands — namely, that its Revolutionary Guard Corps be removed from America’s terrorist list and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) terminate its investigation of traces of nuclear material found at two sites in 2019.\n\n\n\nThe Iranian mullahs may have concluded that by “conceding” on two demands they knew could never be met, they would obtain American agreement to ensure a future president will not abrogate the deal, as then-President Donald Trump previously had done. Even if it cannot obtain that concession, Iran may push for speedy relief from American and European sanctions that have throttled its economy.\n\n\n\nFor its part, the Biden team remains eager to close the deal; many of its leaders, including the president, played a part in achieving the original agreement, which was a source of pride for the Obama administration.\n\n\n\nIt is the sanctions relief, as much as an Iranian nuclear bomb, that worries Israel and its Arab Gulf partners. The sunset provisions that were in the 2015 deal will begin to go into force next year: The European Union will terminate all remaining nuclear sanctions, and Washington not only will remove some Iranian entities from the sanctions list but will seek legislative termination of other sanctions; Iran may want even quicker action on sanctions relief.\n\n\n\nRisks for Israel and U.S.\n\n\n\nIn any event, in 2025, on what has been called “Termination Day,” the United nations will close its Iran file. Tehran then will be able to pursue its weapons program without restriction while, in the meantime, it will have been the recipient of billions of dollars in both frozen assets and petroleum sales. And those funds will enable Iran to increase its financial support for Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis and other militias seeking to destroy Israel, to undermine Gulf governments and, more generally, to disrupt a region that Washington hopes would demand less of its attention, resources and military personnel.\n\n\n\nIsrael may well decide to strike Iranian nuclear facilities, which could in turn result in a new major Middle Eastern war. Even if Israel elects to refrain from attacking Iran, preferring to continue its clandestine war against the mullahs, it might find itself in yet another war with Hezbollah. Bolstered by a fresh increment of Iranian encouragement and financial support, the Lebanese militant group may choose to unleash a major attack on Israeli cities.\n\n\n\nWashington would then find itself dragged back into the Middle East, even as it must continue to attach higher priority to both the threat from China and Russian aggression against Ukraine.\n\n\n\nThe 2015 Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act requires the Biden administration to enable Congress to review any nuclear agreement with Iran, and administration officials have underscored their commitment to do so. Thus far, however, there has been little communication to Capitol Hill regarding the state of the negotiations.\n\n\n\nThe White House should act quickly to brief Congress and should proceed with extreme caution before it enters into any undertakings with Iran that could result in even more instability in the Eastern Mediterranean than already is the case.\n\n\n\nDov S.

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollowing the passage of President Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, the U.S. Department of Energy allotted over $500 million to research organizations across the country to study clean energy solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCase Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio and Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, are among the universities receiving funds.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe announcement was met with a positive response from several lawmakers across the country. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe United States Department of Energy (DOE) announced Thursday it will grant 54 universities and 11 national labs over $500 million to conduct research on clean energy technologies and low-carbon manufacturing, ranging from direct air capture to carbon storage and sequestration. \n\n\n\nThe move comes on the heels of the passage of President Biden’s historic Inflation Reduction Act, which aims to significantly cut emissions by 2030. By 2050, Biden hopes to have a net-zero emissions economy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe new funds allotted by the DOE will be spread across institutions in 34 states and Washington D.C.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Meeting the Biden-Harris Administration’s ambitious climate and clean energy goals will require a game-changing commitment to clean energy — and that begins with researchers across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Jennifer M. Granholm in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNew research projects “will strengthen the scientific foundations needed for the United States to maintain world leadership in clean energy innovation, from renewable power to carbon management,” Granholm added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCarbon dioxide emissions resulting from fossil fuel use are a significant driver of climate change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUniversities receiving the federal funds include the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia, Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio; and Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, among others.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I’m excited to see this nearly $1.5 million award heading to Dartmouth to invest in cutting-edge scientific research around commercial solar technologies,” said U.S. Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire in a statement.\n\n\n\n“This research will help position the U.S. to transition to a clean energy economy and net zero carbon emissions. Time is of the essence to combat the climate crisis, and New Hampshire continues to lead in innovative clean technologies and solutions.”\n\n\n\nNational Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden, Colorado and Ames National Laboratory in Ames, Iowa are among the federal laboratories also receiving funds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA large portion of the money, $400 million, will go towards establishing and maintaining 43 Energy Frontier Research Centers, while these projects will study multiple topics including energy storage and quantum information science.\n\n\n\nFunding for some teams will also be directed towards advancing the Department’s Energy Earthshots Initiatives which focus on solar nuclear energy technologies, energy storage and carbon capture.\n\n\n\nProjects selected to receive the funds were decided on through a competitive peer review process.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3616666-epa-proposes-to-designate-two-forever-chemicals-as-hazardous-aiming-to-bolster-clean-up/",
        "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to designate two types of “forever chemicals” as hazardous substances, aiming to expand both cleanup and accountability for this pollution. \n\n\n\n“Forever chemicals,” also called PFAS, have been linked to illnesses including kidney and testicular cancer and thyroid disease. They’re also notorious for lingering for decades in the environment and human body instead of breaking down over time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPFAS contamination has become widespread across the U.S. as it has been discharged over the years by both industrial facilities and military bases, the latter of which used it in firefighting foam. The compounds can be found in a number of household products including nonstick pans, cosmetics and waterproof apparel.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe new proposal from the Biden administration seeks to help impacted communities clean up this waste. If it’s finalized, declaring these substances as “hazardous” under the Superfund law is expected to both speed up the cleanup process and hold polluters responsible.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMelanie Benesh, Vice President for Government Affairs at the Environmental Working Group, said that the proposal would “jumpstart the cleanup process at a lot of contaminated sites and help the EPA hold polluters accountable for the mess that they have been making over decades.”\n\n\n\nThe hazardous substance designation would allow the EPA to put either the military or private company that contaminated a given area with these substances on the hook to clean it up, and, if they refuse to do so, would give the EPA the power to recoup the costs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Both private parties and [the] Department of Defense will really be incentivized to move out on cleanup when they’re responsible for this now that this designation is going to take place,” said Betsy Southerland, former director of the Office of Science and Technology in the EPA’s Office of Water.\n\n\n\n“The whole idea behind a hazardous substance is that it can pose imminent and substantial endangerment so you really have to move out on it. And if you don’t, if you refuse to, EPA can do it and then sock you with a really big clean up bill,” she added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe designation would also require the reporting of releases of the substances, which is expected to give communities information on where these chemicals are being discharged. \n\n\n\nWhile there are thousands of types of PFAS — an acronym that refers to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — the EPA’s proposal only addresses the two most notorious types, called PFOA and PFOS.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRecently, the agency said that these two substances are dangerous to drink, even in miniscule amounts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA chemical industry trade group pushed back on the EPA’s latest proposal, arguing that it would impose significant costs on businesses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The lack of uniform cleanup standards creates substantial uncertainty….affecting federal, state and municipal governments, and other parties such as local fire departments, water utilities, small businesses, airports and farmers,” the American Chemistry Council said in a statement to The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“A proposed [hazardous substance] designation would impose tremendous costs on these parties without defined cleanup standards, making it impossible for these entities to prepare for the impact of this rule,” the organization said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe American Chemistry Council also said that the Biden administration’s recent finding that PFOA and PFOS are unsafe at “near-zero” levels further complicates the issue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt said that taken together, these actions could “lead to an expectation that all contamination be cleaned up to non-detectable levels of the substances.”\n\n\n\nThe Trump administration previously considered designating these two types of PFAS as hazardous, but did not actually propose a rule to do so.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the Biden administration is also expected to set enforceable drinking water limits for the substances, but has not proposed these limits yet.",

When damsons are at their absolute prime, though, I love baking with them. The crumble topping here needs to be baked in advance to give a nice crunch to the final cake. And, because the baking time is short, doing this ahead means it bakes with the cake, rather than sitting on top turning pale. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Major League Baseball and the Major League Baseball Players Association announced Friday morning that Major League players will travel to South Korea in November for a four-game exhibition series involving players from the Korea Baseball Organization. The &#8220;2022 Korea Series&#8221; will run from November 9-16 and feature two-game sets at Busan&#8217;s Sajik Baseball Stadium (home to the KBO&#8217;s Lotte Giants) and at Seoul&#8217;s Gocheok Sky Dome (home to the KBO&#8217;s Kiwoom Heroes). The four-game series is both a part of MLB&#8217;s new &#8220;MLB World Tour&#8221; initiative to expand the game&#8217;s global presence and a celebration of the 40th anniversary of the KBO.\n&#8220;Major League Baseball is excited to travel to Busan and Seoul for this historic series,&#8221; said MLB chief operations &amp; strategy offer Chris Marinak in a statement within this morning&#8217;s press release. &#8220;This tour is the next step of MLB’s plan to deliver regular baseball events in Korea in the coming years and follows our upcoming Home Run Derby X, scheduled for September 17th in Seoul. South Korea’s rich baseball tradition has produced many accomplished Major League players, including All-Stars Chan Ho Park and Shin-Soo Choo, as well as current Blue Jays pitcher Hyun Jin Ryu and Rays first baseman Ji-Man Choi.  We thank J-One and the KBO for partnering with us and the MLBPA on this great event.&#8221;\nAs MLB&#8217;s release further indicates, this will be the first time Major League players have traveled to play games in South Korea in a century, when a group including Casey Stengel, Waite Hoyt and Herb Pennock, among others, made the trip back in 1922.\nUnder the MLB World Tour, MLB and the MLBPA have agreed to host as many as 24 regular season games and 16 exhibition contests between Asia, Europe, Latin America and Mexico through 2026. The KBO&#8217;s news release (hat tip: Jee-ho Yoo of South Korea&#8217;s Yonhap News Agency) indicates that KBO commissioner Koo-youn Heo and MLB commissioner Rob Manfred also discussed back in June the eventual possibility of regular-season KBO games being played in the United States and of regular-season MLB games being played in South Korea.\nMLB and the MLBPA have yet to announce a slate of participants who&#8217;ll travel to South Korea for the event. The KBO release indicates that further details regarding schedule, matchups, ticket sales and participants on both the MLB and KBO side of the event will be announced at a September press conference.",

        "description": "Sechs Mikrofone, fünf Tasten für Mute von Mikro und Kamera, Laut/Leise und Teams\n\n\n\nSeit gestern teste ich das Logi Dock und ich will einmal vorausschicken, wie Logitech sich den Einsatz vorstellt:\n\n\n\nEin Kabel zwischen Dock und Laptop, alles andere am Dock angeschlossen\n\n\n\nDas Dock hat auf der Rückseite je zwei USB-A und USB-C, einen HDMI- und einen DP-Ports, an denen sämtliche Peripherie angeschlossen  wird, also etwa Bolt-Empfänger, BRIO-Kamera, Headset Dongle und Bildschirm. Ein 230 W kräftiges Power-Supply versorgt alles bis auf den Monitor mit Strom und der Laptop hängt an einem mitgelieferten USB-C Kabel. Dieser Anschluss ist farblich hervorgehoben, dazu gibt es einen weiteren USB-C-Port an der linken Seite. Auch für ein Kensington-Schloss gibt es eine Vorrichtung, sodass das Dock keine Beine bekommt. \n\n\n\n2x USB-A, 2x USB-C (+1), HDMI und DP, USB-C zum PC, Kensington Lock, Power und Bluetooth Pairing\n\n\n\nIm Dock eingebaut sind sechs &#8220;beam-forming&#8221; Mikrofone und ein kräftiger Lautsprecher. Die fünf Knöpfe schalten stumm (Mikro und Kamera), laut und leise, und der mittlere interagiert mit Microsoft Teams. Dazu gibt es eine Unterbodenbeleuchtung mit drei farbigen LEDs, die unterschiedliche Zustände signalisieren. Rundum ist das Dock mit einem Stoff überzogen und alles wirkt sehr wertig.\n\n\n\nIch habe einmal Vergleichsaufnahmen mit einem Lenovo X1 ThinkPad Yoga, einen Poly Sync 20 und dem Logi Dock gemacht, in denen man den unterschiedlichen Klang der eigenen Stimme gut nachvollziehen kann:\n\n\n\nLogi Dock\n\n\n\nLenovo ThinkPad X1 Yoga gen 7\n\n\n\nPoly Sync 20\n\n\n\nFreisprecheinrichtung mit Dock, das ist schon eine großartige Kombination, die ich bei mir allerdings nicht integriert bekomme. Ich habe bereits ein Dock und gehe von dort per USB-C zu meinem Bildschirm. Dort hängen dann Bolt-Empfänger, Headset-Dongle und Webcam dran, die stets mit dem richtigen PC oder iPad Pro verbunden sind. Vom Logi Dock geht es aber nicht weiter, da ein Monitor nur per HDMI oder DP angeschlossen werden kann. Versuchsweise habe ich auch mal das Logi Dock &#8220;hinter&#8221; den Monitor angeschlossen, aber das wollte nicht funktionieren. Darum habe ich für den Test einen eigenen Aufbau gewählt.\n\n\n\nDas Logi Dock bekommt also keinen Editor-Refuses-To-Give-It-Back Award, auch wenn es eigentlich sehr viel richtig macht. Andere würden es direkt unter den Monitor setzen und dann alle Kabel nach hinten vom Tisch führen. Bei mir sind das Kabel, die bereits hinter dem Monitor versteckt sind oder im Dock unter der Tisch-Oberfläche stecken.\n\n\n\nMit gefällt die Integration in Teams, der kräftige Lautsprecher und die Bedienung mit den fünf Tasten. Man braucht allerdings auch unbedingt LogiTune, um die Verbindung zu Meeting-Kalender herzustellen. Das sollte man vorher mit der eigenen IT abklären.",

        "description": "Elizabeth Spiers: &#8220;All memoirs are self-serving — it’s just a matter of degree. But Jared Kushner’s memoir, Breaking History, is, at its core, an extended news release that exists primarily to exculpate its author after his role in one of the most destructive presidential administrations of my lifetime. Any reader who’s inclined to plow through the more than 450 pages of often tedious and repetitive claims will, however, get a very good sense of what Kushner is really like — what he sounds like, how he views his interactions with others and what his values are.&#8221;\n&#8220;I know this because I worked for him in 2011 and 2012, when I was the editor in chief of the New York Observer, a prestigious newspaper Kushner bought in 2006 at the age of 25. At the time, he was ostensibly a Democrat, and Donald Trump was pretending to fire people on national television&#8230;&#8221;\n&#8220;What Kushner’s book really is, however, is a portrait of a man whose moral compass has been demagnetized.&#8221;",

In private conversations with White House staffers and allies in Congress this spring, he said he worried that voters who’d never gone to college could resent a move to cancel huge amounts of student debt, according to four Democratic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private talks. Biden also said that the federal government should not be bailing out Ivy League graduates, and that his children should not qualify for help,&#8221; the Washington Post reports.\nSaid one senior Democrat: &#8220;He was nervous about how it would play with working-class people.&#8221;\n&#8220;But a relentless campaign was pressing Biden to embrace dramatic action: There were private appeals aboard Air Force One, the courting of first lady Jill Biden, months of political and economic arguments from senior White House staffers, and warnings by Black lawmakers about the dangers of doing too little.

        "description": "Bacteria in the saliva of college students who reported recent thoughts of suicide differed in significant ways from those who had not had those thoughts, a new study shows.\n\nThe Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is available 24 hours a day by calling 988.\n\nWhile there is a growing body of research on mental health and the human microbiome, this is the first study to look at bacterial differences in the saliva of those with and without recent suicidal thoughts, also called suicidal ideation.\nResearchers defined recent suicidal ideation as thoughts of suicide within the two weeks before the saliva sample was taken.\nControlling for the influence of other factors known to affect mental health, such as diet and sleep, the researchers found that students with recent suicidal thoughts had higher levels of bacteria associated with periodontal disease and other inflammatory health conditions.\nThey also found that these students had lower levels of Alloprevotella rava, a bacterium known to produce a compound that promotes brain health. These students also shared a genetic variation that the researchers found may influence the presence of Alloprevotella rava in the mouth.\n&#8220;These results are exciting because they tell us which bacteria we need to look at more closely. Our question now is, what are these bacteria doing biologically that affects mental health?&#8221; says Angelica Ahrens, a postdoctoral researcher in the microbiology and cell science department at the University of Florida/Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, as well as first author of the paper in Scientific Reports.\n&#8220;Eventually, we hope this line of research could help predict suicidal ideation based on a person&#8217;s microbiome and could inform pro- or prebiotic treatments for those at risk,&#8221; says Ahrens.\nFor the study, researchers analyzed saliva collected from nearly 500 undergraduate students taking classes in the microbiology and cell science department. The students also completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, which is used to screen for depression symptoms and asks respondents to share if they have had thoughts of suicide within the last two weeks. Those who reported recent suicidal ideation were referred to on-campus mental health services.\n&#8220;Mental health and suicide are serious issues on college campuses, and our students were very interested in being a part of research that can help address this problem. We are continuing to collect data for follow-up studies and hope more students and universities will become involved,&#8221; says Eric Triplett, chair of the microbiology and cell science department, and senior author of the study.\nDepression and suicidal ideation are relatively common among college-aged adults: A 2020 study by the CDC found that up to a quarter of people between ages 18 to 24 had seriously thought about suicide within the last month.\nFor this initial study, students came to the lab to provide a saliva sample, but today participants can opt to send in their saliva sample by mail using a collection kit developed by the researchers.\n&#8220;This at-home method is very convenient for students and also helps us build a more diverse dataset and test different variables. For example, we would like to look at the saliva microbiome of people who have been diagnosed with depression and are taking antidepressants,&#8221; Ahrens says.\n&#8220;While various treatments and lifestyle changes can help, there is still much to be learned about how the human microbiome affects mental health and could be harnessed to improve it,&#8221; Ahrens says.\nThe Suicide and Crisis Lifeline is available 24 hours a day by calling 988.\nSource: University of Florida\nThe post Spit bacteria differs in college students with suicidal thoughts appeared first on Futurity.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3616729-chinas-property-market-is-on-the-brink-heres-what-it-means-for-investors/",
        "description": "One year ago, investors began to assess the implications of a possible default of China’s largest property developer, Evergrande. The company had $300 billion in debt outstanding, and China’s property market weakened as a result of measures the Chinese government took in 2021 to curb booming property prices.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt that time, Ed Yardeni raised the specter that an Evergrande meltdown could turn into China’s version of a “Lehman Moment.” But most economists downplayed the likelihood of global contagion, and U.S. investors shrugged it off.\n\n\n\nMy assessment then was the fallout from an Evergrande default would take longer to play out than the U.S. housing crisis in 2007-2008. The key consideration was that bank loans to China’s property developers are not marketable instruments, and workouts are subject to complex negotiations and regulatory oversight that can take years to settle. Evergrande, for example, recently missed its own deadline for restructuring its company by July 31.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, I maintained investors should pay attention to what was happening, because China’s property market is a dominant sector and an integral part of China’s remarkable economic transformation. Property represents more than two-thirds of household assets compared with about one-quarter for U.S households. Therefore, an unraveling of this sector could rival what happened in the U.S. during the housing bust.\n\n\n\nLast year, the spillover to other sectors was limited, because aggregate demand held up as China weathered the COVID-19 pandemic reasonably well. A Reuters survey of 10 analysts and economists showed they were still upbeat about property values and expected them to rise by 5 percent this year. Instead, prices have fallen for 11 consecutive months, and they appear headed for further declines.\n\n\n\nOne reason for the weakening in property prices is the Chinese government’s zero tolerance policy toward COVID, in which parts of the country have been shuttered in response to outbreaks. Economic activity was barely positive in the second quarter of this year, and investment firms, including Goldman Sachs and Nomura, have cut their forecasts of economic growth this year to 3 percent — well below the government’s target of 5.5 percent that it concedes is no longer feasible.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, problems are spreading because the process for buying apartments in China requires purchasers to make substantial down payments on complexes that are under construction. The slump in the economy has caused developers’ finances to deteriorate such that they are unable to complete many projects.  Some buyers, in turn, have responded by withholding payments on their mortgages, and demonstrations against property developers are becoming common. \n\n\n\nAs a result, Chinese banks are being squeezed on two fronts. The asset side of their balance sheets is under pressure from bad loans to developers and those purchasing apartments. (Note: Loans that are property related account for about 30 percent of all bank loans.) At the same time, the liability side of some smaller banks has been impacted by runs from their depositors. \n\n\n\nTo bolster the sector, the Chinese authorities have lowered interest rates to make mortgage payments more affordable. They are also trying to shore up property developers by providing financial relief. The State Council recently passed a plan to establish a fund worth up to 300 billion yuan ($44 billion) to support multiple property groups. But these measures appear insufficient to stem the problem.\n\n\n\nThe outcome ultimately hinges on how Chinese households respond if property values continue to plummet. The main risk is that China would confront a loss of confidence by households at a time when business confidence is shaky due to the government’s clampdown on technology companies and other private businesses. This combination could result in a growth recession if not outright recession.\n\n\n\nProfessor Robert Z. Aliber, who co-authors Charles Kindleberger’s classic, “Manias, Panics and Crashes,” goes much further. He sees the unraveling of China’s property bubble as marking the end of the country’s economic miracle of the past four decades: “The Xi government may provide a burst of liquidity to paper over the insolvency of property developers, but it cannot paper over the demographics of a declining population and forty or sixty million vacant and overpriced apartments.”\n\n\n\nThis raises the issue of whether a meltdown of China’s property market could spill over to other parts of the world. The main reason for believing it will not spread is that foreign investor involvement in China’s property market and financial system is small. By comparison, European investors were heavily involved in mortgage-backed securities issued by U.S. institutions during the housing boom.\n\n\n\nThat said, given the prominence of China’s economy in the global economy and international trade, a weakening would have spill-over effects to China’s main trading partners in Asia, Europe and North America. According to calculations by JPMorgan Asset Management, China’s strong showing in the decade following the 2008-09 global financial crisis accounted for roughly 30 percent of world economic growth. Accordingly, if China’s economic locomotive were to stall it would likely reverberate throughout global markets.\n\n\n\nNicholas Sargen, Ph.D., is an international economist and global money manager who serves as a consultant to Fort Washington Investment Advisors and is affiliated with the University of Virginia’s Darden School of Business.

        "description": "President Biden on Friday marked the anniversary of the “heinous” terrorist attack amid the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that killed 13 American service members and dozens of civilians.\n\n\n\nBiden issued a statement in which he recognized each of the 13 American service members by name. They died in a suicide bombing outside the airport in Kabul last year in the thick of chaotic attempts to evacuate U.S. troops and civilians from Afghanistan.\n\n\n\n“They were beloved sons and daughters, brothers and sisters. They came from all across our land. Each carried with them the pride of their own unique story and the hopes of the loved ones who nurtured them,” Biden said in a statement.\n\n\n\n“But they were united by a common call—to serve something greater than themselves. They were heroes, working to save lives as part of the largest airlift evacuation operation in our history,” he continued. “The example of their bravery and selflessness will live forever as a testament to the very best of our American character.”\n\n\n\nThe attack, which was attributed to a branch of the terrorist group ISIS, killed Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Darin T. Hoover; Marine Corps Sgt. Johanny Rosario; Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee; Marine Corps Cpl. Hunter Lopez; Marine Corps Cpl. Daegan W. Page; Marine Corps Cpl. Humberto A. Sanchez; Marine Corps Lance Cpl. David L. Espinoza; Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Jared M. Schmitz; Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Rylee J. McCollum; Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Dylan R. Merola; Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Kareem M. Nikoui; Navy Petty Officer Third Class Maxton W. Soviak; and Army Staff Sgt. Ryan C. Knauss.\n\n\n\n“Today, I am praying for the families of those 13 fallen warriors, who lost a piece of their soul one year ago. Our nation can never repay such incredible sacrifice—but we will never fail to honor our sacred obligation to the families and survivors they left behind,” Biden said Friday.\n\n\n\n“I am also holding in my heart all those who lost their child, partner, parent, sibling, loved one, or battle buddy over our two decades of war in Afghanistan. 2,461 American troops made the ultimate sacrifice. 20,744 were wounded, so many whose lives are forever marked by their injuries. It is a painful reminder that there is nothing low-cost or low-grade about war for those we ask to fight for us.”\n\n\n\nBiden pointed to U.S. counterterrorism efforts in the year since he ordered troops out of Afghanistan. He specifically cited recent missions that killed the leader of ISIS in Syria and an al-Qaeda leader who was in Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nThe terrorist attack at Abbey Gate in Kabul a year ago is widely regarded as the low point of Biden’s first term by officials within the administration. It also served as a flashpoint for critics of his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan after roughly 20 years.\n\n\n\nBiden has insisted he does not regret the handling of the U.S. withdrawal, even as accounts have shown the administration appeared unprepared for the rapid collapse of the Afghan government and a chaotic effort to get civilians out of the country culminated with the terrorist bombing that killed 13 U.S. troops and more than 100 Afghans in the area.\n\n\n\nThe president has argued that remaining in Afghanistan would have cost more American lives and forced the U.S. to commit more forces to fight off the Taliban.&nbsp;",

        "description": "A golf course in New York City that former President Trump’s business manages will host a Saudi-backed women’s golf tournament in October, according to The New York Times.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Times reported that the tournament, which is part of the Aramco Team Series, will be held at Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point in the Bronx. A city official told the Times that Mayor Eric Adams’ (D) administration approved the venue hosting the event.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother official told the Times that the city could not “unreasonably withhold approval” for the event based on the city’s contract with the Trump Organization.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis will be the second golf tournament backed by the Saudi Arabian government to occur at a Trump-run golf club after Trump’s National Golf Club Bedminster hosted an event of the LIV Golf tournament last month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFamilies of the victims of 9/11 slammed Trump’s decision to host the event last month, pointing to his past remarks blaming Saudi Arabia for playing a role in the attacks.&nbsp;A majority of the hijackers on 9/11 were Saudi citizens, but the government has denied any knowledge or involvement in the attacks.\n\n\n\nThe Saudi government’s involvement in the golf league has been seen by some critics as an attempt on their part to overshadow alleged human rights abuses that the regime has overseen.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe LIV Golf and Aramco Team Series leagues are both financially supported by the Saudi government, but they are officially separate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) moved to cancel the city’s contract with the Bronx golf club last year after the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection. The Trump Organization responded with a lawsuit last June, saying the decision was politically motivated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Trump Golf Links and the Aramco Team Series for comment.",

        "description": "Shockwaves reverberated around the country following the Supreme Court’s vote to strike down the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision on 24th June this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo months on, abortion is now illegal or heavily restricted in at least 14 states. Around eight more states have laws in place that will pave the way to ban or severely restrict access to abortion, for example in Wyoming, where a near-total ban on abortion is currently delayed by court order. At the moment, 17 states have laws that protect the right to abortion, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe picture is fluid and ever-changing. As it stands now, almost 21 million, or one in three people, in the United States between the ages of 15 and 44, have lost access to abortion, according to U.S. census data. But with some states in flux as their bans are temporarily blocked by the courts, if injunctions are lifted, abortion could soon be&nbsp; inaccessible for 36 percent of those between the ages of 15 and 44, who would then likely to be unable to obtain an elective abortion in their home state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEconomic cost&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is also an economic cost to reducing access to abortion care. The Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR) says that access to comprehensive reproductive health care is central to women’s full participation in the workplace. It also points out that “these measures fall hardest on women that already face systemic obstacles accessing health care and economic opportunities – including Black women, Hispanic women, low-income women, rural women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and more.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThose who participated in a recent LeanIn.org survey agree. Seventy six per cent are concerned that the overturn of Roe will negatively impact their ability to progress at work, and the feeling is even stronger among women of color, 82 percent of whom express concern.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe same number (82 percent) say that having control over whether and when they have a child is critical to pursuing their career goals. Workers are looking to their employers for assistance, with 81 percent saying that supporting access to reproductive healthcare (including abortion) demonstrates an organization’s commitment. A further 76 percent are more likely to want to work for a company that supports abortion access.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCompanies are stepping up as a result, offering to cover or reimburse those employees who need to travel to receive medical care, including abortion. Amazon, H&amp;M, Doordash, Airbnb, Intel, Apple, Gucci and Tesla are just some of the household names stepping up. Employees want more, however, with 78 percent of LeanIn.org’s respondents replying that their employer should take action to protect abortion access too. Watch this space.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the meantime, if you are looking for a new role, we’re taking a look at three employers which are currently hiring and you can check out plenty more opportunities on The Hill Jobs Board.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGrant Thornton&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWith revenues of $1.92 billion, Grant Thornton International is one of the world’s leading organizations of independent audit, tax and advisory firms and has more than 50 offices worldwide.

        "description": "The death of the Star Trek actor leaves behind a hugely important legacy both on the small screen and in spaceNichelle Nichols was my hero. Her death on Saturday at 89 was the passing of an icon who changed the world, and then kept fighting to make the future in our imaginations and in reality, a better brighter place for Black girls. When I was a kid around eight or nine, I would watch reruns of Star Trek and imagine myself as a space traveler. I even loved the fact that our first names were so similar. To me, she was the epitome of cool and I eagerly watched every moment she was on screen.But because I was a kid, I didn’t really grasp how groundbreaking her work on the show was, as by the time I saw it, she was one of many images of Black womanhood. For me she was the one that resonated because I was fascinated by space, but of course I saw everyone from Diahann Carroll to Jackée Harry on screen. My world was one where images of Black womanhood were everywhere. It wasn’t that I thought racism didn’t exist, but the world in which Black women were only depicted as maids was never my reality. The media landscape that would have taught me that there was nothing for girls like me but servitude was changed by Nichelle Nichols. Continue reading...",

The manufacturers said to the consumers, without reprimand or regulation: “These things are great. Consume them.” Today – after many decades of fashionably lighting up – the evils of cigarettes are finally accepted and frowned upon, with new bans put into place. Love Island is on that very same, long trajectory. Continue reading...",

How much could you control if you had every resource available to prepare? The show depicts both the tedious constructions of facsimile – building a replica bar, hiring actors, stress-testing potential conversations – and the unnerving, at times sublime suspension of disbelief.

Not even the bears add tension in this basic Netflix ‘thriller’It is an odd time to be launching a survival drama such as Netflix’s new six-part miniseries Keep Breathing. After all, there is not much you could do to a lone survivor of a plane crash that would not feel restful compared to coping with normal life in 2022.Certainly, the premise of Keep Breathing is undermined from the start by the fact that the Canadian wilderness into which Liv (Melissa Barrera) – a tough, young lawyer – crash-lands looks idyllic. Sure, you would rather be there with a little more food and firestarters than the two power bars and soggy lighter that is Liv’s lot by the time she has swum ashore. The extroverts among you may like more company than a dying co-pilot, too. But overall it looks like a win. Even when a bear turns up and eats the bars, I shrugged and thought: if it is a choice between that or monkeypox and Liz Truss for PM – well, hello, my ursine friend. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The limited series starring To All the Boys’ breakout Lana Condor as an embodied ghost starts off irreverent and devolves into nonsenseBoo, Bitch, a sometimes sharp yet mostly uneven eight-part limited series from Netflix, appeals to a beloved and oft under-rated tradition: the sitcom in which supernatural elements (time travel, foresight, magic powers) underscore the trials of being a teenage girl. Lana Condor’s Erika Vu, a shy, studious senior rendered a ghost after getting smushed by a moose on the night of her first high school party, takes after playfully occult protagonists in irreverent shows such as Sabrina the Teenage Witch, Wizards of Waverly Place, That’s So Raven and, more seriously and successfully, Buffy the Vampire Slayer. The show’s candy-colored aesthetic and caffeinated energy reminds me of Nickelodeon’s Zoey 101; the costumes look like a gleefully unhinged take on mid-aughts TV teen fashion.It’s all light and more fun than you might expect, until it isn’t. Created by Tim Schauer, Kuba Soltysiak, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend’s Erin Ehrlich and Awkward’s Lauren Iungerich, Boo, Bitch straddles the fine line between campy and hokey, deliciously ridiculous and dumb, cheeky and cringe before the second half derails into borderline unwatchable, cheap nonsense. (The title is a cute-ish wink until it becomes an overused refrain in the final episodes.) That Boo, Bitch holds the center at all for five 25-minute episodes is largely thanks to the commitment of Condor, Netflix’s immensely likable homegrown star of To All The Boys I’ve Loved Before, and Zoe Margaret Colletti as her kooky, loyal best friend Gia.

        "description": "This exquisitely pitched true-crime series about an inmate having to befriend a serial murderer at the behest of the FBI is a fitting farewell to the Goodfellas actorYou may feel maxed out on true-crime drama at the moment, and I would entirely understand if so. Recent offerings have included stories of murder (Extremely Wicked, Shockingly Evil and Vile gave yet more prominence to Ted Bundy while The Serpent followed drug dealer and serial killer Charles Sobhraj), miscarriages of justice (When They See Us, about the Central Park Five), the human suffering caused by greed and corruption (Dopesick, about the US opioid crisis), and various manifestations of misogyny and testaments to endemic sexual violence (Unbelievable, Lost Girls, The Staircase). But it’s well worth girding your loins to go one more round with dramatised depravity for the new limited series Black Bird (Apple TV+).Developed by crime writer Dennis Lehane from James Keene’s 2010 memoir In With the Devil, it stars Taron Egerton as Keene – acquitting himself brilliantly in a part that is as about as far removed from his last starring role as Elton John in Rocketman as it is possible to be.

Three southern gal pals (McKinnon, Cecily Strong and host Natasha Lyonne) recount their close encounters with extraterrestrials to two government agents (Bryant and Mikey Day). Whereas two of the women’s had beatific experiences with beings of pure light, McKinnon’s hapless Colleen Rafferty once again gets the short end of the stick: yanked into the sky by a giant claw machine while “popping a squat on the median”, she has her pubic hair plucked out by a group of gray-skinned perverts before being ceremonially dumped into the middle of a Mets’ game “ass-up with my dong-hole and my wrong hole out”.

        "description": "The Last Movie Stars, about power couple Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, also proves a devastating portrait of an eraThe synopsis of The Last Movie Stars, HBO’s new six-part documentary about Hollywood power couple Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward, doesn’t look promising on paper. Filmed at the height of Covid, it is directed and hosted by Ethan Hawke and threatens us with a long list of A-list actors appearing via Zoom to assume various characters. The source material – hundreds of hours of transcripts from interviews commissioned by Newman for a biography that never materialised – tells the story not just of the couple and their careers, but of an era, a marriage and an industry. All of which sounds fine, within its limitations. But who has the time or appetite for six hours of this stuff?As it turns out, watching The Last Movie Stars is an extraordinary experience. As a documentary, it’s different in form to Peter Jackson’s Get Back, the eight hours of recut studio footage from the Beatles’ 1969 recording session. The Last Movie Stars is a more conventional project, with commentary and talking heads intercut with archive footage from Newman and Woodward’s filmography. And yet the depth of the material and the sheer boldness of the show’s length invite a similar sense of immersion to Get Back. Newman burned all the audio tapes from which the transcripts derive, for reasons that, as the show progresses, become obvious: the revelations are so intimate, so startling and at times so devastating, it’s amazing they existed in the first place.Emma Brockes is a Guardian columnist Continue reading...",

For weeks, we’ve seen a conveyor belt of Islanders couple up, break up and, in some cases, make up. But since the longest relationships on the show have existed for only a few weeks, it’s sometimes hard not to think of them as very intense holiday flings.There are no concerns regarding the authenticity of feelings in the new Amazon Prime series The One That Got Away, though. Hosted by the Australian-American singer Betty Who, it features six singles revisiting lost loves from a wide pool: past dates, crushes that were never taken to the next step, potential partners who “friend-zoned” and many instances of “right person, wrong time”. Daters are instructed to go to a “portal” (since Love Is Blind, a strange sci-fi element has become customary) and out of it emerges a potential suitor from their dating history. As if the portal were a time machine, contestants are given the chance to finally stop that ship from passing in the night. Continue reading...",

Why does the setting work so well?It’s that time of year again: heads are being turned, Prettylittlething.com endorsement deals chased, and we’re hearing the phrase “It is what it is” ad nauseam. That’s right: with sky-high ratings and no shortage of drama, this is Love Island’s summer – and we’re all just living in it.But over and above the shenanigans at ITV’s Mallorcan villa, reality television seems to be obsessed with islands at the moment. This month, season two of FBoy Island – a bizarre show where women choose between men who describe themselves as “nice guys” and those who identify as womanising “fuck boys” – arrives on HBO Max. Netflix’s Too Hot to Handle – a dating show that transports 10 horny singles to a tropical paradise and bans them from kissing or touching each other – dropped its third season in January. MTV’s Ex on the Beach, which reunites fiery contestants from British reality shows with their exes, has filmed 12 seasons on islands including Crete, Koh Samui, Bali and Gran Canaria.

It was the No 1 show in the US in 1985, seen in countries across the globe. I never watched it back then. I was in college, and didn’t have a TV – I sort of looked down on television, which, with the likes of The Dukes of Hazzard also topping the charts, wasn’t the astonishing art form it has become. Cut to a global pandemic, and end times, and it seems like I do nothing but watch TV. And Dynasty has me hooked.This isn’t because Dynasty is a good show – on the contrary, it is a horrid, crass, offensive show. The plots are absolute madness – they called it a “night-time soap”– full of plane crashes and kidnappings, the appearance of long-lost children, and people being thrown from horses or falling down stairs. There should have been a drinking game for the frequency with which someone on the show exclaims, in horror: “What?!” Continue reading...",

In Gentleman Jack, we see both Anne and Ann dealing with many of the same issues, emotions and obstacles that lesbians in our times are still dealing with. There were so many times Anne Lister would make a comment that was an arrow to my heart, because I knew what she was feeling even if I live 200 years later.

        "description": "Graphic novel The Sandman made its author into an icon. He talks about his big break in comics, the genre’s long struggle for respectability and the lavish Netflix adaptation that’s bringing his gothic hero to lifeNeil Gaiman is relieved to be home. Dressed all in black, unruly black hair shot through with silver, he sits comfortably on a couch at his house in Woodstock, New York. “I left here in August 2019, figuring I’d be back by the end of March,” he says. “I didn’t actually get back till April 2022. Just in time to go off on a tour of America.” Nobody was completely unaffected by the pandemic, but not even Covid could derail the big-budget Netflix adaptation of Gaiman’s seminal 90s comic series The Sandman, due next month.The British-born Gaiman is one of the most recognised living authors. His restless imagination refuses to be constrained by genre or demographic; he has written adult horror fantasy (American Gods), children’s literature (Coraline) and retellings of ancient myth (Norse Mythology). He has won the Hugo, Nebula and Bram Stoker awards, and the Newbery and Carnegie medals. And those are just the books. Gaiman’s Midas touch extends beyond literature: his play The Ocean at the End of the Lane was recently staged in London to enthusiastic reviews; film adaptations of his work include Coraline and Stardust; Lucifer, Good Omens and American Gods have all been successfully adapted to television; Gaiman even wrote the English translation of classic Studio Ghibli anime Princess Mononoke.

        "description": "Rob Miller, director of The Most Hated Man on the Internet, talks about giving a voice to the victims of an exploitative website, and the incredible mother who led its founder to be jailedOver the past few years, revenge porn has become endemic. Keep an eye on the news and you’ll see it’s peppered with stories about people (mainly men) who have been caught posting naked pictures of their exes on the internet. Last week a paramedic was struck off for posting pictures of his ex-girlfriend. A week before that, two women went to court after filming their friend having sex and posting it on Facebook. West Midlands police just announced that it has investigated a 10-year-old on suspicion of posting revenge porn. It’s one of the least edifying aspects of the internet, and it seems to be unstoppable.All of which makes Netflix’s new series The Most Hated Man on the Internet one of the most upsettingly timely documentaries in recent memory. Essentially a history lesson, it tells the story of IsAnyoneUp.com, a site that for two years revelled in posting intimate pictures of women, almost always submitted without their consent by spurned ex-lovers. The site quickly grew a large and entitled following, and its founder became its messianic ringleader, developing a cult of personality that only expanded its notoriety. Continue reading...",

        "description": "In a new docuseries, the actor recounts the tale of Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward with adulation but not without critiqueThe Last Movie Stars, a new documentary series on Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward released to HBO Max this past weekend, occasionally allows its focus to drift to a third subject. Ethan Hawke presides as director and producer on the six episodes, and he makes no effort to minimize his own presence under some pretense of fly-on-the-wall objectivity. As much as his extensive research project exists to chronicle the lives and works of a Hollywood power couple in a league of their own, he also digests the narrative at hand by examining his own relationship to it.With a cavalcade of famous pals Zoom-ing in during the shaggy-haired early days of quarantine, a murderers’ row of actors’ actors who also record voiceover readings of archival documents, Hawke pontificates on how a generation of serious thespians modeled themselves and their careers after Newman and Woodward. For a substantive performer looking to cultivate a rich inner life of varied hobbies and intellectual pursuits to go along with A-list icon status, there’s no clearer exemplar than Newman, whose ice-blue eyes hid the soul of a Lee Strasberg student and racecar driver.

It’s a Game of Thrones spin-off that has to regain everyone’s trust after Game of Thrones disintegrated so thoroughly during its final season. It has also had the carpet whipped out from underneath it by news that HBO is going to make another Game of Thrones spin-off, starring Kit Harington as Jon Snow. And, potentially worst of all, it will find itself competing with Amazon’s The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power, which has already made a splash by being the most expensive television series ever made.And these challenges might explain why the House of the Dragon press onslaught has already begun. Little by little, we’re starting to learn more about the series, and why HBO desperately needs us to watch it. Here’s what we know so far. Continue reading...",

        "description": "COVID-19 vaccine maker Moderna is suing Pfizer and the German drugmaker BioNTech, accusing its main competitors of copying Moderna’s technology in order to make their own vaccine.Moderna said Friday that Pfizer and BioNTech’s vaccine Comirnaty infringes on patents Moderna filed several years ago protecting the technology behind its preventive shot, Spikevax. The company filed patent infringement lawsuits in both U.S. federal court and a German court.A Pfizer spokeswoman declined to comment, saying the company had not been served with a copy of the litigation.Moderna and Pfizer’s two-shot vaccines both use mRNA technology to help patients fight the coronavirus.The mRNA vaccines work by injecting a genetic code for the spike protein that coats the surface of the coronavirus. That code, the mRNA, is encased in a little ball of fat, and instructs the body’s cells to make some harmless spike copies that train the immune system to recognize the real virus.That approach is radically different than how vaccines have traditionally been made.Moderna said it started developing its mRNA technology platform in 2010, and that helped the company quickly produce its COVID-19 vaccine after the pandemic arrived in early 2020.By the end of that year, U.S. regulators had cleared shots from both Pfizer and Moderna for use after clinical research showed that both were highly effective.Moderna CEO Stephane Bancel said in a prepared statement that the vaccine developer pioneered that technology and invested billions of dollars in creating it.The company said it believes its rivals’ vaccine infringes on patents Moderna filed between 2010 and 2016.Moderna said it recognizes the importance of vaccine access and is not seeking to remove Comirnaty from the market. It also is not asking for an injunction to prevent future sales.",

        "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency said Friday it is designating some toxic industrial compounds used in cookware, carpets and firefighting foams as hazardous substances under the so-called Superfund law.The designation means that releases of long-lasting chemicals known as PFOA and PFOS that meet or exceed a certain quantity would have to be reported to federal, state or tribal officials. The requirement would increase understanding of the extent and locations of the contamination and help communities avoid or reduce contact with the potentially dangerous chemicals, the EPA said.PFOA and PFOS have been voluntarily phased out by U.S. manufacturers but are still in limited use and remain in the environment because they do not degrade over time. The compounds are part of a larger cluster of “forever chemicals” known as PFAS that have been used in consumer products and industry since the 1940s.PFAS is short for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances, which are used in nonstick frying pans, water-repellent sports gear, stain-resistant rugs, cosmetics and countless other consumer products.The chemicals can accumulate and persist in the human body for long periods of time, and evidence from animal and human studies indicates that exposure to PFOA or PFOS may lead to cancer or other health problems.“Communities have suffered far too long from exposure to these forever chemicals,&#x27;&#x27; EPA Administrator Michael Regan said in a statement Friday. “The action announced today will improve transparency and advance EPA’s aggressive efforts to confront this pollution.”Under the proposed rule, “EPA will both help protect communities from PFAS pollution and seek to hold polluters accountable for their actions,&#x27;&#x27; Regan said.The EPA’s action follows a recent report by the National Academies of Science that calls PFAS a serious public health threat in the U.S. and worldwide.Regan said many sources of PFAS contamination are near communities already overburdened with pollution. The proposed rule would provide the agency with improved data and the option to require cleanups and recover cleanup costs to protect public health, he said.The move follows an EPA announcement in June that PFOA and PFOS are more dangerous than previously thought and pose health risks even at levels so low they cannot currently be detected.The agency issued nonbinding health advisories that set health risk thresholds for PFOA and PFOS to near zero, replacing 2016 guidelines that had set them at 70 parts per trillion. The chemicals are found in products including cardboard packaging, carpets and firefighting foam and increasingly found in drinking water.The EPA said in a statement that it is focused on holding responsible those who have manufactured and released significant amounts of PFOA and PFOS into the environment. The agency also said it is committed to further outreach and engagement to hear from communities affected by PFAS pollution.Several states have set their own drinking water limits to address PFAS contamination that are far tougher than the federal guidance.

Officials are no longer confident that PFAS levels allowed under the 2016 guidelines are safe from adverse health impacts, an EPA spokesman said.Attorney Rob Bilott, an anti-PFAS advocate, said the EPA&#x27;s proposal &quot;sends a loud and clear message to the entire world that the United States is finally acknowledging and accepting the now overwhelming evidence that these man-made poisons present substantial danger to the public health and the environment.”Bilott, whose work to uncover the widespread presence of PFAS chemicals in the environment and in human blood was highlighted in the 2019 film “Dark Waters,&#x27;&#x27; represents states, water providers and others affected by PFAS contamination. He said in a statement that any hazardous substance designation under the Superfund law must be implemented so the costs of cleaning up the toxins are borne by PFAS manufacturers who caused the contamination — “not the innocent victims of this pollution who didn’t create the toxins and were never warned any of this was ever happening.”Erik Olson, a health and food expert at the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the announcement an important step to clean up hundreds of contaminated sites across the country and protect millions of families exposed to the toxic chemicals.“Listing PFOA and PFOS as hazardous under Superfund law should allow EPA to hold polluters responsible for that contamination,&quot; he said. “Ratepayers and public utilities should not be footing the bill for industry’s decades of wonton use of these dangerous chemicals.”The EPA said it expects to propose national drinking water regulations for PFOA and PFOS later this year, with a final rule expected in 2023.",

        "description": "JACKSON HOLE, Wyo. — Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday vowed that he won't back down in the fight against high inflation, saying the central bank will do what it takes to rein in prices. In a closely watched speech at the Fed’s annual conference in Wyoming, Powell foreshadowed not only further interest rate increases but also warned that rates might need to stay high for some time to ensure that price spikes do not persist.  “We must keep at it until the job is done,” he said. “Restoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance.” The Fed's campaign to curb the highest inflation in four decades runs the risk of triggering a recession in the world's largest economy. Growth has already slowed — initial readings of GDP showed the economy contracted in the first two quarters of the year — even as inflation has shown signs of cooling off. The persistence of high inflation has sparked a blame game in Washington, with Republicans faulting both the Biden administration's big spending packages and the Fed's delay in raising interest rates. Indeed, Powell's words were a stark about-face from his remarks at the same conference last year, when he said elevated inflation was likely to prove temporary. Now, his message is intended not only to warn the American people that economic pain is ahead but also to deter financial markets from expecting the Fed to reverse course next year. Before his remarks, many investors expected the central bank to begin lowering borrowing costs later next year as a possible recession looms. That had led market rates to fall and stock prices to rise from their June depths — the exact opposite of what the central bank wants to see as it aims to slow spending and investment. But the Fed chief said the battle against inflation would likely mean “a sustained period” of slow growth, with a level of interest rates that keeps the economy on a tight leash. He also said there would “very likely” be some pain in the job market, which could mean a jump in the unemployment rate — that is, millions of job losses.   “These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain,” he said, arguing that letting inflation fester would only cause additional hardship in the future because the Fed would have to act more aggressively.  “History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay,” he said. Many attendees of the conference, who were hoping for tough talk from Powell, were pleased. At six pages, his speech was considerably shorter and more direct than remarks at this venue generally are. That gave markets little room to read something unintended into his words. Both the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&amp;P 500 stock index plunged after the speech.  “It was extremely disciplined, extremely tight. Just saying, ‘we’re on this path, we’re staying on this path,’ and not overcommitting, not overpromising,” said Adam Posen, president of the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Powell’s former Fed colleague, Randal Quarles, called it “exactly what was called for in the moment.” He said the central bank likely needed to get its main borrowing rate up close to 4 percent — it currently sits between 2.25 percent and 2.5 percent — and “they're on the path to do that.” The economy is already slowing, though it still shows “strong underlying momentum,” according to Powell. As for inflation itself, there are some early signs it is easing. The Personal Consumption Expenditures index — the Fed’s preferred inflation measure — showed prices actually fell slightly from June to July, driven in part by lower gas prices, according to data released Friday. But they’re still up 6.3 percent from a year before. “While the lower inflation readings for July are welcome, a single month’s improvement falls far short of what the committee will need to see before we are confident that inflation is moving down,” Powell said. He put responsibility for fighting price spikes firmly in the court of the Fed, although inflation has also been fed by factors that it can’t control, such as supply chain disruptions and Russia’s invasion of Ukraine. “It is true that the current high inflation is a global phenomenon, and that many economies around the world face inflation as high or higher than seen here in the United States,” Powell said. “None of this diminishes the Federal Reserve’s responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability. There is clearly a job to do in moderating demand to better align with supply. We are committed to doing that job.”",

        "description": "By now most people should have the Productivity Calendar feature available on their Chromebook. If you see the date separated from the time in your Quick View, you have it. And if you click the date, you see a nice Calendar view with colored dots under a date to reflect an event. You can even click a day to see the Google Calendar events for a given day. For most of us, the Quick View Calendar starts the week on a Sunday. Here&#8217;s how you can make the Chromebook Quick View Calendar start weeks on Mondays.\n\n\n\nThis is more of a hack than what I&#8217;d call an official solution and it comes courtesy of Reddit. Why do I call it a hack? Because the weekly start day is tied to a language setting specific to Chromebooks. I figured if I went into my Google Calendar settings and changed the weekly start day to Monday, that would do the trick. Nope.\n\n\n\nInstead, at least for English users, you can do this by changing your Chromebook Device language.\n\n\n\n1. Open Settings\n\n\n\nStart by opening the Settings app of your Chromebook. Then search for &#8220;Languages&#8221; and choose the top search result. You should see this page. Note that mine currently says &#8220;English&#8221; for the Device Language. With this configuration, my Chromebook Quick View Calendar starts the week on Sundays.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Change your device language\n\n\n\nClick the Change button for the Device language setting. Then search for &#8220;Canada&#8221; in the next set of options and choose English (Canada). I guess Canadians start their calendar weeks on Mondays because this is the secret setting. And it keeps the device language in English. It&#8217;s possible, likely even, that other countries follow suit, but I need my device to show me English.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you&#8217;ve made the English (Canada) selection, click the Confirm and restart button.\n\n\n\n3. Monday on the Chromebook Quick View Calendar\n\n\n\nAfter your Chromebook restarts, you shouldn&#8217;t see any immediate difference. Click the Quick View Calendar date though and voil&#xE0;! Monday should be the first day in the Calendar view on your Chromebook!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that by changing the Device language on your Chromebook, you may have modified other user interfaces. Frankly, I&#8217;ve looked around and don&#8217;t see any changes. However, there&#8217;s no way I can find them all. So remember that if user interface language appears differently after making this change, you can always undo this process or simply live with whatever else has changed.\n\n\n\nIdeally, Google should tie the Chromebook Quick View Calendar settings to those of Google Calendar itself. You can change the start day of a week there and it should simply carry over to the new Chromebook Calendar integration.\nThe post How to change the Chromebook Quick View Calendar to start on Mondays appeared first on About Chromebooks.",

        "description": "At the heart of history’s most successful eradication campaign is a mystery. The smallpox vaccine—now also being deployed against monkeypox—contains a live virus that confers immunity against multiple poxviruses. But it is not smallpox or a weakened version thereof. Nor is it monkeypox. Nor is it cowpox, as suggested by the vaccine’s famous origin story involving pus taken from an infected milkmaid to immunize an 8-year-old boy.It is something else entirely: a unique poxvirus whose origins have been lost, or perhaps never known at all. Scientists call it vaccinia, and it is pretty much found only in the vaccines. No one knows where vaccinia came from in nature. No one has ever found its animal reservoir. No one knows quite what vaccinia is—even as it has been used to inoculate billions of people and saved hundreds of millions of lives. It is a ghost of a virus that has survived by being turned into a vaccine.José Esparza first began wondering about vaccinia in the 1980s, when he was assigned an office at the World Health Organization next to the smallpox archives. By then, the disease had already been eradicated, and people had, he says, “little interest in understanding the origins of the vaccine.” He went on to have a long career working on HIV and other viruses at the WHO and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, but in retirement, he has returned to solving the mystery of vaccinia. It is a “hobby,” but also a bit of an obsession. For years now, he has been scouring museums and eBay for old vials of smallpox vaccine, scoring a couple every year. (“EBay—you can find anything you can imagine!” he says.) These vials no longer contain live virus, but the technology now exists to sequence the fragments of viral DNA that remain.This DNA has revealed tantalizing if perplexing clues. Vaccinia turns out to be most genetically similar to another poxvirus called horsepox. But scientists have only ever sequenced one horsepox sample in the world, and they may never find another; the disease largely disappeared in the early 20th century. If horsepox really is the progenitor of vaccinia, how did that happen? And how did it then become lost to time?The best-known version of the smallpox-vaccine story goes like this: In 1796, the British doctor Edward Jenner noticed that milkmaids exposed to a mild disease called cowpox were unusually protected from smallpox. He found a young woman with fresh cowpox lesions and scratched material from one into the arm of a boy—the son of Jenner’s gardener, no less—who became mildly ill but survived. He indeed became immune to smallpox. The first vaccine was born.Jenner was not really the first doctor to make this observation about cowpox. But he did document his experiments in a now seminal book. Intriguingly, he mentions horses in the book’s introduction. On the second page, in fact, he speculates that cowpox originated as “grease,” a horse disease that may have spread from equines to farmworkers to cows to dairy maids. He couldn’t prove this, though; it would take several more decades for scientists to understand that diseases are caused by invisible microbes that spread among people and animals. This brief allusion to horses gets forgotten in favor of a “beautiful tale of the milkmaids,” Esparza says.Nevertheless, smallpox vaccines soon began spreading around the world. Nineteenth-century vaccines were a far cry from the standardized pharmaceutical products we’re used to today. Preservation of the material on glass or thread was unreliable, so the smallpox vaccine was maintained in the bodies of young children: Liquid from a pox on one child would be transferred into the arm of another, resulting in a pox whose contents could be transferred to another, and so on. And it had to be children, because adults tended to already have immunity to smallpox. In 1803, Spain sent 22 orphan boys on a Royal Philanthropic Vaccine Expedition to bring the smallpox vaccine to its colonies. The number of boys was chosen precisely to span the length of the transatlantic voyage: Every nine or 10 days at sea, doctors would transfer the vaccine to the arms of two new boys—two in case one did not take, so that the ship would arrive in the Americas with the last set of boys still having sores.The chain of arm-to-arm transfer did sometimes fail, however. When an established source of vaccine wasn’t available, doctors who’d heard about Jenner’s experiment went back to the animals. Cows were used, as were horses. The physician Luigi Sacco, for example, who popularized vaccination in northern Italy, successfully inoculated patients with vaccines derived from grease-infected horses. As doctors such as Sacco experimented with new sources, multiple vaccines probably came into circulation. There was no single canonical vaccine.Not until the mid-19th century, when scientists figured out how to maintain the smallpox vaccine in calves, did it become a mass-manufactured product. The use of horses faded from living memory. Vaccinia and cowpox eventually became interchangeable names for the virus in the vaccine. In fact, the words vaccine and vaccinia both derive from vacca, which is Latin for cow.By the 1930s, though, scientists were realizing that vaccinia and cowpox were not one and the same. When a British microbiologist injected one virus or the other into rabbits, he saw that they induced slightly different immune responses. To the immune system, vaccinia and cowpox are not interchangeable. But the molecular techniques of the time were not sophisticated enough to nail down how they differed.Meanwhile, other theories flourished: Vaccinia was a domesticated version of cowpox or smallpox, transformed through arm-to-arm passage in the 19th century. Or it was a hybrid of the two. Or perhaps it was a prototype poxvirus that gave rise to all other poxviruses. In the 1970s, poxvirologist Derrick Baxby speculated that horsepox was one possible origin for vaccinia—harkening back to Jenner’s description of grease in horses 200 years earlier. But horsepox had gone extinct, he lamented, with no laboratory experiments having ever been conducted.Baxby did not know this at the time, but thousands of miles away, a poxvirus had in fact been killing horses in Mongolia. Only in the early 2000s, some 25 years later, would scientists rediscover and sequence an archived virus from this forgotten outbreak, which they attributed to horsepox. The results were presented at an international meeting of poxvirologists in 2002. “A lot of their ears perked up,” says Edan Tulman, one of the scientists who sequenced the Mongolia virus at Plum Island Animal Disease Center at the time. The virus it most resembled turned out to be none other than modern vaccinia. Yet, it also has genes that “no other modern-day vaccinia” does, suggesting that it is indeed closer to the wild poxvirus that first gave rise to vaccinia, says Elliot Lefkowitz, who studies microbial genomics at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. The results added new fuel to the horsepox-origin hypothesis.Old smallpox vaccines have also confirmed a link—they share even more similarities with horsepox. One of the vials Esparza bought off of eBay, manufactured by a Philadelphia company in 1902, contained vaccinia whose core genome was 99.7 percent identical to that of horsepox. Esparza and two close collaborators—Clarissa Damaso at Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and Andreas Nitsche at the Robert Koch Institute in Germany—have since sequenced about 30 old smallpox-vaccine genomes, which have not all been published yet. They have also reanalyzed five published partial genomes from Civil War–era smallpox vaccines at the Mütter Museum. Four looked like 1976 horsepox virus, and a fifth was so similar, Damaso says, that it’s basically “true horsepox virus.”In fact, all of the vaccinia that the team has found from old vaccines have resembled horsepox, which naturally brings up another question. If doctors in the 19th century were using both cows and horses as sources, how come only horsepox-like viruses survived in vaccines? Perhaps doctors and early manufacturers were inadvertently selecting for horsepox when choosing the best vaccines, suggests David Evans, a poxvirologist at the University of Alberta in Canada. “That’s just a guess,” he says, but “cowpox doesn’t really grow particularly well in humans.” Or perhaps, Damaso muses, cowpox could have been a misnomer this whole time. Just as monkeys are not the natural reservoir of monkeypox, scientists now think that cows are not the natural reservoir of cowpox—it actually seems to be rodents. Poxviruses have historically been named after the animal in which they were first found, but they usually infect a broad range of hosts. Could the virus causing “cowpox” in cows during Jenner’s time actually be what we now classify as “horsepox,” a virus that was possibly infecting cows, humans, and horses? The vaccinia of today is in fact capable of infecting multiple species. People who got older versions of the smallpox vaccine sometimes spread it to others. Vaccinia has also spilled over into animals, including buffalo, rodents, and cattle. And in cattle, the disease manifests a lot like cowpox.  Mysteriously, horsepox seems to have disappeared from the world—perhaps because modern husbandry practices have prevented it from spreading. Mongolia hasn’t recorded any new outbreaks, and Europe hasn’t recorded any in more than a century. A few years ago, Esparza contacted virtually every vet agency in the world looking for any evidence of horsepox, and found none. He’s also tried, unsuccessfully, to hunt for the virus in horses and wild rodents in Mongolia.Proving conclusively that horsepox is the origin of vaccinia is hard, now that wild horsepox is gone from the world. The questions that linger are unanswerable without more samples: Was the horsepox found in Mongolia in 1976 really the same disease that had afflicted horses thousands of miles away and nearly three centuries earlier in Europe, when the smallpox vaccine was first invented? And even if so, could the Mongolia virus be a very old escaped vaccine virus that spread from inoculated humans to animals, rather than a wild horsepox virus?This much is clear, though: The 1976 Mongolia virus and vaccinia have a common poxvirus ancestor, which likely circulated among animals in Europe around Edward Jenner’s time. That ancestor, whether horsepox or not, became the progenitor of all viruses in smallpox vaccines today—but has itself disappeared.Since Jenner’s time, the process of making vaccines has become far more controlled and standardized. The vaccinia in the Jynneos vaccine used against monkeypox today is still live, but it’s no longer capable of replicating in human cells; it lost this ability after being passaged through chicken cells hundreds of times. Vaccinia remains a mystery because it arose before the advent of a modern, regulated pharmaceutical industry. No one kept careful records; even if they did, they wouldn’t have known what to record. It all happened before anyone had an understanding of germ theory. It happened even before the discovery of viruses. Remarkably, the vaccine worked. And it worked so well that we were able to eradicate a human disease for the first and only time.",

        "description": "A federal judge ruled against a Texas law banning adults under 21 years old from carrying a handgun outside their homes, saying that it violates the Second Amendment to the Constitution.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Pittman ruled on Thursday that the Second Amendment’s text, informed by the history and tradition of the era of the Founding Fathers, protects individual rights against this prohibition by age.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ruling is set to go into effect in 30 days to give time for an appeal to be filed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit was filed in November by two individuals between the ages of 18 and 20 and the Firearms Policy Coalition on behalf of its members in that age range.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ruling follows the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in June in which it struck down New York state law that required a high standard for an individual to receive a permit to carry a handgun outside their home. Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority opinion that the Second Amendment protects an individual right to carry a handgun outside the home for self-defense.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe decision comes three months after an 18-year-old gunman opened fire at Robb Elementary School in the city of Uvalde, killing 19 students and two teachers. He was armed with an AR-15-style rifle.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Texas legislature passed a law last year allowing Texans to carry handguns outside the home without a license or training, the Texas Tribune reported. Gov. Greg Abbott (R) called it the “strongest Second Amendment legislation in Texas history,” but some law enforcement groups said it would put officers at risk and allow criminals to more easily obtain firearms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nParents of Uvalde victims and advocates are planning to rally in Austin on Saturday to call on state lawmakers to vote to raise the minimum age for buying an AR-15 rifle to 21.",

        "description": "Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis fares better in a hypothetical head-to-head 2024 matchup against President Biden than former President Donald Trump does, according to a new YouGov poll out Friday.\n\n\n\nIf the next presidential election comes down to a choice between Biden or Trump, the incumbent comes out on top at 39 percent to 36 percent. But pitted against DeSantis, Biden would end up in a closer race. \n\n\n\nIn that scenario, 36 percent said they would support Biden, while 35 percent would back the Florida governor.\n\n\n\nIn either case, a relatively significant percentage of respondents said that they simply wouldn’t vote: 15 percent for a Trump-Biden matchup and 16 percent in a contest between DeSantis and Biden.\n\n\n\nThe poll of 1,000 U.S. adults is the latest evidence of DeSantis’s growing national profile amid speculation that he could mount a bid for the White House in 2024. The Florida governor has seen his political clout swell among Republicans in recent years, and early polling shows him gaining ground on Trump in a hypothetical GOP presidential primary.\n\n\n\nThe YouGov poll is also a sign that voters may not be particularly keen on another Trump presidency, even with Biden’s sagging approval ratings.\n\n\n\nTo be sure, most voters aren’t thrilled about the possibility of Trump or Biden running again in 2024. \n\n\n\nOnly 28 percent of respondents said that Trump should mount another bid for the White House, compared to 54 percent who said that he shouldn’t. When it comes to another Biden campaign, only 21 percent said that he should run for a second term, while 55 percent said that he shouldn’t.\n\n\n\nBiden did see a tick up in his approval rating in a separate poll released Thursday by Gallup, rising to 44 percent.

        "description": "It wasn’t that long ago that Georgians felt comfortable walking the streets of Atlanta or going to the&nbsp;shopping mall&nbsp;alone. Parents didn’t worry about their kids playing outside or whether they’d make it home from school safely. That’s not the case anymore.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRecently, Georgia has seen a&nbsp;crime surge&nbsp;throughout its major metropolitan areas. Lethal drugs have infected neighborhoods all over the state. Public safety is top-of-mind for many Georgians — but apparently not for Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock. This November, voters in the Peach State have the chance to reject Warnock and elect someone who will put Georgians first: Republican Herschel Walker.\n\n\n\nAs a senator, Warnock has consistently pushed a radical, woke agenda that puts law and order last. He&nbsp;lobbied&nbsp;for the end of Atlanta’s bail system, which led to an approximate&nbsp;100 percent spike in released offenders&nbsp;failing to appear for their court dates. He’s&nbsp;voted&nbsp;to&nbsp;confirm&nbsp;Biden’s soft-on-crime Supreme Court pick. He’s demonized our men and women in blue, calling them&nbsp;“thugs” and “bullies.”&nbsp;He’s even&nbsp;voted&nbsp;to give stimulus checks to prisoners, including the Boston Marathon Bomber.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile,&nbsp;Atlanta's homicide rate&nbsp;has increased three years in a row. Smash-and-grab robberies terrorize businesses; one Atlanta boutique lost&nbsp;over $100,000&nbsp;in merchandise after burglars broke into their store. Warnock’s response? Spending&nbsp;$4 million&nbsp;to dismantle part of the city’s jail and turn it into a “diversion center.” At every turn, Warnock has done more for criminals than law-abiding citizens.\n\n\n\nAs if that wasn’t bad enough, Warnock’s support for the Biden administration’s open border policies has laid out a welcome mat for illegal activity.&nbsp;Two hundred thousand&nbsp;migrants were apprehended trying to cross the United States-Mexico border just in July — and that’s not counting the got aways who slipped through the cracks. Since October, Border Patrol agents have encountered&nbsp;66 migrants on the terror watchlist&nbsp;attempting to enter America illegally. Illicit drugs continue to pour into the country:&nbsp;2,071 pounds of deadly fentanyl&nbsp;— the equivalent of&nbsp;more than 469 million&nbsp;lethal doses — were seized at the southern border in July alone, with much more getting through.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFentanyl overdoses are now the&nbsp;leading cause of death&nbsp;for Americans 18-45 years old. These drugs have made their way deep into the country, including the Peach State. Georgia has seen&nbsp;increased&nbsp;overdoses from street drugs laced with fentanyl. It’s killing Georgians — including a&nbsp;toddler. No one is safe, yet Warnock&nbsp;votes against&nbsp;even the most minimal border security efforts.\n\n\n\nWith crime and lethal drugs on the rise, it’s no wonder Georgians are fleeing in search of safer neighborhoods. But when residents leave, local economies suffer. All over the country, businesses are being forced to slash their workforces just to stay afloat. Gasoline averages&nbsp;nearly $4 per gallon, making transportation and supplies more expensive. The price of groceries is up&nbsp;13 percent&nbsp;since last year —&nbsp; the largest increase in 43 years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut rather than alleviate these burdens, Warnock has doubled down. Last year, he helped fuel a&nbsp;boycott&nbsp;of the MLB All-Star game, costing Atlanta small businesses $100 million. He voted to waste $1.9 trillion with Biden’s “stimulus,” which&nbsp;sent inflation soaring&nbsp;and&nbsp;real wages falling&nbsp;— resulting in a pay cut for hardworking families. And earlier this month, he voted to send 87,000 IRS agents after them thanks to Joe Biden’s so-called “Inflation Reduction Act,” which&nbsp;actually does nothing to reduce inflation. In fact, Warnock has voted with&nbsp;Biden 96 percent&nbsp;of the time.\n\n\n\nGeorgians deserve U.S. senators who represent their values. That’s why Herschel Walker’s vision for Georgia is so refreshing. As a senator, Walker will support economic policies that work because he is a successful entrepreneur. He will vote to secure our southern border and stop the flow of human trafficking, criminals and drugs. He’ll fully fund law enforcement and give them the equipment and resources to hire, train and protect officers. He’ll reject woke social experiments and require prosecutors to do their jobs: prosecute crimes and keep violent criminals in jail. And as a legendary athlete, he'll have no problem protecting women's sports from the far left.\n\n\n\nAs a parent myself, I know how vital public safety is to families. Keeping citizens safe and creating an environment where individuals can thrive is the government’s most basic job. It’s the reason we send our senators to Washington. Raphael Warnock had nearly two years to prove himself. Instead, he’s only proved that he cares more about serving Joe Biden's failed agenda than his constituents in Georgia. Voters are ready for a change. In November, they’ll put Warnock out of a job.\n\n\n\nRonna McDaniel is chair of the Republican National Committee.&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/finance/3616777-why-the-fed-chief-says-theres-no-end-in-sight-to-rate-hikes/",
        "description": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank will lean into interest rates meant to restrict the economy until inflation steadily declines.\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the Fed’s annual policy summit in Jackson Hole, Wyo., the Fed chief said the bank will keep taking “forceful and rapid” steps to curb price growth even though it could cause higher unemployment and a recession.\n\n\n\n“While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” Powell said Friday.\n\n\n\n“These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain,” he continued.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPowell’s speech comes as the Fed races to bring inflation down from levels last reached during the 1980s. Annual inflation as measured by personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, was 6.3 percent in July — more than three times the Fed’s target of 2 percent. \n\n\n\nWhile the annual inflation rate dropped sharply in July from 6.8 percent, Powell said the brief dip “falls far short” of what the Fed needs to see “before we are confident that inflation is moving down.”\n\n\n\nThe Fed has already raised its baseline interest rate range from a span of 0 to 0.25 percent in March to 2.25 to 2.5 percent as of July, hiking borrowing costs at a historically rapid pace.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPowell did not specify whether the Fed’s monetary policy panel will raise rates by 0.75 percentage points for the third consecutive meeting at its meeting in September, or if it would opt for a smaller 0.5 percentage point hike. But he made clear the Fed will keep hiking rates and leave them at levels intended to slow the economy enough to curb price growth.\n\n\n\n“We are moving our policy stance purposefully to a level that will be sufficiently restrictive to return inflation to 2 percent,” Powell said.\n\n\n\n“In current circumstances, with inflation running far above 2 percent and the labor market extremely tight, estimates of longer-run neutral are not a place to stop or pause.”\n\n\n\nThe Fed aims to reduce inflation by raising its baseline interest rate range, which increases borrowing costs throughout the economy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHigher interest rates suppress economic activity by making it more expensive for households and businesses to borrow money and increasing the cost of pre-existing debts. Rate hikes also tend to slow the housing market by making mortgage payments more expensive and forcing homeowners to sell at lower prices to compensate for higher borrowing costs.\n\n\n\nFed rate hikes also tend to slow consumer spending as credit card rates increase and declining stock prices give wealthier households less financial wiggle room. Higher interest rates and slower consumer spending also cut into business profit margins, which often leads to declines in hiring and business expansion.\n\n\n\nAs higher rates curb consumer spending and hiring, the Fed hopes to slow the economy enough to reduce price pressures and bring inflation down without causing a recession or job losses. But Powell warned Friday that the U.S. economy will likely feel pain as the Fed continues to ramp up rates.\n\n\n\n“Restoring price stability will take some time and requires using our tools forcefully to bring demand and supply into better balance. Reducing inflation is likely to require a sustained period of below-trend growth,” Powell said.\n\n\n\nEven so, he said the likely dip in economic growth and weaker job market is a necessary sacrifice to prevent a deeper downturn from derailing the economy for longer. He cited the recession invoked by the Fed during the early 1980s after the bank spent 15 years struggling to bring inflation down.\n\n\n\n“History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting,” Powell said.\n\n\n\n“Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now,\" he continued.\n\n\n\nThe Fed has faced criticism from some economists and financial experts for boosting rates to restrictive levels even though many of the forces pushing prices higher are beyond the bank's control. \n\n\n\nThe war in Ukraine has caused prices for food, oil and other key commodities to rise and swing rapidly, pinching household budgets across the world. And while the U.S. has added roughly 2 million jobs since the start of 2022, the size of the workforce is still smaller than before the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Employers have scrambled for years to fill a record number of open jobs, boosting wages and compensation at rapid rates to woo scarce workers.\n\n\n\nPowell, however, said it's the Fed's responsibility to bring inflation down to stable levels regardless of the obstacles in its way.\n\n\n\n\"None of this diminishes the Federal Reserve's responsibility to carry out our assigned task of achieving price stability. There is clearly a job to do in moderating demand to better align with supply. We are committed to doing that job,\" he said.",

        "description": "Families of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre victims on Thursday claimed conspiracy theorist Alex Jones funneled millions of dollars to enrich himself from his company that has now filed for bankruptcy as the families attempt to seek damages through defamation suits.\n\n\n\nThe families filed a motion in a federal bankruptcy court in Houston asking the bankruptcy trustee to take control of Free Speech Systems (FSS), the parent company of far-right website Infowars owned by Jones, and appoint a tort claimants’ committee to represent the families and other creditors’ interests in collecting payment.\n\n\n\nFSS filed for bankruptcy late last month as families of many of the victims of the shooting, which Jones has falsely claimed was a hoax, proceeded with multiple defamation lawsuits in Connecticut and Texas seeking damages for the false claims.\n\n\n\n“So long as FSS possesses its assets and controls its operations, the Sandy Hook Families’ prospects of a full and fair recovery remain in jeopardy,” the motion states.\n\n\n\nThe motion also included a family member of an individual who Jones falsely identified as the shooter in the Parkland massacre in February 2018. That individual passed away in a house fire in May.\n\n\n\nThe families’ attorneys said as the lawsuits were ongoing last summer, FSS conducted “fraudulent transfers” to PQPR Holdings Limited, an entity operated directly and indirectly by Jones and his parents.\n\n\n\nSeventy-two percent of the transfers ultimately went to Jones, and the rest went to his parents, according to the motion.\n\n\n\n“Since the Sandy Hook Families filed their lawsuits, the debtor has systematically transferred millions of dollars to Alex Jones and his relatives and insider entities,” the families’ attorneys wrote in the filing.\n\n\n\nThe motion also alleges Jones “squeeze[d]” FSS into bankruptcy procedures designed to provide additional protections for small business debtors days before a Texas jury ordered Jones to pay millions in damages in a defamation case.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe jury in the defamation case, filed by the parents of one of the children killed at Sandy Hook, ordered Jones to pay $45.2 million in punitive damages earlier this month to the parents and a further $4.1 million for the suffering he put them through by his false claims.\n\n\n\nThe order would have increased debts enough to prevent the company from leveraging the small business protections, according to the motion.\n\n\n\n“FSS’s conduct leading up to and since filing this bankruptcy reveals an out-of-control debtor that is still operated by Jones for the sole benefit of Jones,” the motion states.\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Jones’s attorneys for comment.",

        "link": "https://www.franchisewire.com/10-supercharged-facts-about-ems-technology/",
        "description": "What is EMS Technology?\n\n\n\nYou may have heard of Electrical Muscle Stimulation or EMS Training. If not, you have likely seen images of people working out in what appears to be specialized workout suits.&nbsp;But what exactly is EMS, and does it actually work?\n\n\n\nEMS or Electrical Muscle Stimulation was pioneered in Europe, with more than 1,700 EMS studios in Germany and Austria alone. EMS sends impulses to muscles, helping them contract more times than a conventional workout will allow – without straining joints. \n\n\n\nEMS Technology and Franchising\n\n\n\nThe global muscle stimulation devices market is estimated to be worth $912.1 million by 2027. Pulse Performance Franchising, based in Austin, Texas, offers opportunities to become part of this rapidly-growing industry. Pulse Performance EMS fitness studio franchises combine EMS training and EMS Sculpt with additional services that provide a comprehensive approach to fitness. The leadership team behind Pulse Performance experienced the benefits of EMS technology firsthand and launched the franchise opportunity to make it accessible to everyone. \n\n\n\nPeople seek EMS technology for many reasons: EMS offers an effective workout that’s time efficient. It gives faster results than a regular workout, comes with a personal trainer, produces 98% muscle activation, has zero impact and increases lifespan. \n\n\n\nStill wondering why and for what benefits someone is doing this type of training?&nbsp;Well, here we look at ten amazing facts about EMS.  \n\n\n\n10 Amazing Facts About EMS\n\n\n\nEMS technology benefits everyone from high-level athletes to seniors. \n\n\n1. EMS Helps Athletic Performance\n\n\n\nAthletes can power up their games with EMS fitness training. It increases strength, agility, speed, core stability and dynamic power, helping sports hobbyists and elite athletes improve their game. From golf and tennis to soccer to running, consistent EMS fitness training has benefited athletes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n2. EMS Training is Therapeutic\n\n\n\nEMS training has many therapeutic benefits and helps people achieve wellness goals. EMS sessions offer:\n\n\n\nMuscle recovery and relaxationIncreased flexibility and mobilityMuscle stability, tightening and toningImproved energy levels and circulation&nbsp;\n\n\n\n3. EMS Fitness Machines Build Strength\n\n\n\nEMS fitness machines offer training for strength, endurance and recovery. While EMS strength training is typically performed one to two times per week, EMS endurance and recovery sessions can be done more frequently.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n4. EMS Activates Muscles\n\n\n\nDuring an EMS session, impulses activate more than 98% of muscles simultaneously throughout all major muscle groups. According to Miha Bodytec, a manufacturer of EMS training equipment, each muscle reacts with 85 contractions per second compared to traditional strength training, which only activates one to two contractions per second in one muscle group.\n\n\n\n5. EMS Tones and Sculpts\n\n\n\nEMS Sculpt is used to tone and burn fat in targeted areas. \n\n\nYou can tone and sculpt with EMS workouts. While the most common use of EMS is rehabilitation and fitness training, EMS technology is also used with EMS Sculpt to tone and burn fat in targeted areas. You can shape your body with the power of non-invasive electromagnetic energy.&nbsp;EMS Sculpt is FDA approved to target abs, glutes, arms and thighs. EMS Sculpt has the power to tone muscle and burn fat. This leading-edge technology delivers up to 30,000 contractions in just one 30-minute session. That’s over 22 standard workouts packed into half an hour!&nbsp;\n\n\n\n6. EMS Training is Gentle\n\n\n\nThere’s no heavy lifting with EMS training. EMS offers a great way to work out and get fit, especially when you cannot participate in conventional fitness training. EMS training should always be personalized to your fitness level by a certified EMS trainer. It is low impact and low strain. You can get all the benefits of a traditional workout without lifting, pushing or pulling anything heavy, so you are not taxing your joints or overworking muscles. This significantly reduces the risk of injuries and allows you to enjoy a low-strain, low-impact short workout that still burns calories and helps tone your body while building lean muscle mass. In fact, EMS technology was initially introduced as a means of physical rehab.\n\n\n\n7. EMS Training and Sculpt are Safe and Non-Invasive\n\n\n\nSafety is at the core of EMS Training and EMS Sculpt. Both EMS Training and EMS Sculpt are&nbsp;FDA approved, and specifically, EMS Sculpt is a safe and non-invasive alternative to cosmetic procedures that target fat loss in specific areas. There is no recovery period or downtime with EMS Sculpt.\n\n\n\n8. EMS Technology Offers Flexibility\n\n\n\nEMS technology can be used anytime and anywhere. While full EMS training should be done with a certified EMS trainer, several portable options allow you to use EMS technology for various purposes anytime and anywhere. A TENS unit&nbsp;(Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation) is one of the most common devices. TENS are small devices that use low voltage electrical current to relieve pain in a target area. Some of the most common conditions for which TENS has been used include:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOsteoarthritisFibromyalgiaTendinitis&nbsp;Low back pain.Chronic pelvic pain.Diabetes-related neuropathy&nbsp;Peripheral artery disease\n\n\n\nOther portable options include EMS belts/pads, ab stimulators and wireless EMS suits.\n\n\n\n9. EMS is for Everyone\n\n\n\nEMS sessions are effective and safe for all fitness levels. Whether you are just starting to get fit or are a professional athlete, the training session is low impact and easy on the joints. If you have suffered from an injury or suffer from chronic pain, EMS is still proven safe and beneficial for rehab workouts and workouts for seniors. Hundreds of thousands of people have benefited from EMS, including athletes and celebrities. Even Olympic athletes like Usain Bolt use EMS training in their regimens.\n\n\n\n10. EMS is Fast and Effective\n\n\n\nEMS training sessions are extremely efficient.&nbsp;They last only 20 minutes and deliver the same benefits as two-and-a-half hours of conventional strength training and two hours of high-intensity interval training (HIIT).\n\n\n\nAbout the Pulse Performance Franchise Opportunity\n\n\n\nThe Pulse Performance franchise makes EMS technology accessible to everyone. \n\n\nThe Pulse Performance franchise makes EMS technology accessible to everyone.

In private conversations with White House staffers and allies in Congress this spring, he said he worried that voters who’d never gone to college could resent a move to cancel huge amounts of student debt, according to four Democratic officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to reflect private talks. Biden also said that the federal government should not be bailing out Ivy League graduates, and that his children should not qualify for help,&#8221; the Washington Post reports.\nSaid one senior Democrat: &#8220;He was nervous about how it would play with working-class people.&#8221;\n&#8220;But a relentless campaign was pressing Biden to embrace dramatic action: There were private appeals aboard Air Force One, the courting of first lady Jill Biden, months of political and economic arguments from senior White House staffers, and warnings by Black lawmakers about the dangers of doing too little.

It did not appear to bother them in 2020, nor does it appear likely to bother them in 2022, that their party’s character and coalition keep skewing toward white college graduates. Consciously or not, this is the track the party is currently on &#8212; the cultural left turn of the party makes no sense outside of that context.&#8221;\n&#8220;Between 2012 and 2020, the Democratic advantage among nonwhite working class voters declined by 19 points, while the Democratic advantage increased among white college graduates by 16 points. Stay tuned for more of the same.&#8221;",

        "description": "New research digs into what makes the human brain distinct from that of all other animals—including even our closest primate relatives.\nIn an analysis of cell types in the prefrontal cortex of four primate species, researchers identified species-specific—particularly human-specific—features.\nAnd they found that what makes us human may also makes us susceptible to neuropsychiatric diseases.\nFor the study, the researchers looked specifically at the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), a brain region that is unique to primates and essential for higher-order cognition.\nUsing a single cell RNA-sequencing technique, they profiled expression levels of genes in hundreds of thousands of cells collected from the dlPFC of adult humans, chimpanzees, macaque, and marmoset monkeys.\n&#8220;Today, we view the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as the core component of human identity, but still we don&#8217;t know what makes this unique in humans and distinguishes us from other primate species.&#8221; says Nenad Sestan, professor of neuroscience at Yale University, professor of comparative medicine, of genetics, and of psychiatry. Sestan is also the lead senior author of the paper.\n&#8220;Now we have more clues,&#8221; Sestan says.\nTo answer this, the researchers first asked whether there are there any cell types uniquely present in humans or other analyzed non-human primate species. After grouping cells with similar expression profiles they revealed 109 shared primate cell types but also five that were not common to all species. These included a type of microglia, or brain-specific immune cell, that was present only in humans and a second type shared by only humans and chimpanzees.\nThe human-specific microglia type exists throughout development and adulthood, the researchers found, suggesting the cells play a role in maintenance of the brain upkeep rather than combatting disease.\n&#8220;We humans live in a very different environment with a unique lifestyle compared to other primate species; and glia cells, including microglia, are very sensitive to these differences,&#8221; Sestan says. &#8220;The type of microglia found in the human brain might represent an immune response to the environment.&#8221;\nAn analysis of gene expression in the microglia revealed another human-specific surprise—the presence of the gene FOXP2. This discovery raised great interest because variants of FOXP2 have been linked to verbal dyspraxia, a condition in which patients have difficulty producing language or speech. Other studies have also shown that FOXP2 is associated with other neuropsychiatric diseases, such as autism, schizophrenia, and epilepsy.\nSestan and colleagues found that this gene exhibits primate-specific expression in a subset of excitatory neurons and human-specific expression in microglia.\n&#8220;FOXP2 has intrigued many scientists for decades, but still we had no idea of what makes it unique in humans versus other primate species,&#8221; says co-lead author Shaojie Ma, a postdoctoral associate in Sestan&#8217;s lab. &#8220;We are extremely excited about the FOXP2 findings because they open new directions in the study of language and diseases.&#8221;\nThe research appears in the journal Science. Additional authors are from Yale and the University of Wisconsin-Madison.\nFunding for the research came from the National Institutes of Health and National Institute of Mental Health.\nSource: Yale University\nThe post What makes human brains special may also make us vulnerable appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "People who were more distressed—showing signs of anxiety or depression—during the COVID-19 pandemic were less likely to follow distancing guidelines, but more likely to get vaccinated, a new study shows.\nResearchers refer to this as differential distress: when people act safely in one aspect while disregarding safety in another, both in response to the same psychological distress. This creates a conundrum for those trying to determine how best to communicate risks and best practices to the public.\nThe study of 810 people revealed that distress was less likely to affect older people either way, despite their higher risk for severe outcomes if infected with SARS-CoV-2. The findings, published in Frontiers in Psychology, suggest that fear messaging, which is intended to scare people and can increase their levels of distress, may not be the most effective way to encourage people to change behaviors.\n&#8220;These findings do not point to a straightforward public health messaging campaign,&#8221; says Joel Myerson, research professor in psychological &amp; brain sciences at Washington University in St. Louis.\n&#8220;Instead, officials may have to consider more finely tailored messages for different populations in order to achieve best outcomes: more attention to CDC recommendations as well as more people getting vaccinated.&#8221;\nThis is the second study from Myerson and colleagues to analyze the ways people changed behaviors during the pandemic. The first study, published in November in the journal PLOS ONE, looked at social distancing and hygiene behaviors across a range of demographics.\n&#8220;What really motivates many people to change behaviors for the better is considering how their actions can benefit, or harm, other people.&#8221;\nThe results suggested that distress was closely tied to the way people responded to recommendations about social distancing. People who were more distressed were less likely to observe social distancing recommendations, perhaps as a way to maintain social connections that can ease anxiety and depression.\nIn the latest work, researchers again asked people about their adherence to the latest CDC recommendations, including newer recommendations outlining when to wear a mask and suggesting that people avoid spending lots of time inside with others. The results showed similar correlations to the previous study among age, distress, and behavior changes.\nIn terms of public health and effective messaging, one of the most pressing issues to arise after publication of the first study was the introduction of vaccines—and the myriad ways people felt about them. Looking at four categories—fully vaccinated, partially vaccinated, unvaccinated but likely to get one, unvaccinated and unlikely to get one—several findings stood out:\n\nPeople who had been fully vaccinated were more likely than those who were partially vaccinated to have close interactions with others following their shots.\nRelative to those who said they were unlikely to get vaccinated, those who said they were likely to do so thought their chance of infection was higher.\nDepending on the person&#8217;s age, they responded differently to the same level of stress. Overall, for example, the higher level of distress someone had, the less likely they were to social distance, but the more likely they were to get vaccinated. Both of these correlations became weaker, however, as people aged.\n\nFear messaging that tries to scare people into following guidelines tends to be useful only for a one-time event, says Leonard Green, professor of psychological and brain sciences and of economics. &#8220;Ostensibly, getting vaccinated should count as such an event.&#8221;\nBut as breakthrough cases increase and boosters add up, vaccinations are no longer one and done; they are instead a series of events, spread out over more than a year.\nAlthough fear-based messaging may encourage younger people to get vaccinated, it also diminishes their resolve to stick to mitigation behaviors like social distancing. Without doing both, the risk of breakthrough infections could continue to rise.\nAnd, the research shows, messaging becomes less effective as people age—and become more susceptible to severe illness if they&#8217;re infected.\n&#8220;Part of the solution to the problem of differential distress may be to avoid the distress altogether,&#8221; Green says, by forgoing the fear campaign. Instead, a gentler approach may be warranted. &#8220;Our previous work suggests that what really motivates many people to change behaviors for the better is considering how their actions can benefit, or harm, other people.&#8221;\nThe National Institute on Aging of the National Institutes of Health funded the work.\nSource: Washington University in St. Louis\nThe post COVID distress upped vax rates, but not distancing appeared first on Futurity.",

The publication of Life in the English Country House: A Social and Architectural History in 1978 captured the zeitgeist in a period when stately homes were being repurposed as sites of mass leisure. It sold more than 140,000 copies in hardback.When Girouard started his career the study of architectural history in Britain was dominated by the German-trained Nikolaus Pevsner, for whom the discipline was essentially about tracking artistic styles through intense formal and spatial analysis. In contrast, Girouard’s books placed buildings within their cultural, social and intellectual milieu. The results were scholarly, but also immensely fun, gossipy and stylish. Continue reading...",

        "description": "President Biden leads former President Trump by just 1 point in a hypothetical 2024 presidential election rematch, according to an Emerson College poll released Friday. \n\n\n\nThe results showed Biden with 43 percent of the vote to Trump’s 42 percent, with 8 percent planning to vote for someone else and 6 percent undecided. Spencer Kimball, the executive director of Emerson College Polling, said in the announcement of the results that this is the first Emerson poll this year in which Biden leads Trump in such a match-up. \n\n\n\nCompared to Emerson’s poll on the head-to-head last month, Biden improved by 2 points and Trump fell two. \n\n\n\nThe poll found voters are closely divided over whether the FBI’s search of Trump’s Mar-a-Lago property earlier this month for presidential records, including some classified and sensitive documents, made them more or less likely to support him. Thirty-six percent of respondents said they were less likely to support him, 30 percent said they were more likely and 34 percent said the search has no effect on their opinion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s approval rating in the poll rose 2 points to 42 percent, while his disapproval rating dropped 2 points to 51 percent. Republicans kept the one-point lead in the generic congressional ballot that they had in last month’s poll, leading 45 percent to 44 percent. \n\n\n\nThe poll also showed a split on Biden’s decision to forgive up to $10,000 in student loan debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 per year, with 36 percent saying it goes too far, 35 percent saying it is the right amount of action and 28 percent saying it does not go far enough.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nProgressives had urged Biden to cancel as much as $50,000 per borrower, while Republicans have slammed him for canceling any debt. \n\n\n\nHalf of all respondents listed the economy as their most important issue, while abortion and health care each tied for second with 9 percent listing them as most important.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe poll was conducted from Aug. 23 to 24 among 1,000 registered voters. The margin of error was 3 points.",

        "description": "Researchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business estimated the price tag of President Biden’s student debt plan could grow to more than $1 trillion over the next decade if certain conditions take hold.\n\n\n\nThe study found the plan would cost $605 billion over the next decade under strict assumptions, but the price tag in other conditions could grow to more than $1 trillion, a scenario the researchers said “requires further study.”\n\n\n\nBiden on Wednesday announced the long-awaited plan, which cancels thousands of dollars in debt for many borrowers, extends a payment pause until the end of the year and caps monthly payments at a percentage of borrowers’ incomes.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration had faced pressure from many Democrats to take executive action on student debt, but the announcement has also been met with criticism from Republicans and some moderate Democrats who expressed worry over the plan’s cost and its impact on already high inflation rates.\n\n\n\nWhen asked at a press briefing on Thursday, White House officials declined to give a price tag for the decision, saying “it depends” on how many borrowers take up the offer.\n\n\n\nThe most prominent part of the plan cancels up to $10,000 in student debt for individuals making less than $125,000, while Pell Grant recipients under the same income cap are eligible for up to $20,000 in debt forgiveness. The income caps are doubled for families.\n\n\n\nThe Wharton researchers found that proposal will cost between $469 billion and $519 billion over the 10-year budget window, with the higher amount representing if the plan ultimately includes future students and students currently enrolled in college with loan deferral status. \n\n\n\nBiden also announced plans to extend a pause on student loan payments put in place during the pandemic one final time. Payments were set to resume in September, but Biden extended the pause until the end of the year.\n\n\n\nThat plan will cost an additional $16 billion, according to the study.\n\n\n\nSome economists argue any inflation increases driven by the debt cancellation will be offset by the payment resumption next year.\n\n\n\nThe third prong of Biden’s plan will cap monthly loan payments at 5 percent of undergraduate loan borrowers’ discretionary income and cover their unpaid monthly interest. For borrowers who originally took out loans of $12,000 or less, the plan reduces the number of years before the government forgives the balance from 20 years to 10 years.\n\n\n\nWharton researchers found that under strict assumptions about borrowing behavior, the proposal would cost $70 billion.\n\n\n\nBut the researchers noted that future details of the program and behavior changes among borrowers could increase the cost of the proposal to $450 billion or more, which would make the total plan cost over $1 trillion.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday is the 102nd anniversary of women's suffrage in the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the century since ratification of the 19th amendment, significant gains have been made with regard to women’s rights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the economic toll of the COVID-19 pandemic on women, along with the recent decision to revoke a woman’s right to an abortion have some questioning whether American women are truly equal to men in 2022. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday marks Women’s Equality Day, a motion first introduced in 1971 to commemorate August 26, 1920 — when women in the United States won the right to vote — and formally adopted in 1973. \n\n\n\nOne hundred years after women’s suffrage prevailed in its fight to amend the U.S. constitution, questions of equality remain at the forefront of the national conversation, especially in light of the Supreme Court’s recent decision to overturn Roe v Wade.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“On Women’s Equality Day, we honor the movement for universal suffrage that led to the 19th Amendment, celebrate the progress of women over the years, and renew our commitment to advancing gender equity and protecting women’s rights,” President Biden said in a proclamation.\n\n\n\n“This commitment is more important than ever in the wake of the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade and eliminate a woman’s constitutional right to choose. My Administration is doing everything in its power to protect access to the reproductive health care that generations of women and activists have fought for, including abortion.”\n\n\n\nTo understand progress made and strides yet to be accomplished, it’s important to take a look back at the origins of the equal rights movement and track progress made throughout the years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDecades of protest preceded the inclusion of the 19th amendment into the U.S. constitution.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdvocates, lead by early feminists Alice Paul and Carrie Chapman Catt, began to organize as early as the 1800s to win the right to vote, but the world’s first women’s rights convention — held in 1848 at Seneca Falls, New York — is credited with formally kicking off the movement in America.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWomen’s suffrage was first proposed in 1878 and several states in the western region of the country adopted state provisions granting women the right to vote as early as 1912. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough the 19th amendment was technically ratified on August 18, 1920, the move became official on the 26th, after then U.S. Secretary of State Bainbridge Colby signed a proclamation finalizing the motion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, for many women of color, the right to vote was not guaranteed until the Voting Rights Act went into effect 45 years later.\n\n\n\nIn 1923, Paul went on to draft the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) with Crys­tal East­man, which would guarantee equal legal rights for all Americans regardless of sex and end legal distinctions between men and women with regard to divorce, employment, and other areas.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNearly 100 years later, the amendment has yet to be included in the United States constitution, despite gaining support from the necessary 38 states. One hurdle of many precluding the amendment’s finalization is the fact five states have since rescinded their support. Ratification deadlines set by Congress following the measure’s approval have also expired.\n\n\n\nThe 1970s’ second wave feminism saw a resurgence of interest in passing the ERA. Its original text was tweaked in 1972 to read: “Equal­ity of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex. The Congress shall have the power to enforce, by appro­pri­ate legis­la­tion, the provi­sions of this article.”\n\n\n\nOne year prior, Bella Abzug (D-NY) introduced the concept of Women’s Equality Day, to commemorate August 26 as the day women achieved suffrage, though two years passed before it became nationally recognized.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbzug was a feminist and civil rights advocate who supported passage of the ERA throughout her tenure in office.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDespite the work of hundreds of women throughout American history, gender gaps in pay, employment, and leadership positions persist.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2020, American women earned 84 percent of that earned by men, meaning women would have to work an extra 42 days to make up for the difference, data from Pew Research show.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, the COVID-19 pandemic has derailed career trajectories for many working women given the fact women are more often caregivers for children, who demanded increased attention as school went online and day cares posed exposure concerns.\n\n\n\nAn analysis from the Brookings Institution found women are disproportionately represented in low-wage jobs and continue to face discrimination in the labor market. According to the report, “one out of four women who became unemployed during the pandemic reported the job loss was due to a lack of childcare, twice the rate of men surveyed.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor women of color, the crisis took an even larger toll. A December 2020 jobs report found while men gained 16,000 jobs, women lost 156,000. However, further analyses of these data “show that white women actually gained jobs while Black and Latina women made up the majority of the losses,” wrote Arghavan Salles, a surgeon at Stanford University in 2021.\n\n\n\nSome advocates still push for the passage of the ERA to address these widespread issues.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Women’s equality cannot wait another century. That’s why I have been proud to join over 200 of my congressional colleagues on a bill to remove the arbitrary deadline from the ERA. In March 2021, I also re-introduced the ERA in the House, as I have in every session of Congress since 1997,” wrote Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) in a recent editorial for The Hill.\n\n\n\n“This Women’s Equality Day, let’s not leave it up to the next Congress to pass the ERA. This is the year we knock down any unnecessary obstacle to ensure that equal rights for women are enshrined in the Constitution once and for all.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "Caribbean people in Minnesota gather at a past celebration of the annual Guyana Day. Events celebrate communities that are part of the larger Caribbean region.Courtesy of Trevor SamarooWhen Trevor Samaroo first started the non-profit group Minnesota Guyana Day a few years ago, there weren’t many events that focused on Guyanese culture. As a child of one of the first waves of Caribbean immigrants to come to Minnesota, Samaroo grew up watching his dad create spaces for Caribbean families to gather together. He knew he wanted to do the same. Guyana is a country located in South America that is tied to Caribbean culture through its traditions, music and food. According to the U.S. Census, there are nearly 8,000 Caribbean people living in Minnesota and Samaroo says the Guyanese community in Minnesota is growing.While there were events celebrating communities part of the larger Caribbean region which includes Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago, Haiti and the Bahamas, Samaroo said the organizers of Minnesota Guyana Day wanted a space to celebrate their own unique traditions.“Let’s do something where everyone can come out and enjoy, celebrate the culture and represent what we have here in Minnesota,” Samaroo said. “A lot of people are learning now around the country, but people in the community know that in little pockets across the state that there is a very big population here.”This year’s event, “Guyana Night,” will take place on Saturday at the Eritrean Community Center in St. Paul. It features three popular artists from Guyana and Trinidad; Poowah Vanita Willie, Fiona Singh and Mahendra Ramkellawan — artists Samaroo says members of the community have been excited to see.“We’re just trying to focus on this type of music that you really won&#x27;t hear anywhere else in Minnesota or the Midwest. You would have to go with some of these larger populated areas like Toronto, New York, Orlando and Miami.” Samaroo said.Samaroo says “Guyana Night” is also an opportunity for the Guyanese community to share their culture with others and make their presence known in Minnesota. The event will also feature traditional Guyanese and Caribbean food.“As a Guyanese person, if you’re asked, ‘Where are you from? Where&#x27;s your family from?’ It’s ‘Oh you’re from the Caribbean? You must be from Jamaica,’” Samaroo recalled. “The West Indies is a very diverse place and that’s why we try to educate people and represent our people to let them know we’re here.”",

        "description": "Robert Habeck is trying to correct his first major misstep.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGermany’s Green vice chancellor has had a fairly good crisis so far — but his plans for a gas levy on consumers have drawn a backlash.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLast week, the government in Berlin passed the so-called gas surcharge, which will see Germans pay a few cents extra per kilowatt-hour of gas, meaning an average four-person household will pay €480 more a year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe revenues are meant to finance a support fund for struggling energy companies to ensure the country’s supply won’t be disrupted as utilities face soaring costs for replacing Russian imports. A large chunk will go to Uniper, which recorded billions in losses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut this week, it emerged that companies raking in record-high profits could also benefit from the surcharge.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConsumer protection groups were outraged. \n\n\n\n&#8220;It is incomprehensible that with the gas levy [households] should support companies that are making a tidy profit,” said Federal Consumer Association chair Ramona Pop.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHabeck, Germany’s economy and climate minister, initially tried to defend his policy and asked profit-making companies to voluntarily waive any support claims. But after mounting criticism from the opposition and even within his own government, he backtracked.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt a business conference Thursday evening, Habeck said he would try to limit which companies can benefit from the revenues and acknowledged the current design of the levy presented a “political problem” that “has really ruined my day for the last 48 hours.”\n\n\n\nThe criticism, he admitted, was “correct.” He added that the current design meant companies may have a “legally justified claim. We will look at that again to see if there is a way to ward off this justified claim,” signaling potential legal problems with revising the levy at this stage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“But,” he said, according to a transcript of the speech, “it is certainly not morally right for companies that —&nbsp;let me say it plainly — have earned big bucks to say: &#8216;For the handful of revenue losses we had, we&#8217;ll ask the population &#8230; to also give us money.&#8217;”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFinance Minister Christian Lindner also said he was open to revising the measure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor Habeck, whose popularity has soared far past Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s approval ratings, the gas levy marks his first significant blunder since taking office in December.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn previous months, he’s been busy shoring up Germany’s energy supply for the winter. That meant restarting coal plants, begging Middle Eastern autocrats for fossil fuels and taking another look at the country’s nuclear phaseout — a less-than-ideal image for a Green climate minister.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut he’s won plaudits for solid crisis management. Germany’s gas storage sites are more than 80 percent full — well ahead of schedule — a demand reduction plan has just been approved, and a major renewables bill was passed by parliament earlier this summer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe levy’s design, however, prompted criticism even from within the coalition. Social Democrat chair Saskia Esken and Green youth wing leader Sarah-Lee Heinrich were among those who attacked the plan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&#8220;It can’t be that society should now bear the losses while many companies have made excess profits during this crisis,” said Heinrich. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of&nbsp;POLITICO Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one-stop-shop solution for policy professionals fusing the depth of POLITICO journalism with the power of technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive, breaking scoops and insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomized policy intelligence platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-level public affairs network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY GO PRO\n\n\n\nLOG IN",

        "description": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Several people who were arrested last week as part of Gov. Ron DeSantis’ voter fraud crackdown were notified by official government entities they were eligible to vote, according to court documents and interviews. The defendants told authorities they had no intention of committing voter fraud, according to affidavits, and in some cases were baffled by their arrests because counties had sent them voter registration cards and approved them to vote. The defendants were vilified by the governor during a high profile press conference last week, where DeSantis announced the arrest of 20 people — convicted murderers and sex offenders — who allegedly cast votes in the 2020 election when they weren’t eligible to. The defendants, because of their convictions, weren’t permitted to vote. DeSantis highlighted their arrests to show his new $1.1 million election security office, created during the 2022 legislative session, was paying off and rooting out bad actors looking to commit voter fraud. Such fraud has become a top tier issue for Republicans across the country, including DeSantis, who has championed a series of election reform bills, including the creation of a first-of-its kind election investigations unit housed under Republican Attorney General Ashley Moody. In the days since the announcement, however, several of those arrested have told media outlets or authorities that they had no idea they were not eligible to vote. In court documents filed in five counties, most say at least one official government body — in most cases a local election supervisor — incorrectly indicated to them they could vote, including allowing them to register and sending them voter cards in the mail.   Court records show that many who were swept up by authorities have little education or financial resources and are now back in the state’s criminal justice system. Florida Department of Law Enforcement special agents interviewed the defendants over a few days in early August before arresting them last Thursday. Peter Washington, a 59-year-old Black man from Orlando, who served 10 years in prison related to sexual battery conviction, told a Florida Department of Law Enforcement special agent that prison officials informed him he could vote. At the time, he was taking classes to transition back into society as his release date from prison approached. He received no indication from the Orange County Supervisor of Elections office that he was not eligible to vote. “Washington received a voter registration form in the mail, filled it out and mailed it back to the Orange County Supervisor of Elections Office,” read an affidavit filed by authorities in Orange County court. “The Orange County Supervisor of Elections mailed him a voter card.” Voting rights groups have been highly critical of Florida’s creation of the election investigation office and DeSantis’ decision to arrest 20 people. They argue it's symptomatic of an overall broken system, and that the people could have been removed from the voting rolls rather than arrested in their homes, especially considering local election officials had permitted them to vote. “To see the state going after folks and dragging them out of their homes in handcuffs and throwing them in jail, that is just overreach, especially when the state knows there was not intent,” said Desmond Meade, executive director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition. Meade was one of the chief architects of Amendment 4, which voters approved in 2018 and setup a framework for most ex-felons to regain their voting rights. Michelle Stribling, a 52-year-old Black woman from Eatonville convicted in 1993 of second degree murder, told investigators during an Aug. 5 interview at her house that she “could not read or write very well,” and did not understand questions related to her status as an ex-felon on registration paperwork. But Orange County election officials mailed her a voter card after she registered, which led her to believe she was able to vote. “Stribling believed that her rights were restored because she completed the voter registration application and received a voter registration card,” read her probable cause affidavit. Leo Grant, a 55-year-old Black man from South Bay, told Florida department of law enforcement special agents he has been diagnosed with stress, depression and wears a pacemaker. He also told authorities that a local election office sent him a voter identification card and was able to vote without issue. “Grant remembers filling out his vote-by-mail ballot at his house and mailing it in for the November 2020 election by putting it in a Post Office mailbox,” read the criminal affidavit. Grant told the Miami Herald last Friday, one day after the DeSantis press conference and his arrest, that he was completely confused by the ordeal. “I don’t really understand, how did I commit fraud?” Grant told the newspaper. “I don’t understand any of this stuff.” Meade said it should be reasonable for citizens to trust that when the government tells them they can vote, that they are eligible. “It is their [government’s] responsibility to make the determination on eligibility to vote and to send you a voter education card,” Meade said. “It is purely natural for a citizen to rely on the government to make those determinations and that they be accurate.” His group on Thursday set up a bail and legal defense fund for those arrested, most of which do not have significant personal financial resources. “We don’t want anyone to take plea deals just because they can’t pay bail,” Meade said. “They are in danger of losing their jobs, and some are key providers for their families. This could impact more than just the individuals.” Meade said his group is now advising that those arrested not speak to anyone, including the media, until they have attorneys other than public defenders, which his group is helping facilitate at no charge. Attorney Larry S. Davis, who is representing one of the men arrested in Miami-Dade for free, said his client was arrested at 6 a.m. when a SWAT team banged on his door. “He was in his underwear, and they would not let him get clothed before taking him to jail,” Davis said. “There were people in his backyard who were armed, and they used a helicopter. It disrupted the entire neighborhood very early in the morning.” Davis would not identify which client he represented because the person is concerned they will lose their job over the arrest. “They were approached to register to vote at a local WalMart. When they said they could not register because they were a felon, the person there said they could because Amendment 4 passed,” David said. “They helped him fill out the paperwork. He later got a voter card, and thought he could vote. That was two years ago.” The defendants come from Orange, Palm Beach, Hillsborough, Miami-Dade and Broward counties. Only Miami-Dade County responded when asked for comment. Suzy Trutie, the deputy Supervisor of Elections in Miami-Dade County said that when a county gets a registration applications they are forwarded to the state, which uses a series of databases to verify the person’s identity. “After the verification process has been completed, the State notifies the County that the person’s eligibility has been confirmed,” she said via email. “Finally, the County issues a voter registration card to the elector.” Alison Novoay, spokesperson for the Palm Beach County Supervisor of elections, said in an email that the state notifies their office when a prospective or registered voter is convicted of a felony or otherwise ineligible. After that, the Supervisor of Elections removes them from their voting lists. “We were not notified by the state prior to 2022 that these individuals were ineligible,” she said. “Upon notification we immediately commenced the removal process.” After the story was posted, DeSantis’ communications director Taryn Fenske sent a statement to POLITICO pointing to a state statute that “the supervisor must ensure that any eligible applicant for voter registration is registered to vote.” “I want to point out that when you register to vote in Florida, you check a box to affirm that you are not a convicted felon, or if you are, your right to vote has been restored,” Fenske said after POLITICO’s story posted. “The murders and sex offenders that were arrested have due process, and they will get the opportunity to make their case.” She did not answer follow-up questions about whether she believes the state has any role in verifying voter eligibility, as both Palm Beach and Miami-Dade election officials indicated they do. A rule instituted by the Florida Department of State, which administers elections, in 2009 outlines that the state “shall identify voters … who are potentially ineligible based on a felony conviction without civil rights restored.” Once identified, that list “shall be provided to the Supervisors of Elections.” The governor’s office did not respond Friday night when asked about this rule. When DeSantis announced the arrests during a press conference at the Broward County courthouse, he said it was just the first wave of arrests. Beyond felons, his election investigations office is looking at allegations that undocumented immigrations may have illegally voted as well as individuals who voted twice in one election. There have been three arrests made in The Villages, a Republican stronghold in central Florida, related to people admitting they voted twice in the 2020 election. DeSantis did not hold events highlighting those arrested, each of whom entered pretrial diversion programs and avoided jail time. “This is just the first step. There are many more in the pipeline” DeSantis said during last week’s press conference. “We are not just going to turn a blind eye to this. The days of that happening in Florida are over.”",

        "description": "Security is often seen as a zero-sum game between “go fast” or “stay secure.” We would like to challenge this school of thought and introduce a framework to change that paradigm to a “win-win game,” so you can do both—“go fast” and “stay secure.” Historically, application security tools have been implemented much like a gate at a parking lot. The parking lot has perimeter-based ingress and egress boom gates. The boom gates let one car through at a time, and vehicles often are backed up at the gates during busy hours. However, there are few controls once you get inside. You can access nearly any space on any level and easily move between levels.When you apply this analogy to application development, AppSec tools are often implemented as \"toll gates\" within waterfall-native workflows. Developers are required to get in line, submit to a security scan, and wait to see the results. When the results are produced, developers spend significant time and energy investigating red flags raised by security. This process is slow and, not surprisingly, not very popular with developers. It’s why they often view traditional security programs as inhibitors to innovation.Guardrails not gatesWe suggest a workflow that’s less like a parking lot gate and more like a freeway with common-sense safety measures. Freeways have directive rules for all users. Speed limits, single direction of travel, and mandatory speed reduction zones when exiting contribute to freeway safety. Some freeways implement preventative measures based on these rules, such as physical walls dividing opposite flows of traffic and protective guardrails to reduce collisions and keep vehicles from veering off the road. While driving on a freeway comes with its own complications, there are no boom-style gates blocking your path. Following the same directive rules, there are detective and responsive controls, such as speed detectors, cameras, signs reminding drivers which direction they are going, and how fast they are traveling. Some freeways have deployed rumble strips to remind a dozing driver to stay in their lane. Applying lessons from freeways to application development and compliance in the cloud represents the perfect opportunity to build software more securely.Modern application security tools should be fully automated, largely invisible to developers, and minimize friction within the DevOps pipeline. To do this, these security tools should work the way developers want to work. Security controls should integrate into the development lifecycle early and everywhere. These controls should live within the developer's preferred tools and create rapid feedback loops so mistakes can be remediated as soon as possible.A typical compliance cycle looks like this:Here, we highlight the gap between the desired state and the actual state that becomes problematic when audit times come. This increases the overall cost of the audit and the time spent in generating the evidence of controls.Instead, this is what we need.We need the actual state to track the desired state continuously. We need continuous preventative controls to stop insecure resources from being introduced. We need detective controls to find non-compliant resources promptly and constantly. We need responsive controls to fix non-compliant resources automatically. In all, we need continuous compliance.Infrastructure continuous compliance reference architectureHow do we get started with continuous compliance? Here is the reference architecture that enables you to develop this capability.The architecture is centered on building a close-loop of directive, preventative, detective and responsive controls. It is also open and extensible. Although we reference Google Cloud architectures in this blog, you can use them for other cloud service platforms or even on-premise. The National Institute of Standards and Technology’s Open Security Controls Assessment Language (OSCAL) is a helpful resource to express your control library in a machine-readable format. OSCAL can allow organizations to define a set of security and privacy requirements, which are represented as controls, which then can be grouped together as a control catalog. Organizations can use these catalogs to establish security and privacy control baselines through a process that may aggregate and tailor controls from multiple source catalogs. Using the OSCAL profile model to express a baseline makes the mappings between the control catalog and the profile explicit and machine-readable.Directive controlsThe starting point of the close-loop is the directive and harmonized controls. Next, you should have control mappings rationalized to the technical controls against your compliance requirements. These requirements can come from various sources, such as the threat landscape of your industry, your internal security policies and standards, your external regulatory compliance, and industry best practice frameworks. Control mappings will form a Technical Control Library. The library is a dataset mapping out harmonized controls to requirements written in different compliance frameworks. The control mapping justifies the security controls. It builds the linkage between security and compliance and helps you reduce your compliance audit cost. This dataset should be a living document. An easy first step in building such as library is to begin with the CIS Google Cloud Platform Foundation Benchmark. The benchmark is lightweight and it constitutes foundational security any entity should get right on Google Cloud. In addition, Security Command Center Premium’s  Security Health Analytics can help you to monitor your Google Cloud environment against these benchmarks  on a continuous basis across all the projects within your organization. The Technical Control Library will guide the rest of the closed-loop. For every directive control, you should have corresponding preventative control to stop non-compliant resources from being deployed. You should have the detective control to look over the entire environment seeking non-compliant resources. And you should have the responsive control remedying non-compliant resources automatically or kicking off responsive workflow with your Security Operations function. Finally, every policy evaluation point should have a feedback loop to the engineers. A prompt and meaningful feedback loop provides a better engineering experience and increases development velocity in the short run. These feedback loops will breed good behaviors to write better and more secure code in the long run.Preventive controlsAlmost every action on the Google Cloud is an API call, such as when creating, configuring, or deleting resources, so preventative controls are all about API call constraints. There are different wrappers for these API calls, including Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) solutions such as Terraform or Google Cloud Deployment Manager, the Cloud Console interface, Cloud Shell SDK, Python, or GO SDK. As with any other application code deployment, the IaC solutions should use a Continuous Integration (CI) solution. On the CI, you could orchestrate IaC constraints, similar to writing unit tests for application code. Since all IaC solutions come in or can be converted to JSON format, you can use Open Policy Agent (OPA) as the IaC constraint solution. OPA’s Rego policy language is declarative and flexible, which allows you to construct almost any policy in Rego. For the input sources that are not IaC, you could fall back to the organization policies and IAM as these two controls have the closest proximity to Google Cloud. That said, it’s considered a best practice to restrict non-IaC inputs for higher environments such as production-like or production, so you could codify your infrastructure, apply controls and workflows in the source repository. Detective and responsive controlsEven if you've nailed the preventive controls, and the cloud environment is sterile, we still need detective and responsive controls. Here’s why. For one, not all the controls can be safely implemented as preventative controls in the real world. For instance, we may not fail all the Google Compute Engine deployments at the CI if these VMs have external IP addresses because external IP addresses may be required for a specific software or use cases. Another reason is that we want to produce time-stamped compliance status for audit purposes. Taking the CIS compliance as an example, we could have enforced all the CIS check on the CI and set IaC as the only deployment source for cloud infrastructure. However, we will still need to demonstrate the runtime CIS compliance report using Security Command Center. Security responsive controls are not limited to remediation actions. They can also take the form of notifications via email, messaging tools, or integration with ITSM systems. If you use Terraform to deploy the infrastructure and use Cloud Function for auto-remediation, you need to pay attention to the Terraform state. Since auto-remediation actions performed by Cloud Function are not recorded in the Terraform state file, you will need to inform the engineers to update the source Terraform code.The futureThe fact that manual processes around security and compliance don’t scale points to automation as the next enabler. The economics of automation require a systemic discipline and holistic enterprise-wide approach to regulatory compliance and cloud risk management. By defining a data model of the compliance process, the aforementioned OSCAL represents a game-changer for automation in risk management and regulatory compliance. While we realize that adopting “as code” practices is a long-term investment for most of our customers, Risk and Compliance as Code (RCaC) has a number of building blocks to get you started. By adopting the RCaC tenets you shift towards codified policies and infrastructure for a secure cloud transformation. Stay tuned as we introduce exciting new capabilities and features to Google Cloud Risk and Compliance as Code in the months to come.",

        "description": "When Dassana co-founders Gaurav Kumar and Parth Shah, formerly founder and founding engineer at RedLock (now Prisma Cloud by Palo Alto Networks), set out on a new startup journey in 2020, they knew exactly where to start: sign up for Google Workspace.  “Every startup I’ve been at, we used Google Workspace,” said Kumar. “We’ve been using it for so long, and we’re all used to it. It’s like drinking water—you don’t think about it.” “We’re big on user experience,” explained Shah. “Google is one of the few companies out there that is all about building the right kind of user experience that’s easy to follow. The sharing capabilities are amazing and, of course, easy to use. Docs, Sheets, Slides—we use all of it.” Dassana, which emerged from stealth with $5 million in seed funding earlier this year, is a next-generation security data lake. It provides a holistic picture of security risk across an organization and its business units by ingesting large volumes of structured data in a schema-less fashion. Their success is a great testament to why startups are choosing not only Google Workspace, but a range of Google Cloud products. Though the Dassana team was comfortable with Workspace from the start, not all their early technology choices were the best fit for the company, and Google Cloud services became more crucial as the startup evolved. For example, the team opted to use Amazon Web Services (AWS) to start their cloud journey, but ultimately started to explore other cloud options when they decided to run their technology platform on Kubernetes.  “We started looking into which cloud platforms provide the best Kubernetes experience,” said Kumar. “Hands-down, Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) had the best experience. If you look at product velocity and how GKE has evolved over time, from its early days to GKE Autopilot and all the features and other native integrations—nothing even comes close.”In particular, Kumar noted that the native integration between Google Workspace and GKE was particularly unique and useful. “When I go to Google Workspace and then go to GKE, my identity is already there,” he said. “I don’t have to integrate or manage anything. If I disable an account in Workspace, it’s also disabled on GKE.” Another advantage is that GKE allows you to set up Google Groups to work with Kubernetes role-based access control (RBAC) for GKE clusters. This lets administrators maintain users and groups outside of GKE and assign RBAC permissions directly to Groups in Workspace without any extra engineering work or overhead management. “I can actually use my Workspace identity to give granular controls to my GKE workloads. The integration of Google Groups in GKE and Kubernetes is a lifesaver. It’s saved us a lot of hassles,” said Kumar. Kumar also noted that the platform delivers better performance compared to other solutions thanks to the low latency of Google Cloud’s global network. Like many startups, Dassana has found a powerful combination in Google Workspace and GKE on Google Cloud that lets them connect technologies, easily collaborate with their teams, and rapidly build their product. The team also recognizes the necessity of continued innovation, and is exploring additional Google Cloud products to help them accelerate their momentum. For example, Dassana plans to use the performance and scale of Cloud Storage buckets to store the company’s data. The team is also investigating how to save time by using Pub/Sub to integrate data directly from Google Workspace and other sources for security analytics. To learn more about why startups like Dassana are choosing Google Workspace and Google Cloud to accelerate their growth and reach their goals, visit our startup solutions pages for Google Workspace and Google Cloud.Related ArticleHow PicnicHealth is revolutionizing healthcare with Google Workspace and Google CloudHealthcare startup PicnicHealth uses Google Cloud and Google Workspace to revolutionize healthcare data.Read Article",

        "link": "https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/data-analytics/best-practices-for-spatial-clustering-in-bigquery/",
        "description": "Most data analysts are familiar with the concept of organizing data into clusters so that it can be queried faster and at a lower cost. The user behavior dictates how the dataset should be clustered: for example, when a user seeks to analyze or visualize geospatial data (a.k.a location data), it is most efficient to cluster on a geospatial column. This practice is known as spatial clustering, and in this blog, we will share best practices for implementing it in BigQuery (hint — let BigQuery do it for you). BigQuery is a petabyte-scale data warehouse that has many geospatialcapabilities and functions. In the following sections, we will describe how BigQuery does spatial clustering out of the box using the S2 indexing system. We will also touch on how to use other spatial indexes like H3 and geohash, and compare the cost savings of different approaches. How BigQuery does spatial clustering under the hoodClustering ensures that blocks of data with similar values are colocated in storage, which means that the data is easier to retrieve at query time. It also sorts the blocks of data, so that only the necessary blocks need to be scanned, which reduces cost and processing time. In geospatial terms, this means that when you’re querying a particular region, only the rows within or close to that region are scanned, rather than the whole globe.All of the optimizations described above will occur automatically in BigQuery if you cluster your tables on a GEOGRAPHY column. It’s as easy as typing CLUSTER BY [GEOGRAPHY] when creating the table. Only predicate functions (e.g. ST_Intersects, ST_DWithin) leverage clustering, with the exception of ST_DISJOINT. It should also be noted that while BigQuery supports partitioning and clustering on a variety of fields, only clustering is supported on a geospatial field. This is because geometries can be large and could span across partitions, no matter how BigQuery chooses to partition the space. Finally, cluster sizes will range from 100MB to 1GB, so clustering on a table smaller than 100MB will provide no benefit.When writing to a table that is clustered by GEOGRAPHY, BigQuery shards the data into spatially-compact blocks. For each block, BigQuery computes a bit of metadata called an S2 covering that includes the spatial area of the data contained within. When querying a geography-clustered table using spatial predicates, BigQuery reads the covering and evaluates whether a particular covering can satisfy the filter. BigQuery then prunes the blocks that cannot satisfy the filter. Users are only charged for data from remaining blocks. Note that S2 coverings can overlap, as it is often impossible to divide data into non-overlapping regions. Fundamentally, BigQuery is using the S2 index to map a geometry into a 64-bit integer, then BigQuery clusters on that integer using existing integer-based clustering mechanisms. In the past, customers have manually implemented an S2 indexing system in BigQuery. This was done prior to BigQuery’s native support of spatial clustering via S2. Using BigQuery's native clustering resulted in a large performance increase, not to mention the added simplicity of not having to manage your own S2 indexes.Alternative Spatial IndexesSpatial clustering utilizes a spatial indexing system, or hierarchy, to organize the stored data. The purpose of all spatial indices is to represent this globe we call Earth in numerical terms, allowing us to define a location as a geometric object like a point, polygon or line. There are dozens of spatial indexes, and most databases implement them in their own unique way. Although BigQuery natively uses S2 cells for clustering, other indexes can be manually implemented, such as H3, geohash, or quadkeys. The examples below will involve the following spatial indexes:S2:  The S2 system represents geospatial data as cells on a three dimensional sphere. It is used by Google Maps.uses quadrilaterals, which are more efficient than hexagonsHigher precision than H3 or geohashingH3:  The H3 system represents geospatial data on overlapping hexagonal grids.Hexagons are more visually appealing Convolutions and smoothing algorithms are more efficient than S2Geohash - Geohash is a public domain system that represents geospatial data on a curved grid.  Length of the Geohash id determines the spatial precisionFairly poor spatial locality, so clustering does not work as wellSpatial clustering in BQ — S2 vs. GeohashIn most cases for analysis, BigQuery’s built-in spatial clustering will give the best performance with the least effort. But if the data is queried according to other attributes, e.g. by geohash box, a custom indexing is necessary. The method of querying the spatial indexes has implications on the performance, as is illustrated in the example below. ExampleFirst, you will create a table with random points in longitude and latitude. Use the BigQuery function st_geohash to generate a geohash id for each point.code_block[StructValue([(u'code', u'drop table if exists tmp.points;\\r\\n \\r\\ncreate or replace table tmp.tenkrows as\\r\\nselect x from unnest(generate_array(1, 10000)) x;\\r\\n \\r\\ncreate or replace table tmp.points\\r\\ncluster by point\\r\\nas\\r\\nwith pts as (\\r\\n select st_geogpoint(rand() * 360 - 180, rand() * 180 - 90) point\\r\\n from tmp.tenkrows a, tmp.tenkrows b\\r\\n)\\r\\nselect st_geohash(point) gh, pts.point\\r\\nfrom pts'), (u'language', u''), (u'caption', &lt;wagtail.wagtailcore.rich_text.RichText object at 0x3ed25c361210&gt;)])]Use the st_geogpoint function to transform the latitude and longitude into a GEOGRAPHY, BigQuery’s native geospatial type, which uses S2 cells as the index. Select a collection of around 3,000 points. This should cost around 25MB. If you run the same query on an unclustered table, it would cost 5.77GB (the full table size).code_block[StructValue([(u'code', u'select * from tmp.points\\r\\nwhere st_dwithin(st_geogpoint(1, 2), point, 10000)'), (u'language', u''), (u'caption', &lt;wagtail.wagtailcore.rich_text.RichText object at 0x3ed25eb11610&gt;)])]Now you will query by geohash id. BigQuery’s ability to leverage the spatial clustering will depend on whether the BQ SAT solver can prove the cluster of data can be pruned. The queries below are both leveraging the geospatial clustering, costing only 340 MB. Note that if we had clustered the table by the ‘gh’ field (ie geohash id), these queries would cost the same as the one above, around 25MB.code_block[StructValue([(u'code', u\"select * from tmp.points\\r\\nwhere starts_with(gh, 'bbb')\\r\\n \\r\\nselect * from tmp.points\\r\\nwhere gh between 'bbb' and 'bbb~'\"), (u'language', u''), (u'caption', &lt;wagtail.wagtailcore.rich_text.RichText object at 0x3ed25d0e5ad0&gt;)])]The query below is much less efficient, costing 5.77GB, a full scan of the table. BigQuery cannot prove this condition fails based on the min/max values of the cluster so it must scan the entire table.code_block[StructValue([(u'code', u\"select * from tmp.points\\r\\nwhere left(gh, 3) = 'bbb'\"), (u'language', u''), (u'caption', &lt;wagtail.wagtailcore.rich_text.RichText object at 0x3ed25d0e55d0&gt;)])]As the examples show, the least costly querying option is to use the indexing consistent with the query method — native S2 indexing when querying by geography, string indexing when querying by geohash. When using geohashing, avoid left() or right() functions, as it will cause BigQuery to scan the entire table.Spatial clustering in BQ with H3One may also find themselves in a situation where they need to use H3 as a spatial index in BigQuery. It is still possible to leverage the performance benefits of clustering, but as with geohashing, it is important to avoid certain patterns. Suppose you have a huge table of geography points indexed by H3 cell ID at level 15, which you’ve clustered by H3_index (note: these functions are supported through the Carto Spatial Extension for BigQuery). You want to find all the points that belong to lower resolution cells, e.g. at level 7. You might write a query like this:code_block[StructValue([(u'code', u'select * from points\\r\\n where H3_ToParent(h3_index, 7) = @parent_cell_id'), (u'language', u''), (u'caption', &lt;wagtail.wagtailcore.rich_text.RichText object at 0x3ed24322d110&gt;)])]Where H3_ToParent is a custom function that computes the parent cell ID from a higher resolution index. Since you’ve clustered by the H3 index, you might expect a lower cost, however this query will scan the entire table. This happens because H3_ToParent involves bit operations, and is too complex for the BigQuery query analyser to understand how the query’s result is related to cluster boundaries. What you should do instead is give BigQuery the range of the H3 cell IDs at the level that the geographies are indexed, like the following example:code_block[StructValue([(u'code', u'select * from points\\r\\n where h3_index BETWEEN H3_CellRangeStart(@parent_cell_id, 15)\\r\\n AND H3_CellRangeEnd(@parent_cell_id, 15)'), (u'language', u''), (u'caption', &lt;wagtail.wagtailcore.rich_text.RichText object at 0x3ed2431ffa10&gt;)])]Where H3_CellRangeStart and H3_CellRangeEnd are custom functions that map the lower-resolution parent ID to the appropriate start and end IDs of the higher resolution cells. Now BigQuery will be able to figure out relevant clusters, reducing the cost and improving the performance of the query.What’s Next?Spatial clustering is a complex topic that requires specialized knowledge to implement. Using BiqQuery’s native spatial clustering will take most of the work out of your hands. With your geospatial data in BigQuery, you can do amazing spatial analyses like querying the stars, even on large datasets. You can also use BigQuery as a backend for a geospatial application, such as an application that allows customers to explore the climate risk of their assets. Using spatial clustering, and querying your clusters correctly will ensure you get the best performance at the lowest cost. Acknowledgments: Thanks to Eric Engle and Travis Webb for their help with this post.Related ArticleQuerying the Stars with BigQuery GISDr. Ross Thomson explains how you can use BigQuery-GIS to analyze astronomy datasets, in a similar manner to analyzing ground-based map d...Read Article",

        "description": "Editor’s note: August 26th is Women's Equality Day, a day celebrated in the United States to commemorate the 1920 adoption of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, which prohibits the states and the federal government from denying the right to vote on the basis of sex.In 1920, one hundred and two years ago, women of the United States were first granted the right to vote. We acknowledge the ratification of the 19th Amendment as a major milestone in the fight for women’s rights and equality. However, it is important to remember that even though the 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote, not all women had the ability or access to vote. The 1965 Voting Rights Act was another important achievement; however, the fight for equal rights is not over. As we observe and celebrate this milestone, we will be clear-eyed about the work that still has to be done. And we acknowledge the fight goes on, specifically for those not of the majority. And even though this is a day we celebrate in the U.S. we want to take this time to honor all women globally. Women’s Equality Day is a moment in time when we can recognize the powerful women and movements that have paved the way for us while continuing to work to break barriers for the women of the next generation. Today we celebrate all women, especially the women impacting the world through innovation in technology and business. We asked both internal Googlers and our Google Cloud Innovator Champion community what Women’s Equality Day means to them. The responses were filled with a sense of inspiration while also being centered around a call for action. We are honored to share these videos with you today.Ashley Willis shares that Women's Equality Day is about celebrating the power of the women who have paved the way for us while also recognizing we still have a long way to go. Ashley offers her support advocacy as we work together to achieve gender equality.Ida Delphine shares that to her, Women's Equality Day signifies not only the freedom of women but their independence to do or be whatever they want to be.Stephanie Wong shares that for her Women's Equality Day is all about celebrating the achievements of women's rights activists, and also talking about some of the struggles that we still often face.Nathaly Alarcon Torrico shares that Women's Equality Day is a day that allows us to see how far we've come and to be inspired by other women's accomplishments. It is also a day to evaluate our goals and set the bar higher.For Women's Equality Day, Aindrila Das is reminding us that even though we have made steps in the right direction there is so much work left to be done in the area of women empowerment and equality.Lynn Langit shares that Women's Equality Day means sharing information so that all people, and in particular women, on this day can reach their full potential.Antonella Blasetti is commemorating Women Equality Day by sharing her passion for information technology and cloud and welcomes more women to join the field.Sharmistha Chatterjee is marking Women's Equality Day by asking us to be bold, confident, in order to prove your decisions are worth it and remember that your decisions are equally good and important to the future.Tune in to Google Cloud’s social media channels today as we share videos from Googlers and our Google Cloud Innovator Champion community to celebrate women in technology and business.Related ArticleCelebrating Women’s Equality Day with Google CloudIn honor of Women’s Equality Day 2021 Google Cloud celebrates women in cloud and business technology (at Google and beyond).Read Article",

        "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/26/us-china-deal-00053897",
        "description": "The U.S. and China have struck a deal to allow American authorities to inspect the audits of U.S.-listed firms based in China and Hong Kong, a landmark agreement that represents a first step toward avoiding further delistings from New York exchanges. The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board signed the agreement with the China Securities Regulatory Commission and the Ministry of Finance of the People's Republic of China, opening the door for PCAOB inspectors to travel to Hong Kong and begin inspections on the ground by mid-September. Now, with the arrangement in place, the PCAOB should, for the first time, have “complete access” to select what firms it inspects, view complete audit work papers and interview personnel associated with the audits under review. However, officials caution that the deal is only one piece of a move to prevent some 200 companies from being kicked off U.S. exchanges. “The real test will be whether the words agreed to on paper translate into complete access in practice,” PCAOB Chair Erica Williams said in a statement, adding that the agreement has “no loopholes and no exceptions.” Washington and Beijing have been at odds for years over the PCAOB’s inability to inspect the auditing of China- and Hong Kong-based companies listed on the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq. Since the early 2000s, the U.S. has required all publicly traded companies to provide the PCAOB with the ability to inspect their auditors. But China and Hong Kong have long resisted the calls, often on the grounds of national security concerns. In 2020, U.S. lawmakers moved to force Beijing’s hand with the passage of the Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act. The law, passed following a rare show of bipartisanship in Washington, effectively started the clock ticking on China and the U.S. to reach an agreement to allow for the PCAOB to inspect the audits. Under the law, companies that are found to not have allowed the PCAOB complete access for three straight years would risk being kicked off U.S. exchanges. “Foreign companies operating on U.S. markets should be held to the same standards across the board,” said Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), who first introduced the legislation along with Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.), in a statement Thursday. “I applaud today’s action by the PCAOB — achieving the crucial first step of getting the Chinese government to agree to these requirements — which for the first time will ensure all companies operating in the U.S. markets are held to the same audit standards.” A deal seemed to be far from guaranteed just a month ago. In July, SEC Chair Gary Gensler said he was “not particularly confident” that one would be made. And the pressure only mounted in August, when five of China’s largest state-owned firms unveiled plans to voluntarily delist from the New York Stock Exchange. But the two sides were ultimately able to come together to reach the terms of Thursday’s agreement. In a statement, the China Securities Regulatory Commission called the agreement “an important step forward by regulators in China and the U.S. towards resolving the audit oversight issue that concern mutual interests, and lays the foundation for proactive, professional and pragmatic cooperation of the next stage.” Still, U.S. regulators caution that the deal is only part one of averting an additional wave of delistings from New York. If the PCAOB cannot “inspect and investigate completely audit firms in China,” Gensler said Thursday that China-based issuers are still at risk of facing trading prohibitions on their U.S. securities.",

        "description": "Colorado Democrats urged President Biden in a letter on Friday to use his executive powers to preserve the historical legacy of key Rocky Mountain landscapes and ban new oil and gas leasing in certain spaces. \n\n\n\nThe politicians — Rep. Joe Neguse, Sen. Michael Bennet, Sen. John Hickenlooper and Gov. Jared Polis — asked the president to protect the public spaces included in the Colorado Outdoor Recreation &amp; Economy (CORE) Act, the progress of which has stalled in Congress, despite strong local support. \n\n\n\nChief among their requests is the designation of Colorado’s Camp Hale and the Tenmile Range as the “Camp Hale - Continental Divide National Monument,” by means of the Antiquities Act.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis area, they explained, was instrumental “in preparing the 10th Mountain Division for some of the most difficult moments of World War II,” while many veterans returned to establish Colorado’s outdoor recreation economy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe politicians also urged the president to protect Colorado’s Thompson Divide through a Federal Lands Policy and Management Act mineral withdrawal, which would ban new oil and gas leasing, as well as mining, in the region.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFarmers, ranchers and other community members have all come together in support of this conservation measure, the politicians noted.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe letter comes after Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack’s recent visit to the region to meet with Colorado stakeholders, who called for urgent administrative actions to protect landscapes included in the CORE Act. \n\n\n\nDuring that visit, Vilsack met with conservationists, sportsmen, ranchers, business leaders and veterans, who demonstrated “overwhelming support” for such protections, according to the letter. \n\n\n\n“It is clear that Coloradans across the state support the conservation and preservation of these landscapes for future generations,” the letter stated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn January 2021, Neguse, Bennet and Hickenlooper reintroduced the CORE Act, which has now passed the House of Representatives five times.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Despite strong public support, the CORE Act has been held up in the Senate by lawmakers who are dead set against passing any conservation legislation,” Jennifer Rokala, executive director of the Center for Western Priorities environmental group, said in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s time for President Biden to step in to deliver for the people of Colorado,” Rokala added.\n\n\n\nThe proposed legislation would designate Camp Hale as a National Historic Landscape, while prohibiting new oil and gas drilling in areas important to sportsmen and ranchers near the Thompson Divide.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCombining four previously introduced Colorado public land bills, the CORE Act also sought to protect 73,000 acres of land as new wilderness and nearly 80,000 acres as new recreation and conservation management areas that maintain existing outdoor uses, such as hiking and biking. \n\n\n\nIn their letter to the president, Neguse, Hickenlooper, Bennet and Polis likewise called for new protections to the areas proposed for wilderness designation, mineral withdrawal and special management.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSuch measures — specifically for Colorado’s Grand Mesa Uncompahgre and Gunnison National Forests —&nbsp;would come with the support of seven Colorado county commissioners, the politicians noted.\n\n\n\nIn&nbsp;an appeal&nbsp;sent to Bennet last month, the commissioners asked that the senator urge Biden to “safeguard these cherished landscapes as soon as possible.”\n\n\n\nThe Colorado congressman, senators and governor suggested that the president use administrative tools at his disposal, such as forthcoming revisions to the U.S. Forest Service plan, to accomplish this goal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“By taking these steps, you will be making sure that even more of Colorado’s open spaces will be preserved for future generations,” the Colorado politicians wrote to Biden.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We will continue our fight to pass the CORE Act to deliver permanent conservation for the areas featured in the legislation but ask for your help in the interim to offer administrative protections modeled after the CORE Act,” they added.\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the White House for comment.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study published in the journal Clinical Nutrition looked at genetic data from more than 580,000 people in the United Kingdom and Finland.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers from Cambridge University compared participants not by their reported level of coffee consumption, but according to whether they had genetic variants predisposing them to increased or decreased coffee or tea consumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study found that people with a genetic score associated with a 50 percent increase in coffee consumption were at 2.8 times the risk of esophageal cancer than non-drinkers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPeople who regularly drink hot coffee or tea may be at an increased risk of developing throat cancer as consuming hot liquids can damage the lining of the esophagus, according to a recent study.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe study published in the journal Clinical Nutrition looked at genetic data from more than 580,000 people in the United Kingdom and Finland. Researchers from Cambridge University compared participants not by their reported level of coffee consumption, but according to whether they had genetic variants predisposing them to increased or decreased coffee or tea consumption.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearchers conducted the analysis this way to account for variables that may have skewed the results of past research, for example, coffee drinkers also tend to consume more alcohol than non-coffee drinkers, which could explain an increased risk for cancer. The genes associated with coffee and tea consumption, however, are not correlated to drinking alcohol.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe study found that people with a genetic score associated with a 50 percent increase in coffee consumption were at 2.8 times the risk of esophageal cancer than non-drinkers. Meanwhile, participants who said they preferred their coffee “hot” had a 5.5-fold increase in risk, those who enjoyed it “very hot” had a 4.1-fold increase in risk and “warm” coffee drinkers experienced a 2.7-fold increase in developing cancer in the esophagus.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nImportantly, the study’s findings show that coffee and tea consumption did not appear to increase the risk of any other types of cancers. Researchers say a potential explanation for increased risk of throat cancer is the physical damage to the body’s digestive system from the hot liquid, rather than a cancer-causing effect directly from coffee or caffeine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“While a link with any cancer type is unwelcome, our investigation generally provides good news for coffee drinkers, as there was no evidence supporting a causal effect of coffee consumption on any major cancer type,” Stephen Burgess, the study’s author, said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEsophageal cancer is a rare type of cancer, making up only about 1 percent of cancer cases in the U.S., although the overall survival rate for this type of cancer is about 20 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrevious studies on the pros and cons of drinking coffee have been mixed. Recent research has shown moderate coffee consumption is associated with a longer life span, while other studies have linked the beverage with lower odds of developing type 3 diabetes, depression and other conditions.&nbsp;",

Crews will ride aboard Artemis II on a similar trajectory in 2024, and the first woman and the next man to land on the moon are slated to arrive at the lunar south pole in late 2025 on the Artemis III mission.”&nbsp;More on the launch from CNN&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis project’s goal is to eventually travel to Mars: Space.com explains “why NASA sees the moon as a stepping stone to Mars.”&nbsp;Read it here&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTHIS MORNING — NASA HELD A PRE-LAUNCH PRESS BRIEFING:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAhead of Monday’s launch.&nbsp;Watch&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHappy Friday!

Annual inflation without food and energy prices, also known as core inflation, fell from 4.8 percent in June to 4.6 percent in July.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKeep in mind: “Much of the July dip in inflation came from a steep decline in gasoline prices, reversing a staggering June spike in oil prices that pushed the average cost of a gallon of gasoline above $5 in the previous month.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat this means for inflation, via The Hill’s&nbsp;Sylvan Lane&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMEANWHILE — BIDEN’S APPROVAL IS THE HIGHEST IT’S BEEN IN A YEAR:&nbsp;According to a new Gallup poll,&nbsp;President Biden’s approval rose to 44 percent in August.\n\n\n\nFor context: Biden’s approval was 38 percent in the same poll in July.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⛔️&nbsp;In Congress&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt wouldn’t be almost fall if we weren’t already talking about a possible shutdown:&nbsp;Via The Hill’s&nbsp;Rachel Frazin, “Liberal lawmakers are pressing Democratic leaders in the House to not include a side deal undercutting environmental reviews worked out with Sen.&nbsp;Joe Manchin&nbsp;(D-W.Va.) in a short-term measure funding the government.”\n\n\n\n“House Natural Resources Chairman&nbsp;Raúl Grijalva&nbsp;(D-Ariz.) is circulating a letter asking leadership to separate the Manchin deal out from a continuing resolution that would temporarily avert a government shutdown.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy this matters: “The issue is expected to come to a head in September, when lawmakers return from recess, as Democrats try to secure funding for the government and prevent a shutdown.” The full story\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💸&nbsp;The White House&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLots of social media posts about the canceled student debt:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNews of the Biden administration forgiving up to $10,000 in federal student loans and up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients triggered a lot of reactions, both good and bad.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne critic is Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.): “For our government just to say, you know, ‘Ok, well your debt is completely forgiven,’ … it’s completely unfair,” Greene said on Newsmax on Wednesday. “[Taxpayers] shouldn’t have to pay off the great big student loan debt for some college student that piled up massive debt going to some Ivy league school … That’s not fair.”&nbsp;Watch Greene’s full response to student loan cancellation&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House&nbsp;tweeted in response: “Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene had $183,504 in PPP loans forgiven.” The PPP loans are referring to the Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) that were given to small businesses during COVID-19 closures. ProPublica data show Greene’s company was forgiven of its roughly $183,000 loan.\n\n\n\nThe full back and forth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🦠&nbsp;Latest with COVID&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;The ‘there’s no \"I\" in team’ phase is over:&nbsp;“Moderna said Friday it is suing Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, alleging patent infringement over the COVID-19 vaccine. The move sets up a showdown between two major vaccine makers that together have helped blunt the impacts of the pandemic in the United States and other countries.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy now?: “The move also marks that Moderna views the pandemic as being in a different phase. The company said that it previously pledged not to enforce it patents while the pandemic continued. But, it said, ‘in March 2022, when the collective fight against COVID-19 entered a new phase and vaccine supply was no longer a barrier to access in many parts of the world, Moderna updated its pledge.’”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat to expect, via The Hill’s&nbsp;Peter Sullivan&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNothing more political than a pandemic:&nbsp;“Anthony Fauci&nbsp;is preparing to leave the public stage — but health experts are worried the toxic atmosphere that tailed him will hang around for years to come.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKeep in mind — Fauci is not particularly controversial among most experts: “Opinions of Fauci among the general public cleave along partisan lines, but most experts think he did about as good a job as anyone could in managing a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic. They worry that the unremitting personal attacks he faced are emblematic of a broader, sneering tone toward scientific expertise and advice.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat the partisan lines of the pandemic could mean for public health, via The Hill’s Niall Stanage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n➤&nbsp;THE COVID-19 NUMBERS&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCases to date: 93.7 million&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDeath toll: 1,037,381&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCurrent hospitalizations: 31,752&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShots administered: 608 million&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFully vaccinated: 67.4 percent of Americans&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCDC data here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🐥Notable tweets&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA holiday we should absolutely celebrate:&nbsp;In honor of National Dog Day, NBC’s “Today” tweeted a threat of puppies.&nbsp;Photos of the pups\n\n\n\nThis one may be my favorite\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n⏱On tap&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe House and Senate are out.&nbsp;President Biden&nbsp;is in Washington, D.C., and is leaving for Delaware this afternoon.&nbsp;Vice President Harris&nbsp;has no public events scheduled.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToday: Women’s Equality Day.&nbsp;What to know about the 102nd anniversary of women winning the right to vote&nbsp;\n\n\n\n9:30 a.m.: Biden received the President’s Daily Brief.&nbsp;11 a.m.: Biden dropped by a meeting with state and elected officials on Women’s Equality Day to discuss reproductive health care.&nbsp;1:55 p.m.: Biden leaves for Delaware.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAll times Eastern.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n📺What to watch&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis morning: NASA held a briefing ahead of Monday’s moon launch.&nbsp;Video&nbsp;12:45 p.m.: White House press secretary&nbsp;Karine Jean-Pierre&nbsp;holds a press briefing.&nbsp;Livestream&nbsp;2 p.m.: The White House Monkeypox Response Team holds a press briefing.&nbsp;Livestream&nbsp;Op-ed&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🍒 In lighter news \n\n\n\nToday is&nbsp;National Cherry Popsicle Day.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI would love for every dog to experience Krispy Kreme:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn honor of National Dog Day, Krispy Kreme is selling doggie “doughnuts” on Friday.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3616831-heres-how-corporations-can-leverage-the-inflation-reduction-act-to-address-climate-change/",
        "description": "When President Biden signed&nbsp;the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), he unleashed $739 billion to rebuild the economy, including a historic $369 billion over the next 10 years for climate action. While this is a lot of money, it is insufficient for what is needed to address the challenge of global climate change. Conservative estimates (such as&nbsp;The Stern Review’s) have called for investing 1.5 to 2 percent of GDP annually to thwart the worst effects of climate disruption.\n\n\n\nWith a $22 trillion economy, that would put the climate bill for the U.S. at more than $400 billion a year. Yet the IRA is a good opportunity for American businesses and other large organizations. The act is corporate friendly in that it supports the coal and gas pipeline industries, and does not eliminate the “carried interest” income tax shelter for wealthy companies. It offers companies and other large organizations a novel opportunity to rise to the greater challenge of finding a global climate solution.\n\n\n\nAs the chief sustainability officer of a large organization, I have learned that government investments are most effective when they are positively leveraged by other large organizations. The IRA is already being leveraged by the state of California, which announced this week its&nbsp;plans to ban gas powered vehicles by 2035. Its plan, if implemented by the California Air Resources Board, will ensure 35 percent of new passenger vehicles are electric battery or hydrogen powered by 2026, and 100 percent net-zero emissions by 2035. This is a good start; now we need corporations and consumers to find ways of leveraging the IRA.\n\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act is strategic and fundamental to moving the U.S. into compliance with the&nbsp;2015 Paris Climate Agreement. Firstly, it sends a symbolic message that the U.S. now believes in and is strongly behind the idea of building a low-carbon economy. Secondly, it makes a significant enough investment to trigger the process of change in several relevant industries such, as electric vehicles (EV), EV charging infrastructure and battery technology. Thirdly, it has a real potential for reducing 40 percent of U.S. carbon emissions by 2030. Each of these can serve as leverage points for corporations.\n\n\n\nOur discussions of climate solutions at the&nbsp;Club of Rome, a platform of diverse thought leaders who identify holistic solutions to complex global issues, show that in implementing global climate solutions, corporations and consumers both can play vital roles as “impact multipliers.”\n\n\n\nA far-sighted and far-reaching corporate strategy is to see this act as a strong signal of where the federal government is leading the U.S. economy — to a low-carbon future.\n\n\n\nThis is the opportunity for corporations to lean-in with their own considerable resources to make new strategic investments into decarbonization. They could convert all vehicles to EVs, make all their buildings energy efficient, build new buildings to be carbon neutral, implement the sustainable development goals and align with the Paris agreement targets.\n\n\n\nBoosting these decarbonization expenditures, and doing so annually, could also create competitive advantage by spawning new sustainable technologies that the world will need in the coming decade. Corporations could target an equivalent amount of investment to match government investments, and that would surely make U.S. corporations the global leader in climate action. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nConsumers can lean-in on several of the IRA’s provisions by abandoning fossil-based automobiles and home energy systems. The bill offers them a&nbsp;$4,000 to $7,000 tax credit&nbsp;for buying electric vehicles, and a 20 percent subsidy for home solar panels. The bill changes the economic logic of home heating and autos by making renewable energy cheaper than fossil-based option. This is a huge leverage opportunity that sustainable consumption advocates should actualize now. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf corporations, large organizations and consumers do not rise to the challenge now, the IRA by itself will surely not solve the climate problem. It will, at best, make a small dent, and leave the U.S. economy vulnerable to a&nbsp;15 percent decline in GDP at a time when it is already suffering from inflation and potential recession.

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/mariners-extend-julio-rodriguez.html",
        "description": "The Mariners have locked up one of the sport&#8217;s brightest young stars on a record-setting contract, announcing late Friday night they&#8217;ve signed Rookie of the Year candidate Julio Rodriguez to an extension. The deal, which begins this season, guarantees him $210MM over 12 years and contains both player and club options that can extend the length of the contract and push the total value as high as $470MM. Rodriguez, an Octagon client, also reportedly receives a full no-trade clause.\n\nIt is one of the more complex contracts agreed upon in major league history. According to reports from ESPN&#8217;s Jeff Passan and Ken Rosenthal of the Athletic, Rodriguez will make $120MM through 2029. According to Rosenthal, that takes the form of a $15MM signing bonus to be paid up front, with $105MM to be distributed between 2023-29. After the contract&#8217;s seventh year (2028), the Mariners must decide whether to effectively re-extend Rodriguez for either eight or ten years, with the size and value of that long-term &#8220;club option&#8221; dependent on how Rodriguez finishes in MVP voting through the contract&#8217;s first seven seasons.\nAt minimum, Seattle will be deciding on whether to extend the contract by eight years and another $200MM. That figure would escalate to $240MM over eight years if Rodriguez earns two or three top ten finishes in MVP balloting over his first seven years. It&#8217;d be valued at $260MM over eight years with four top ten finishes and at $280MM over eight years if he wins an MVP and finishes in the top five once more or finishes in the top five of MVP balloting on three occasions. The option value would escalate to $350MM over ten years if Rodriguez either wins two MVP awards or finishes among the top five in balloting on four occasions. In the event Rodriguez hits that highest threshold at the Mariners exercise the option, the contract would max out at 18 years and $470MM in total value.\nIf the Mariners do not exercise their multi-year option after Year 7, Rodriguez will have a five-year, $90MM player option that he can exercise after Year 8 of the contract. (That option value could escalate as high as $125.5MM based on his finishes in Silver Slugger voting and All-Star appearances). That $90MM figure is considered guaranteed money, as is the case with all player options. Between the $120MM he&#8217;ll be paid over the next eight seasons and the base value of the player option, Rodriguez&#8217;s guarantee lands at the aforementioned $210MM. There is, of course, a scenario where the Mariners do not pick up their 8- to 10-year &#8220;club option,&#8221; and Rodriguez also declines his five-year, $90MM &#8220;player option,&#8221; which would then allow him to reach free agency after collecting $120MM over eight years, when he&#8217;ll be heading into his age-30 campaign.\nRodriguez, 21, broke camp with the Mariners this season and, after a rough couple of weeks to begin the year, burst into immediate stardom and has established himself as one of the frontrunners for Rookie of the Year honors. He&#8217;s currently hitting .269/.328/.471 with 20 home runs, 19 doubles, three triples and 23 steals (in 29 tries) &#8212; plus above-average defensive contributions in center field.\nThose numbers are at least slightly skewed by a poor start to the year in which Rodriguez batted .136/.208/.159 with a 45% strikeout rate. Dating back to April 22, Rodriguez has mashed at a .285/.342/.508 clip. That production is about 46% better than league average after weighting for park and league, by measure of wRC+, which places Rodriguez in a three-way tie with Alex Bregman and the also recently-extended Austin Riley for 12th-best among qualified Major League hitters. Rodriguez also ranks 13th in the Majors in both average exit velocity (92 mph) and hard-hit rate (49.6%) in that time, and his 14.9% barrel rate in that stretch is MLB&#8217;s ninth-best mark.\nAdd in the fact that he&#8217;s done all of this at 21 years of age and after skipping the Triple-A level entirely, and Rodriguez&#8217;s rookie season becomes all the more remarkable. Given that youth and lack of upper-minors seasoning, it&#8217;s quite possible that even though Rodriguez already ranks among the game&#8217;s best hitters, we&#8217;ve yet to even see the best he has to offer.\nFrom a defensive standpoint, Rodriguez has more than held his own in center field this season, turning in positive marks in Defensive Runs Saved (2), Ultimate Zone Rating (0.3) and Outs Above Average (5). Many scouting reports penned before his MLB debut suggested that as Rodriguez ages and continues to fill out, he could be destined for a corner outfield slot, but given his 70- or even 80-grade raw power and the solid work he&#8217;s flashed in center this season, he&#8217;ll have both the bat and likely the defensive chops to be an above-average contributor in right or left field.\nIt&#8217;s easy to see why the Mariners jumped at the opportunity to keep Rodriguez around for the long term, and they&#8217;ve done with a massive and complex contract. The $210MM guarantee will give Rodriguez the record for largest contract ever signed by a player with under a year of Major League service time. That distinction currently belongs to Rays shortstop Wander Franco, who inked an 11-year, $182MM extension last November.\nRodriguez will topple that mark with ease, although it&#8217;s not an apples-to-apples comparison. Franco wasn&#8217;t promoted until midseason and inked his deal in the winter, when the Rays had six full seasons of club control left over him. Because Rodriguez made the Opening Day roster, he&#8217;ll get a full year of service in 2022 and would &#8220;only&#8221; have had five additional years of club control remaining. In that respect, Rodriguez could technically be considered more of a one-plus player (between one and two years of service time), although even when viewing the contract through that lens, it&#8217;s still a record-setting agreement; Ke&#8217;Bryan Hayes&#8217; $70MM extension in Pittsburgh was the previous record for a player with between one and two years of service.\nRegardless of which service bracket one thinks more aptly applies to Rodriguez, this new 14-year deal now stands as the largest contract ever promised to a player with fewer than two years of Major League service time. In that aspect, Rodriguez and the Major League Baseball Players Association are surely pleased to see the precedent for young, superstar extensions moved even further forward.\nAll that said, there&#8217;s still potential for the contract to be quite favorable for the Mariners. Rodriguez would&#8217;ve likely earned near the league minimum in salary over the next two seasons (plus any payouts from the newly collectively bargained bonus pool for pre-arbitration players). A player with his upside and early dominance would likely have done quite well in arbitration, and while we can never know exactly how much he might&#8217;ve earned through that process, arbitration is generally based on precedent. Looking for recent comparables, Mookie Betts secured $57.5MM for his three arbitration seasons. If we put Rodriguez into that broad vicinity, his remaining five years of club control might have netted him somewhere in the range of $60MM &#8212; perhaps a few million more if he&#8217;d taken home an MVP Award and/or pushed the Betts precedent a bit further.\nRodriguez will be paid $15MM on average over the next eight seasons, with at least two free agent seasons bought out. That obviously pales in comparison to what Rodriguez&#8217;s could&#8217;ve earned on the open market had he gone year-to-year and hit the free-agent market in advance of his age-27 season, and the Mariners will have an opportunity to keep Rodriguez from hitting free agency at any point in his prime. That risk-reward tradeoff is the nature of early contract extensions, of course. There&#8217;s obviously ample risk of injury or downturn in performance for Rodriguez, all of which is baked into the relative discount rate for those open-market seasons.\nFrom a team payroll vantage point, there&#8217;s ample room for Seattle to make a commitment of this nature. A significant portion of the team&#8217;s recent rebuild was dedicated to clearing long-term clutter from the books &#8212; e.g., the Robinson Cano trade &#8212; and the team&#8217;s long-term commitments are now rather minimal. Left-hander Robbie Ray is signed through the 2026 season, as is shortstop J.P. Crawford, but they&#8217;ll combine for just $37MM at that point. That would&#8217;ve only been Rodriguez&#8217;s fifth big league season, so the salaries on his contract will still likely not quite have escalated to their maximum levels.\nLooking more short-term, the books are also still accommodating. The Mariners, who&#8217;ll see veterans Mitch Haniger and Adam Frazier reach free agency at season&#8217;s end, had just over $63MM in guaranteed money on the 2023 payroll prior to this contract. That number doesn&#8217;t include an $8MM option for righty Chris Flexen, nor does it include a handful of arbitration raises: Luis Castillo (earning $7.35MM this season), Diego Castillo ($2.315MM), Paul Sewald ($1.735MM), Ty France (pre-arb) and Erik Swanson (pre-arb).\nIt&#8217;s a momentous day in Mariners history, one that firmly drives home the organization&#8217;s &#8220;win-now&#8221; mentality as it inches toward a postseason berth that would smash a two-decade playoff drought &#8212; currently the longest in major North American professional sports. There&#8217;s risk for both parties, but the contract is a continuation of the ever-growing trend of extending young stars at nine-figure rates that guarantee a player&#8217;s entire prime. The contract also locks Rodriguez down as the new face of Mariners baseball for the next decade-plus, ensuring them a charismatic, marketable star around which to both build the roster and sell the product to the fanbase.\nJesse Sanchez of MLB.com first reported that the two sides were nearing an extension worth more than $200MM guaranteed and as much as $450MM in total value. ESPN&#8217;s Jeff Passan reported the contract length and exact guarantee. USA Today&#8217;s Bob Nightengale reported the agreement was in place. Passan and  provided specifics on the financials. Rosenthal also reported the deal contained a full no-trade clause.\nImage courtesy of USA Today Sports.",

        "description": "ATHENS — Greek Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis on Friday sought to deflect increasingly heated attacks in parliament over a spiraling phone-tapping scandal by accusing unidentified foreign entities of trying to destabilize the country amid an energy crisis and increased threats from Turkey. \n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Greece&#8217;s spy chief and the government&#8217;s general secretary lost their jobs after revelations that the phone of an opposition leader, Nikos Androulakis, had been tapped. In a labyrinthine case, Mitsotakis&#8217; center-right government admits that the intelligence service conducted this legal wiretapping, but is denying any involvement with what it calls separate illegal cases, in which Androulakis and journalists were bugged with spy software called Predator.  \n\n\n\nDuring a heated parliamentary session on Friday, Mitsotakis dug in and refused to answer the key question of why the phone of Androulakis, head of the center-left Pasok party, had been bugged. Alexis Tsipras, leader of the biggest opposition party, the left-wing Syriza group, slammed the hack as a &#8220;criminal act&#8221; and said that Mitsotakis&#8217; handling of the case should lead to his resignation. \n\n\n\nMitsotakis, who faces a national election by next year at the latest, vowed to stay in government and not call a snap election, arguing that he needed to stick around to ensure stability in the face of threats from unnamed foreign forces.\n\n\n\n“I&#8217;m well aware that there are interests that want weak governments, because they believe that this increases their ability to exert influence,” he said. He added that everyone should calm down because Greece&#8217;s neighbors, referring to Turkey, “remain unpredictable.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“War, the huge energy crisis, high prices, all bode for a very difficult winter. And not only that. In Evros [the Greek-Turkish border region], a new wave of invasion is already being planned, this time under a supposedly humanitarian mask,” he added. \n\n\n\nMitsotakis defended the workings of the country’s national intelligence service (EYP), saying its operations were essential to the country’s security, despite the misstep of tapping an opposition leader&#8217;s phone, in what he said was a legal but &#8220;politically unacceptable&#8221; operation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Nothing must bring into question this valuable operational branch of the state,” Mitsotakis said during the debate called by Syriza, after it was revealed that Androulakis, head of Greece&#8217;s third largest party, was put under surveillance for three months by EYP last year, when he was running for his party&#8217;s leadership.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the dark? \n\n\n\nMitsotakis also insisted he was personally unaware of the wiretapping and that he would not have approved it had he known. “No prime minister can be aware of who EYP taps,” he said.\n\n\n\nGreece’s National Intelligence Service does, however, report directly to the prime minister’s office, according to a change in legislation voted in by the ruling New Democracy government.\n\n\n\n“The biggest cowardice is not to accept political responsibility and say &#8216;It&#8217;s not my fault, it&#8217;s my nephew&#8217;s fault,'&#8221; Tsipras replied, referring to the fact that the government&#8217;s general secretary, who resigned because of the scandal, earlier this month was Mitsotakis&#8217; nephew. \n\n\n\n“That is what you plead, that you are so irresponsible and so inadequate that even your closest associate, even your closest relative was operating in such serious matters without your knowledge,” he added.\n\n\n\nGreece&#8217;s Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis | Ludovic Marin/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\nMitsotakis was pressed by all party leaders to answer why Androulakis was under surveillance.\n\n\n\n“You are obliged to give an answer. What was this national reason?” Tsipras demanded. “Is Mr. Androulakis an agent of foreign interests &#8230; Is he a spy of foreign forces? Is he dangerous to our national interests?”\n\n\n\nAndroulakis filed a complaint with prosecutors at Greece’s Supreme Court on July 26 over the Predator spyware, and demanded to know the reasons for the intelligence service’s hack.\n\n\n\nPredator pressure\n\n\n\nIn April, financial journalist Thanassis Koukakis said he had been notified by digital rights group Citizen Lab that his phone had been the target of surveillance by Predator software from July to September 2021. The government also admitted during a closed parliamentary session that he was also under survaillance by EYP, according to several lawmakers present in the session. Athens, however, separately denies any connection with the Predator software. \n\n\n\nLast November, journalist Stavros Malichudis realized from a leaked report that the government had spied on him. The government denied the allegation and the media paid little attention to it.\n\n\n\nThe head of Pasok&#8217;s parliamentary group Michalis Katrinis accused the government of deliberately obscuring the company that operates and sells the Predator software in Greece, despite its offices being only some 10 kilometers from the Greek parliament. \n\n\n\n&#8220;What are the personal, family and professional relations of the people who own and trade Predator with central executives of the system of the [the PM&#8217;s office] &#8230; Whose morbid strategy is served by the effort to trap and blackmail journalists, politicians and businessmen?&#8221; he asked.\n\n\n\nAndroulakis lashed out against the government while speaking to his parliamentary group on Thursday, saying that they were “plotting against him.”\n\n\n\n&#8220;A shadow state mechanism wanted to hold Pasok hostage. The plan failed miserably,&#8221; he said.“The government repeatedly claims that the Greek authorities do not use Predator. But is it the simultaneous [surveillance by] EYP and Predator within a few days a coincidence?” he asked rhetorically. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of&nbsp;POLITICO Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one-stop-shop solution for policy professionals fusing the depth of POLITICO journalism with the power of technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive, breaking scoops and insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomized policy intelligence platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-level public affairs network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY GO PRO\n\n\n\nLOG IN",

In its purest state, squeezed from the fruit and kernels of the oil palm, it has a deep red colour and rich fragrance. By the time it reaches our supermarkets, in ultra-processed foods and cosmetics, it’s been refined, bleached, deodorised and relabelled, appearing in multiple different forms. Bee and Tom look at the reasons for its ubiquity, the consequences for those involved in its production and whether a sustainable palm oil industry is possible.Find more to read on the episode page: https://lrb.me/palmoilpodSubscribe to the LRB from just £1 per issue: https://mylrb.co.uk/podcast20bTitle music by Kieran Brunt / Produced by Anthony Wilks Our GDPR privacy policy was updated on August 8, 2022.

They discuss some of the apparently immovable Beethoven mythologies – the keyboard pedagogy, the heroic glower, the many appropriations of the 9th&nbsp;Symphony – and the blend of Viennese tradition and radical invention which characterises his music, particularly the piano sonatas, from the ethereal melodic sweetness of&nbsp;The Tempest&nbsp;to the terrifying, thumping trills of the&nbsp;Hammerklavier.Read James Wood's piece here: https://lrb.me/beethovenpodSubscribe to the LRB from just £1 per issue: https://mylrb.co.uk/podcast20bPieces and recordings featured in this episode:5th&nbsp;Symphony: Berlin Philharmonic / Furtwängler (1954)3rd&nbsp;Symphony: Berlin Philharmonic / Furtwängler (1952)Piano Sonata No. 29 (‘Hammerklavier’): Barenboim (1984)Piano Sonata No. 29 (‘Hammerklavier’): Solomon (1952)Piano Sonata No. 17 (‘The Tempest’): Gould (1960)9th&nbsp;Symphony: Beyreuth Festival Orchestra / Furtwängler (1951)Piano Sonata No. 7: Horowitz (1959)Piano Sonata No. 26 (‘Les Adieux’): Kempff (1951)Piano Sonata No. 31: Hess (1953) Our GDPR privacy policy was updated on August 8, 2022.

        "description": "Federal investigators obtained a search warrant for former President Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate earlier this month by pointing to a raft of highly classified material they’d already obtained from there, according to a legal affidavit unsealed Friday. Records the FBI obtained from Trump’s Florida home in advance of the Aug. 8 search bore indications they contained human source intelligence, intercepts under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and signals intelligence, as well as other tags indicating high sensitivity. Several of those tightly-controlled documents contained Trump’s “handwritten notes,” the partially-redacted affidavit detailing the Justice Department investigation says. In those boxes, agents found 184 unique documents, 25 of which were marked “top secret,” 92 of which were marked “secret,” and 67 of which were marked “confidential”–the lowest level of national security classification. According to the affidavit, NARA officials found some of those “highly classified records were unfoldered, intermixed with other records, and otherwise unproperly [sic] identified.\" Prosecutors also added in another court filing unsealed Friday that the ongoing criminal probe into government records stashed at Trump’s Florida home has involved “a significant number of civilian witnesses” whose safety could be jeopardized if their identities were revealed. The partial release of the heavily-redacted affidavit and related court documents is the latest development in a fast-moving legal saga that poses an acute threat to the former president. Experts say it is unprecedented in nature. One classified information expert who oversaw such issues across the government said Friday that the scenario laid out was extraordinary and suggested that significant national secrets are at stake. “To my knowledge, this has never become an issue. Most former presidents have played this pretty straight and narrow,” said William Leonard, who headed up the National Archives’ Information Security and Oversight Office. “If it was just the infamous personal note from the North Korean leader to Trump and he refused to part with that, that’s something that obviously could be handled administratively… But I have to think in this instance the information was so sensitive and the potential damage to national security could be so significant that the government felt they had no other choice other than to proceed down this route.” The court filings unsealed Friday revealed that the magistrate judge who issued the warrant for the search of Trump’s residence received legal arguments from Trump’s attorneys before doing so. Those arguments came in the form of a three-page, May 25 letter from Trump lawyer Evan Corcoran. In the letter, Corcoran sought to discourage the Justice Department from proceeding with a criminal investigation or potential criminal charges over the presence of classified records at Mar-a-Lago. “Public trust in the government is low. At such times, adherence to the rules and long-standing policies is essential,” Corcoran wrote. “President Donald J. Trump is a leader of the Republican Party. The Department of Justice (DOJ), as part of the Executive Branch, is under the control of a President from the opposite party. It is critical, given that dynamic, that every effort is made to ensure that actions by DOJ that may touch upon the former President, or his close associates, do not involve Politics.” Notably, the letter came before a June 3 meeting between Trump, his attorneys and DOJ officials at Mar-a-Lago, where the department’s counterintelligence chief Jay Bratt and FBI agents viewed parts of the premises. Trump has repeatedly described his interactions with DOJ as cordial, with aides noting that he shook hands with Bratt during the meeting. But those accounts didn’t mention the heightened tensions reflected in Corcoran’s letter. Similarly, Trump has described that DOJ asked him to install a lock on his storage facility after the June 3 meeting. But DOJ revealed in the affidavit that this request was delivered with far more alarm than Trump conveyed.   “As I previously indicated to you, Mar-a-Lago does not include a secure location authorized for the storage of classified information,” DOJ wrote in a letter to Corcoran at the time. “As such, it appears that since the time classified documents [redacted] were removed from the secure facilities at the White House and moved to Mar-a-Lago on or around January 20, 2021, they have not been handled in an appropriate manner or stored in an appropriate location.” Corcoran, in his May 25 letter, also argued that presidents have “absolute authority” to declassify documents, although he did not explicitly say that Trump had done so. Some Trump allies have asserted that he explicitly or implicitly declassified materials by taking them from the Oval Office to the White House residence or other locations, though no evidence has emerged of a formal declassification order. Indeed, the affidavit unsealed Friday contains a reference to former Trump adviser Kash Patel — one of Trump’s authorized representatives to the National Archives — claiming in a Breitbart News article that Trump had declassified many of the records at issue. In a post on his social media site, Trump lashed out shortly after the affidavit was unsealed, complaining of heavy redactions and noting that the word “nuclear” wasn’t mentioned despite reports that documents related to America’s nuclear secrets were among the cache held at Mar-a-Lago. Trump, notably, didn’t say whether or not such documents were in fact among them, only that there was no reference to them. Trump also repeatedly slammed Reinhart for authorizing the search saying he should have recused himself from the matter. But Trump — as both Reinhart and the Justice Department have noted in court filings — never attempted to intervene in the matter to either help shape the redaction process, provide more insight on the documents he had at his estate or to formally seek the magistrate’s recusal. In his own letter, Corcoran contended that a technical reading of one federal statute covering mishandling of classified information&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/1924&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-dd62-d9e7-ab9e-ff73b8880000&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-dd62-d9e7-ab9e-ff73b8880001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">one federal statute covering mishandling of classified information indicates it does not apply to the president. But he did not address whether or how a former president would also be immune from prosecution or retain some declassification power.   When prosecutors sought the search warrant for Mar-a-Lago, they included Corcoran’s letter in their submission to Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart. However, they did not cite the criminal statute Corcoran referenced as a basis for the search. Instead, prosecutors pointed to possible violations of the broader-ranging and more severe Espionage Act, as well as criminal statutes covering theft of government records and obstruction of justice. The Justice Department had grown alarmed this spring after learning from the National Archives that Trump possessed “highly classified” materials in a Mar-a-Lago storage room, some of which had been returned to the archives earlier in the year. But DOJ came to believe not all of it had been sent back. Trump’s attorneys, meanwhile, delayed the FBI’s access to the retrieved documents earlier this year, according to correspondence released by the Archives. Ultimately the department resorted to getting a search warrant in order to try and obtain the materials it believed remained at Mar-a-Lago. The much-anticipated release of the affidavit behind that warrant came in response to an order from Reinhart, who partially granted a request from media organizations and a conservative group that the document be unsealed. The Justice Department argued against making even a redacted version of the affidavit public, warning that redactions needed to protect the integrity of the investigation and to prevent harm to individuals would be so extensive as to render the document meaningless. However, the department elected not to appeal Reinhart’s decision to release a censored version of the affidavit to a district court judge or to a federal appeals court. Prosecutors submitted proposed redactions to the court on Thursday morning and Reinhart concurred with all of them. In an order issued a short time later, the judge said that prosecutors had shown “good cause” to redact elements of the affidavit that would reveal “the identities of witnesses, law enforcement agents, and uncharged parties,” as well as “the investigation’s strategy, direction, scope, sources, and methods” and “grand jury information.” Some of the deletions are intended to shield investigators’ sources and methods for collecting evidence as part of their criminal probe into what Reinhart called the “highly classified” documents the FBI discovered at Mar-a-Lago. Both Reinhart and the Justice Department have noted an uptick in violent threats against those connected to the Trump probe as they laid out their rationale for redactions. While the precise reasons for most of the specific redactions were not revealed Friday, at least some — like withholding the name of the FBI agent who swore out the affidavit — were withheld on grounds of “agent safety.”",

        "description": "Monkey Barrel Comedy, EdinburghThe standup puts her working-class status front and centre in this compelling and cathartic journey through her Covid yearsLauren Pattison had two ambitions for 2020: get engaged, and take a comedy show on tour. By the summer, she’d lost her relationship and her career, fled London, and was working the tills at Morrison’s in her home town of Newcastle. It Is What It Is tells the story of her two-year fall and subsequent rise. Dogged, upbeat and motormouthed, it’s both an endearing tale of the 28-year-old’s resilience and a document of the damage (existential and financial) wrought on comedians by Covid.Particularly working-class comedians: Pattison’s class status is front and centre here. There’s a choice gag about nepotism (no friend to her comedy career) getting her a cushy supermarket job, and a conspicuous emphasis on the relative poshness of her successive boyfriends. Class figures too in her matter-of-factness when justifying her new line of work mid-pandemic. “I’m not brave,” Pattison tells aghast fellow comics, “I’m unemployed.”At Monkey Barrel Comedy, Edinburgh, until 28 August.All our Edinburgh festival reviews.

        "description": "Fourteen of the 15 boxes recovered from former President Donald Trump&#x27;s Florida estate early this year contained documents with classification markings, including at the top secret level, according to an FBI affidavit released Friday explaining the justification for this month&#x27;s search of the property.The 32-page affidavit, even in its heavily redacted form, offers the most detailed description to date of the government records being stored at Trump&#x27;s Mar-a-Lago property long after he left the White House and reveals the gravity of the government&#x27;s concerns that the documents were there illegally.“The government is conducting a criminal investigation concerning the improper removal and storage of classified information in unauthorized spaces, as well as the unlawful concealment or removal of government records,” an FBI agent wrote on the first page of the affidavit in seeking a judge&#x27;s permission for a warrant to search the property.The affidavit does not provide new details about the 11 sets of classified records recovered during the Aug. 8 search at Mar-a-Lago but instead concerns a separate batch of 15 boxes that the National Archives and Records Administration retrieved from the home in January.In those boxes, according to the affidavit, officials located 184 documents bearing classification markings, including 25 documents marked as top secret. Agents who inspected the boxes found markings related to information provided by confidential human sources as well as information related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.Taken together, the affidavit reveals additional details about an ongoing criminal investigation that has brought fresh legal peril for Trump just as he lays the groundwork for another presidential run. It also shows in stark detail the volume of sensitive government documents that were stored at Mar-a-Lago instead of being turned over to the National Archives.The FBI submitted the affidavit, or sworn statement, to a judge so it could obtain the warrant to search Trump&#x27;s property. Affidavits typically contain vital information about an investigation, with agents spelling out the justification for why they want to search a particular property and why they believe they’re likely to find evidence of a potential crime there.But affidavits routinely remain sealed during pending investigations, making the decision by Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart to reveal portions of it all the more striking.In an acknowledgment of the extraordinary public interest in the investigation, Reinhart on Thursday ordered the department by Friday to make public a redacted version of the affidavit. The directive came hours after federal law enforcement officials submitted under seal the portions of the affidavit that they wanted to keep secret as their investigation moves forward.Documents previously made public show the FBI retrieved from the property 11 sets of classified documents, including information marked at the top secret level. They also show that federal agents are investigating potential violations of three federal laws, including one that governs gathering, transmitting or losing defense information under the Espionage Act. The other statutes address the concealment, mutilation or removal of records and the destruction, alteration or falsification of records in federal investigations.It&#x27;s possible that the affidavit, particularly in its unredacted form, could shed light on key unanswered questions, including why sensitive presidential documents — classified documents, among them — were transported to Mar-a-Lago after Trump left the White House and why Trump and his representatives did not supply the entire tranche of material to the National Archives and Records Administration despite repeated entreaties.It could also offer additional details on the back-and-forth between Trump and the FBI, including a subpoena for documents that was issued last spring, as well as a June visit by FBI and Justice Department officials to assess how the materials were being stored.The Justice Department had earlier contested arguments by media organizations to make the affidavit public, saying any disclosure could contain private information about witnesses and about investigative tactics. But Reinhart, acknowledging the extraordinary public interest in the investigation, said last week that he was disinclined to keep the entire document sealed and told federal officials to submit to him in private the redactions it wanted to make.In his order Thursday, Reinhart said the department had made compelling arguments to leave sealed broad swaths of the document that, if disclosed, would reveal grand jury information; the identities of witnesses and “uncharged parties&quot;; and details about the investigation&#x27;s “strategy, direction, scope, sources and methods.”But he also said he was satisfied “that the Government has met its burden of showing that its proposed redactions are narrowly tailored to serve the Government’s legitimate interest in the integrity of the ongoing investigation and are the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire Affidavit.”",

        "description": "A federal judge has officially ordered the partially-redacted affidavit explaining justification for FBI search of Trump&#8217;s Mar-a-Lago property unsealed.\nFor what it&#8217;s worth, Donald Trump is sending out a barrage of posts on Truth Social.\nA Justice Department legal brief explains the proposed redactions:\n\nThe government asserts that an investigation of Trump has resulted in threats against witnesses and investigators.\nThe government asserts that information must be withheld because of the near-certainty of obstruction of justice.\n\nAnd here is some of what is included in the partially-redacted affidavit:\n\nTrump is referred to in the affidavit as &#8220;FPOTUS.&#8221;\nIn the 15 boxes taken from Mar-a-Lago, the Justice Department says &#8220;of most significant concern was that highly classified records were unfoldered, intermixed with other records, and otherwise unproperly identified.&#8221;\n&#8220;There is probable cause to believe that additional documents that contain classified NDI or that are Presidential records subject to record retention &#8230; remain at the PREMISES. There is also probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction will be found at the PREMISES.&#8221;\nAgents discovered that many of the materials included the highest national security restrictions with foreign governments, to protect “clandestine human sources” employed by intelligence community to collect information around the world.\n&#8220;Based on the foregoing facts and circumstances, I submit that probable cause exists to believe that evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed in violation 18 U.S.C. §§ 793(e), 2071, or 1519 will be found at the PREMISES.&#8221;\n\nMatthew Miller: &#8220;All of it is bad, but Trump having documents derived from human intelligence (i.e. spies) floating around Mar-a-Lago is about the worst imaginable offense in this space.&#8221;\nPlease leave your reactions in the comments.",

        "description": "If someone tries to sell you 30TB of solid-state storage for less than $40, consider turning around and running away, no matter how many clip-art rockets they use in their pictures.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt feels like high-capacity SSDs are getting cheaper all the time, but in the words of a security researcher known as Ray Redacted on Twitter, there are still some deals that are too good to be true. In the spirit of discovery, he bought a \"30TB\" external SSD from AliExpress for $31.40, which also happens to be listed on Walmart's website for $39 (I am linking it for educational and entertainment value, please do not buy it).\nFor those of you who are following this thread but not understanding the scam: Scammer gets two 512MB Flash drives. Or 1 gigabyte, or whatever.  They then add hacked firmware that makes it misreport its size.  Windows reports EXACTLY 15.0 terabytes. Not 14.89, Not 14.78— Ray [REDACTED] (@RayRedacted) August 26, 2022\nBut when you go to WRITE a big file, hacked firmware simply writes all new data on top of old data, while keeping directory (with false info) intact. H2Testw actually WRITES &amp; then RE-READS its data. But the scammer slowed the bus down from 5 gigabits per second to .48 gigabits— Ray [REDACTED] (@RayRedacted) August 26, 2022\nOn the inside, this \"SSD\" looks like two small-capacity microSD cards hot glued to a USB 2.0-capable board. This board's firmware has been modified so that each of these cards reports its capacity as \"15.0TB\" to the operating system, for a total of 30TB, even though the actual capacity of the cards is much lower. This is another giveaway; Windows reports drive capacities in gibibytes (1,024 mebibytes) or tebibytes (1,024 gibibytes), while drive manufacturers use gigabytes (1,000 megabytes) and terabytes (1,000 gigabytes). This is why a 1TB drive normally only has a reported capacity of 930-ish GB, rather than a nice round number.Read 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

The suit also doesn't seek damages for sales before March 8, 2022, sales in lower or middle-income AMC 92 nations, or sales where \"the US Government would be responsible for any damages.\"\nIn a statement announcing the suit, Moderna stated that it expected Pfizer and BioNTech to \"respect its intellectual property rights\" and \"consider a commercially reasonable license\" to sell vaccines outside those accepted conditions, but the firms failed to do so.Read 10 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

In an interview on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, Zuckerberg said the device is coming at Meta's Connect conference in October.\nZuckerberg described some key features of the new headset—most notably the ability to track your facial expressions and represent them on your virtual avatar. He again explained that his focus is on using VR as the ultimate expression of technology connecting people—for example, by facilitating eye contact within VR.\n\"When you're on a video call, you don't actually feel like you're there with the person.

Dell was also a step ahead of the competition a couple of years ago when it moved to a slightly taller screen with a 16:10 aspect ratio, further improving the design's usability without increasing its size.\nBut for power users who can afford to spend a few hundred extra dollars, Lenovo's ThinkPad X1 Carbon has always been an appealing upsell. It's a little lighter than Dell's ultraportable, but it nevertheless manages to fit in a bigger screen and a better port selection. Lenovo's laptop keyboards and trackpads are almost always best in class. And the ThinkPad's pedigree as a business laptop means that the Carbon's design still makes nods to repairability and upgradability, even if many of its internal components have still been soldered down to save space.\nThis year's version of the X1 Carbon—we're up to Gen 10, if anyone's counting—doesn't change much on the outside. But it includes new 12th-generation Intel Core processors, which, as we've seen in other laptops, can be a blessing and a curse. Performance in CPU-heavy tasks can be faster, sometimes dramatically so. But it comes at the expense of extra heat and less battery life, and that's a tough trade-off to recommend for a general-use ultraportable.Read 20 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Data were then converted into a score out of 100, with 100 points representing the safest conditions. Weighted averages were used to determine each state’s overall score.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn recent weeks, new cases of COVID-19 have slowly begun to decrease, and around 67 percent of the nation’s population has been vaccinated against COVID-19.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, on the state level WalletHub found Vermont ranked the best out of the country for keeping its residents safe, with a score of 75.95. North Carolina, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Maine, and Hawaii followed, respectively. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bottom 10 slots were occupied by Louisiana, being the worst with a score of 14.31, followed by West Virginia, Tennessee, Georgia, Kentucky, Indiana and Mississippi.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResults are similar to findings of another recent study that tracked the most and least healthy states in the country. In that analysis, researchers found Vermont was the third healthiest state, while New Hampshire and Connecticut were in the top 10.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConversely, Louisiana, West Virginia, and Mississippi ranked as some of the least healthy states.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to the WalletHub analysis these states all had high COVID-19 death rates and low vaccination rates.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, several states surveyed, like Alabama, reported low COVID-19 death rates along with low vaccination rates.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTied for first place, North Carolina, Washington D.C., Massachusetts, New York and Pennsylvania had the highest rates of vaccinated residents. Wyoming came in last, outranked by Mississippi and Louisiana, respectively.\n\n\n\nIn addition, Vermont had the lowest positive testing rate recorded, while Missouri and Tennessee had the highest rates of positive tests.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSimilar to trends documented throughout the pandemic, states who voted for a Democrat in the 2020 election tended to be safer than those that went Republican.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Imagine&nbsp;signing one consent form to receive help from a shelter, food pantry, substance abuse center, or other social service — but with that one action, you’ve opened the floodgates for&nbsp;staff and volunteers at hundreds of other&nbsp;organizations&nbsp;to see your private financial, medical, behavioral, and&nbsp;social data&nbsp;in its entirety. And you didn’t have a choice in the matter.\n\n\n\nThis is more than hypothetical; it’s happening in communities today.\n\n\n\nWe’re in this situation because privacy assurances within the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) introduced&nbsp;20 years ago this month&nbsp;have not kept up with healthcare organizations that are now taking an earnest and more modern approach to whole person care. This has left the door open for bad actors to take advantage of loopholes and diminish privacy for deeply personal information.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo maintain high standards for the privacy and protection of personal information that citizens across the U.S. have come to expect, legislators need to act before it’s too late.\n\n\n\nIt’s important to understand how the blurring lines between health care and social care have unintentionally created an environment that some organizations are exploiting.\n\n\n\nOver the past two decades, the U.S. has made significant strides in recognizing the outsized impact that socioeconomic factors have on health outcomes and cost. In fact, it’s widely accepted that&nbsp;80 percent of health outcomes are determined by these social determinants of health&nbsp;(SDOH) – including food insecurity, transportation barriers, housing instability and other factors. In other words, the medications you take or the decisions you make with your doctor, while important, only influence a fraction of your overall health.\n\n\n\nThis is why healthcare organizations have become more involved in social care. They realize how important it is for keeping people healthy, so as they continue to focus on what they do best — medicine and clinical care — they’re partnering with other organizations in their communities that provide social care. Nonprofits and community-based organizations (CBOs) that provide assistance for things like food, housing, transportation, utilities, substance abuse treatment and so much more are the bedrock of our social safety net. And when these organizations are connected to and working with our healthcare systems, it lifts the wellbeing of our communities and the people in them.\n\n\n\nOrganizing CBOs, nonprofits and other social services into a network to help people find the right resources at the right time amplifies the reach these organizations have, and the good they can do. But if a social care network is not thoughtfully designed with the right legal and moral boundaries for protecting personal information, privacy starts to erode.\n\n\n\nHealthcare organizations are held to a higher standard for protecting personal information, thanks to HIPAA and other industry regulations — but the social care organizations they work with are not held to those same standards. This must change.\n\n\n\nThis spring, the&nbsp;State of New Hampshire passed a bill with overwhelming, bi-partisan support to provide important guard rails for privacy when accessing social services through a referral network. This simple but critical legislation for maintaining privacy can serve as a blueprint for federal action on the issue. In the meantime, states that care about the privacy of their residents (and which can act more nimbly than the federal government) should consider enacting similar legislation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is no legitimate argument for leaving privacy behind when modernizing the social safety net. Some might say that requiring individual consent — versus blanket consent —&nbsp;to refer&nbsp;a person to a social service will hinder access to care. This is simply not true.\n\n\n\nOrganizations across the country are&nbsp;successfully working with&nbsp;referral networks that require individual consent, proving that it can be done efficiently and effectively. On the other hand, there are others who are taking the opposite approach. In these cases, people may not realize that they’re giving blanket consent for their personal information to become accessible far and wide by others in their community.\n\n\n\nSo many people are concerned about how social media networks may be ignoring privacy by tracking people and sharing data — it’s a legitimate issue that gets constant attention. Social care networks are capable of similar actions, but the information they have access to is far more personal. This issue deserves just as much — if not more — attention until we can assure each individual has full control of their personal information and transparency to know who has access to it.\n\n\n\nNew Hampshire was the first to recognize that this breach of privacy has been taking place. As&nbsp;a result, the state took swift steps to prevent it from happening. It’s time for others to follow suit.\n\n\n\nErine Gray is CEO and founder of&nbsp;findhelp.org, a public benefit corporation working to modernize America’s social safety net for anyone who needs help or helps others.",

        "description": "Two people were killed and two others wounded in a shooting at a homeless shelter in Kentucky on Thursday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPolice responded to a report of multiple people being shot at&nbsp;the Harbor House men’s shelter in Henderson, a city located along the Ohio River near Indiana, around 7:40 p.m., according to a news release. Officers found four victims with gunshot wounds, one of whom was dead when they arrived and three of whom were transported to local hospitals with life-threatening injuries.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA second victim died at the hospital.\n\n\n\nPolice identified the shooter as 37-year-old Kenneth Gibbs, a resident of the shelter, and found his vehicle about two hours after they initially responded. \n\n\n\nPolice said that soon after, they found Gibbs walking in the area of softball fields and arrested him without incident. He had a handgun on him at the time of his arrest, police said. \n\n\n\nHe was charged with two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder, according to the release.\n\n\n\nThe release did not give additional details about the circumstances of the shooting.\n\n\n\nPolice identified the two deceased as 67-year-old Steven Wathen and 44-year-old Chad Holmes. The two injured were a 33-year-old male and a 41-year-old male. All victims were Harbor House residents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Evansville Courier and Press reported that the two injured are in stable condition.",

Judge Bruce Reinhart concluded Thursday that proposed redactions from DOJ were narrow enough to allow for public disclosure while protecting their ongoing investigation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe affidavit offers new information about the extent of the saga to recover documents from Mar-a-Lago. The document says the National Archives first reached out about retrieving records as early as May 6, 2021 – just a few months after Trump left office.\n\n\n\nYet it wasn’t until late that year that the Trump team alerted Archives that they had 12 boxes ready for pick up. The agency would instead leave with 15.\n\n\n\nThe release of the redacted affidavit follows the disclosure of the warrant that allowed for the search of Trump’s home, indicating that storing documents there may have violated the Espionage Act, as well as two other statutes.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tRead the document: Unsealed Department of Justice’s Trump warrant affidavit\t\n\n\n\n\nOne bars concealing, removing and mutilating government documents, and the other prohibits similar actions when done “with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence [an] investigation.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn inventory released alongside the warrant indicated the FBI recovered 11 different sets of classified documents during the search, along with information about “the president of France” and Trump’s pardon of his ally Roger Stone. \n\n\n\nThe affidavit consistently refers to the possibility of finding “national defense information” at Trump’s home, a term used in the Espionage Act. The law does not require mishandling classified materials, only information that if released could injure the United States.\n\n\n\nIn a statement from Trump shortly after its release, the former president called the document “a total public relations subterfuge by the FBI &amp; DOJ” that was not reflective of “our close working relationship regarding document turnover - WE GAVE THEM MUCH.”\n\n\n\nBut the affidavit counters some of the prior statements from Trump and his legal team.\n\n\n\nWhile in prior statements Trump noted that he put a larger lock on his storage room at Mar-a-Lago at the request of the government – “We agreed. They were shown the secured area, and the boxes themselves” – the interaction does not appear to be as friendly as Trump suggested.\n\n\n\n“They have not been handled in an appropriate manner or stored in an appropriate location. Accordingly, we ask that the room at Mar-a-Lago where the documents had been stored be secured and that all of the boxes that were moved from the White House to Mar-a-Lago (along with any other items in that room) be preserved in that room in their current condition until further notice,” the Justice Department wrote in a June 8 letter.\n\n\n\nThat correspondence came after DOJ had already issued a May subpoena requesting Trump return of classified materials kept at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nTrump had called for the release of both the warrant and the affidavit. He filed a separate case however seeking an injunction to stall the FBI’s investigation and asking a court to appoint a special master for the case. Doing so would let an outside party approved by the court first review the evidence taken during the search before the FBI can review it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nWe&#39;re also getting a better breakdown of what was in the 15 boxes that Archives retrieved from MAL in January. pic.twitter.com/vpxqnxlLnM&mdash; 𝚁𝚎𝚋𝚎𝚌𝚌𝚊 𝙱𝚎𝚒𝚝𝚜𝚌𝚑 (@RebeccaBeitsch) August 26, 2022\n\n\n\n\nThis story was updated at 1:32 p.m.",

        "title": "Removing friction in climate finance",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3616897-removing-friction-in-climate-finance/",
        "description": "The climate finance problem is not a shortage of finance or of opportunity. The real problem is the friction that slows the flow of capital from investors to climate solutions. This friction, created by outdated and overbearing regulations, industry and market inexperience, and inertia, spans the globe.\n\n\n\nWhen I began work in this area two decades ago, entrepreneurs (including me) complained that investors were uninterested in financing businesses addressing climate change. Conversely, investors complained that there were simply too few financeable businesses. Both were right. In the early 2000s, products designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, such as solar panels, were outrageously expensive, more than&nbsp;four times&nbsp;the cost of power from natural gas. Similarly,&nbsp;electric vehicles&nbsp;were costly and lacked the range to compete with gasoline-powered automobiles.\n\n\n\nToday, that’s no longer the case. Renewable energy is cheaper than fossil fuels, with the International Energy Agency declaring solar \"the cheapest source of electricity in history\". Electric vehicles perform better than gasoline-powered automobiles, have comparable range and refuel for a fraction of the cost. But just because low-carbon products are better, does not mean that climate change has been solved.\n\n\n\nAvoiding catastrophic warming, defined by scientists as global warming more than 1.5 to 2 degrees Celsius, requires an entirely new global economy, reconfiguring our sources and uses of energy, transportation, existing building stock, agriculture and land use. And it needs to happen quickly. To put it another way, the global economy built in the 300 years since the Industrial Revolution must be rebuilt within 30 years. Investors met the unprecedented demand for capital to create the Industrial Revolution. They have the opportunity to do it again in the era of climate change.\n\n\n\nSeizing this historic opportunity will require policymakers in every country to address three points of friction slowing the flow of investment capital required to alter the course of climate change:\n\n\n\n1) Regulations\n\n\n\nFinancing a transmission line to move clean hydropower from Canada to New York City has taken&nbsp;17 years&nbsp;to clear regulatory approvals and is still pending final review.\n\n\n\nThe story in Europe is not much better. In Germany, a country with a history of leadership on climate change, construction of&nbsp;new wind farms&nbsp;has ground to a halt in the face of new state-level regulations. In many countries, outdated regulations thwart investment in energy efficiency in buildings, electric vehicle charging stations, sustainable meat substitutes and so many more climate-friendly businesses.\n\n\n\nThe solution to regulatory friction is both less government and more. Specifically, governments at every level need to remove or streamline regulations that hamper projects while imposing government authority to resolve disputes and limit NIMBYism (those who cry “not in my back yard”). The recently passed&nbsp;Inflation Reduction Act&nbsp;incentivizes low-carbon solutions, but even its political backers recognize the need to advance&nbsp;“permitting reforms”&nbsp;for the promise of this new law to be realized.\n\n\n\n2)&nbsp;Inexperience\n\n\n\nInvestors rely heavily on experience, their own and that of market experts, when committing capital. This poses a problem for climate solutions that are relatively new to investors. For example, renewable energy projects have been&nbsp;slow to securitize&nbsp;because of an absence of standards and ratings, reducing the flow of capital to the sector.\n\n\n\nFortunately, investors are beginning to understand how to navigate this new terrain. As I outline in my new book,&nbsp;“Investing in the Era of Climate Change,” five climate-friendly investment strategies are broadening the participation of investors, not only individuals but also large institutional investors.\n\n\n\n3)&nbsp;Inertia\n\n\n\nInvesting in climate solutions in developing countries is made more challenging by volatile local currency exchange rates, economic and political instability. These additional frictions have created an inertia among investors.\n\n\n\nWhile the UN calls for a six-fold increase in financing of climate solutions in developing countries, actual foreign direct investment has&nbsp;declined&nbsp;in recent years. Governments and multilateral institutions, such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, need to address this inertia with sovereign risk insurance products to accelerate capital flows from investors to low-carbon solutions in developing countries.\n\n\n\nThese friction points appear minor against the massive challenge of climate change but addressing them will make a world of difference. Products to reduce nearly half of global emissions are already commercially competitive and appealing to many traditional investors. The technologies needed to reduce the remaining half are in development and attracting venture capital investors. While the total investment needed to remake the global economy is an estimated&nbsp;$100 trillion to 150 trillion&nbsp;over the next 30 years, an increase of five to eight times the current rate of&nbsp;$600 billion&nbsp;annually, it’s entirely feasible given the deep liquidity of the global capital markets and the shift underway in the investment community.\n\n\n\nThe capital exists, as do the business solutions, to avoid a climate catastrophe. Governments simply need to ensure they connect quickly enough.\n\n\n\nBruce&nbsp;Usher&nbsp;is the Elizabeth B. Strickler and Mark T. Gallogy faculty director of the Tamer Center for Social Enterprise and a Chazen Institute senior scholar at Columbia Business School.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/national-security/3616988-trump-affidavit-shows-fbi-doj-public-relations-subterfuge/",
        "description": "Former President Trump on Friday bashed the Department of Justice and a federal judge following the release of a heavily redacted affidavit that provided several new details on the search of his Mar-a-Lago estate earlier this month.\n\n\n\n“Affidavit heavily redacted!!! Nothing mentioned on ‘Nuclear,’ a total public relations subterfuge by the FBI &amp; DOJ, or our close working relationship regarding document turnover - WE GAVE THEM MUCH,” Trump posted on Truth Social, the social media site he helped launch.\n\n\n\nTrump also complained that the judge in the case, Bruce Reinhart, should not have signed off on the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago and suggested he should have recused himself from the case. Reinhart has received threats in the wake of the search.\n\n\n\nThe former president's response appeared to be specifically referencing a report that some of the documents he had at Mar-a-Lago contained classified information about the nation's nuclear program. The specific contents of the documents were not detailed in the affidavit released Friday.\n\n\n\nThe redacted affidavit came out one week after Reinhart said the federal government could make recommendations for redactions but that he saw no reason to keep the document under seal.\n\n\n\nThe document said authorities found 184 classified documents in their initial review of boxes recovered from the home in January. Of those 184 documents, 68 were marked “confidential,” 92 were marked “secret” and 25 were marked “top secret,” according to the affidavit.\n\n\n\nThe 28-page affidavit, which was used to justify the search earlier this month, contains numerous redactions but indicates that the January review caused authorities to believe “evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed” would be found at Mar-a-Lago. The affidavit also indicates “there is probable cause to believe that evidence of obstruction” would be found at the estate.\n\n\n\nIn a separate filing explaining the rationale behind its redactions, DOJ said it had to protect “a broad range of civilian witnesses,” warning they would likely face intimidation.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump has in the weeks since the FBI search attacked the judge in the case as well as federal law enforcement, claiming he is the victim of political persecution.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe has repeatedly asserted that he cooperated with authorities to turn over documents prior to the search. Federal officials have indicated they had concerns about the handling of sensitive materials and had previous conversations with Trump’s representatives about the documents prior to the search.\n\n\n\nThe search has galvanized Republican support for Trump at a time when he is mulling a campaign for the White House in 2024, with the vast majority of GOP officials arguing the search was unjustified and calling for the release of the full affidavit.\n\n\n\n\"The release of a heavily redacted, overtly political affidavit only proves that the Biden administration is desperate to cover up their unprecedented, unnecessary, and un-American raid against President Donald J. Trump,\" Taylor Budowich, a spokesperson for the former president, tweeted Friday.\n\n\n\n\"This is a grave travesty, and what is unredacted only further supports President Trump's position, there was NO reason for a raid - it is all politics!\" Budowich added.",

        "description": "Some people might be familiar with ENS, the \"Ethereum Name Service\", which seeks to be a web3 equivalent of DNS. If you've seen people with usernames ending in .eth, that's an ENS address. The problem is that .eth is not a functional top-level domain, and so many services relied on eth.link to surface these DNS records to other services.However, the eth.link domain is only rented for a set period of time and needs to be renewed. ENS DAO tweeted that the domain's owner, Virgil Griffith, is \"unavailable\". By this, they mean that he is currently serving his first of five years in prison for helping North Korea evade sanctions. With Griffith \"unavailable\", the project has found itself at the mercy of GoDaddy. Welcome to the decentralized web3 we've all been promised!Although GoDaddy previously allowed another person to renew the domain on Griffith's behalf, they reversed that decision, and now say they intend to allow the domain to expire on September 5.The ENS DAO issued a series of tweets urging people to switch to a different service, given the risk that the domain could be snapped up. \"If the name expires and is acquired by someone with ill intent, the damage they could do via phishing is substantial - so please update your links and alert your users of the issue immediately,\" they wrote.\n        \n            \n              \n                Tweet thread by ENS DAO\n               \n            \n            \n              \n                \"GoDaddy Statement on eth.link Domain Registration\"",

        "description": "Many of the GOP’s biggest donors are among those who funneled anonymous contributions to former U.N ambassador Nikki Haley’s nonprofit as she lays the groundwork for a prospective 2024 presidential bid, according to previously unreported tax documents obtained by POLITICO. Haley’s nonprofit policy advocacy group, Stand For America, Inc., has received major donations from people including New York hedge fund manager Paul Singer, investor Stanley Druckenmiller, and Miriam Adelson and her late husband, casino mogul Sheldon Adelson, the Internal Revenue Service filings reveal. The roster of supporters who gave undisclosed donations in 2019 also includes Suzanne Youngkin, the wife of Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, himself a possible presidential contender; former Pennsylvania Senate candidate and hedge fund executive David McCormick; and Vivek and Lakshmi Garipalli, members of a New Jersey family that has donated large sums to Democrats — but which gave Haley’s organization $1 million. The donor list also includes dozens of people who gave anonymously to Haley’s nonprofit but have not given disclosed contributions to her PAC, which was formed two years later and is required to regularly disclose the names of donors who give at least $200. Those contributors include the Garipallis and GOP megadonor Joe Ricketts. (See the full list of donors here.) Like other nonprofits, Stand For America files an annual tax return with the IRS. While the agency and the nonprofit must make those filings available to the public, including the amounts of contributions to the group, such nonprofits do not have to disclose the identities of their donors. However, the organization Documented, which describes itself as a nonpartisan government watchdog that investigates money in politics, obtained an unredacted copy of Stand For America’s 2019 filings, which it then shared with POLITICO. The group did not share the original source of the filing, but it bears a stamp from the charity office of the New York state attorney general. The disclosures provide the clearest picture yet of how a prospective 2024 presidential candidate is cultivating a secret network of high-dollar contributors as she builds a political apparatus. And the names of her donors demonstrate the deep connections Haley has formed at the top levels of the Republican Party, with some of the GOP’s biggest super PAC donors among those who gave money to fund the launch of her organization after she left the Trump administration. Haley is among at least a dozen other would-be White House hopefuls— including former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence — who also have allied nonprofits bankrolled by donors whose identities have remained under wraps.  “It’s very rare that the public has the opportunity to see the identities of the donors who are providing five- or even six-figure contributions to a dark money group. It’s called dark money for a reason. Typically, the public does not know who is financing these groups, and this is a rare exception,” said Brendan Fischer, deputy executive director of Documented. “This previously unpublished donor list provides a valuable clue as to the network of wealthy donors that Haley might rely upon if she does ultimately run for office,” Fischer said. Such tax filings are typically closely held, as donors contribute to nonprofit groups with the understanding that their names will be kept secret. The Haley team moved to stop publication of this story, with attorney Michael Adams writing in a cease-and-desist letter that POLITICO “was not authorized to receive the confidential tax return information, nor is Politico entitled to print, publish, or even retain it.” Lynn Oberlander, an attorney for Ballard Spahr representing POLITICO, responded in a letter that the reporting on the funding of U.S. political activity “is in the public interest and fully protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution.” POLITICO reached out to each donor named in this article prior to publication. They either did not respond or declined to offer comment. “This disclosure of a confidential tax return was clearly a corrupt violation of state and federal law to try to intimidate conservative donors,” Haley said in a statement. \"Liberals have always weaponized government against conservatives, and Republicans have been too nice for too long. We will make sure the buck stops here.” The nonprofit is a political asset for the 50-year-old Haley, a former South Carolina governor long known as a favorite in the GOP donor world. When she launched the group in 2019, it was five years since her most recent run for office, and she could use the group to build a fresh new email list of supporters, pay staff and fund travel, polling and policy research. Just because a donor gives to her nonprofit does not necessarily indicate they will back a future presidential bid. Many of the contributors are also known to support other potential candidates, including Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. The contributions from 2019 also represent a snapshot in time: The donors gave before Trump lost his 2020 reelection race and immediately pivoted to make himself a frontrunner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Documented says it has not obtained the unredacted version of Stand For America’s most recent IRS filings, which cover the 2020 calendar year. The redacted 2020 filings show that the organization raised $9.3 million that year, with the largest single contribution totaling $750,000. Haley stepped down from her post in the Trump administration at the end of 2018 and launched Stand For America shortly after. The 501(c)(4) “social welfare” organization’s mission, according to its website, is to support “policy that will ensure a stronger, safer, and more prosperous country for all Americans.”    Over the course of 2019, the filing shows, Haley received the support of 71 donors who gave at least $5,000, for an overall fundraising total of $7 million. The biggest givers were New Jersey health executive Vivek Garipalli and his mother, Lakshmi Garipalli, who contributed $500,000 apiece. Vivek Garipalli has been a regular Democratic donor, giving to the likes of President Joe Biden and Senate Democrats — but he has a “longstanding personal friendship” with Haley and her husband, according to a federal financial disclosure document Haley filed in 2018, when she was serving as U.N. ambassador. Garipalli gifted Haley New York Knicks tickets valued at nearly $20,000 that year, and he gave hundreds of thousands of dollars to a pair of pro-Haley political action committees when she was governor of South Carolina, according to campaign finance filings. Haley’s next-biggest nonprofit donors in 2019 were the Adelsons, who each donated $250,000. (Sheldon Adelson died in early 2021.) Miriam Adelson — who has since become the most sought-after megadonor in the GOP — also donated the maximum-allowed $5,000 to Haley’s PAC in 2021, her first federal donation since her husband’s death. Haley was one of a handful of would-be candidates who landed a private meeting with Miriam Adelson while attending a Republican Jewish Coalition conference in the fall of 2021.  The third-biggest donors were Stanley Druckenmiller and his wife, Fiona, who gave a combined $350,000. Next was Scott Bessent, an investor with a long history of giving to Republicans, who contributed $325,000. Singer, another prominent GOP megadonor, gave $270,000. Haley’s donors span the party’s ideological spectrum, from those supportive of Trump to those less so. She attracted six-figure nonprofit donations from Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, who extensively funded Trump’s 2020 reelection effort, but also Druckenmiller, who backed former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a moderate Republican, over Trump in the 2016 primary. Haley has separately launched Stand For America PAC, which unlike the non-profit vehicle must disclose its contributors and has a donation limit of $5,000. The PAC can spend unlimited amounts on politics, though the size of donations are capped. And while the nonprofit can raise and spend in unlimited amounts, it has restrictions on how much it can spend on expressly political activity. Some of Haley’s donors have only given through the dark money vehicle. While the Garipallis and Bessent are among Stand For America’s biggest donors, they have yet to give to Stand For America PAC, according to the most recent federal filings. The same goes for Republican megadonor Ricketts, who gave $50,000 to the nonprofit Stand For America but nothing to the PAC, which was registered in 2021. Haley’s nonprofit vehicle — like those aligned with other prospective 2024 candidates — is using its funding to pay political consulting firms doing work for the group. Stand For America’s highest-paid vendors, according to the filing, include prominent Republican consulting firms: direct mail firm Image Direct and a pair of digital firms, Coldspark and Fifth Influence. The nonprofit has also promoted Haley’s policy platform, and it has developed an extensive email list of prospective supporters. Stand For America sends out a five-day-a-week policy newsletter to more than 200,000 subscribers, has aired issue advocacy commercials in states like Georgia and Virginia, and hosted virtual town halls for supporters. In addition, the organization has conducted congressional outreach on certain issues, published a 160-page policy book and produced a series of policy videos in which Haley has participated. All of the activity helps to promote Haley as she ramps up for 2024. A future Haley campaign could rent or buy the email list to build out its fundraising apparatus, for example. “The reality is that some potential candidates are relying on a small handful of very wealthy donors as they map out their political future,” Fischer said. “And if those candidates win office, they’re going to owe an immense debt of gratitude to those secret donors.”",

        "description": "Justice Department lawyers are in the early stages of drafting a potential antitrust complaint against Apple, according to a person with direct knowledge of the matter — a sign that a long-running investigation may be nearing a decision point and a suit could be coming soon. Various groups of prosecutors inside DOJ are assembling the pieces for a potential lawsuit, the individual said, adding that the department’s antitrust division hopes to file suit by the end of the year. Still, the Justice Department has made no decisions whether or when to sue Apple, the world’s most valuable public company, cautioned that person and one other familiar with the probe — and it’s still possible no case will be filed. Both were granted anonymity to discuss a confidential investigation. The suit would be the latest major legal problem besetting the country’s biggest tech companies two years after federal regulators and multiple states filed antitrust cases against Google and Facebook. And it would be the DOJ’s first antitrust suit against one of the tech titans during President Joe Biden’s administration. The Justice Department has been investigating Apple since 2019 over allegations that it abused its market power to stifle smaller tech companies, including app developers and competing hardware makers. As the investigation has progressed, a suit has become increasingly likely, but the move to drafting sections of the suit is a significant step forward in the process. DOJ declined to comment. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Apple investigation is one of a series of efforts by Congress, DOJ and the Federal Trade Commission to rein in the mammoth tech companies that have come to dominate the global internet, social media and online advertising. The FTC is also pursuing an antitrust investigation of Amazon involving both its retail and cloud computing businesses. The Apple case is particularly significant because it would open a second, massive battle with the tech industry at DOJ. The Justice Department is already litigating a case against Google over its search business and is preparing a second lawsuit over its advertising operations. While DOJ could still decide not to sue, the deliberations about how to frame a complaint make a case more likely. Any case is going to be a hard fight for DOJ, and with a market cap of $2.73 trillion, Apple has near endless resources to defend itself. It has already shown a willingness to litigate to protect its lucrative App Store, going to trial against Fortnite maker Epic Games last year. To date, much of the attention on a potential Justice Department case against Apple has focused on its App Store, the only way for users to download applications on iPhones and iPads. But the case DOJ is now considering extends well beyond the Apple-controlled payment system and the high commissions that have drawn the ire of software developers for years, according to the individuals. Prosecutors are also homing in on whether and how Apple’s control over its physical devices harms competitors beyond app developers. DOJ is focused heavily on public complaints leveled by Tile, a maker of devices and technology used to find lost items, according to three people with knowledge of the government’s work. All were granted anonymity to discuss confidential meetings. Tile’s tracking devices compete against Apple’s AirTags. Tile has been public about its complaints, testifying in congressional hearings that Apple has made it more difficult for the company’s devices to access needed location data, and restricted access to key hardware components in its phones. DOJ lawyers in San Francisco are leading the probe, and have been reaching out in recent weeks to companies that partner with Tile to enable the company’s location tracking technology in their devices, according to the three people. In those meetings, the three people said, department officials have made clear that both Apple’s App Store and mobile phone operating systems at large are under scrutiny. Tile declined to comment. Complaints around Apple’s App Store have been percolating for years, and are focused on the company’s policies prohibiting outside payments for in-app purchases and rules barring iPhone users from circumventing the store to download software on the devices. That’s in contrast to devices running Google’s Android operating system, which generally allow users to install apps from rival sources. Google, however, is also facing antitrust scrutiny in the U.S. and Europe over its app store. Epic Games went to trial against Apple last year over the App Store restrictions on its Fortnite video game, largely losing its case but attracting the interest of DOJ prosecutors who attended every day of the three-week legal showdown. The federal judge in the Epic case ruled that Apple is not a monopolist but said the company has unfairly restricted access to its phones and must allow third-party payment systems. Both sides are appealing, and the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals has scheduled a hearing for late October. The timing of a potential DOJ case against the company is almost certain to be dictated at least in part by the Epic case. Justice Department officials will likely want to wait for the outcome of the appeal to help decide how to frame a possible lawsuit. In her ruling, the trial judge expressly said that while Epic did not prove its case, it's possible that another plaintiff could.",

        "description": "A new study reveals that we share the social media posts that we think are the most relevant to ourselves or to our friends and family.\nThe average internet user spends nearly three hours a day using social media. It&#8217;s clear that social media is becoming increasingly crucial to sharing important information with the public—like how to stay safe from COVID-19, for example—and researchers want to know what makes a piece of media compelling enough for people to share it online.\nResearchers analyzed the behavior of more than 3,000 individuals to explore the psychology behind sharing information online. It turns out that the answer is quite straightforward: People share information that they feel is meaningful to themselves or to the people they know.\nDanielle Cosme, a research director at the Annenberg School for Communication&#8217;s Communication Neuroscience Lab at the University of Pennsylvania, and her team test what contributes to &#8220;value-based virality&#8221;—essentially that information on the internet can go viral because people find it inherently valuable, either to themselves or to society.\nThis finding is key to crafting effective messaging for social causes, says Cosme. Knowing the psychological ingredients that make a person share a post on social media can help scientists share facts about climate change or public health officials dispel myths about vaccines.\nCosme&#8217;s research shows that people pay more attention to information they perceive to be related to themselves.\nSimilarly, humans are social beings and love to connect with each other. Sharing information activates reward centers in our brain. And when we communicate with others, we consider what the other person is thinking or wants to hear—a quality known as social relevance.\nFor the new study, researchers exposed participants to articles and social media posts about health, climate change, voting, and COVID-19. Some participants read headlines and summaries of news articles, others looked at social media posts. All of the participants rated how likely they were to share each message and how relevant they found each one to themselves and to people they know.\nThe researchers found that no matter the topic covered or the medium of the message, people were most likely to say they&#8217;d share messages that they perceived as self- or socially relevant. Further, they found that when participants were asked to explicitly write out why a message was relevant to themselves or people they know, they were even more likely to share it than when they just reflected on the topic.\n&#8220;Sharing information is a critical component of individual and collective action,&#8221; Cosme says. &#8220;At the beginning of the pandemic, we needed to quickly spread accurate information about what was going on, how to protect ourselves, how to protect each other. Information spreading within social networks can be really impactful for changing our individual behavior, and also changing our collective behavior through shifting our perceptions of what&#8217;s normative.&#8221;\nWith data on tens of thousands of messages, Cosme and her colleagues at the Communication Neuroscience Lab believe this finding can help shape effective public messaging on social media.\n&#8220;We&#8217;re interested in understanding how we can translate psychological theory into real-world interventions to try to promote behavior change,&#8221; Cosme says.\nOne way to improve content sharing is to recruit people who find the content self- or socially relevant to share messages online. Another is to frame messages to be seen as more self- or socially relevant by audiences without tailoring the messages themselves.\n&#8220;We developed message frames that could be paired with existing news and social media posts,&#8221; says Emily Falk, the study&#8217;s senior author. &#8220;This means that the same prompts that worked in this study could be tested easily in other contexts as well.&#8221;\nThe researchers are continuing this research by looking at brain activity in relation to social media sharing. For these studies, they&#8217;re using fMRI scanners to understand how specific regions of the brain shape perceptions of self and social relevance.\nOverall, the team hopes that the results of the study will give those wanting to create social change the tools to do so effectively.\n&#8220;Big issues require collective action,&#8221; Cosme says. And spreading accurate information empowers individuals to join together and act.\n&#8220;This study highlights key psychological ingredients that motivate people to share information about topics that impact our well-being,&#8221; Falk says. &#8220;Sharing is one key lever for shifting cultural norms and motivating larger scale action, so it&#8217;s really important to understand what makes it happen.&#8221;\nThe study appears in the Journal of Experimental Psychology: General.\nSource: Penn\nThe post There&#8217;s a simple motivation for social media shares appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "The Democratic National Committee rolled out a digital ad buy in four states hitting Republicans on abortion following bans on the procedure going into effect in Idaho, Texas and Tennessee. \n\n\n\nThe five-figure ad buy, which was first reported on by The Hill, is slated to run in Nevada, Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Colorado. The spots will air on video mediums and be seen on platforms like YouTube and Facebook. \n\n\n\nThe spots highlight efforts to restrict abortion. One fifteen-second clip ends with the caption “your state could be next.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Democrats will continue to remind voters that if Republicans gain power this November, they will go even further than overturning Roe and work to take away the freedom for millions more women to make their own health care decisions,” DNC Chairman Jaime Harrison said in a statement to The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ads are the latest Democratic effort to zero in on the issue of abortion access as midterm campaigns shift toward general election messaging. On Thursday, Texas gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke rolled out his first general election ads of the cycle, choosing to focus on abortion access. \n\n\n\nDemocrats have been more aggressively messaging on the issue since Kansas voters rejected a ballot measure earlier this month that would give the state legislature the authority to ban abortion. On Tuesday, Democrat Pat Ryan defied expectations in the special election for New York’s 19th Congressional District, winning the election after centering his message on abortion.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Climate change, deficit reduction and Medicare reform were the headline achievements of President Biden’s landmark&nbsp;Inflation Reduction Act&nbsp;which the president has&nbsp;called&nbsp;“one of the most significant laws in our history.”&nbsp;Many experts&nbsp;say it will play a significant role in addressing a number of important health and environmental matters facing the nation that have been neglected for far too long.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPassage of this law now brings renewed hope to Biden’s broader legislative agenda, especially in the field of public health. Part of that push involves an effort by the administration to tackle an issue that for years has disproportionately affected women, especially those of color: maternal mortality. Biden should be commended for focusing energy and federal resources to address it — but timing is everything, as they say, and Biden’s attempt to improve maternal health in America could not have come at a worse moment.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration recently released a&nbsp;70-page plan&nbsp;to improve access to health care and address the health disparities of women of color across the country.&nbsp; Among its many provisions, the plan seeks to expand the number of health care providers, improve coverage of high-quality care and provide greater social service support for women.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We imagine a future where every person in this country can have a safe, dignified pregnancy and birth,” the report states, “and where equitable access to health care before, during and after pregnancy is assured.”\n\n\n\nIf you thought maternal mortality has declined in recent years thanks to advancements in modern medicine, think again. A&nbsp;Century Foundation analysis&nbsp;of 2020&nbsp;data&nbsp;from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&nbsp;found that maternal mortality is climbing in the United States, outpacing our closest industrialized nation (France) by nearly threefold. Black women are three times as likely to die from maternal-related issues as white women, and Hispanic women experienced a 44 percent spike in maternal mortality from 2019-2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s a growing crisis that has demanded attention for decades. But because of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe vs Wade, the problem is all but certain to continue despite Biden’s ambition to fix it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat’s because the availability of women’s health care professionals, which is&nbsp;already declining&nbsp;across the country, is&nbsp;expected to drop&nbsp;significantly in states that have enacted laws to ban abortion in the wake of the court’s decision.&nbsp;Nearly half of the OBGYN workforce&nbsp;resides in states that are restricting abortion, and many&nbsp;young OBGYNs&nbsp;are considering leaving to practice in states where abortion rights remain. This will only amplify the current shortage of women’s health care providers and hinder access to family planning, prenatal and postpartum health services and care for women in half the states across America — the very people Biden’s maternal health initiative seeks to help.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is a sad irony to it all; just when we finally see leadership from the White House confront a climbing public health threat that has disproportionately impacted women of color for years, the fallout from a politicized Supreme Court decision will make it infinitely more difficult to accomplish. What’s more, any future court action that seeks to advance Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas’&nbsp;desire&nbsp;to overturn contraceptive access would make the current problem even worse.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf the White House is committed to reversing the widening maternal mortality rate, it must first lead a federal legislative effort to protect&nbsp;contraceptive access&nbsp;and&nbsp;abortion rights. The U.S. House has moved to codify both rights — now the U.S. Senate must act and do the same. Biden must also designate funding and develop an operational plan to execute his 70-page initiative. Unless these things happen, Biden’s goal of having a positive and lasting impact on improving the health of women across the country has little hope of succeeding.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDoing so will not only preserve a women’s right to choose. It will balance the availability of women’s healthcare professionals and services in states around the country. It will reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies — including those that present complications and end in fatality for the mother. It will pave the way for more equitable access to healthcare services for pregnant women of all races.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd it will help improve public health for women everywhere by giving Biden’s plan to save lives a chance to work.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLyndon Haviland, DrPH, MPH, is a distinguished scholar at the CUNY School of Public Health and Health Policy. &nbsp;",

        "description": "The race for the top Democratic seat on the powerful House Oversight and Reform Committee got more crowded on Friday when Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) entered the contest to replace the outgoing chairwoman, Rep. Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.).\n\n\n\nMaloney lost her primary race on Tuesday to Rep. Jerry Nadler (D-N.Y.), ending a 30-year career on Capitol Hill and opening up the top panel seat in the next Congress.\n\n\n\nRaskin's decision to seek the spot pits him against two other, more veteran Oversight Democrats — Reps. Stephen Lynch (Mass.) and Gerry Connolly (Va.), who launched their candidacies on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nDemocrats have traditionally favored seniority when choosing top committee spots, which would seem to place Raskin at a disadvantage in the race. \n\n\n\nStill, the three-term congressman has built a sturdy national profile in his short time on Capitol Hill, leading the House's second impeachment of former President Trump after last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol, and now playing a high-profile role in the investigation of the attacks. \n\n\n\nA former professor of constitutional law, Raskin is now making the case that his legal background makes him the best candidate to lead the Democrats on the Oversight panel.\n\n\n\n\"We are still in the fight of our lives to defend American constitutional democracy and—by extension—political freedom and human rights all over the world,\" Raskin wrote Friday to his fellow Democrats in a letter obtained by The Hill.",

        "description": "A grand jury indicted 14 Maryland police officers on Thursday after prosecutors alleged that they secretly double-dipped shifts, simultaneously working as both private security and at the police department.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrince George’s County State’s Attorney Aisha Braveboy announced the indictments against 13 current and one retired officer on charges of misconduct in office and felony and misdemeanor theft scheme.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe investigation originally stemmed from a separate but related case involving a former county police officer who pleaded guilty earlier this year, according to a release from the state’s attorney’s office. That case showed evidence that the 14 officers hid their secondary shifts from the police department between January 2019 and March 2021. \n\n\n\nSeven of the officers are charged with misconduct for submitting falsified information to a secondary employer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThirteen are charged with theft scheme of at least $1,500 to under $25,000, and one is charged with theft scheme of at least $100 to under $1,500.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe officers could face up to five years in prison if convicted of felony theft. Misconduct in office does not have a maximum sentence.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Police officers are sworn to protect and serve the public, and they take an oath to uphold the law. These indictments demonstrate our commitment to pursuing justice regardless of a suspect’s race, gender, religion, or occupation,” Braveboy said in the release.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post reported that a Prince George’s County program allows officers to earn extra income through working as private security, but they need to receive approval from the department and work while they are off duty.",

        "description": "Federal prosecutors will seek a 17 1/2 year sentence for a former Marine and New York Police Department officer convicted on six counts related to his participation in the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a sentencing memorandum on Thursday recommending the 210-month sentence for Thomas Webster for violently assaulting a Washington police officer, “spearheading” the breach of a police line outside the Capitol and “disgracing a democracy that he once fought honorably to protect and serve.”\n\n\n\nThe sentence would be nearly double the longest prison sentence handed down by a court in a Jan. 6 case so far, CBS News reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWebster’s sentencing is scheduled for next Friday.\n\n\n\nA jury in May found Webster guilty on five felonies and one misdemeanor, including assaulting, resisting or impeding an officer using a deadly or dangerous weapon, engaging in an act of physical violence on Capitol grounds and entering or remaining in a restricted building with a deadly or dangerous weapon.\n\n\n\nDOJ had released footage of Webster carrying a metal flagpole with a red U.S. Marine Corps flag, berating D.C. Metropolitan Police Department officer Noah Rathburn.\n\n\n\n“You f---ing piece of s---. You f---ing Commie motherf---ers, man … Come on, take your s--- off. Take your s--- off,” Webster yelled at the officer.\n\n\n\nWebster then swung the flagpole at the officer, which he wrested from Webster. Webster then broke through a metal barricade, tackling Rathburn to the ground and choking him by the chinstrap of his gas mask, making it difficult for the officer to breathe, prosecutors said.\n\n\n\nDOJ also asked the court to make Webster pay $2,060 in restitution, a mandatory $100 fine for each of the five felonies and a mandatory $10 fine for the misdemeanor.\n\n\n\nWebster’s attorneys, meanwhile, asked the court to honor his 127 days in custody that immediately followed his arrest and only further sentence him to supervised release.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“A comparison of Mr. Webster’s relevant conduct and life history to the conduct and history of the other defendants who have been sentenced in connection to the Capitol riot would not justify the disparity and sentences that either the guidelines or the government’s recommendation would create,” his attorneys wrote.\n\n\n\nWebster’s attorneys argued he was “swept up” in the crowd and admitted his role in the riot upon learning he was under investigation. Webster now believes he was “duped and used as a pawn” by elected officials.\n\n\n\n“Defendant is no longer under any illusion that the 2020 election was stolen or that he was fighting for a just cause,” they wrote. “Mr. Webster certainly acknowledges in retrospect that his actions seriously injured this country.”",

That alone could explain why Biden chose to move forward with the plan and why Republicans are opposing it so fiercely.

Unless, that is, their party works hard to get them upset in the first place.&#8221;\n&#8220;So a lesson from the student debt debate is that politicians are always looking for policy questions that will engage their supporters.&#8221;",

        "description": "To fight off invaders, plants can reprogram their cells, similar to the way factories retool their manufacturing in times of war, researchers report.\nCrops and other plants are often under attack from invaders like bacteria, viruses, and other pathogens. When a plant senses a microbial invasion, it makes radical changes in the chemical soup of proteins—the workhorse molecules of life—inside its cells.\nIn recent years, Xinnian Dong, professor of biology at Duke University, and her team have been piecing together just how they do it.\nIn a new study published in Cell, Dong and first author Jinlong Wang reveal the key components in plant cells that reprogram their protein-making machinery to fight disease.\nEach year, around 15% of crop yield is lost to bacterial and fungal diseases, costing the global economy some $220 billion. Plants rely on their immune system to help them fight back, Dong says.\nUnlike animals, plants don&#8217;t have specialized immune cells that can travel through the bloodstream to the site of infection; every cell in the plant has to be able to stand and fight to defend itself, quickly shifting into battle mode.\nWhen plants come under attack from invaders, they shift their priorities from growth to defense, so cells start synthesizing new proteins and suppress production of others. Then &#8220;within two to three hours things return to normal,&#8221; Dong says.\nThe tens of thousands of proteins made in cells do many jobs: catalyzing reactions, serving as chemical messengers, recognizing foreign substances, moving materials in and out. To build a specific protein, genetic instructions in the DNA packed inside the cell&#8217;s nucleus are transcribed into a messenger molecule called mRNA. This strand of mRNA then heads out into the cytoplasm, where a structure called a ribosome &#8220;reads&#8221; the message and translates it into a protein.\nIn a 2017 study, Dong and her team found that when a plant is infected, certain mRNA molecules are translated into proteins faster than others. What these mRNA molecules have in common, the researchers discovered, is a region at the front end of the RNA strand with recurring letters in its genetic code, where the nucleotide bases adenine and guanine repeat themselves over and over again.\nIn the new study, Dong, Wang, and colleagues show how this region works with other structures inside the cell to activate &#8220;wartime&#8221; protein production.\nWhen plants detect a pathogen attack, the molecular signposts that signal the usual starting point for ribosomes to land on and read the mRNA are removed, which keeps the cell from making its typical &#8220;peacetime&#8221; proteins.\nInstead, ribosomes bypass the usual starting point for translation, using the region of recurring As and Gs within the RNA molecule for docking and start reading from there instead.\n&#8220;They basically take a shortcut,&#8221; Dong says.\nFor plants, fighting infection is a balancing act, Dong says. Allocating more resources to defense means less is available for photosynthesis and other activities in the business of life. Producing too many defense proteins can create collateral damage: plants with an over-active immune system suffer stunted growth.\nBy understanding how plants strike this balance, Dong says, scientists hope to find new ways to engineer disease-resistant crops without compromising yield.\nDong&#8217;s team did the bulk of their experiments in a mustard-like plant called Arabidopsis thaliana. But similar mRNA sequences have been found in other organisms, including fruit flies, mice, and humans, so they may play a broader role in controlling protein synthesis in plants and animals alike, Dong says.\nThe National Science Foundation, the National Institutes of Health, and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute funded the work.\nSource: Duke University\nThe post Plants shift to &#8216;wartime production&#8217; to fight invaders appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "There may soon be a new weapon in our centuries-old battle against germs: the first durable coating that can quickly kill bacteria and viruses and keep on killing them for months at a time.\nAs reported in the journal Matter, the coating proved deadly to SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), E. coli, MRSA, and a variety of other pathogens. It killed 99.9% of microbes even after months of repeated cleaning, abrasion, and other punishment on real-world surfaces like keyboards, cell phone screens, and chicken-slathered cutting boards.\nThe coating could be a game changer in traditionally germ-laden public spaces like airports and hospitals, says co-corresponding author Anish Tuteja, a professor of material science and engineering at the University of Michigan.\n&#8220;We&#8217;ve never had a good way to keep constantly-touched surfaces like airport touch screens clean,&#8221; he says. &#8220;Disinfectant cleaners can kill germs in only a minute or two but they dissipate quickly and leave surfaces vulnerable to reinfection.\n&#8220;We do have long-lasting antibacterial surfaces based on metals like copper and zinc, but they take hours to kill bacteria. This coating offers the best of both worlds.&#8221;\nThe coating, which is clear and can be brushed or sprayed on, gets its durability and germ-killing power by combining tried-and-true ingredients in a new way. It uses antimicrobial molecules derived from tea tree oil and cinnamon oil, both used for centuries as safe and effective germ killers that work in under two minutes.\nThe coating&#8217;s durability comes from polyurethane, a tough, varnish-like sealer that&#8217;s commonly used on surfaces like floors and furniture.\n&#8220;The antimicrobials we tested are classified as &#8216;generally regarded as safe&#8217; by the FDA, and some have even been approved as food additives,&#8221; Tuteja says. &#8220;Polyurethane is a safe and very commonly used coating. But we did do toxicity testing just to be sure, and we found that our particular combination of ingredients is even safer than many of today&#8217;s antimicrobials.&#8221;\nThe results of the study&#8217;s durability tests suggest that the coating could keep killing germs for six months or longer before its oil begins to evaporate and reduce its disinfectant power. But even then, Tuteja says it can be recharged by wiping it with fresh oil; the new oil is reabsorbed by the surface, starting the cycle again.\nThe key challenge was to combine the oil and polyurethane in a way that let the oil molecules do their germ-killing work while preventing them from evaporating quickly.\nThe research team—including associate professor of materials science and engineering and biomedical engineering Geeta Mehta, a co-corresponding author; and materials science and engineering PhD students Abhishek Dhyani and Taylor Repetto, co-first authors—found a possible solution in cross-linking, a well-known process that uses heating to link materials together at the molecular level. The smaller oil molecules readily combined with the cross-linking polymer molecules, forming a stable matrix.\nBut to kill germs, the oil molecules need to penetrate their cell walls, which they can&#8217;t do if they&#8217;re tightly tethered into the matrix. Eventually, they found a middle ground by partially cross-linking the materials—enough to keep some of the oil molecules free to do their work, but keeping others bound tightly to the polyurethane.\n&#8220;There was some trial and error, but we eventually found that cross-linking only some of the oil did what we needed,&#8221; Tuteja says. &#8220;The free oil tends to stay with the oil that&#8217;s cross-linked into the matrix, helping the coating last longer.&#8221;\nOnce the basic recipe was set, the researchers set about finding a combination of active ingredients that would kill a wide variety of the germs that trouble humans most.\nTo identify a representative sample of microbes, they worked with co-corresponding authors Christiane E. Wobus, an associate professor of microbiology and immunology, and J. Scott VanEpps, an associate professor of emergency medicine, both at the University of Michigan Medical School. Ultimately, they found a precise balance of antimicrobial molecules that were effective, safe, and inexpensive.\nTuteja emphasizes that they&#8217;re not locked into one specific formula; the team&#8217;s understanding of individual ingredients&#8217; properties enables them to tweak the formula for specific applications or rebalance the antimicrobial agents to kill specific germs.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s never our goal just to develop a one-off coating, but instead to develop a library of underlying material properties to draw from,&#8221; Tuteja says. &#8220;If we can understand those properties, then we can develop coatings to meet the needs of specific applications.&#8221;\nTuteja estimates that the technology could be commercially available within a year; it has been licensed to Hygratek, a spinoff company that Tuteja founded with assistance from University of Michigan Innovation Partnerships.\nThe Office of Naval Research funded the work, with additional support from the University of Michigan, Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Defense, with raw materials provided by Covestro.\nThe University of Michigan has applied for a patent based on this technology. Tuteja and the University of Michigan have a financial interest in Hygratek.\nSource: University of Michigan\nThe post Coating keeps killing viruses and bacteria for months appeared first on Futurity.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/marlins-dfa-jesus-aguilar.html",
        "description": "The Marlins have designated first baseman Jesus Aguilar for assignment, general manager Kim Ng announced to reporters (Twitter link via Jordan McPherson of the Miami Herald). All-Star Garrett Cooper is back from the injured list in a corresponding move.\nNow that the trade deadline has passed, the only course of action for the Marlins will be to place Aguilar, 32, on waivers and hope that another club claims him. Given the $7.5MM guarantee on the struggling Aguilar&#8217;s 2022 contract, however, that appears quite unlikely. While Aguilar&#8217;s deal does carry a mutual option for the 2023 campaign, mutual options are rarely exercised, so teams will look at him as a pure rental.\nThere&#8217;s still about $1.6MM left to be paid out on the contract of Aguilar, plus a $200K buyout on that option. It&#8217;s hard to imagine a contending club dropping $1.8MM to claim a player who is hitting just .236/.286/.388 on the season as a whole &#8212; including a dismal .188/.246/.347 slash since the All-Star break. The overwhelming likelihood is that Aguilar will clear waivers and become a free agent &#8212; whether by being released or rejecting an outright assignment.\nAt that point, Aguilar would be free to sign a new contract with any team, and the new team would only owe him the prorated league minimum for any time spent on the MLB roster. The mutual option would no longer be a consideration, as he&#8217;ll have been released from the contract containing that clause. Aguilar would be postseason-eligible for a new club as long as he is signed (or, far less likely, claimed) prior to Sept. 1.\nWhile a team isn&#8217;t likely to take a chance on Aguilar at the cost of his remaining salary, it stands to reason that several clubs would hold interest in signing him at the prorated league minimum. Aguilar hasn&#8217;t been himself in 2022, but as recently as 2020-21 he gave Miami a combined 726 plate appearances of .265/.336/.458 production, smacking 30 home runs and 33 doubles with an 18.3% strikeout rate against a solid 9.5% walk rate.\nAguilar doesn&#8217;t carry a significant platoon split, so at his best, he&#8217;s an above-average, everyday slugger with 30-homer pop &#8230; he just hasn&#8217;t been close to his best in 2022. His 23.2% strikeout rate is the highest it&#8217;s been since 2018, and Aguilar has seen his average exit velocity (87.7 mph) and hard-hit rate (35.4%) dip to career-worst levels in 2022.\nAguilar has generally graded out as a solid defender at first base, but he&#8217;s seen his typically solid grades take a step back in 2022, clocking in at -4 Defensive Runs Saved, a -1.4 Ultimate Zone Rating and zero Outs Above Average. He&#8217;s limited to first or designated hitter for the most part, with the lone exception being a few emergency appearances across the diamond at the hot corner over the years (27 career innings, including five in 2022).\nAssuming Aguilar indeed clears waivers, teams in need of some offensive help at first base or designated hitter &#8212; or just a right-handed bat off the bench &#8212; could take a low-cost look in hopes of turning his season around. For the Marlins, they&#8217;ll use the remainder of the year to give a larger look to Lewin Diaz, who once ranked among the organization&#8217;s top prospects but has seen his stock tumble in recent seasons. The aforementioned Cooper also figures to see additional time in the lineup.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/rays-extend-tyler-glasnow.html",
        "description": "The Rays announced agreement Friday on a contract extension with Tyler Glasnow that will run through the 2024 season. The deal reportedly pays the Wasserman client $5.35MM in 2023, his final season of arbitration-eligibility, and jumps to a hefty $25MM in 2024. It also contains potential bonuses dependent upon Glasnow&#8217;s finishes in Cy Young balloting over the next two seasons.\nLast year, the now-29-year-old Glasnow looked well on his way to establishing himself as one of the sport&#8217;s most dominant arms. Long a top prospect in the Pirates organization, Glasnow was infamously traded to the Rays, alongside Austin Meadows and Shane Baz, in exchange for Chris Archer &#8212; one of the most lopsided deals in recent memory.\nHe&#8217;s spent parts of four seasons with Tampa Bay &#8212; 2018-21 &#8212; and posted a combined 3.10 ERA and 3.19 FIP with 34.3% strikeout rate against a 7.9% walk rate. That includes a relatively slow start, as the big righty managed a 4.20 ERA through 11 appearances down the stretch after the 2018 deadline deal. Since the calendar flipped to 2019, Glasnow has been an excellent performer. He posted a microscopic 1.78 ERA across 60 2/3 innings in 2019, striking out a third of opponents while inducing grounders on over half the batted balls against him. While his ERA jumped to 4.08 during the shortened 2020 campaign, Glasnow punched out an even more impressive 38.2% of batters faced that season.\n\nEverything seemed to be coming together last year, Glasnow&#8217;s age-27 campaign. He&#8217;d been on a potential Cy Young trajectory, starting 14 games and working to a 2.66 ERA over 88 frames through mid-June. He paired that with an elite 36.2% strikeout rate while generating swinging strikes on more than 17% of his offerings, but he blew out his elbow and was forced to undergo Tommy John surgery. That procedure ended his season and led to some speculation the payroll-conscious Rays could consider trading him last offseason, but there&#8217;s no indication they ever came close to doing so.\nGlasnow maintained over the winter that he hoped to stick with Tampa Bay. He reiterated that sentiment when chatting with Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times this afternoon, saying he&#8217;d much preferred to stay in the organization. The Rays held onto him throughout his rehab process, and the former fifth-rounder could make his return to the mound later this season. Glasnow told Topkin he&#8217;s headed to Triple-A Durham to throw some live batting practice sessions and could soon embark on a minor league rehab assignment.\nIt&#8217;s a bold move for the Rays, whom Topkin notes have never previously paid a player a $25MM annual salary (although franchise shortstop Wander Franco will reach that mark in 2028 under the terms of the 11-year extension he signed last November). Next year&#8217;s $5.35MM figure represents only a marginal bump over this year&#8217;s $5.1MM mark, reflecting the fact that he hasn&#8217;t pitched all season and wouldn&#8217;t have been in line for a notable arbitration raise. It&#8217;s the 2024 commitment to buy out Glasnow&#8217;s first free agent year that comes as a surprise.\nIt&#8217;s easy to see both the high risk and reward of the move from Tampa Bay&#8217;s perspective. If Glasnow picks up right where he&#8217;d left off pre-surgery, he&#8217;ll immediately form a fearsome pairing with AL All-Star starter Shane McClanahan at the top of the rotation. It&#8217;s not uncommon for ace-caliber hurlers to surpass $30MM annually over a multi-year free agent investment, one the Rays seem unlikely to make. Even factoring in the potential bonuses, a $25MM base salary in 2024 would be more than reasonable if Glasnow pitches as he did in 2019-21, and the team isn&#8217;t on the hook for any longer-term commitment. It&#8217;s a match for the guarantee the Astros gave Justin Verlander last winter coming off two seasons largely lost to a Tommy John surgery of his own. Verlander has returned to the top of the rotation and pitched exceptionally, and the Astros have been handsomely rewarded for their investment.\nAt the same time, there&#8217;s no sugarcoating the downside for Tampa Bay if Glasnow suffers an injury setback or performance regression. The Rays have never opened a season with a player payroll higher than this year&#8217;s estimated $83.9MM tab, per Cot&#8217;s Baseball Contracts. Presumably, owner Stuart Sternberg is willing to push that number upwards over the coming two seasons, but it remains to be seen whether they&#8217;ll eclipse nine figures by that point. Glasnow&#8217;s deal could wind up counting for around one-quarter of the team&#8217;s player expenditures, and the club also has fairly notable salaries for Manuel Margot ($10MM) and Brandon Lowe ($8.75MM) for that season. Players like McClanahan, Randy Arozarena and Drew Rasmussen will have reached arbitration-eligibility by then as well.\nIt&#8217;s a bold strike from an organization that doesn&#8217;t customarily make this kind of financial investment. If all goes well, the Rays will get an extra season of ace-level performance for a price below the free agent market value. Glasnow, meanwhile, locks in a fair amount of financial security as he wraps up his Tommy John rehab. He tacks on another year with a club for which he&#8217;s clearly comfortable playing, and he could still land a multi-year deal once he hits the open market in advance of his age-31 season. There&#8217;s risk for the Rays in committing a sizable portion of their expected 2024 payroll to a player who hasn&#8217;t thrown an MLB pitch in 14 months, but they&#8217;re clearly confident Glasnow will be no worse for wear than he was before he went under the knife.\nMarc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times first reported the Rays and Glasnow were in agreement on an extension that ran through 2024. Jeff Passan of ESPN was first to report the salary terms. Ken Rosenthal of the Athletic noted the presence of &#8220;significant&#8221; bonuses based on Cy Young finishes.\nImage courtesy of USA Today Sports.",

The curious little feline responded immediately, flying across the room to look for the &#8220;other cat&#8221; in his territory. \n\n\n\nWe were babysitting our friend&#8217;s kitten and thought it would be funny to see if the translator app (human to cat) worked on him and it seemingly did on camera.",

        "description": "While we were all initially on the fence about which Pixel 6 smartphone we preferred, I think we all now agree that the Pixel 6 Pro is the superior device across the board. With a better display, markedly better haptics, and the additional telephoto camera lens, the larger of the two Tensor-powered phones is simply the better Pixel phone if you don&#8217;t mind paying $899.\n\n\n\nEarlier this week, I shared a stellar deal that can score you the budget-friendly Pixel 6a for as little as $199. That discount is still available and I highly recommend taking advantage of it if you&#8217;re looking for the Pixel experience and a budget. For those looking to get their hands on the true Google flagship experience, the aforementioned Pixel 6 Pro is the way to go, and right now, you don&#8217;t have to pay premium money to get the premium Google phone. Before you get into the details of the deal, here&#8217;s a quick refresher from Robby on why he changed his mind about the Pixel 6 Pro.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, it appears that many retailers are cleaning house and depleting Pixel 6 supplies to make room for the upcoming Pixel 7 that should release in early October. As a matter of fact, T-Mobile no longer carries the Pixel 6 Pro and is offering deep discounts on the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6a for new and existing subscribers. Best Buy still has an inventory of the entire Pixel 6 family and right now, you can grab an unlocked Pixel 6 Pro and save as much as $350. Your discount will depend on how you purchase your new Pixel 6 Pro. If you want to just buy it outright, you&#8217;ll get a hefty $250 discount which brings the 128GB model down to a very affordable $649\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you want to go ahead and activate your new Pixel on your carrier, you can save even more. Existing customers on AT&amp;T or T-Mobile can get the Pixel 6 Pro for $549 if you add a new line or you&#8217;re opening a new account. Verizon customers will get the unlocked Pixel 6 Pro for $599 when adding a line or $649 if they&#8217;re upgrading an existing line. T-Mobile and AT&amp;T customers that are looking to upgrade an existing line can just skip the carrier step and buy the phone unlocked for $649. Any way you slice it, this is an exceptional price for what some would say is one of the best smartphones you can buy. Check out all the buying options over at Best Buy before they&#8217;re gone. I&#8217;d bet that these deals will continue until the inventory is depleted and then, it&#8217;ll be too late. \n\n\n\n\nPixel 6 Pro at Best Buy",

        "description": "Senate Republicans' primary super PAC is canceling nearly $10 million in Arizona and Alaska ad reservations, raising questions about the party’s commitment to Blake Masters, its Senate nominee in the Copper State. The Senate Leadership Fund, which is aligned with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, is scrapping roughly $8 million in ads — about half of its initial Arizona reservation — that were supposed to start in the early fall. The group's ads are now set to begin in early October. In November Masters will face Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), who already enjoys a heavy financial advantage down the stretch. The super PAC's move will exacerbate that Kelly edge as Republicans seek to net the one seat needed to take back Senate control. Republicans currently see Georgia and Nevada as potentially more fertile territory to flip than Arizona, and they also have to protect seats in Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Ohio and beyond. The McConnell-backed super PAC's strategic change is in part a reaction to its massive $28 million commitment in Ohio, where GOP nominee J.D. Vance is facing a strong challenge from Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio). The organization said it will reallocate the money elsewhere and is not planning to totally pull of out Arizona at the moment, as Kelly leads&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/senate/2022/arizona/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-dd62-d9e7-ab9e-ff73b8920001&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-dd62-d9e7-ab9e-ff73b8920002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">leads Masters in essentially every recent public poll. “We’re leaving the door wide open in Arizona, but we want to move additional resources to other offensive opportunities that have become increasingly competitive, as well as an unexpected expense in Ohio,” said Senate Leadership Fund President Steven Law. “We think the fundamentals of this election strongly favor Republicans, we see multiple paths to winning the majority, and we are going to invest heavily and strategically to achieve that goal.” Still, there are signs that the GOP is keeping Arizona on the table. OneNation, a GOP nonprofit affiliated with the super PAC, included the state in a new round of ad buys, according to CNN. Both Masters and Vance were supported in their Republican primaries by GOP donor Peter Thiel and former President Donald Trump. It’s not clear whether Thiel will help either candidate in the general election.  Absent further GOP investment, the super PAC's move will likely leave Kelly and his allies with a huge money advantage this fall. Kelly and Democratic groups have more than $40 million reserved for the fall, while Republicans had about $18 million before the super PAC shifted money away from the state, according to AdImpact. While the change in Arizona might raise questions about Republicans’ view of Masters’s chances, Law said the decision to cut two weeks — or about $1.7 million in advertising — to boost Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is a vote of confidence in her. Murkowski advanced to the top-four general election with about 45 percent of the vote compared with 39 percent for Trump-backed Kelly Tshibaka; the general election will be decided by ranked-choice voting. “We are all-in for Senator Murkowski. Senator Murkowski is in a very strong position and based on that decided to push back our start date,” Law said. Ads supporting Murkowski’s bid will now begin Sept. 20. The National Republican Senatorial Committee separately canceled millions in ads earlier this month, planning to reprogram them to get more efficient buys alongside GOP candidates but sparking some skepticism about the group’s strategy. A spokesperson for the McConnell-backed super PAC said its moves in Arizona and Alaska shouldn’t be taken as a sign of financial trouble and that “we’re currently several million ahead of where we were for the month of August at this point in 2020.” Natalie Allison contributed to this report.",

The real issue is who will be indicted first —&nbsp;Donald Trump or Hunter Biden?\n\n\n\nThe drumroll of charges against Hunter Biden in the conservative media had been largely dismissed as political claptrap. Nobody on the left cared about Hunter’s laptop any more than they cared about Hillary’s emails. The target was his father, the president.\n\n\n\nThe laptop story has grown a beard. The laptop was found in a Delaware computer repair shop in 2019 and brought to light three weeks before the 2020 election. Its contents had been out of Hunter’s custody for some time. but Rudy Giuliani claimed he had a printed version of the contents covering a period from 2009 to 2019, when Joe Biden was vice president, including 129,000 emails related to Hunter Biden of which some 22,000 were proved to have been authentic.\n\n\n\nGiuliani gave them to the New York Post, and said he offered three hard drives to the FBI, but the agency refused to accept them. Turns out that portable hard drive had something added to it both before and after the New York Post’s original story, and the FBI had previously obtained the laptop from the computer repair shop pursuant to subpoena. \n\n\n\nThe inquiry into Hunter Biden’s business dealings, in which he acted as a consultant to companies in China and Ukraine, appeared to be dying on the vine. But lately, the broad federal investigation of Hunter headed up by David Weiss, the holdover United States attorney in Delaware, has picked up steam. Weiss is no Trumpist zealot. He served as a prosecutor in Delaware in the 1980s, returned to the small office in 2007 and remained there for 11 years until Trump appointed him U.S. attorney. When he came up for confirmation, Delaware Democratic Sens. Coons and Carper strongly supported him.\n\n\n\nThere are 93 U.S. attorneys in the country who, although appointed for a term, serve at the pleasure of the president. When a new president takes office, all customarily resign or are dismissed. Biden wisely left two in office: John Durham, investigating the origins of Russiagate, and Weiss, investigating the president’s son.\n\n\n\nMany citizens have accepted the corrupt Hunter Biden narrative hook, line and sinker. Others scoff at the charges as politically motivated. But here’s the deal, as the man said: What is the case against Hunter Biden that Weiss may be considering?\n\n\n\nThere is a weak accusation against Hunter that he was in possession of a firearm while “addicted to a controlled substance.” It will be hard to make out this offense, and that is why in the real world it is seldom charged. When and how long did Hunter have the gun? Was he addicted at the time? How addicted was he? These are all questions giving rise to the kind of reasonable doubt that would make prosecutors pause.\n\n\n\nThere is also the Foreign Agents Registration Act (FARA), which makes it a federal crime to engage in lobbying or political activity for a foreign government or national without registering with the Justice Department as a foreign agent.\n\n\n\nHunter never registered. And there is an aroma about the circumstance that, without any obvious skill sets or qualifications, he accepted extravagant fees for sitting on the board of Burisma, a Ukrainian company. But was this political activity or lobbying?\n\n\n\nNormally, FARA violations merit only a slap on the wrist. But recently, Justice has charged Trump ally Tom Barrack and Trump loyalists Rick Gates and Paul Manafort with FARA violations. Why is Hunter Biden different from these other politically connected people?\n\n\n\nThen, there is the oldie but goodie, tax fraud, the one that brought down Al Capone. No one knows for sure how Hunter handled his taxes, although he recently paid some of his outstanding tax liability. And no one knows whether Weiss is considering tax charges against him. Time will tell all.\n\n\n\nAnd there is the suggestion of money laundering, arising out of the recent sales of Hunter’s artwork to anonymous purchasers, the details of which being at this moment unknown.\n\n\n\nThen there are the charges that our attorney general might bring against former President Trump, arising out of the Jan. 6 insurrection or the classified documents seized at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nHarvard Law Professor Laurence Tribe thinks that Trump’s latest lawsuit, seeking a special master on the Mar-a-Lago search and seizure, was “very strange.” Says Tribe, “he’s sort of asking Merrick Garland to prosecute him.”\n\n\n\nThere are at least five theories about why Trump has not yet been indicted, although the evidence that he sparked the Jan. 6 melee is overwhelming, not the least of which being the testimony of Cassidy Hutchinson before the House Committee that Trump knew that the mob was armed before he sent them up to Capitol Hill.\n\n\n\nThe first, and the most disturbing, is that Garland for whatever reason may plan to let Trump beat the rap. It’s the banana republic argument. A former judge with a fierce veneration of precedent, Garland may take stock from Nixon’s pardon and believe that indicting Trump would deviate from a bad case for the nation and presidential accountability standing for the unfortunate proposition that former presidents ought not be criminally charged for their excesses while in office. \n\n\n\nThe Constitution declares that, once out of office, a rogue president shall be “liable and subject to Indictment, Trial, Judgment and Punishment according to law.” As Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) made clear, this outcome should apply to Trump. “President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office,\" he said on the Senate floor. \"Didn't get away with anything yet.\" Surely McConnell is right. The rule of law is the lynchpin of our democracy; it must be more than a slogan.\n\n\n\nOr Garland may harbor some apprehension that Trump’s supporters might engage in civil unrest were their leader to be indicted. About this, Professor Tribe says: “I’m not underestimating the civil unrest that could follow a decision to indict Trump, but when the evidence of his seditious conspiracy and other federal crimes is as overwhelming as it appears it will be, a decision not to indict him would be far worse.”\n\n\n\nThe publicly available evidence against Trump seems to get stronger each day. According to the New York Times, several witnesses are now saying Trump went through the boxes personally. If so, the defense of mistake or “Can I help it if I hire such stupid people?” would not be available.\n\n\n\nThe second possibility is that Garland is still investigating the attack, seeking to turn participants who might cooperate and await the report of the House Select Committee, which has already made clear that it believes Trump is guilty. \n\n\n\nAnd, as the New York Times reports, prosecutors are finally scrutinizing the ringleaders of the attack and have “substantially widened” the inquiry beyond those who breached the Capitol. Obviously, although many believe there is an avalanche of evidence against Trump, Garland would want to develop an open-and-shut case.\n\n\n\nA third possibility would be to charge Trump civilly. New York Attorney General Letitia James is contemplating a possible civil case against Trump, alleging fraud. Trump recently invoked his Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination nearly 450 times in a deposition in that case, and Garland may decide to let the New York case be the last word.\n\n\n\nIn the civil case, James need merely prove her charges by the lesser burden of the “preponderance of the evidence,” so why not roll the dice on a table where the odds are better? But Trump has successfully defended congeries of civil actions over the years with great success. He knows how the game is played, and he has always managed to win it.\n\n\n\nThen, there is the possibility of a deal. Over 90 percent of federal indictments end in a bargained guilty plea. Garland might seek a deal whereby Trump is not charged criminally on the condition that he not seek public office again. It is highly unlikely that Trump would accept such an agreement, but if the choice is jail or repose in Mar-a-Lago, Trump may well fold.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFinally, it is possible that Garland has decided to temporize —&nbsp;that is, to do nothing for the time being. This approach smacks of fecklessness. The closer we get to 2023, the more Trump can argue that any decision to prosecute is politically motivated. Delay will hardly keep Trump from running again.\n\n\n\nSo how will it all end? I would bet that both cases end in some sort of settlement. For example, Hunter Biden will agree not to contest the FARA charges in exchange for a slap on the wrist. Trump will settle with James on the fraud charges, announce he will not run for office and accept some level of responsibility for the riot, after which he will claim he was “beautifully” exonerated.\n\n\n\nIt’s got to end somewhere. A major ingredient of the rule of law is finality. Perhaps Garland’s Justice Department will announce both indictments on the same day. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nJames D.

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlasmalogens are lipids that are found in cell membranes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe amount of plasmalogens found in the body may diminish with age.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers are examining whether plasmalogens taken as a supplement could have positive health and anti-aging effects.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists have long been interested in studying aging: how it happens, why it happens, and can we stop or slow it down. While the master key to youth remains elusive, researchers might be getting closer to unlocking smaller clues. Plasmalogens, a type of lipid, can be found in several food sources, like pork, beef, chicken, fish and other seafood. Some recent studies suggest that plasmalogens are important factors in aging, and that eating more plasmalogens could potentially prevent or reverse some signs of aging.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOur cell membranes are made up of a lipid bilayer, meaning that there are two layers of lipids with the hydrophobic parts of the compounds facing inwards towards the center between the layers. There are many types of compounds that can anchor themselves to the lipid bilayer, with certain parts facing in towards the inside of the cell and other parts facing out to the outside of the cell. One category of these lipids includes plasmalogens.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome research suggests that the presence of certain types of brain lipids are associated with greater longevity and other types are associated with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease. Research has also linked plasmalogens to certain types of cancer, like gastrointestinal cancer.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow these plasmalogens are connected to the aging process is not fully understood, but some experts think it could be related to free radicals, or uncharged molecules, that can bind to lipid molecules. This reaction can lead to damage to the cells and in the long run affect the functioning and life of the cell. This process is also called oxidative stress and is the reason why health professionals may recommend increased consumption of antioxidants. The theory goes that the antioxidants can bind to the free radicals before they can cause damage to your cells.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRecent research published in Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences suggests that taking plasmalogens as a supplement could help reverse some of the signs of aging. The researchers extracted plasmalogens from sea squirts, an ocean organism that is commonly eaten in Asian cuisines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn an experiment in middle-aged female mice, researchers found that after two months of taking plasmalogens orally the mice performed better at memory tests and had less inflammation in their brains. The aged mice that were on the plasmalogen treatment also had more synaptic vesicles, which play a role in synapse connections between neurons, than the control aged mice who didn’t receive plasmalogens.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn another study published in Disease Models &amp; Mechanisms, a different team administered synthetic plasmalogens to mice. The scientists gave the mice a specific plasmalogen for four weeks that normalized the levels of plasmalogen in the liver, small intestine, skeletal muscle and the heart. The results suggest that the oral treatment did change the levels of plasmalogens and could be investigated further as a possible therapeutic treatment for a rare genetic disorder that blocks the body from producing plasmalogen naturally.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, there’s still a long way to go before we can potentially reap the benefits of plasmalogens. “These molecules, plasmalogens, have been swept under the rug because nobody likes to think about them,” says Richard Gross, who is a professor at Washington University, in a press release. “[They’re] hard to work with. They're susceptible to light, they're stable in only certain solvents, they have a limited lifespan after they're synthesized unless extreme precautions are taken, and they're expensive to make and synthesize.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Bureau found 16.3 million Americans have long Covid today. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnywhere between 2 to 4 million are out of work because of the condition. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf no policy interventions are taken to address long Covid, the economy could suffer greatly. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUp to 4 million Americans may be out of work due to long Covid and it carries steep economic repercussions for not just the U.S. economy but the productivity of working people.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau found 16.3 million working-age Americans have long Covid today and of those 2 to 4 million are out of work because of the condition.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLong Covid is defined as having symptoms of COVID-19 for at least 12 weeks after being infected with the virus and it comes in multiple forms — including respiratory symptoms and neurological problems like brain fog, poor memory and headaches.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe annual cost of wages lost to long Covid is around $170 billion a year and could potentially run as high as $230 billion. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers at the Brookings Institution analyzed Census Bureau data, along with other studies that looked at rates of people with long Covid, and found the loss of jobs is consistent with the current labor market shortages, like in education, transportation, food service, hospitality and health and social care industries.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTaking a closer look at wages, Brookings found that the average U.S. worker earns $1,106 per week, and if up to 4 million Americans are out of work due to long Covid, that translates to $230 billion a year in lost earnings — nearly 1 percent of the total U.S. gross domestic product. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Critically, this number does not represent the full economic burden of long Covid, because it does not include impacts such as the lower productivity of people working while ill, the significant health care costs patients incur or the lost productivity of caretakers,” said the report.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHarvard University economist David Cutler estimated that medical care and lost quality of life related to long Covid can cost an additional $544 billion each year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe economic burden long Covid poses to the U.S. is steep and something Brookings researchers say will depend on three factors: availability and accessibility of improved treatment options, whether vaccines can reduce the odds of getting long Covid and whether repeat infections carry additional long Covid risk. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nCurrently, there is no standardized treatment for long Covid and recent studies suggest available COVID-19 vaccines only reduce the risk of it by 15 percent. It's not yet known what the risk is of getting long Covid after repeat infections.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, one study by researchers from the University of California, San Francisco found participants who took Pfizer’s Paxlovid COVID-19 treatment several weeks after testing positive for the virus had lessened long Covid symptoms. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If the long Covid population increases by just 10 percent each year, in 10 years, the annual cost of lost wages will be half a trillion dollars,” said the Brookings report.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere is one thing that could ease the burden and help those Americans who continue to suffer from long Covid: policy interventions. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThough Congress hasn’t enacted any laws pertaining to long Covid, President Biden directed Health and Human Services to develop the first-ever interagency national research action plan on long Covid. The effort aims to progress prevention, diagnosis and treatment for people experiencing long Covid and associated conditions. &nbsp;",

        "description": "The “Great Minnesota Get-Together” is upon us. And, of course, the best part about it is the data.Yearly attendance record: 2.1 million in 2019Fair attendance has climbed over time, and not just because the length of the fair has extended— from six days 1885-1918 to double that starting in 1975. According to records given to us by the State Fair, attendance first topped 1 million in 1955, and then topped 2 million in 2018.Last year attendance was down by one-third from the previous fair, 1.3 million attended compared to the record 2.1 million in 2019. The fair was cancelled in 2020 due to COVID-19.Just in: yesterday&#x27;s opening day saw 121,478 people pass through the gates. That is nearly double the 61,983 on opening day last year.This year attendance to the just-completed Iowa and Wisconsin state fairs were up by 22 percent and 19 percent, respectively, to 1.1 million and 1.0 million over the course of the 11 day fairs. If Minnesota follows their lead, the fair will see around 1.6 million visitors this year.Daily attendance record: 270,426 on Saturday, Sept. 1, 2018The second Saturday of the fair is the highest attended day of the fair, averaging 239,000 attendees in recent years. On the second Saturday of 2018 the crowd was a record 270,000, perhaps in part driven by the appeal of that night’s Grandstand headliner, Hairball: A Bombastic Celebration of Arena Rock.If you are looking for a smaller dose of humanity with your state fair experience, the opening day is your best bet, averaging 112,000 in recent years, but really any weekday is far less attended than the two Saturdays and Sundays of the fair.Based on the data, here are the lower traffic days to visit the State FairHottest year at the Fair, 2018. Most Rainy, 2021.If you were one of the 62,00 people who attended day one of last year’s Minnesota State Fair, congratulations! You were there for the most rainy day of the fair, at least for the pat 12 years. Over 1.6 inches fell that day, contributing to the nearly four inches total over the course of the fair— also a recent record.In terms of heat, the 12-year high was on the first Monday of the 2013 State Fair, when the temperature reached 97 degrees Fahrenheit. On Average the temperature tops out at 80 degrees over the course of the fair, with a daily low of 63. It has gotten as cold as 48 degrees during the course of the fair, so you might want to bring a jacket.So far it does not look like we’ll rival any of those records this year.Best-selling food at the fair? You guessed it…Sweet Martha’s tops this list by far, outselling the two cheese curd vendors on the Fair’s top ten list combined. And perhaps driving Midwest Dairy Association into the number five position. Minnesota’s State Fair is all about milk and cookies.Most common Grandstand Act: AlabamaOn the list maintained by the Minnesota State Fair, which tracks acts who have appeared since 1962, country-rockers Alabama tops all others with no less than 19 appearances.Garrison Keillor is second with 13 appearances, 11 branded as “Prairie Home Companion” followed by two “Minnesota Show” acts. Country legend Willie Nelson is third, tied with the 11 shows of amateur talent contest finalists gathered from around the state.Ten most frequently appearing acts, Minnesota State Fair GrandstandAlabama (19)Garrison Keillor (13)Amateur talent contest finals (11)Willie Nelson (11)The Beach Boys (10)The Oak Ridge Boys (10)Alan Jackson (8)Ray Komischke Orchestra (8)Bonnie Raitt (8)The Turtles (8)Note: 1962-2021Source: Minnesota State Fair.Two (other) groups of boys —The Beach Boys and The Oak Ridge Boys — are tied for fourth place with 10 appearances each. The only female headliner in the top 10 is bluesy rocker Bonnie Raitt, who has graced the Grandstand eight times, tied with four other acts.The Beach Boys will notch their 11th appearance on Monday night’s double bill with the Temptations.In terms of Minnesota icons, Prince never played the state fair (although he was honored posthumously with a “Prince night” in 2016), but Bob Dylan has appeared twice on the Grandstand.The only record I could find of Judy Garland appearing at the state fair is in this depiction of the Yellow Brick Road from the fair’s 2019 Floralpalooza:Judy Garland Minnesota State Fair flowersJay Gabler",

        "description": "The FDA recommends to take at least two COVID-19 antigen tests 48 hours apart before ruling out a possible infection.Justin Paget/Getty ImagesWe regularly answer frequently asked questions about life during the coronavirus crisis. If you have a question you&#x27;d like us to consider for a future post, email us at goatsandsoda@npr.org with the subject line: &quot;Weekly Coronavirus Questions.&quot; See an archive of our FAQs here.Ah, the start of a new school year. Maybe you&#x27;re one of millions of Americans who have started mingling with peers in the dorms and suddenly find yourself sniffling and wondering if you have COVID-19. Or you&#x27;re just getting back from your summer vacation and the back of your throat has a worrisome itch.You consider taking an at-home rapid test, but you have lots of questions. With new FDA recommendations on testing, how many times should you test for a definitive result? And, how infectious are you if the positive line is faint? And what if the test turns positive — but only after an hour? We posed your questions to the experts: Dr. Abraar Karan, infectious disease researcher at Stanford; Meriem Bekliz, virologist at the University of Geneva; and Dr. Preeti Malani, professor of medicine at the University of Michigan. Here&#x27;s the scoop:So I caught COVID-19 and after 10 days I&#x27;m still testing positive. But the line on my rapid test is really faint now compared to a week ago. What&#x27;s the deal? Exactly how contagious am I? &quot;The faintness or darkness of the line probably has some correlation to degree of infectiousness especially early on [during the infection],&quot; says Karan.So if the line is faint, that could mean your risk of accidentally passing the virus on to others is low. &quot;Some people may not be infectious because the tests could be picking up viral debris from a waning infection,&quot; says Bekliz.But don&#x27;t rip off your mask just yet: There could be other reasons for a faint line. There is &quot;some room for error&quot; with those rapid tests, Karan says. You&#x27;re sticking a cotton swab up your nose and hoping to snare some virus. A faint line could mean you&#x27;ve collected less virus this time around. Maybe you swabbed for less time or in only one nostril when your test instructions say to swab both. &quot;In general, a darker line is a result of more virus [on the swab],&quot; says Malani. &quot;But antigen tests are not especially sensitive, so even with a negative test, you can be contagious.&quot;So the bottom line, say our experts: If you&#x27;re testing positive – even with a faint line — you should behave as if you are contagious. If there&#x27;s any hint of a positive line, Bekliz recommends you continue to wear a mask, work from home if possible and generally limit contact with other people.Last week I tested positive for COVID-19 and went through the recommended 5 days of isolation and additional 5 days of masking. How many times do I need to test negative before it&#x27;s OK to assume I&#x27;m virus-free?Figuring out when it&#x27;s OK to ease up on your safety measures after catching COVID-19 can be tricky. If you suspect that you may have COVID but haven&#x27;t tested positive yet, the FDA now recommends serial testing, which means you should repeat your home test after 48 hours to make sure you aren&#x27;t accidentally getting a false negative test. And what should you do if you already tested positive and want to know when you&#x27;re finally negative? &quot;The recommendations for serial testing are for people that have been exposed and are trying to diagnose themselves,&quot; says Karan. &quot;They&#x27;re saying to repeat the test after a day or two, but not if your first test is already positive and you&#x27;re testing to become negative.&quot;Once you have tested positive and your body starts clearing the virus, a negative rapid test should be a pretty good indication you&#x27;re no longer infectious, so long as you follow the test protocols correctly and wait an appropriate amount of time before testing. &quot;If it&#x27;s been like five days [since the onset of symptoms], and the test is negative, then I would feel good about that,&quot; says Karan. &quot;If the test is negative one or two days after symptoms start, then I would maybe think you didn&#x27;t get a good sample and should test again.&quot;While that&#x27;s reassuring, there wasn&#x27;t agreement among our experts about exactly what to do. While Karan says one negative test after an appropriate amount of time is good enough, Malani says you should take two just to be sure.&quot;Usually you want a couple negative tests,&quot; says Malani. &quot;If you have two negative antigen tests, that&#x27;s really helpful.&quot; So that first negative test is likely a good sign, but taking an additional test 24 hours later is a great way to confirm the result and rule out errors in testing.I was feeling a bit off and took a COVID-19 test. After 15 minutes it looked like the test was negative. But when I came back to check the test an hour later a positive line had appeared! Then I retested three times and they all came back negative. Does this mean I could have COVID-19?This is a pretty unusual circumstance, our experts say, but one that could potentially indicate bad news. &quot;The tests aren&#x27;t really meant to be read an hour later,&quot; says Malani. &quot;But it would be a little bit concerning for someone who has symptoms and has their test turn positive later.&quot;Each test kit has its own recommended timeframe for reading the test. BinaxNOW and iHealth kits say you should read the test after 15 minutes, but not after 30 minutes. INDICAID test kits say you should read the test after 20 minutes, but not after 25 minutes. Reading the test after the recommended time frame could lead to a false positive.However, Karan agrees that &quot;it would be less likely to be a false positive if someone&#x27;s having symptoms and we&#x27;re at a time when there&#x27;s a high amount of virus being spread.&quot;Following the FDA recommendation to test at least twice and waiting 48 hours between tests can help determine your true COVID-19 status as well.&quot;My advice would be to probably stay put and not expose anyone, and then perhaps repeat the test,&quot; Malani says. &quot;Now, if you&#x27;re feeling great the next day and your test is negative, maybe it was nothing.&quot; Or simply &quot;assume you&#x27;re positive if you have symptoms,&quot; Karan says. &quot;Try to get a PCR test and retest again [at home] in the next few days. If the PCR test is negative, you&#x27;re probably OK.&quot;No matter the circumstances, if you&#x27;re worried that you could have COVID-19, our experts think your best bet is to repeat your at-home test over a couple of days. So if you want to ace COVID Testing 101 this school year, just remember that two negative tests are better than one. Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "The Diamondbacks have designated right-hander Chris Devenski for assignment, per a team announcement. His spot on the active roster will go to righty Reyes Moronta, whom the D-backs claimed off waivers earlier this week.\nDevenski, 31, was once one of the American League&#8217;s best relievers, dominating with the Astros in 2016-17 and earning the nickname &#8220;The Dragon&#8221; as he ripped through opposing lineups with lofty strikeout totals and tidy walk rates. Injuries have taken their toll in the seasons since, however, and he&#8217;s managed just 21 2/3 Major League frames dating back to the 2020 season.\nThat includes 10 2/3 innings with the Snakes in 2022, during which time he&#8217;s been tagged for nine runs on 14 hits and a walk with nine punchouts. After seeing his average fastball velocity dip to a career-worst 91.5 mph in 2021, Devenski did restore some zip on that heater in 2022, averaging 93.9 mph. That&#8217;s roughly in line with the velocity from his peak, but the right-hander&#8217;s swinging-strike and opponents&#8217; chase rates are nowhere near his heyday, and he&#8217;s allowed hard contact in droves during this year&#8217;s small sample. Opponents have posted a 91.8 mph average exit velocity against him, and 51.4% of the balls put into play against Devenski have been hit at 95 mph or harder.\nThe Diamondbacks will have a week to place Devenski on outright waivers or release him, now that this year&#8217;s trade deadline has passed.",

        "description": "The Twins announced Friday that they&#8217;ve reinstated outfielder Kyle Garlick from the 10-day injured list and designated infielder Tim Beckham for assignment in order to open a spot on the roster.\nBeckham, 32, inked a minor league deal with the Twins over the winter and recently had his contract selected as Minnesota deals with a deluge of injuries both in the outfield and around the infield. He appeared in a dozen games with the Twins but took just 25 plate appearances and went 2-for-25 with nine strikeouts in that time.\nBeckham has had a monster season in Triple-A, hitting .413/.481/.579 in 133 plate appearances, but it was never particularly realistic to expect the journeyman to sustain anything close to that level of output in the big leagues, where he&#8217;s a .247/.299/.426 hitter in 1776 plate appearances. He&#8217;ll be placed on waivers or released within the coming days now that he&#8217;s been designated for assignment.\nGarlick, 30, will give the Twins a much-needed healthy outfielder and some desperately needed help against left-handed pitching. He&#8217;s hitting .257/.319/.514 in 116 plate appearances this year and has carved out a role with the Twins based on his ability to clobber southpaws. In 172 career plate appearances against lefties, the right-handed-hitting Garlick is a .266/.314/.576 hitter.",

(credit: Getty | Francis Dean)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA multistate outbreak of E. coli O157 infections linked to romaine lettuce on Wendy's burgers has more than doubled since last week, according to an update from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\nThe case count now stands at 84 and spans four states: Indiana (6), Michigan (53), Ohio (23), and Pennsylvania (2). That's up from last week's case tally of 37 from the same four states. Currently, at least 38 of the people sickened have been hospitalized. Eight of those people, all in Michigan, have developed a serious and potentially life-threatening type of kidney failure called hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), the CDC reports. No deaths have been reported. So far, the people sickened range in age from 5 to 94 years, with a median age of 24.\nBecause of reporting lags, the CDC warns that \"the true number of sick people in this outbreak is likely higher than the number reported, and the outbreak may not be limited to the states with known illnesses.\"Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 contains Congress’s largest investment to date to deal with climate change. It passed without a single Republican vote. Before this, Congress’s most significant effort was in 2009 with enactment of ARRA (The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act) during the first month of President Obama’s first term. No House Republican voted for the ARRA, and only three Republican senators did.\n\n\n\nIt wasn’t always this way.\n\n\n\nWhen climate change first appeared on the national agenda the commitment to deal with it was bipartisan. At the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, President George H. W. Bush stated the U.S. position: “Let me be clear on one fundamental point. The United States fully intends to be the world’s preeminent leader in protecting the global environment. We have been that for many years. We will remain so.”\n\n\n\nBefore 2010, some Republican members of Congress provided leadership to deal with climate change. In 2003, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), with Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.), took the lead in introducing the first major bill on the issue in the Senate. In 2007, three Republicans (Ted Stevens of Alaska, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania), joined me and three other Democrats in introducing the Low Carbon Economy Act. It proposed to set up a cap-and-trade system, but without all the complexity included in the House-passed bill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut opposition to dealing with climate change became a litmus test for Republicans seeking their party’s nomination in the 2010 midterm election campaigns. In June 2009, the Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill passed in the Democratic-controlled House. To defeat the legislation, the Koch brothers, through Americans for Prosperity, worked with others from the fossil fuel industry to galvanize members of the tea party to oppose the bill. They succeeded. The bill died in the Senate in the face of a threatened Republican-led filibuster.\n\n\n\nSince 2010, congressional Republicans have prevented enactment of significant legislation on the issue. President Trump’s strong opposition reinforced Republican opposition in Congress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the 12 years since the Republican Party made climate change a political issue, the scientific evidence of climate change has become overwhelming. The real world evidence is also too obvious to ignore: record high temperatures, long-term drought in the southwest, increased frequency of forest and grassland fires, and historic flooding in coastal areas and even in Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell’s (R-Ky.) home state.\n\n\n\nYet Republicans still feel no responsibility to address the issue.\n\n\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) deserve great credit for developing the Inflation Reduction Act, and securing its passage. Now, in 2022, Democrats have finally managed to make progress, but they have had to do so without the help of a single Republican in either house of Congress.\n\n\n\nMuch more needs to be done. In Congress Democrats should not be the only ones committed to protecting the global environment. Until Republicans also are willing to support constructive policies to address climate change, our efforts to reduce emissions to stabilize the climate will continue to fall short.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJeff Bingaman served as a United States Senator from New Mexico from 1983 to 2013, for 5 terms, and is a former chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. His book,&nbsp;“BREAKDOWN, Lessons for a Congress in Crisis,” will be published in October by High Road Books.",

Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams’ office worked with defense attorneys from the Innocence Project New Orleans, a nonprofit focused on freeing the wrongfully convicted or those serving unjust sentences, to have the conviction vacated.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAttorneys argued that the only eyewitness to the attack, the victim, could have misidentified Walter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“There were some red flags that the eyewitness testimony could well have been unreliable,” Emily Maw, an attorney at the DA’s office told the AP.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFilings from the DA’s office and the Innocence Project list several errors in Walter’s case, like years' worth of mistakes made by Walter’s previous attorneys and no match between Walter’s blood and semen taken from the victim, the outlet added.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJudge Darryl Derbigny, who vacated the case, called the failure to present the blood and semen evidence that could have proved Walter’s innocence, as “unconscionable” to say the least.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "description": "Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) clocked in with the highest favorability rating among a list of 23 potential 2024 presidential contenders, according to a new USA Today-Ipsos poll.\n\n\n\nForty-six percent of respondents said they had at least a somewhat favorable view toward Sanders, while 41 percent said they had an unfavorable opinion.\n\n\n\nPresident Biden had the second-highest favorability rating at 43 percent, although his unfavorability rating was notably higher than Sanders's, with 52 percent of those surveyed saying they had an unfavorable opinion of the president. Former President Trump clocked in with the same ratings as Biden.\n\n\n\nThe three political figures were followed in the poll by other well-known potential candidates, while possible contenders with a smaller national profile were seen as unfamiliar by most voters. \n\n\n\nVice President Harris and former Vice President Mike Pence both received favorable ratings from at least 40 percent of respondents, earning the third- and fourth-highest figures among the candidates, respectively.\n\n\n\nAmong Democrats, Biden received the highest favorability rating, with 82 percent of Democratic voters indicating a positive view of the sitting president. Just 11 percent of Republicans indicated a favorable view of Biden.\n\n\n\nBiden and his aides insist he plans to run for a second term in 2024 if his health allows, although some Democrats have dodged questions about supporting Biden’s reelection bid amid his low approval numbers. \n\n\n\nWhen asked, many of those Democrats say they are focused on this year’s midterm elections. But some figures dodging questions include those who could potentially mount their own White House bid in 2024.\n\n\n\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) declined in June to say if she would be endorsing Biden in 2024 during an interview on CNN’s “State of the Union.”\n\n\n\n“We’ll cross that bridge when we get to it,” she said. “But I think if the president has a vision, and that’s something certainly we’re all willing to entertain and examine when the time comes.”\n\n\n\nOcasio-Cortez’s favorability rating in the poll was in the middle of the pack, ranking No. 11 among those of the 23 polled candidates.\n\n\n\nThirty-three percent of voters surveyed said they had a favorable view of Ocasio-Cortez, while 38 percent indicated an unfavorable view.\n\n\n\nThe poll found the progressive lawmaker had the lowest favorability rating among Republicans, with 10 percent of GOP respondents giving her a favorable rating, 1 percentage point lower than Biden and Harris.\n\n\n\nTrump received the highest favorability rating among Republicans — 81 percent — according to the poll. The former president was followed by Pence and Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), who were viewed favorably by 69 percent and 68 percent of Republican voters, respectively.\n\n\n\nA group of moderate Republican governors included in the poll, like Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan and New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, saw lower favorability ratings.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the vast majority of respondents also indicated they were unfamiliar with the two governors, while higher-profile figures like Trump and Pence were known by most voters polled.The poll was conducted Aug. 18-22 through online interviews with 2,345 U.S. adults. The margin of error is 2.5 percentage points.",

This figure is down from the 6.8 percent annual inflation rate that was reported in June.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the Fed’s goal is to get inflation down to 2 percent, and Powell said the drop from last month is “far short” of what the Fed needs to see before it can be confident that inflation is dropping.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Fed has already raised interest rates from a range of 0 to 0.25 percent in March to 2.25 to 2.5 percent in July. This included two consecutive increases of 0.75 percentage points, the largest monthly increases in almost 30 years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHigher interest rates can restrain economic growth by making borrowing money more expensive and slowing consumer spending.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPowell said the Fed’s decision on how much to raise interest rates next month will be based on the data it receives.",

        "description": "The White House on Friday offered a cost estimate for President Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan, saying it would cost $24 billion annually over 10 years, or $240 billion.   \n\n\n\nDeputy Director of the White House National Economic Council Bharat Ramamurti told reporters at a White House briefing that the estimate assumed that 75 percent of those eligible for the student loan relief would take advantage of it.  \n\n\n\nThe White House estimate is significantly lower than other outside estimates, and comes after administration officials for days declined to offer a precise figure amid criticisms from Republicans and some Democrats about the potential for the relief plans to exacerbate inflation. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn analysis released by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business estimated that the cost of Biden’s changes to student loans could balloon to $1 trillion over the next decade. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Budget estimated earlier this week that the plan will cost between $440 billion and $600 billion over the next 10 years.  \n\n\n\nRamamurti said Friday that the Education Department and Office of Management and Budget will release an official budgetary score “in the coming weeks.” He also said that the White House still considers the plan “fully paid for” by the reduction in the federal deficit that has occurred under Biden’s watch. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden announced on Wednesday that he would forgive up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers who make under $125,000 annually and $20,000 for those who received Pell Grants. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublicans have attacked the debt relief plan, arguing it will ultimately add to the federal deficit and increase inflation. Some Obama-era economists like Jason Furman have also taken issue with the president's plan.\n\n\n\nRamamurti said Friday that cost of the student loan relief plan would shave 1.5 percent off of the administration’s projected deficit reduction of $1.7 trillion this current year. &nbsp;",

        "description": "Vicky Ward: &#8220;I have known Jared Kushner (not well) for quite some time. The man I first met in New York in the early 2000s was a cherubic-looking, vulnerable young man in his early 20s, openly hurting about the fact his father, whom he loved and revered, was in jail for a horrible, lurid crime involving a sex tape and blackmail of a family member. One couldn’t help but feel for this grieving son. Then when Kushner and Ivanka Trump temporarily split up, largely due to religious differences, he was also miserable, torn between religion and his soulmate. Again, one couldn’t help but feel for him.&#8221;\n&#8220;Fast forward to 2016 and Kushner’s stint on Trump’s campaign as his son-in-law. When I sat down with him for the first time in many years while reporting a piece on him and his brother for Esquire, I saw a person entirely changed. The vulnerability was gone. This was a person who was not just condescending to journalists, but clueless about their motivation&#8230;. He had become someone who harbored grudges and delusions&#8230;. He had become someone who had an extraordinarily exaggerated sense of self-worth&#8230; He was someone who thought all problems could be massaged by PR. After all, he owned a newspaper.&#8221;\n&#8220;And he was a bully. Or at least he tried to be.&#8221;",

        "description": "The Republican National Committee has fired Paris Dennard as its national spokesman, according to two people familiar with the move. Dennard had been serving as a national spokesman and director of Black media affairs for the committee. He started working for the RNC in March 2020. “Paris Dennard no longer works for the RNC. We don’t comment on personnel matters,” RNC chief of staff Mike Reed said in a statement. One person familiar with the firing said it took place earlier this week. Dennard did not respond to a request for comment. Dennard, a veteran of the George W. Bush White House, was a high-profile on-air surrogate for former President Donald Trump. Dennard served on Trump’s commission on White House Fellowships, and during the 2020 campaign he was on the advisory board of Black Voices for Trump, an initiative aimed at helping the former president expand his share of the Black vote. In 2018, the Washington Post reported that, four years earlier, Dennard had been fired from his post at Arizona State University over accusations of sexual misconduct. Following the report, CNN suspended Dennard from his role as a contributor at the network, saying at the time it was “look[ing] into the allegations.” Dennard — who told the Post that the allegations were “false” — and CNN parted ways in late 2018.",

        "description": "HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Medical examiners confirmed Friday that convicted Ponzi schemer and Jeffrey Epstein mentor Steven Hoffenberg was the person found dead in a Connecticut apartment earlier this week.\n\n\n\nHoffenberg, 77, is believed to have died at least seven days before his body was found Tuesday in Derby by police, who responded to a request to check on his welfare, authorities said. He had to be identified through dental records because of the decomposition of his body, police said.\n\n\n\nHis cause of death is pending toxicology test results. An autopsy showed no signs of trauma, and there were no indications of a struggle or forced entry at the apartment, officials said.\n\n\n\nEpstein, the disgraced financier who killed himself in a New York jail in 2019 while awaiting trial on allegations he sexually abused dozens of girls, worked for Hoffenberg's bill collection company, Towers Financial Corp., in the late 1980s, when prosecutors said the Ponzi scheme began.\n\n\n\nHoffenberg, who once tried buying the New York Post, ended up getting busted in one of the country's largest frauds. He admitted he swindled thousands of investors out of $460 million and was sentenced in 1997 to 20 years in prison. He claimed Epstein was actually the architect of the scheme, but Epstein was never charged.\n\n\n\nHe was released from federal custody in 2013, according to the U.S. Bureau of Prisons. It was not immediately clear how he ended up living in a small apartment in a multifamily home in Derby, about 12 miles (19 kilometers) northeast of Bridgeport.\n\n\n\nGary Baise, one of Hoffenberg's friends and lawyers and a former acting deputy U.S. attorney general, said Hoffenberg and Epstein had a “special relationship” and Hoffenberg said Epstein was the smartest person he knew when it came to money.\n\n\n\nBaise said Hoffenberg also was very intelligent, which may have contributed to his downfall.\n\n\n\n“He was too smart for his own good,” Baise said in a phone interview Friday. “He thought he could get away with his Ponzi scheme but he could not. He did not have self-control. He always thought he was smarter than the next guy and that was one of his problems. ... But he was a good man.”\n\n\n\nBaise, who said he had not had contact with Hoffenberg for several months, said he wasn't surprised by his death because Hoffenberg did not appear to be taking good care of himself.\n\n\n\nPolice in Derby were asked to do a welfare check on Hoffenberg on Tuesday by a private investigator for a woman who identified herself as close to Hoffenberg and a sexual abuse victim of Epstein's, Derby police Lt. Justin Stanko said. The investigator said the woman had not heard from Hoffenberg for five days, and that was unusual, Stanko said.\n\n\n\nHoffenberg briefly took over the New York Post in 1993 while bidding to own it. The Post reported that Hoffenberg funded the paper for three months and rescued it from bankruptcy. His efforts to buy the paper were derailed by civil fraud allegations by the Securities and Exchange Commission that led to the criminal prosecution of the Ponzi case.",

        "description": "This summer, there have been record temperatures almost everywhere in the world. London experienced the highest temperature ever recorded in the city, and Southern Europe is so hot it is literally burning. Many U.S. cities are witnessing extended periods of triple-digit temperatures. These events have clearly been exacerbated by climate change and should serve as a wake-up call to those who doubt climate change as a true challenge.\n\n\n\nAmidst all this, the discourse between Republicans and Democrats on advancing even modest climate policy, like tax incentives to accelerate the adoption of renewable technologies, has become an ever-widening chasm. Ahead of the 2022 midterms, Republican leadership is seizing a unique opportunity to frame the Democratic Party as a group of extremists using climate as a way to tax oil and gas out of existence and raise not only energy prices, but inflation as well. With the passage of the recent Inflation Reduction Act, some prominent Republicans even compared the climate portions to the extreme Green New Deal.\n\n\n\nTo be fair, Republicans have made important points around energy security amid the war in Ukraine. European dependence on Russian gas is a reality check that the world is not ready yet to eliminate hydrocarbons as some progressives would have us believe. Oil and gas — and yes, even nuclear energy —&nbsp;will be critical parts of our energy portfolio for years to come. Even Europe, which does not suffer from the political discourse we have in the U.S. around climate policy and has been highly supportive of renewable alternatives, cannot manage alone on green technologies for years to come. However, that doesn’t mean that we shouldn’t invest in a clean energy future.\n\n\n\nEurope and the UK are making admirable efforts to rapidly advance wind, solar and vehicle electrification to cut CO2 emissions by over 50 percent over the next decade. Importantly, in most European countries, the conservative parties are on board with the transition to clean energy and have a sense of urgency to get there as quickly as possible.\n\n\n\nHere in the U.S., on the other hand, we still struggle to achieve bipartisan climate wins. Yet, the potential costs of climate change to our quality of life and that of our children and to society more broadly are too great to continue to treat climate as a political game. Republican leadership must strike a balance of achieving energy security in the short term while aggressively supporting and advancing smart climate policy.\n\n\n\nAs a Republican and an environmentalist, I continue to be disappointed and frustrated with my party’s sarcastic tone on climate, and I am not alone. Young voters, aged 18 to 35, are becoming one of the largest voting blocs in the country, and the Republican Party risks permanently alienating them if climate continues to stay on the backburner. As these young voters start to become more active politically, Republican leadership needs to figure out the calculus here pretty quickly or find the math will not add up well for future elections.\n\n\n\nNeither Republicans nor Democrats want to live in a world where the environment has become inhospitable as a result of extreme temperatures and frequent fires, droughts and hurricanes. Ironically, those who live in red states in the South and West have the most to lose from the effects of climate change. It’s time for Republicans in those states and across the country to stop being obstructionists and lead on climate — before it’s too late to put out the fire.\n\n\n\nGary Rappeport is on the board of both the Environmental Defense Fund Action and the American Conservation Coalition.",

        "description": "President Biden on Friday dismissed the claim from former President Trump that he broadly declassified the boxes of White House documents he took to Florida after leaving office.\n\n\n\nBiden was dismissive about Trump’s claim that he had declassified the documents that were being kept at his Mar-a-Lago estate hours after the Justice Department released an affidavit that offered some new information about the materials recovered there.\n\n\n\n“'I've declassified everything in the world. I'm president,'” Biden said sarcastically, waving his hands in the air. “Come on.”\n\n\n\nBiden, speaking with reporters outside the White House, otherwise declined to comment on the details of the investigation into Trump.\n\n\n\n\"Let the Justice Department take care of that,\" he said.\n\n\n\nTrump’s handling of classified materials has been under intense scrutiny since the FBI searched his home earlier this month. Officials have said the search was related to sensitive government materials being kept at Trump’s estate.\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice earlier Friday released a heavily redacted affidavit that was used to justify the search.\n\n\n\nWhile the document contains little information about the search itself, it does reveal that an initial collection of boxes from Mar-a-Lago in January yielded 15 boxes containing 184 documents that were classified, secret or top secret.\n\n\n\nTrump has defended his handling of sensitive materials in the weeks since the search in part by claiming the materials he took with him were all declassified.\n\n\n\nBut several former Trump administration officials have publicly said they were not familiar with such an order to declassify, and legal experts have said Trump could not have declassified the materials simply by saying he wanted to do so.\n\n\n\nA White House spokesperson was asked about the affidavit after its release but declined to comment on the ongoing investigation.\n\n\n\nBiden has also largely refrained from weighing in on the FBI search of his predecessor’s home.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAsked Wednesday about the FBI’s actions, Biden said he had no advanced notice of the search before it happened earlier this month.",

        "description": "Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Mark Warner (D-Va.) on Friday said the redacted FBI affidavit used to justify a search warrant on former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence suggests that some of the country’s “most sensitive intelligence” was mishandled.\n\n\n\nThe heavily redacted affidavit — which was made public on Friday after a judge ordered it to be unsealed the day before — revealed that 184 classified documents were found at Trump’s Florida residence in the first review of boxes recovered by the National Archives.\n\n\n\n“It appears, based on the affidavit unsealed this morning, that among the classified documents at Mar-a-Lago were some of our most sensitive intelligence – which is one reason the Senate Intelligence Committee has requested, on a bipartisan basis, a damage assessment of any national security threat posed by the mishandling of this information,” Warner wrote in a statement on Friday, shortly after the affidavit was unsealed.\n\n\n\n“The Department of Justice investigation must be allowed to proceed without interference,” he added.\n\n\n\nOf the 184 documents recovered by the National Archives in January, 92 were marked as “SECRET” and 25 were marked “TOP SECRET.” Some of the top secret documents included information from “clandestine human sources,” which is information that cannot be shared with foreign governments, and from monitoring “foreign communications signals.”\n\n\n\nThe National Archives recovered a total of 15 boxes from Mar-a-Lago in January. The affidavit said authorities believed “evidence, contraband, fruits of crime or other items illegally possessed\" still remained at Mar-a-Lago after the first tranche of documents were recovered in January.\n\n\n\nThe FBI ultimately executed a search warrant on the Florida residence earlier this month. An inventory list released after the search revealed that 11 sets of classified documents were recovered by the FBI, as well as information about “the president of France” and a pardon received by Trump ally Roger Stone.\n\n\n\nWarner and Sen. Marco Rubio (Fla.), the top Republican on the Senate Intelligence Committee, penned a letter to Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines and Attorney General Merrick Garland earlier this month asking for details about the classified documents that were recovered in the search, in addition to an assessment of national security risks that were potentially triggered by the mishandling of documents, a Senate aide confirmed to The Hill on Friday.\n\n\n\n\"The Senate Intelligence Committee is charged with overseeing counterintelligence matters, including the handling and mishandling of classified information, which appears to be at the core of the search of Mar a Lago,\" the aide said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe letter was first reported by Axios.",

        "description": "The Phillies have reinstated reigning National League MVP Bryce Harper from the 60-day injured list, tweets Matt Gelb of The Athletic. Infielder/outfielder Yairo Munoz was optioned to Triple-A Lehigh Valley to open a spot on the active roster, while fellow outfielder Simon Muzziotti was recalled from Triple-A and placed directly on the 60-day injured list in order to clear a spot on the 40-man roster. Philadelphia also recalled southpaw Bailey Falter from Lehigh Valley to start tonight&#8217;s game.\nHarper is hitting cleanup in today&#8217;s Phillies lineup and serving as their designated hitter &#8212; a role he figures to occupy down the stretch as he continues to nurse a ligament tear in his throwing elbow. That, of course, is not the injury that&#8217;s held Harper out for the past two months. Harper was playing through the elbow issue and serving as a highly productive DH before suffering a fractured thumb upon being hit by a pitch. He required surgery to address the issue and has been out of action since June.\nThe Phils weathered that absence extremely well, and they find themselves in strong playoff position as a result. Philadelphia heads into tonight&#8217;s game with a 70-55 record that places them firmly in possession of the National League&#8217;s second Wild Card spot. They&#8217;ll now welcome back Harper, owner of a massive .318/.385/.599 showing through 275 plate appearances, to the lineup for the season&#8217;s final five weeks. The aforementioned elbow ligament tear will keep Harper at DH, at least for the time being, but Philadelphia is no doubt thrilled to get his bat back in the lineup.\nAs for Muziotti, his 2022 season is over due to a torn patellar tendon in his right knee. The 23-year-old, one of the better outfield prospects in the organization, made his MLB debut this April and appeared in nine games. He spent the majority of the year with Double-A Reading, hitting .259/.339/.455 through 38 games. He&#8217;ll be paid at the prorated $700K MLB minimum rate for the rest of this season and collect around five weeks of big league service time while looking ahead to 2023.",

        "description": "Last month we began to see some of the work Google is doing to improve battery and performance on Chrome and ChromeOS. This came in the form of an experimental flag, which enables a feature called &#8220;Quick intensive throttling after loading.&#8221; The feature would reportedly activate intensive throttling after 10 seconds instead of the default 5 minutes when a page is backgrounded to not being used in a while. Limiting these wake-ups is said to extend battery life by about 10% when all tabs are hidden and silent.\n\n\n\nWe now see Google doing more work in that space with the introduction of a new &#8220;Performance&#8221; page, which will have toggles to turn on &#8220;High-Efficiency Mode&#8221; and &#8220;Battery Saver Mode.&#8221; This discovery was made by u/Leopeva64-2, who noticed a new flag in Chrome Canary and code in the Chromium Gerrit with more information about these two new modes.\n\n\n\nHigh-Efficiency Mode flag in Chrome CanarySource: u/Leopeva64-2\n\n\n&#8220;High-Efficiency mode,&#8221; which will be aptly named &#8220;Snooze tabs,&#8221; will discard tabs after they have been in the background for the time specified. The time specified in the flag options is 5 seconds, 30 seconds, 2 minutes, and 1 hour. However, enabling that flag now in Canary doesn&#8217;t make the toggle available yet in Settings, so we can&#8217;t tell if this option will appear as part of it. Also, it will be possible to add URLs to an exception list so that this rule doesn&#8217;t affect them and discard their tabs.\n\n\n\nAs far as &#8220;Battery Saver mode,&#8221; the feature is said to &#8220;make it so that frame rate is throttled to lower power consumption,&#8221; which sounds similar to the &#8220;Quick intensive throttling after loading,&#8221; while not exactly the same. Battery saver will have four options, which are:\n\n\n\n&#x2022; BatterySaverModeDisabled (0): &#8216;Battery Saver Mode will be disabled.&#x2022; BatterySaverModeEnabledBelowThreshold (1):&nbsp;Battery Saver Mode will be enabled when the device is on battery power and battery level is low.&#x2022; BatterySaverModeEnabledOnBattery (2):&nbsp;Battery Saver Mode will be enabled when the device is on battery power.&#x2022; BatterySaverModeEnabled (3):&nbsp;Battery Saver Mode will always be enabled.Source: u/Leopeva64-2\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, since a UI for these toggles is not yet available and the Chrome team needs a way to test them, the toggles have been added to the chrome://discards page. There you can urgently discard a tab or turn on/off either of the aforementioned modes, the latter appearing in Chrome Stable but not working yet.\n\n\n\nWe will have to wait and see how these new toggles affect day-to-day Chrome usage. Chrome has long suffered from performance issues due to its impact on a system&#8217;s RAM and CPU resources, and users have had to deal with it. Thankfully with these new options, users can test if they actually improve the experience and help Google determine if they should be mainstays in Chrome settings.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Flanked by several DFL legislators at the Minnesota Capitol Friday, DFL Gov. Tim Walz said his Republican opponent Scott Jensen&#x27;s comments likening COVID-19 restrictions to the rise of Nazi Germany fit a pattern of &quot;hateful and dangerous&quot; rhetoric.Earlier this week Jensen did not back down from comments that were caught on video in April when he compared COVID-19 mask mandates to an erosion of individual rights in 1930s Germany that led to the Nazi Party taking power. “So when I make a comparison that says that I saw government policies intruding on American freedoms incrementally, one piece at a time, and compare that to what happened in the 1930s, I think it&#x27;s a legitimate comparison,” Jensen said in a video he posted to Facebook Tuesday. “It may not strike your fancy — that&#x27;s fine. But this is how I think, and you don&#x27;t get to be my thought police person.”Walz said Jensen should take up Jewish community leaders&#x27; offers to help him understand why his comparisons are so offensive.&quot;They were not attempting to be ‘thought police.’ They were attempting to be experts and advise,” Walz said. “And if you&#x27;re asking to be the governor of Minnesota, every single day, you are going to have experts advise you, and many times they may not align with your preconceived notions.&quot;At a news conference with Walz, state Rep. Frank Hornstein, DFL-Minneapolis, said he was a child of holocaust survivors, and that his grandparents were murdered by the Nazis.&quot;When my family&#x27;s experience and those of 6 million mostly Jewish people are trivialized and minimized this desecrates their memory and desecrates proper memorialization of this, one of the most heinous events in human history,” Hornstein said, adding. “That&#x27;s why we stand together to condemn this in the strongest possible terms. The last thing we need in Minnesota, in the country right now, is this level of extremism and polarization, which these comments fuel.&quot;While campaigning Friday at the Minnesota State Fair, Jensen was asked about a possible apology. &quot;Is Governor Walz going to apologize for what he did to our kids&#x27; education? Is he going to apologize for the fact that people have been getting shot in their neighborhoods? Is he going to apologize to the fact that he drove the gallon of gas upwards? When is he going to apologize?” Jensen responded. “I’ve got an idea for him. If he wants to apologize to me, or if he wants me to apologize to him, why don&#x27;t we have a damn debate?&quot;Walz debated Jensen earlier this month at Farmfest and has said he will debate Jensen again. He declined an invitation from MPR News to debate Jensen at the State Fair.",

        "description": "Vicky Ward: &#8220;I have known Jared Kushner (not well) for quite some time. The man I first met in New York in the early 2000s was a cherubic-looking, vulnerable young man in his early 20s, openly hurting about the fact his father, whom he loved and revered, was in jail for a horrible, lurid crime involving a sex tape and blackmail of a family member. One couldn’t help but feel for this grieving son. Then when Kushner and Ivanka Trump temporarily split up, largely due to religious differences, he was also miserable, torn between religion and his soulmate. Again, one couldn’t help but feel for him.&#8221;\n&#8220;Fast forward to 2016 and Kushner’s stint on Trump’s campaign as his son-in-law. When I sat down with him for the first time in many years while reporting a piece on him and his brother for Esquire, I saw a person entirely changed. The vulnerability was gone. This was a person who was not just condescending to journalists, but clueless about their motivation&#8230;. He had become someone who harbored grudges and delusions&#8230;. He had become someone who had an extraordinarily exaggerated sense of self-worth&#8230; He was someone who thought all problems could be massaged by PR. After all, he owned a newspaper.&#8221;\n&#8220;And he was a bully. Or at least he tried to be.&#8221;",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe fallout from this month's breach of security provider Twilio keeps coming. Three new companies—authentication service Authy, password manager LastPass, and food delivery service DoorDash—said in recent days that the Twilio compromise led to them being hacked.\nThe three companies join authentication service Okta and secure messenger provider Signal in the dubious club of Twilio customers known to be breached in follow-on attacks that leveraged the data obtained by the intruders. In all, security firm Group-IB said on Thursday, at least 136 companies were similarly hacked, so it's likely many more victims will be announced in the coming days and weeks.\nUncommonly resourceful\nThe compromises of Authy and LastPass are the most concerning of the new revelations. Authy says it stores two-factor authentication tokens for 75 million users. Given the passwords the threat actor has already obtained in previous breaches, these tokens may have been the only things preventing the takeover of more accounts. Authy, which Twilio owns, said that the threat actor used its access to log in to only 93 individual accounts and enroll new devices that could receive one-time passwords. Depending on who those accounts belong to, that could be very bad. Authy said it has since removed unauthorized devices from those accounts.Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge / Old wind turbine blades are usually sent to landfills, which rather undercuts the concept of sustainable energy production. (credit: Imagevixen/Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWind power is a rapidly growing industry, with a 53 percent increase in new installations in 2020 alone, according to the Global Wind Energy Council. The massive fiberglass blades can be as long as half of a football field and keep getting larger— the bigger the blade, the more electricity is produced. That poses a problem when the blades outlive the mechanical parts of the turbines. They're usually sent to landfills, which undercuts the whole concept of sustainable energy production.\nFortunately, John Dorgan, a chemical engineer at Michigan State University, has come up with a new polymer resin that can not only be recycled into a new generation of turbine blades but also materials for a wide range of commercial applications. These include the manufacture of car taillights, diapers, kitchen sinks—even edible gummy bears. He described his research at a meeting of the American Chemical Society in Chicago this week.\nDorgan terms his approach \"molecular flexibility,\" inspired in part by an article he once read by Isaac Asimov, describing a future where people would be able to resynthesize raw protons, neutrons, and electrons into anything they wanted. \"It's almost like the replicator from Star Trek, where they can just sort of make atoms into anything that they want—ice cream floats, or new clothing, or what have you,\" said Dorgan during a press conference at the ACS meeting. \"Of course, we're a long way from the replicator idea, but we did draw some inspiration from those sorts of things.\"Read 7 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Duke Learning Innovation co-hosted the 2022 Pandemic Pedagogy Research Symposium on May 11, alongside institutional partners: the Center for Academic Innovation at the University of Michigan, Penn’s Online Learning Initiative, Princeton&#8217;s McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning, Stanford Digital Education, University of Georgia&#8217;s Center for Teaching and Learning and the Friday Institute for Educational Innovation at NC State University. The symposium, which was free to all participants, featured research presentations, lighting talks and panel discussions. Participant research focused on transformations that emerged from the chaos of the pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs part of a deep dive session Moving from Innovation to Meaningful Institutional Transformation, presenters from four of our partner institutions — Princeton University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Georgia (UGA) and the University of Michigan — shared their experiences with how teaching and learning has changed.\n\n\n\nIn the University of Michigan’s presentation, Deb Meizlish, Senior Assistant Director for the\n\n\n\nCenter for Research on Learning and Teaching, provided a framework not just for her presentation but the whole of the session.\n\n\n\n“What are you holding on to? And what are you letting go of? … We found [these questions] to be fruitful ways to open conversations about the teaching and learning lessons from this pandemic moment,” Meizlish said.\n\n\n\nWhile Princeton, Penn, UGA and Michigan have institutional differences that shape their innovation strategies, throughout the four presentations and the lively discussion that followed, common threads of transformation emerged.\n\n\n\nEngaging the University Community\n\n\n\nAcross the board, the presenters of this session discussed how their centers for teaching and learning and campus partners worked to engage their communities in their initiatives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGiven the turbulence of the pandemic era, Meizlish noted that there has been a focus on asking where do we go from here?&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’re asking questions about what we need to prepare people for and what evidence we need to select different approaches … we’ve been intentional about listening to the community,” said Caitlin Hayward, Associate Director, Research &amp; Development at Michigan’s Center for Academic Innovation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShirley Wang, Senior Associate Director for the McGraw Center for Teaching and Learning at Princeton, focused her presentation on how Princeton is working on initiatives on faculty teaching. For instance, Princeton will be piloting a Hybrid Course Design Institute this summer that will include asynchronous and synchronous online engagement, aimed at faculty redesigning their courses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’ve done a lot of reflection … over the last year and the last couple of years,” Wang said. “Some of the challenges we see in terms of having faculty engage with teaching or teaching-related initiatives seems to be about sort of bandwidth and also just engagement.”\n\n\n\nRuth Poproski, Assistant Director of Faculty Teaching and Learning Initiatives for the Center for Teaching and Learning at UGA, spoke about an AirTable tool called S.A.L.T. (Selecting Your Active Learning Techniques). This tool, Poproski noted, emerged from working with faculty and students. Poproski expects the crowdsourced-tool’s repository will expand, noting other institutions are already using it. Poproski also shared that a major Quality Enhancement plan for UGA’s undergraduate education is centered on active learning.\n\n\n\nBuilding Meaningful Learning Experiences\n\n\n\nBruce Lenthall, Executive Director of Penn’s Center for Teaching and Learning emphasized in his presentation the importance of community to student learning. Throughout institutional surveys that explored how online courses were going, as well as focus groups, it became clear that building instructor-student and peer relationships made learning “meaningful.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Learning from and with one another, building community, isn’t just a bonus, it’s not just an add-on, it is at the core of the experience,” Lenthall said.\n\n\n\nDuring the discussion portion of the session, audience members asked about how to avoid giving students cognitive overload by introducing too much technology.\n\n\n\nWang offered the possibility that instructors consider, “potentially deemphasizing the technology itself and being really thoughtful about the pedagogy, so it’s the technology [that] enhances the pedagogy,” but technology doesn’t drive the classroom.\n\n\n\nDefining Flexibility \n\n\n\nIn both presentations and the question and answer session, the term “flexibility” ignited discussion both about how courses adapted to support students and how the term, when used without institutional guidance, could provoke uncertainty.\n\n\n\nLenthall said during his presentation, “Flexibility wasn’t enough, we also needed a high degree of structure for our students … Structure and flexibility are not in fact oppositional as they’re so often cast, but they [reinforce] one another, and if we value compassionate teaching it requires both.”\n\n\n\nWhen noting that Michigan used technology to respond to the needs of the pandemic, Hayward highlighted tools such as the learning management system Gradecraft, whose functions encourage instructors to design flexible courses from the get-go.\n\n\n\nMultiple members of the audience noted that while they wanted to support students, not every institution made it clear how to accommodate students during the pandemic. The ad-hoc approach instructors had to take made it difficult to accommodate students equally and, at times, created burdens for those teaching in an already difficult time.\n\n\n\nIn response to this, Poproski said that flexibility “needs a little more investigation” to balance student and instructor needs.\n\n\n\n“Flexibility tends to come with a lot of extra work. And so what are the ways we can do it efficiently and effectively that also help the students see that they are being cared for, their interests are being taken into account?” Poproski asked.\n\n\n\nLearn More\n\n\n\nIf you registered for the 2022 PPRS, you can access recordings of the sessions until August 15, 2022.\n\n\n\nInterested in redesigning your course based on the ideas shared from this blog post?

        "description": "With the start of the Fall 2022 semester right around the corner, here are answers to frequently asked questions instructors and students have asked in the past.\n\n\n\nInstructors\n\n\n\nHow do I create a Sakai site for my course?By default, instructors must create their own Sakai site(s) for their course(s) each semester. However, some departments have coordinators create sites for their instructors so we recommend logging into Sakai first to see if your department did so. If you do not see a site for your course, you can create one by following this guide.I would like to copy the contents from one of my past sites to a new course. How do I do that?Instructors may only copy content from a past course if they are listed at the Instructor role in both the past course and the new, current course. To do so, see this guide.Certain tools or data may have to be adjusted and updated after the import is completed. For example, assignment dates should be updated to reflect the new semesters dates. This can be done with the Assignment tool itself or in bulk via the Date Manager.Note: If you are trying to import Quizzes, only draft versions of the quiz will be imported from the past site to the new site. As such, make sure the draft versions are not in the Trash tab in the past site before running the import process.My course is crosslisted across multiple subjects. How do I add all students from each of the separate subject rosters?You can add additional rosters of students to a site by following this guide.How do I re-arrange the left side tool order in my Sakai site?See this guide.How do I add a new tool to my Sakai site? For example, the quiz tool, Warpwire, etc.See this guide.\n\n\n\nStudents\n\n\n\nI just registered for a course in DukeHub but can&#8217;t see it in Sakai. When will I be able to access the Sakai site?First, not all instructors use Sakai for their courses. Confirm with your instructor that they will be using Sakai and that they have published the site for students to see. Second, new enrollment changes are added to Sakai a couple times a day. As such, you should be added to the Sakai site in 12-24 hours from the time you added the course in DukeHub.How do I re-arrange the sites in the favorites toolbar?See this guide.\nThe post Sakai Back-to-school FAQs appeared first on Duke Learning Innovation.",

        "description": "By Chase Barclay &amp; Jax NalleyDuke Student Government Academic Affairs Committee\n\n\n\nDuke Student Government is excited to offer our Syllabus Bank platform for its second consecutive semester this fall. The Syllabus Bank is an online repository that enables students and faculty across the university to access syllabi for undergraduate courses. For years, this type of access hasn’t been offered to all students equally, with many selective student organizations having maintained their own internal repositories only available to members. Under the old system, only some students had the advantage of viewing syllabi, with historically marginalized populations often being disadvantaged in their educational access on campus year after year. Many of our peer institutions (Brown, Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, and Yale) have recognized this and implemented their own versions of a Syllabus Bank to both combat this clear inequity and enhance the experiences of undergraduate students and faculty on their campuses.\n\n\n\nSince launching our pilot in Fall 2021 in partnership with several departments, the Registrar’s Office, and Undergraduate Education Leaders, over 1,200 syllabi have been uploaded to the Syllabus Bank, which were made widely available during our full launch last semester. While we are impressed by the warm welcome many have given the Syllabus Bank, we need higher participation in order to truly accomplish our goal of breaking down barriers for students when crafting their Duke experience.\n\n\n\nUltimately, this initiative will not succeed without your contribution and partnership, so we are writing today with a request:\n\n\n\nWe hope you will consider uploading your Fall 2022 syllabi (and those from previous semesters, if you are willing!) before Friday, August 26th, as the student body will begin heavily utilizing the Syllabus Bank starting Monday, August 29th, in line with the start of classes and the add/drop period for Fall 2022.\n\n\n\nBenefits\n\n\n\nWe know that your to-do list is already packed, so you may be wondering: “what’s in it for me?” Here are just a few benefits that participating faculty report:\n\n\n\nIdentifying adjacent courses, or courses on related topics, across departmentsGaining general familiarity with courses offered by colleagues, which may prove particularly useful for newer faculty membersDiscovering useful language to inform your own syllabi, such as class attendance or participation policy, assignment structure, etc.Consulting syllabi of prior version(s) of a course if you take over responsibility for said course.\n\n\n\nProtecting Your Syllabi\n\n\n\nWe know that course syllabi represent your unique body of work, the result of years of academic specialization, and unique research. As such, we take the security of these documents within our system very seriously to prevent unauthorized sharing. A variety of measures are in place to ensure the integrity of your syllabi:\n\n\n\nOnly members of the Duke community with a valid Shibboleth login (NetID &amp; password) can access class syllabi.All users of the Syllabus Bank must agree to an Acceptable Use Policy before accessing it, which explicitly outlines prohibited actions relating to the Syllabus Bank and details that any violation of this policy, or other institutional policies such as the Duke Community Standard, can lead to disciplinary action with the Office of Student Conduct &amp; Community Standards.\n\n\n\nSteps to Upload\n\n\n\nFirst, go to the Simple Syllabus website (Duke.SimpleSyllabus.com) and log in using your NetID credentials.Upon logging in, notice the three different tabs across the top: Dashboard, Published, and Syllabus Library.The default page, the Dashboard tab, lists all the courses you have taught during the aforementioned terms.To upload a syllabus, click on the pencil icon next to the class of interest.\n\n\n\nNOTE: At this time, we are not seeking syllabi for graduate courses.\n\n\n\nImportantly, DUS Assistants also can upload syllabi for all classes within their respective departments, if your department already collects syllabi centrally. Should your DUSA not have access, please have them email syllabi@duke.edu.\n\n\n\nFeel free to reach out to syllabi@duke.edu with any questions or concerns and visit this website to see further details, video tutorials, and an in-depth FAQ. Thank you so much, in advance, for uploading to the Syllabus Bank and supporting this vital Undergraduate Education initiative.\nThe post Upload to the Syllabus Bank to Support an Equitable Student Experience appeared first on Duke Learning Innovation.",

        "description": "Dr. Yakut Gazi (Photo courtesy of Georgia Tech)\n\n\nOn July 29, Dr. Yakut Gazi officially joined Duke University as its first Vice Provost for Learning Innovation and Digital Education. In this role, Gazi oversees both Duke Learning Innovation and Duke Continuing Studies, with responsibility for the development and execution of pedagogical innovation and digital education strategies, youth academic enrichment programs, and continuing education and lifelong learning offerings.\n\n\n\nPreviously, Gazi was the Associate Dean for Learning Systems at Georgia Tech Professional Education; her higher education experience spans over 29 years in four countries. In her answers to the following five questions, Gazi shares how her past has shaped her present and will influence Duke’s future.\n\n\n\nThis is a newly-created role at Duke. What attracted you to this position?\n\n\n\nThe commitment to the mission of lifelong education and to digital learning to provide accessible, affordable and flexible learning represents my life’s work. We have a unique opportunity to shape not only the future of our institutions, but also the future of higher education. Progressive and bold brands like Duke can expand access and opportunity in an equitable and inclusive manner to deliver affordable programs to global audiences. This is exactly where I want to be at this point in my career. This new Vice Provost role and office will help Duke become the educational partner of choice for the global lifetime learners of today and the future.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat are some of your goals for your first 90 days at Duke?\n\n\n\nDuke University already has a great reputation, sizable online and continuing education activity, and a very talented and dedicated team. I have a vision and a plan to put Duke on the map as a powerhouse for lifetime education. My goal is to use the first 90 days to test my hypotheses while I meet and talk to as many stakeholders as possible at Duke. This kind of work requires intentional relationship building and intense listening to faculty, learners, leaders of the institution and the community, as well as colleagues in the field. Creating consensus behind a vision and plan is critical for my first 90 days.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhich issues in education are you most passionate about?\n\n\n\nI am convinced that challenges with the future of work and education are really issues of scale and inclusion, especially in a technology-driven post-COVID world. To achieve impact at scale, we need to relentlessly pursue accessibility and affordability, while maintaining a focus on quality. I am an immigrant and I live in a multicultural, multilingual, multifaith and multigenerational household. Diversity and inclusion is very close to my heart. Creation of accessible, affordable, high-quality educational opportunities that enable participation of diverse learners for a more just world is what fuels me and gives me excitement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow did you become interested in higher education and online learning?\n\n\n\nSometimes simple, seemingly trivial decisions in life become major forks in the road. As a senior in college, I took an undergraduate research course – primarily because it fit my schedule and I liked that professor. This course created an immense passion for research which carried me to a master’s program, a job as a research assistant, and then pursuing a doctoral degree. One day, walking through the computer lab, helping a class that I was TAing, I realized that computers were the future of education. Back then I was in the field of science education. Online was just starting, we were still using dial-up connections. With this epiphany, I decided to shift my graduate studies to educational technology and first went to the University of Barcelona as a visiting scholar and worked on a European Union project to develop online modules, and then moved to Texas to start a new doctoral program in educational technology. As my career progressed, I had an opportunity to work at the intersection of online and professional/lifelong education and now cannot think of them separate from each other. We will live longer lives (50% of children who are born today are expected to live to be 100) and with technology shaping our careers, we will need to continually learn new skills and update our knowledge. We can no longer be “done with school.” Obviously, we cannot pause our lives and go back to school, so online education, coupled with meaningful, intelligently designed in-person interactions will be how we swirl in and out of school.\n\n\n\nWhat are some of your proudest work-related achievements?\n\n\n\nI have been part of bold initiatives that allowed me to work as part of talented, dedicated teams. I was among the first waves of people who helped establish Texas A&amp;M’s branch campus in Qatar. Being a part of that adventure back then and seeing that endeavor celebrating its 20th year is very powerful. About a decade ago, I was a part of a team that built a new regional university in Texas (Texas A&amp;M University-Central Texas), grew online programs and acquired initial accreditation. The satisfaction that we felt as part of this incredible moment in the history of that university and the pride we felt as a result of this accomplishment will always stay with me for the rest of my career. Having said that, I am definitely proud to be here at Duke.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nThe post Meet Duke&#8217;s New Vice Provost for Learning Innovation and Digital Education: 5 Questions with Yakut Gazi appeared first on Duke Learning Innovation.",

        "link": "https://learninginnovation.duke.edu/blog/2022/07/exploring-cures/",
        "description": "By Hanbing Lin*\n\n\n\nCourse-based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) have emerged in response to studies showing the benefits of undergraduate students participating in research. Because it is embedded within a course, it has the added benefit of reaching a wider range of students, some of whom have never considered doing research or do not know how to find research opportunities (Dolan, 2016). In CUREs, instead of several cookbook-style labs, students participate in a semester-long research project. Floyd Beckford, Ph.D., Professor of Duke Kunshan University, who has implemented CUREs in his CHEM 402 course, defines CUREs as &#8220;a laboratory experience that will open up opportunities to develop your creativity and critical thinking skills and add to the potential knowledge base of this particular area.&#8221; We interviewed Prof. Beckford and asked him to share more of his experience with CUREs.\n\n\n\n(Professor Floyd Beckford in his lab)\n\n\nLooking back on his first-time teaching CUREs, he says, &#8220;Years ago, back in the US, I was assigned to teach environmental Chemistry, a required course for environmental majors. Most of the students in this program did not like chemistry but were outdoorsy, so I took them out into the woods to dig up soil and water samples. They were in their element. It was not as bad after that when they returned to the lab since they had a more intimate connection with what they were doing.&#8221;\n\n\n\nWhen asked what he likes about CUREs, Prof. Beckford says, &#8220;Traditional labs are set up and optimized so that students don&#8217;t fail. They are told to do X, Y and Z and are expected to get A. It eliminates all the problem-solving training. In research, that is not the case. Students do need to figure out certain things and come up with solutions on their own. The sooner they start this process, the better for them over these four years. In CUREs, they learn by doing. They come up with questions as they are doing it and come up with solutions as they are doing it. It is an iterative process. They see what does not work and find out what works. It is also important to have students connect what they learn in class and what they can do with it.&#8221; Prof. Beckford suggests that with CUREs we can scaffold training for Signature Work (SW) project in the DKU curriculum, because SW calls for students to identify complicated problems that are of particular importance and to investigate these through curricular and related co-curricular experiences. In CURE-framed courses, students with diverse backgrounds gain more confidence, creativity and critical thinking skills by experiencing the authentic scientific investigations\n\n\n\nChoose a Suitable Project\n\n\n\nAfter deciding to teach a CURE and incorporating research into the course learning objectives, faculty face the first challenge: picking an appropriate project. It needs to be challenging but doable within the constraints of the course. On this topic, Prof. Beckford suggests, &#8220;It is essential to pick projects with a good potential for success. That way, students will appreciate the setbacks, but those will be buried under the more positive outcomes. So, the learning and research progress are met to a certain extent.&#8221; The project also needs to be of interest to the students and others not in the class. &#8220;Do you ever wonder what is in the rivers of Kunshan? We can find out in our Chemistry lab!&#8221; \n\n\n\nDecide Student Freedom and Responsibilities with the Project\n\n\n\nBesides teaching content knowledge, CUREs also foster students as future scientists. Students should be given the freedom to explore, but to what extent? The next step is to decide how much flexibility and ownership students will have of the project. Prof. Beckford says in his CHEM 402 course the students have complete responsibility for the execution of the project. They plan the experiments and then consult with him to ensure that they are on the right track and that various issues such as lab safety have been considered.\n\n\n\nTo help students experience first-hand how a research project is developed and carried out, Prof. Beckford requires students to do a complete risk assessment before starting the project. &#8220;That means they must consider the experiments they want to do, which chemicals/other materials they will need, and investigate the risk associated with those materials. This is now very typical for research-oriented institutions when a new project is being developed. These risk assessments are considered at very high levels of the institution; indeed, projects can be denied approval if the risks are considered too great or unmanageable. So, for the students to undertake this activity is a clear nod to them engaging in scientific research in the future.&#8221; He also holds high standards for the &#8220;lab report.&#8221; The format is to be the same as what will be seen in a typical chemistry journal as he wants to expose students to the procedures that are common among the practicing professionals in the field. He initially was going to have a peer-review of the &#8220;article&#8221; as a part of the final outcomes, but it did not work out due to the tight schedule of the class.\n\n\n\nDevelop an Assessment Plan\n\n\n\nAnother challenge faculty will face while implementing CUREs is assessment. Since it engages students in work that is open-ended with unpredictable outcomes, the assessment cannot rely on the success of their experiments. In Prof. Beckford&#8217;s case, student progress is assessed mainly through ongoing conversations with the student and evaluation of the data at hand. He explicitly told students that their results, any results, would be secondary to the actual execution of the project. &#8220;So how they do things, planning and execution, is important as opposed to what they actually end with. That way, it is a true research experience, with all the pitfalls: reactions that did not go to plan; products that were unexpected; reactions that just failed and had to be re-thought; reactions that worked far better than expected, etc. All these things teach them how to troubleshoot, pick options, and come up with new ideas. And all these things would be embedded in the learning objectives of the course. So, the students will have met those objectives even if the results from the research were underwhelming.&#8221;\n\n\n\nProf. Beckford notices that not knowing what they are expected to get allows students to be more creative and willing to try different things. With the flexible lab schedule, students actually end up spending much more time in the lab than he has expected. When experiments do not go as the students have planned, they are eager to come to the lab and try again. In CUREs, students gain not only content knowledge but also confidence as future researchers. One student in Prof. Beckford&#8217;s class reflected on the lab experience, &#8220;CURE allows us to combine a wealth of background knowledge, and we really appreciate the opportunity to apply our knowledge. Also, this process of self-exploration gave us a full sense of chemistry and motivated us to carry on because we know we can make a great difference.&#8221; Indeed, one student in the course continued the project in the summer and was close to being able to actually present her results at an international conference.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCUREs open doors for students to engage in authentic scientific investigation and discovery in a classroom setting. While participation in CUREs promotes students&#8217; science identity development, science self-efficacy, motivation, and the ability to &#8220;think like a scientist” (Esparza et al., 2020), they also bring unique challenges to both students and the instructor. Prof. Beckford says he is still exploring with CUREs at DKU. For instance, many students at DKU are not used to the flexibility and freedom in class, so next time he will probably not be as hands-off. He would like to see this kind of pedagogy implemented more widely at DKU. Incorporating research in a course does not have to be limited to STEM classes and it may be beneficial to start students early. At the introductory level, very careful planning would be necessary for a full-fledged project to be successful at DKU, considering the limited time of 7 weeks. However, he believes that it is worth investigating. It could be done on a smaller scale, and the benefits of this type of pedagogy are very tangible and sought after. Uncertainty is an essential part of the research. Let us get comfortable with it and dive into the unknown together!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences:\n\n\n\nDolan, E. L. (2016).

        "description": "Dr.&nbsp;Kristin Stephens-Martinez&nbsp;teaches Computer Science 216,&nbsp;Everything Data; this large course introduces over 200 students to working with data – both fundamental concepts and computational tools – and finishes with a capstone team project working with real data. She says, &#8220;I&#8217;ve been on a journey for a while in trying to figure out how to make my grading more equitable.&#8221; In the most recent offering of CS 216, Spring of 2022, Dr. Stephens-Martinez made some dramatic changes in the grading scheme and introduced mini-exams. These changes were motivated in part by multiple conversations on her podcast, CS-Ed Podcast, in which she interviews various guests about teaching and equity in computer science. In particular, she was inspired by her conversation with Joe Feldman, the author of&nbsp;Grading for Equity, and later interviews with Brett Wortzman and Kevin Lin.\n\n\n\nDr. Stephens-Martinez focused on building flexibility and compassion into her course assessments. For example, there were four mini-exams, and students could retake each mini-exam. In these mini-exams, instead of allocating specific points to parts of questions, each question was graded with a four-category rubric, with each category having a specific number of points allocated. Only blank responses received a 0. Students did initially find the 4 category rubric a bit confusing, as grading didn&#8217;t point out exactly where they could have received a higher grade. They wanted more feedback, but by mid-semester, most students strongly agreed that grading was reasonable. \n\n\n\nCategoryDescription E (Exemplary) Work that meets all requirements and displays full mastery of all learning goals and material.S (Satisfactory)Work that meets all requirements and displays at least partial mastery of all learning goals as well as full mastery of core learning goals.N (Not yet)Work that does not meet some requirements and/or displays developing or incomplete mastery of at least some learning goals and material.U (Unassessable)Work that is missing, does not demonstrate meaningful effort, or does not provide enough evidence to determine a level of mastery.&nbsp;Scoring rubric for sections of mini-exams\n\n\n\nTAs were trained to grade specific questions on this 4 point scale by looking at examples graded by Dr. Stephens-Martinez.\n\n\n\nThe mini-exam and other practices Dr. Stephens-Martinez used in the course are examples of choices that support all students, described as 3 pillars of Grading for Equity: accurate, bias-resistant and motivational. \n\n\n\nThe mini-exam is not graded on points (0-100) but each question is graded on a 0-4 scale, with a minimum of 1 point if the student wrote anything relevant. This is an example of accurate and motivational grading as described in Grading for Equity. In the mini-exam logistics, Dr. Stephens-Martinez provided a translation from the rubric to a percentage score to help students understand their grade. She cautions that a 4 point scale does not allow partial credit, and thinks that allowing retakes helped students accept the 4 point scheme.For many assignments other than the mini-exams, if a student scored above a certain percentage (80-90%, depending on the assignment), they got full credit, which is an example of grading based on standards rather than points, which is motivational.Students had the option to retake any of the mini-exams without making special arrangements, and could decide which mini-exam(s) to retake, which is an example of bias-resistant grading &#8211; grades are based on evidence, not reflective of a student&#8217;s environment or the timing of the work. Students could substitute a related grade for a missed mini-exam, another example of motivational grading.There was a relatively liberal (and well-documented in her syllabus) late policy for most assignments, also an example of both bias-resistant grading as well as being motivational for students. There were many chances to practice and get feedback before a final grade is assigned, a practice supported by all three pillars of Grading for Equity. \n\n\n\nDr. Stephens-Martinez found that educating students on why and how she was using this grading scheme was very important.  As the grading scheme for the entire course was complex, and scores higher than a certain percentage got full credit, she provided a Google sheet with embedded formulas to calculate grades, and gave directions for students to make their own copy to track their own grades, an example of using grading to be motivational. Further, students were given many resources for help, including daily office hours with TAs both online (Zoom) and in person, and the online class discussion forum available as a lecture back channel to encourage use of the discussion forum for creating community.\n\n\n\nFor more on grading, read Grading for Equity by Joe Feldman.

She was particularly motivated by this episode “Grading for Equity with Joe Feldman” and her rubric design was heavily inspired from her discussion in a two part episode series: “Alternative Grading with Brett Wortzman and Kevin Lin Part 1” and “Alternative Grading with Brett Wortzman and Kevin Lin Part 2.&#8221;\n\n\n\nMore on Grading from our blog:\n\n\n\nSymposium Spotlights: Seven (Feasible) Ways to Beat the Grading Grind,  Amy Kenyon, 06/16/2022\n\n\n\nAlternative Strategies for Assessment and Grading, Amy Kenyon, 03/09/2022\nThe post Considering Equity in Grading in Computer Science appeared first on Duke Learning Innovation.",

        "link": "https://learninginnovation.duke.edu/blog/2022/07/tips-for-trying-an-unsupported-tool-in-your-class/",
        "description": "During the recent Pandemic Pedagogy Research Symposium hosted by Duke Learning Innovation in May 2022, an attendee commented on Twitter asking a question we receive regularly here at Learning Innovation:\n\n\n\n\nI&#39;m thinking about the adoption of one-off innovative tools for virtual learning that don&#39;t have institutional support and haven&#39;t been vetted for accessibility. I&#39;m not opposed to this practice per se, but it does make me think about sustainable &amp; inclusive strategy? #pprs22&mdash; Dr. Jenae Cohn (@Jenae_Cohn) May 11, 2022\n\n\n\n\nWe receive flavors of this question almost every semester. Some faculty ask ‘is it ok to use an unsupported tool?’ while others who may have been using something for a few terms might ask ‘what would you suggest to help sustain the use of this tool?’\n\n\n\nThere are a lot of reasons not to use unsupported educational technology (edtech) tools, but there are also situations that warrant them. If your institution enables faculty to experiment with unsupported tools in their classes, there are a number of topics worth reflecting on and discussing with a vendor before you partner with them. Below is an email template to help facilitate the conversation with edtech vendors:\n\n\n\nDear {COMPANY},  I’m interested in using {TOOL} in my {COURSE} this term. Since {TOOL} is not an {INSTITUTION} supported and endorsed tool, I’d like to discuss the following to ensure a simple, secure, and reliable experience for my students and me.> Is your product FERPA and WCAG 2.1 compliant? > Do you have a VPAT and HECVAT you can share with me? > Who owns the user data and user-created content my students and I put in {TOOL}? > What entities outside {COMPANY} do you grant access to or sell the user data and user-created content my students and I put in {TOOL}? > How does {TOOL} accommodate or help achieve {TEACHING VALUE, PEDAGOGY, GOAL}? > Where can I find the policies and terms my students and I will agree to if we use {TOOL}? > What languages does {TOOL} support other than English? > We have students taking this class from {COUNTRY}. Are there any restrictions or known issues accessing {TOOL} from {COUNTRY}? > How do you protect users from doxxing, harassment, or hate speech from others using {TOOL}? \n\n\n\nEstablish your values\n\n\n\nThe questions in the template address several technological values shared by Learning Innovation and Duke OIT including data security (HECVAT), privacy (FERPA), and accessibility (WCAG and VPAT). We recommend you:&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nReflect on your goals, pedagogy, teaching philosophy, professional values, and planned use of the tool.&nbsp;Research the tool and company to see if there is any conflict with your answer to #1.Discuss these with your peers, IT support, and teaching and learning support groups.\n\n\n\nAn example of edtech conflicting with values can be found in our Design and Grade Course Work Teaching Guide under the “Duke has chosen not to implement a proctoring technology” heading.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf your institution supports Learning Management System (LMS) integrations for unsupported tools, ask the vendor about their integration with the LMS your institution uses. An LTI integration can provide an additional layer of security and ease the process you and your students have to go through to use the tool.\n\n\n\nEstablish responsibility\n\n\n\nOne reason central IT departments and teaching and learning centers exist — and why we engage in contractual relationships with vendors — is to define and hold accountable someone responsible for the security of the people and data they create while using a tool.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWho is responsible for making sure your students’ data is protected and not shared? You are.\n\n\n\nThis isn&#8217;t legal advice; if you use an unsupported tool, someone is still responsible for the security of the data your class puts in the tool. We think it&#8217;s best not to assume and explicitly ask questions of the vendor related to what you are responsible for, what your students are responsible for, what the vendor is responsible for, and how they manage their technology and operations so that you feel confident in trusting them.\n\n\n\nAsk for a copy of (and read) any policies, terms, or agreements you’ll be accepting if you use the tool. These are sometimes but not always found publicly on their website and may be labeled terms, policies, or EULA (End User License Agreement).\n\n\n\nRegardless of whether the tool is free, it is common for data you and your students create to be shared or resold by the company if not explicitly stated otherwise. Reflect on the data your class will put in the tool and what that means if given to a third party.\n\n\n\nWho is responsible for informing your students that they’re using a tool that the institution does not support and has not been reviewed for privacy and security? You are.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInforming your students that the tool is not supported by your institution should be one of the first things you explain before you start using the tool in class. This is especially important when a tool produces something public – like a public blog, website, or profile. Prepare plans for accommodating students who wish to opt out of using the tool.\n\n\n\nCreating a safe environment for experimentation and failure is a key component of learning. This can sometimes be negatively affected by the desire to participate in public spaces like social media or the desire to use industry-standard tools students may use professionally post-graduation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThink through the options the tool has for private and public spaces and how that might affect your students&#8217; mindset, creativity, honesty, and ability to learn. How would you support a student who experiences doxxing, harassment, or hate speech from others on the tool if the vendor cannot prevent it?\n\n\n\nIf the tool isn’t free, does it require a purchase by the student, creating an added expense and burden?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDo you have an alternate plan if the tool goes away, changes features or pricing options, or doesn&#8217;t work as you anticipated?\n\n\n\nWho is responsible for providing technical support for the tool? You are.\n\n\n\nCongratulations, you&#8217;re now the IT service desk ! Ask the tool specifically what support options they offer and include instructions for your students on where and how to get help with the tool.\n\n\n\nIf supporting the tool yourself becomes too much to handle, prepare a backup plan and stop using it.\n\n\n\nUnderstand the unique characteristics of your class and institution\n\n\n\nInstitutions with international or multilingual student populations should ask about the internationalization features of the tool. Since Duke partners with Duke Kunshan University, we specifically call out difficulties students may run into accessing tools from inside China.\n\n\n\nFor students in certain countries including China, some commonly used tools such as Google Docs may not be accessible at all. Students may be able to work around this problem by using a VPN (or virtual private network); however, this solution may not be straightforward for students.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe use this as a conversation starter, balancing brevity and scope and knowing we haven’t accounted for everything. Let us know what we missed and what topics or questions would you include.\n\n\n\nResources\n\n\n\nEducause Rubric for selecting active learning technologies\n\n\n\nWestern University Rubric for eLearning Tool Evaluation\n\n\n\nThe full thread that inspired this piece can be found on Twitter. Thanks, @Jenae_Cohn!\n\n\n\nBelow is another version of the template for staff supporting faculty requesting unsupported tools at other institutions.\n\n\n\nThank you for reaching out and requesting support. Unfortunately, we cannot support {TOOLNAME} at this time. We recommend using {INSTITUTION} supported and endorsed tools to keep things simple, secure and reliable, but realize you might also be faced with a situation that warrants the use of non-{INSTITUTION} supported tools.&nbsp;If you do move forward with {TOOLNAME}, keep in mind that when you use tools that have not been reviewed and supported by {INSTITUTION} you are:1. Responsible for making sure your students’ data is protected and not shared;2. Responsible for informing your students that they’re using a tool that {INSTITUTION} does not support and has not been reviewed for privacy and security (this is especially necessary when a tool produces something public – like a public blog or website, for example);3. Responsible for providing technical support for the tool yourself (if the tool or platform doesn’t already provide sufficient support).&nbsp;For {INSTITUTION} students in China, some commonly used tools (e.g., Google Docs, Google Sites, WhatsApp) may not be accessible. Students may be able to work around this problem by using a VPN (or virtual private network); however, this solution may not be straightforward for students.&nbsp;We recommend asking a representative of {TOOLNAME} these questions before you move forward:&gt; Is your product FERPA and WCAG 2.1 compliant?&gt; Do you have a VPAT and HECVAT you can share with me?&gt; Who owns the user data and user-created content my students and I put in {TOOL}?&gt; What entities outside {COMPANY} do you grant access to or sell the user data and user-created content my students and I put in {TOOL}?&gt; How does {TOOL} accommodate or help achieve {TEACHING VALUE, PEDAGOGY, GOAL}?&gt; Where can I find the policies and terms my students and I will agree to if we use {TOOL}?&gt; What languages does {TOOL} support other than English?&gt; We have students taking this class from {COUNTRY}. Are there any restrictions or known issues accessing {TOOL} from {COUNTRY}?&gt; How do you protect users from doxxing, harassment, or hate speech from others using {TOOL}?\nThe post Tips for Trying an Unsupported Tool in Your Class appeared first on Duke Learning Innovation.",

        "description": "While end-of-semester student evaluations can help instructors determine what changes they might need to make for future iterations of a course, they do not do much to ensure the current students have a positive experience. Rather than waiting until the end of the semester to find out if your students are struggling with a certain aspect of your course, let Learning Innovation conduct a mid-semester small group instructional feedback (SGIF) session to help you course-correct at a time when both you and your students may benefit. \n\n\n\nThe Process\n\n\n\nSmall Group Instructional Feedback (SGIF) is a formative, mid-course check-in used for gathering information from students on their learning experience. This process, which is offered at many institutions nationally, is designed to foster dialogue between students and instructors, and to offer students a transparent but anonymous way to surface their concerns about the course in a thoughtful way.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter you fill out a brief SGIF request form, a teaching consultant from Learning Innovation will meet with you to provide an overview of the program, address any questions or concerns, and schedule the SGIF session, which will last about 30 minutes. Then, you will step out of your class and the teaching consultant will facilitate the session during the pre-determined class meeting time (either in person or online, depending on the course format). Students will be asked to join small groups, reflect, and reach consensus on their answers to the following questions:\n\n\n\nWhat is going well for you in the course so far?&nbsp;What do you think could be improved in the course?&nbsp;A custom question for that particular course, based on DLI’s discussion with the instructor.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFinally, the teaching consultant will meet with you to review a report summarizing anonymized outcomes of the SGIF session and to help determine how to best respond to students.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Results\n\n\n\nLearning Innovation has conducted dozens of SGIF sessions over the past 5 years; below are three instructors’ recent experiences with the program.\n\n\n\nLee Baker, Professor of Cultural Anthropology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The Small Group Instructional feedback program was both beneficial and impactful. I was teaching a new class, so it helped me confirm what was working well and enabled me to make some critical adjustments so my student could better achieve our learning outcomes. \n\n\n\nThe process is structured to get rich and deep qualitative feedback, which is better than any mid-semester survey or another form for students to fill out. Students also liked that they were ‘consulted’ on how the class was going and now seem more invested in the class.”\n\n\n\nConnie Bishop, Consulting Associate in the School of Nursing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“I decided to participate in SGIF because it’s immediate feedback by a third party directly with students… and would help me make adjustments immediately if needed, but also would give me formative feedback.”\n\n\n\nOne change Bishop made based on the SGIF findings was essentially adding more lectures: “For the topics that were difficult or really highly technical, I would do mini-podcasts, but I didn’t do them for every module.” She had been trying to keep lecture to a minimum, but when the students expressed that they wanted the podcasts for every module, she added them.\n\n\n\nIn her undergraduate classes, Bishop uses FlipGrid, an asynchronous video discussion board in lieu of written discussion boards, and had recently started using it for her graduate courses as well. The SGIF session “confirmed they loved it.”\n\n\n\nAn added benefit for Bishop’s students is that the SGIF process served as a model for the kind of ongoing professional development and improvement that her students will be expected to make as nurses. Several students noted this in their end-of-semester feedback, saying that the SGIF session helped them better understand the importance of formative improvement.\n\n\n\nKristin Stephens-Martinez, Assistant Professor of the Practice of Computer Science\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStephens-Martinez recently taught a new, experimental course and invited Learning Innovation to conduct a SGIF session to see how things were going midway through the semester.\n\n\n\n“The biggest value was to have an outside person being the go-between where the students would feel that they could be more candid because they know their anonymity is ensured, and it’s someone else summarizing the raw, qualitative information for me.”\n\n\n\nShe appreciated that the teaching consultant conducting her SGIF session was able to filter the results and identify trends in the feedback. While the overall finding was a reassurance that, yes, students were enjoying her class, one important piece of information emerged: students did not understand the grading scheme. Stephens-Martinez reviewed her policy and agreed with her students; “You’re right, I have not given you all the information you need to know how I’m grading you.” She then reassessed how she would be consistent across all the assignments and communicated that change to the class.\n\n\n\nSign Up Now For Fall 2022\n\n\n\nBecause the SGIF session requires time during a class meeting, we recommend planning ahead and completing the request form early so that you have ample time to determine when your SGIF will occur during the semester. \n\n\n\nSoliciting mid-semester student feedback is not only a method you can use to improve (or confirm the success of) your teaching, but it is also a meaningful way to involve students in their learning and show that you care about their experience in your course.\nThe post Include Small Group Instructional Feedback In Your Fall Course Plans appeared first on Duke Learning Innovation.",

        "link": "https://learninginnovation.duke.edu/blog/2022/07/renee-richer/",
        "description": "By Hanbing Lin*\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRenee Richer, Ph.D., is an Associate Professor of Biology at Duke Kunshan University (DKU). Graduated from Harvard University, she works at the intersection of environment and biology (physiological ecology) with emphasis on the impacts of climate change and ameliorating its impacts. She is the recipient of the Duke Kunshan University award for Outstanding Teaching in Undergraduate Courses for the academic year 2021-22. This award recognizes excellence in teaching in undergraduate courses, as nominated by the students.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStudents’ Feedback about Prof. Renee Richer&#8217;s courses\n\n\n\n&#8220;Prof. Richer organizes this course based on all students&#8217; interests and always shares interesting articles related to both course objects and our interests. Besides, she always motivates us to pursue potential research opportunities that will be very helpful for our future applications. She is always there, willing to provide information and suggestions for our learning and individual research. I can relate the class material to my individual research well and I can see how useful this knowledge is for my future study. And she is willing to answer any question in or after class, and she always explains in detail so I have no difficulty fully understanding the course. She really deserves this award!!!&#8221;\n\n\n\n&#8220;I do not like biology, but because of Renee Richer, I was so motivated.&#8221; \n\n\n\nHow rare and precious are comments like this in the days when student disengagement worries instructors all over the world? We had the pleasure of talking to her and asking her to share her experience with teaching online.\n\n\n\nReach out to Students and Establish a Learning Community in Online Classes\n\n\n\nIt is so hard to connect to students scattered worldwide on Zoom [when teaching remotely and students outside of China cannot return], especially in a large class, but Prof. Richer still tries her best to reach students wherever they are and make ties with them. Besides telling students that whenever they want to meet to just let her know, she also stays behind after each class. At the end of each class, she stops the recording and tells the students they can log off now, but she will stay for a little while in case they want to ask questions or just chat. Turning off the recording helps students that will usually shy away from cameras.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\nShe shares &#8220;silly&#8221; cartoons about science and does ice breakers throughout classes, so students talk and learn more about each other. To establish a sense of community, she also encourages students to share their work, read each other&#8217;s papers before submission, discuss what concepts they are struggling with, and learn from each other. During the lockdown due to COVID, students in Kunshan could not go out, so students in the US went out to collect the materials for a lab. Students in Kunshan contributed by doing what they could, image analysis and calculations, for example. They came together to build the final lab report.\n\n\n\n\nEngage Students with Extreme Examples and Relatable Assignments&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn class, Prof. Richer uses extreme examples to shock and &#8220;wake&#8221; students up. For instance, she talks about an animal, a sea slug, which eats algae, incorporates the chloroplasts into it, and photosynthesizes. The animal&#8217;s genome has incorporated some genes to keep the chloroplasts alive. Most people are unaware that these sea slugs -animals &#8211; photosynthesize, so it is eye-opening and engaging for her students.\n\n\n\nStudents love her assignments. One student said, &#8220;I love the enlightening podcasts professor assigned to us each week, and I love the Six Extinction reading. It makes me fully amazed by and respect the power of nature.&#8221; Prof. Richer uses scientific documentaries and podcasts that are fun to listen to and relatively easy to understand to illustrate what they are doing in class and have students write a response paper. Instead of calculations and derivations, students are asked to write about: &#8220;How do you feel about this?&#8221; &#8220;How do you respond to this unexpected scientific discovery?&#8221; &#8220;How do you respond to the fact that plants can learn and have behaviors?&#8221; It gets students to write about how they feel about sciences and how their attitudes toward sciences are changing.\n\n\n\nProf. Richer also assigns light readings, such as short science news articles, and scientific papers, which she guides students through step-by-step. Students enjoy knowing they have the knowledge and expertise to understand a scientific paper and grow more confident in their pursuit of the sciences.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGuide Students with Personal Experiences and Train Students to be Young Scientists\n\n\n\nProf. Richer loves sharing with her students the failures and successes that she once experienced as a student. Students often do not realize that professors might have once struggled in college as well. They may not be aware of the challenges that their mentors have faced and overcome. Sharing that experience with students is an excellent way to establish a connection. Through faculty stories, students can see themselves, their struggles and successes, and how to get where they want. This successful and confident person they admire once struggled in classes as well. What else can motivate the students more when they are down? As Prof. Richer says, &#8220;I share so students can see that it is their personal motivation and diverse experiences that are an indication of &#8216;success&#8217; and not perfect grades.&#8221;\n\n\n\nShe believes every student has unique skills and knowledge to contribute to the academic world, so she encourages everyone. When a student has an interest, she tries to support it and helps students see that their interests can be their careers. She always asks students how they imagine their future and how they would like to spend their time. Do they enjoy being in the field or the lab? What type of work do you imagine themselves doing in that setting?\n\n\n\nOne student commented: &#8220;Professor Richer is so nice that she tries her best to help us with our research interests. She shared science news with us daily through email and recommended a lot of research and internship opportunities for us to polish our resumes. &#8221; Students sometimes come to her asking, &#8220;This article you shared really addresses my interest; how can I learn more?&#8221; In classes, if she notices something students are particularly interested in, she will feed and funnel the class information through their interests. For example, she has a student that is particularly interested in wolves. When they do something in class, she will try to illustrate how it is relevant to the student&#8217;s wolf interest. Why is this biological concept important for wolves? How do we apply it to wolves?\n\n\n\nProf. Richer encourages students to apply for research opportunities, everything and anything as she puts it. She writes recommendation letters for them and helps them go through students&#8217; letters to professors. Sometimes you get the most unexpected offer and get rejected by what you are so sure is yours. She shares her experiences as a college student looking for opportunities and demonstrates to the students: &#8220;You just have to apply. &#8221; To students worrying that their GPAs are not good enough for graduate schools, she will tell them graduate schools are not looking for a 4.0. They will look at how students spend their time and whether they are participating in activities that a young scientist will be interested in, such as attending conferences and doing research.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConnecting with students is a challenge all faculty face. Many go out of their way to motivate and inspire students during tough times. Students clearly appreciate the efforts and prof. Richer&#8217;s story shows that enthusiasm and love for what you do can transmit through Zoom.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout the author\n\n\n\n*Hanbing Lin, Ph.D., is the Educational Consultant for Sciences for the Center for Teaching and Learning (CTL) at DKU. She collaborates with the CTL team to work closely with DKU faculty, especially faculty in the Division of Natural and Applied Sciences. She received her Ph.D. in Physics from Drexel University and had taught at college and high school levels in US and China for over a decade before joining DKU.\nThe post Meet Renee Richer, the 2022 DKU Teaching Award Winner appeared first on Duke Learning Innovation.",

        "description": "Deepfakes had a moment this year: From a fairly&nbsp;obvious deepfake of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky&nbsp;on hacked media in Ukraine to more proficient video&nbsp;scams&nbsp;involving Elon Musk and potentially spurious claims of deepfakes obscuring the truth from&nbsp;Pakistan&nbsp;to&nbsp;mayors’ offices across Europe.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHundreds of articles have focused on these and hypothetical deepfake scenarios and what they mean for the future of video and trust. But despite all this attention, shallowfakes — videos shared with misleading contexts or small edits — are far more widespread and easier to produce. Tackling the scourge of shallowfakes will set us in good stead in a number of ways. It will solve a pressing issue the public faces today. And it will provide a powerful set of tools for addressing more complex synthetic media manipulation like deepfakes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShallowfakes can muddy the waters by casting doubt on urgent, authentic videos or by misdirecting attention by promoting false narratives. In conflict zones or during civil unrest, addressing these videos can mean the difference between life and death. It can be the difference between securing justice and enough reasonable doubt to prevent action. Poynter&nbsp;noted&nbsp;the explosion of this kind of shallowfake on TikTok during the early stages of the war in Ukraine, and we’ve seen countless more examples from the U.S. and from countries around the world.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLuckily, we don’t need to implement complex new processes to tackle shallowfakes. Centrally this is a question of media literacy — how do you enable people to do the ‘lateral reading’ around a video or image they encounter in order to identify that it has been decontextualized or that there are better sources of information? However, there are also concrete, yet underresourced ways to help a media consumer verify whether a piece of video or an image has been shared with misleading context.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMost journalists know how to use a reverse image search (or keyframe search for video) to see where the first instance of a piece of content is, and to see where it pops up over time. It is standard practice, and yet it is not something that is broadly accessible to ordinary people on the platforms they use most. TikTok doesn’t offer it as individuals look at videos on their “For You” pages and Facebook and Twitter don’t offer it as users browse their timelines — neither does YouTube as people watch video after video. On Google, it is inadequate where it is found offered directly for consumers: in Google Lens and embedded in Google Images, where it is oriented towards shopping queries, not confronting hoaxes and deception. \n\n\n\nThis is something we’ve heard our partners on the ground ask for again and again in the&nbsp;global consultations&nbsp;we’ve led on dealing with media manipulation. If we could only ensure that there was equitable, intuitive access to simple verification tools like reverse image and video search — both within individual platforms and across platforms, as falsehoods don’t know platform borders — ordinary people and human rights defenders alike would be in a much stronger position to tackle the next wave of shallowfakes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the fact that a simple reverse image search remains inaccessible highlights how we are going to have to approach this from a standpoint of equity. We need to approach this issue from the perspective of global human rights orientation, rather than applying a Western first or Silicon Valley-led approach. We see this bias manifest in a number of ways, including an overreliance on centralized authority and legislative or regulatory solutions, as well as in assumptions that social media platforms are able or willing to act globally in contextually appropriate ways to understand and respond to misinformation. This belies the state of affairs in much of the world, (including the Western world) where those in power have active interests in leveraging shallowfakes and the&nbsp;liar's dividend, and where platforms have systematically underinvested in content moderation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn the flip side, we need to preserve creative expression and recognize the continued use of satire and creative expression to work around repressive regimes. We also need to ensure that our approach doesn’t discount people who don’t have access to the “right” technologies, whether that is a specific app or just a smartphone. These tools need to be ubiquitous and in the platforms that we all use, just like the tools used to create shallowfakes.\n\n\n\nEnsuring that communities around the world can access and intuitively use detection tools is the heart of what an equitable approach to detection should look like. It also lays the groundwork for much more daunting challenges to come — deepfakes and AI-generated photorealistic images among them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt may surprise some to learn that we actually have a burgeoning set of technologies to track the transformations of manipulated media. My company, WITNESS, has been&nbsp;deeply involved&nbsp;in several such efforts, including the standard-setting work of the Coalition for Content Provenance and Authenticity, originally convened by Microsoft, Adobe, Twitter, the BBC and others. These technologies&nbsp;hold promise if they are built and used with attention to these global contexts: incorporating privacy, having broad accessibility, being opt-in and not using harmful legislative approaches. And there is increasing investment in the technical tools to detect deepfakes in cases where these authenticity trails are not embedded in the media. But if we can’t manage to make these emerging tools available for those who need them most, and intuitive to use, we can never hope to address the coming wave of disinformation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt is hard to overstate the value of and potential for justice that civilian witnesses and democratized access to video provides. It’s critical that we prioritize equitable access to simple, easy-to-use methods of authenticity detection if we want to continue advancing the fight for human rights and justice and fortify the truth. \n\n\n\nSam Gregory is the director of programs, strategy and innovation of WITNESS, a human rights organization with global experience working on how people in crisis ensure their videos are trustworthy and more evidentiary, and an expert on deepfakes and responses to new forms of media manipulation.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/3617315-energy-secretary-calls-on-us-refiners-to-limit-exports-ahead-of-hurricane-season/",
        "description": "Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm called on major U.S. oil refiners to build up capacity and reduce exports of refined products ahead of the winter in a letter shared with The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the letter, written last week, Granholm noted the reduced availability of diesel inventories along the East Coast, which are nearly 50 percent below the five-year average. Refined product exports are at a record high. \n\n\n\nA likely above-average hurricane season, followed shortly by the winter heating season, is likely to compound demand in the northeast. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Given the historic level of U.S. refined product exports, I again urge you to focus in the near term on building inventories in the United States, rather than selling down current stocks and further increasing exports,” Granholm wrote, saying that such a buildup would be an alternative to emergency measures such as releases from the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe letter was reported first by The Wall Street Journal. The paper accused Granholm in a  Wednesday editorial of attempting to strong-arm the energy industry and abandoning European nations weaning themselves off Russian imports. \n\n\n\nAn Energy Department official sharply disputed this characterization, saying “as we get closer and closer to peak hurricane season right now, and we're running our internal models, we are calling on [the industry] to be more proactive.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We understand that they do have plans in place for their refineries and getting them back up and running,” the official added, “but we also want them as they're increasing their exports to also look at the bigger picture … and making sure they're making the right decisions to ensure there's physical supply for American consumers and our allies.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe official cited another letter, also shared with The Hill, to Granholm from the six New England governors urging action ahead of the winter. \n\n\n\nThe governors asked the department to aid in modernizing New England’s energy reserves, as well as considering suspending the Jones Act, which restricts delivery of U.S.-exported liquefied natural gas into the region.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement to The Hill, American Petroleum Institute President Mike Sommers said: “History has shown that federal market intervention has long-term negative consequences for secure, reliable and affordable energy for Americans and the best path to build redundancies for unprecedented events, including hurricanes or global turmoil, is to increase access to American energy.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "Families of children killed in the Uvalde, Texas, school shooting earlier this year will join a gun control protest in the state’s capitol on Saturday.\n\n\n\nGun safety advocacy group March for Our Lives will bring the families, along with survivors of the Santa Fe high school shooting in 2018, to Austin, Texas, to participate in its rally.\n\n\n\n“March For Our Lives is rallying with parents who lost children in Uvalde, survivors from Santa Fe, TX, and youth activists from across Texas to show Governor Abbott that Texans are united in demanding immediate action on gun safety,” the organization told The Hill.\n\n\n\n“Three months since the horrifying and preventable tragedy at Robb Elementary School, Governor Abbott still hasn’t taken action to keep kids safe and prevent gun violence.”\n\n\n\nMarch for Our Lives, an organization first established by survivors of the 2018 school shooting in Parkland, Fla., has hosted protests across the country since the Uvalde shooting in May, which killed 19 children and two adults.\n\n\n\nThousands attended the March for Our Lives protest held on the National Mall in early June, one of 450 demonstrations that took place in the wake of the Uvalde shooting and the racially motivated shooting that occurred in Buffalo, N.Y. the same month.\n\n\n\n“All Americans have a right to not be shot, a right to safety. Nowhere in the Constitution is unrestricted access to weapons of war a guaranteed right,” said Parkland survivor David Hogg at the event.\n\n\n\nMarch for Our Lives told The Hill that the rally aims to urge the Texas legislature to pass laws raising the minimum age to buy the semi-automatic guns used in mass shootings like the one in Uvalde.\n\n\n\n“Every day he doesn’t take action is another day he gambles with our lives,” wrote the organization. “Governor Abbott must call a special session now and raise the minimum age to purchase an AR-15 to 21.”\n\n\n\nThe gun control rally will follow a decision made on Thursday blocking a Texas law that bans people under 21 years old from carrying handguns outside of their homes.\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge Mark Pittman ruled that the law violates the Second Amendment to the Constitution by limiting the individual rights of adults under 21.\n\n\n\nMarch for Our Lives aims to pass “common-sense reforms” such as “implementing universal, comprehensive background checks; creating a searchable database for gun owners; investing in violence intervention programs, specifically in disenfranchised communities; funding the Centers for Disease Control to research gun violence so that reform policies are backed up by data, and banning high-capacity magazines and semi-automatic assault rifles,\" according to the organization's statement.",

They were shown the secured area, and the boxes themselves.”\n\n\n\nBut the interaction does not appear to be as friendly as Trump suggested.\n\n\n\n“They have not been handled in an appropriate manner or stored in an appropriate location,” DOJ wrote in the letter asking for the lock and the preservation of those records.\n\n\n\nThe affidavit indicates the National Archives first reached out about retrieving records as early as May 6, 2021 – just a few months after Trump left office. But it wasn’t until December that Trump’s team indicated it had boxes of documents ready for pick up.\n\n\n\nAnd while Trump has relayed surprise by the execution of a search warrant, his legal team seemed to understand there could be pending charges in a May letter that followed receipt of a subpoena earlier that month.\n\n\n\nHis lawyer sought to push back on the idea that Trump could even face charges as a former president.\n\n\n\n“Any attempt to impose criminal liability on a President or former President that involves his actions with respect to documents marked classified would implicate grave constitutional separation-of-powers issues,” Evan Corcoran wrote.\n\n\n\nBut he cites only one law to back his claim that “unauthorized removal and retention of classified documents or material does not apply to the President.”\n\n\n\nThat particular statute wasn’t cited in the warrant, however, as the government is relying on other statutes, including the Espionage Act, which only require mishandling national defense information that could be used to injure the United States.\n\n\n\nThe affidavit offers new details on classified records previously recovered from Trump\n\n\n\nThe affidavit points to a review of documents recovered from Mar-a-Lago in January as a basis for the search earlier this month.\n\n\n\nIt reveals Trump had far more classified documents than was previously known.\n\n\n\nThe affidavit indicates that among 15 boxes handed over to the National Archives, there were 184 classified documents, including 25 deemed to be particularly sensitive. These contained top secret information such as those gained from “clandestine human sources,” information prohibited from being shared with foreign governments, and information obtained by monitoring “foreign communications signals.”\n\n\n\nWhen the January recovery became public in February, Trump released a statement saying the National Archives did not “find” anything.\n\n\n\nHowever, Archives actually referred the matter to the Justice Department given the wide array of classified materials found in those initial boxes.\n\n\n\n“It appears, based on the affidavit unsealed this morning, that among the improperly handled documents at Mar-a-Lago were some of our most sensitive intelligence,” Senate Intelligence Committee Chair Mark Warner (R-Va.) said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy Trump held on to classified materials a mystery\n\n\n\nTrump’s reasons for holding on to dozens of classified and top-secret documents more than a year after leaving office is still unclear, but the affidavit underscored the messy nature of the former president’s record keeping.\n\n\n\nThe affidavit indicated that the documents recovered during an initial search in January found classified and top-secret documents were intermixed with other materials in boxes.\n\n\n\nFormer administration officials have spoken publicly about the haphazard nature of document organization in the final days of the Trump White House, and he was known to discard or rip up documents throughout his time in the White House despite strict rules about preservation.\n\n\n\nMultiple former Trump administration officials, including former Vice President Mike Pence and former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, have said they did not take any classified materials with them when they left office even as they criticized the FBI for searching Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nTrump has maintained he could declassify documents unilaterally upon leaving office, allowing him to take them with him to Florida. But former administration officials and President Biden have rejected that theory as nonsense.\n\n\n\n“Come on,” Biden said dismissively Friday when asked about Trump’s claim",

        "description": "Sen. Bob Casey&nbsp;(D-Pa.), a member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, is urging the Department of Labor to monitor and regulate how companies are using invasive technology to monitor their employees during work hours.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a letter addressed to Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, Casey called for the agency to push for more oversight, accountability and transparency on how these surveillance technologies are being used in the workplace and how they are impacting workers’ privacy.\n\n\n\n“The implementation of novel technologies to track, monitor, manage and discipline workers is growing due to an imbalance of power in the workplace and a lack of legal protections or regulatory restrictions on these behaviors,” Casey said in the letter.\n\n\n\n“Without oversight, more and more intrusive technologies will be implemented in the workplace,” he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCasey listed examples of how employees are constantly monitored and sometimes punished or fired for low productivity scores that are based on algorithms and automated systems which have “little or no meaningful human oversight.”\n\n\n\nFor instance, he cited some Amazon workers who are penalized for taking breaks to go to the bathroom or to pump breast milk.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn late July, a female Amazon employee sued the tech giant for allegedly failing to provide reasonable breaks and appropriate rooms for workers to pump breast milk,&nbsp;Reuters reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe senator also mentioned how some companies are using technology to monitor and preempt employees' right to organize, or use bots to fire workers over email.\n\n\n\n“Workers disciplined or terminated by these systems are often left with few options to dispute these decisions or engage with a human manager to understand how these decisions were made,” Casey said.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the&nbsp;Federal Trade Commission&nbsp;announced that it was looking at ways to crack down on harmful commercial surveillance and lax data security.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Firms now collect personal data on individuals at a massive scale and in a stunning array of contexts,” said FTC Chair Lina Khan in a statement. \n\n\n\nCasey added that the Labor Department should follow suit to address surveillance in the workplace.",

        "description": "For this year’s Minnesota State Fair, MPR’s All Things Considered will be featuring a series called “Infrequently Asked Questions.” MPR News reporters will try to answer fair questions you didn&#x27;t know you had.As many as a quarter-million people a day show up at the Minnesota State Fair during its annual run. But just as surely as they scarf buckets of cookies and down truckloads of craft beer — they leave. By midnight most nights, fairgoers are back home and the grounds are mostly empty. Mostly. It takes a lot of work to keep the fair going from day to day, and a huge amount of that happens overnight. MPR’s Tim Nelson has covered the fair for decades and walked its streets a few times before 4 a.m. Tim joined MPR News host Tom Crann from the fairgrounds. So Tim, what does happen overnight at the fair? It has actually changed over the years: When the fair was smaller, with fewer days and fewer people, there were some deliveries to vendors during the day. But the crowds have made that impossible. It’s just not safe to have trucks driving around anymore, so all of that has to happen at night. All the food, all the beverages, all the propane gets hauled in overnight and restocked for the next day. So basically, if someone can’t pull it in on a wagon or cart, it comes in overnight to be ready when the gates open at 7 a.m. Most of it comes in at gate 14 on Canfield Street, on the southwest corner of the fairgrounds. Everything else gets buttoned up overnight, but that is the main 24-hour access. Jeffrey Martinez works the night shift cleaning the floors of the Food Building at the State Fair in Aug.Max Nesterak | MPR News 2016There’s got to be a big cleaning crew as well. The grounds always seem to be spruced up and sparkling when the gates open in the morning. It’s a huge task. I talked to Sean Casey, head of operations for the fair. “The goal is to make the grounds look just like it did opening morning,” he said.That starts with a crew of people with backpack blowers marching across the fairgrounds. They pick up all the litter and blow all the debris off the sidewalks and boulevards onto the streets. And then a street sweeper goes over every foot of every street, every night. Same goes for all the bathrooms: there are 10 standalone bathrooms on the grounds, plus restrooms in many buildings, like the Grandstand and the Agriculture Horticulture building. They have to be cleaned, restocked with toilet paper and hand soap, every night. The fair goes through so much of it, they have to store it in sheds off the fairgrounds. Related linksEarlierWhat happens to the DNR fish after the State Fair is over?And then some of the bathrooms, well … need to be put back together. Sean Casey says repairs are pretty proportional to the amount of beer that gets drunk. “The doors get beat up or ripped off or whatever might be,” he said. “Or — you know, we had a circumstance where a scooter was going into the accessible stall and took a toilet out in the women&#x27;s room. So the plumbers&#x27; overnight guy, his job is to go through all the restrooms, make sure there&#x27;s no clogs, nothing overflowing, check the sinks, make sure they&#x27;re all working correctly and again — kind of the same thing — we want it to look presentable every morning, as if it was opening day.”Part of the reason for the after-hours work is, well, gender imbalance. There just aren’t as many women carpenters and plumbers who can work in single-gender bathrooms, so they get worked on at night. A look at the Giant Slide from a Skyride gondola on the final night of the Minnesota State Fair.Tim Nelson | MPR News 2011And there are other complications as well: There’s a rule here that all daytime repairs have to be done at ground level. They won’t bring in ladders or lifts or scaffolding at all when people are here, so if light bulbs need to be replaced or banners need to be fixed, that equipment is only allowed at night. And that goes for vendors as well: if the cooler conks out in your food stand, or you get a hydraulic leak on your ride, and a technician can’t carry the part in to fix it, or do the repair by hand, it will have to wait until the grounds are closed to the public. And what about the animals? Are they at the fair overnight? Is someone watching them? There are animals here overnight in the various livestock buildings. And there are also people living here — in the 4H dorms, and at about 250 camping spots here. And there’s actually quite a bit of security on hand. A lot of the booths have guards overnight to watch over their inventory. And of course there have been some overnight shenanigans on the fairgrounds. Oh, do tell. I’ve been covering the fair on and off for 30 years now, and back in the day, I was the public safety reporter for the Pioneer Press. And I used to have scanners running, 24 hours a day. And decades ago, the fair traffic would often pick up late at night — you&#x27;d hear people start reporting runaway bulls on the grounds. But it was fake. It was a prank that the old hands would pull on the new people, telling them to go try and corral a cow by the Grandstand, and then sighting it down on the Midway and sending someone chasing down there to look for it. I haven’t heard that for a long time, but it seemed to be an annual ritual for a while. So, the gates may be closed after the fireworks end, but there’s still a lot going on each night at the fairgrounds.",

        "description": "The Nationals have released veteran infielder Maikel Franco, reinstated second baseman Luis Garcia from the injured list, optioned righty Cory Abbott and selected the contract of top pitching prospect Cade Cavalli, per a team announcement. Cavalli&#8217;s looming promotion had been announced by the team earlier in the week. Mark Zuckerman of MASNsports.com first noted that Garcia was in the clubhouse and that Franco appeared to be packing up and saying his goodbyes, indicating a move was on the horizon.\nFranco, who turns 30 today, has spent the season as Washington&#8217;s primary third baseman. The Nats signed the former Phillies top prospect to a minor league deal over the winter, and he broke camp with the team. Franco has gotten 99 starts, with the vast majority of that time coming at his customary position at the hot corner. While he&#8217;s been a durable lineup fixture, the right-handed hitter simply hasn&#8217;t produced much at the plate. Franco posted a .229/.255/.342 showing across 388 plate appearances, only connecting on nine home runs with a meager 3.1% walk rate.\nIt&#8217;s a second straight well below-average season for Franco, who managed a .210/.253/.355 line with the Orioles last season. Fellow journeyman Ildemaro Vargas, who was selected onto the big league roster at the start of this month, has a far more productive .317/.354/.450 showing in 65 plate appearances. The switch-hitting Vargas has taken hold of the third base job as a result, while Garcia is now in line to pair with top prospect CJ Abrams as the primary middle infield duo. That pushed veteran second baseman Cesar Hernandez to the bench and squeezed Franco off the roster.\nA nine-year MLB veteran, Franco finds himself on release waivers. Assuming he goes unclaimed, he&#8217;ll hit free agency and be able to explore other opportunities elsewhere. It seems likely he&#8217;ll be limited to minor league offers, although he&#8217;d technically be eligible for another team&#8217;s postseason roster if he signs before the end of this month.",

        "description": "Always Connected\n\n\n\nThe term &#8220;always connected&#8221; has been kicked around the tech industry for a few years now. In its current state, it simply means that a device always has some form of connection to the web wherever you go. Whether it&#8217;s a phone, laptop, wearable, or even a car, always connected is the dream that these devices are always connected, all the time. The only real limitation of an &#8220;always connected&#8221; device is the coverage provided by the respective carriers. \n\n\n\nThat said, worldwide coverage isn&#8217;t quite yet a reality which means that always-connected devices aren&#8217;t necessarily connected one hundred percent of the time. According to T-Mobile, half a million square miles of the U.S. alone fall under the &#8220;dead zone&#8221; category which means that no mobile carriers have coverage in those areas. If you happen to find yourself in one of those areas, your &#8220;always connected&#8221; device is about as useless as a rock. At least with the rock, you could start a fire or maybe go hunt for dinner. \n\n\n\nAnyway, in a surprise announcement, T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert took the stage last night with Tesla/SpaceX CEO Elon Musk to announce a monumental partnership that could mean the end of dead zones as we know it. As part of the Coverage: Above and Beyond initiative, SpaceX will be launching second-generation Starlink satellites in 2023 that will take advantage of T-Mobile&#8217;s mid-band 1.91 to 1.995GHz spectrum that the Un-Carrier acquired when it purchased Sprint. Sievert pointed out that most modern smartphones can already use this band and that, when rolled out, will work out of the box. The hope is that phones and data-enabled devices will be capable of switching to and from the Starlink-served cellular service seamlessly. It was a fairly long chat and it does go off into the weeds a bit but you can check out the details in the video below. \n\n\n\nSpaceX + T-Mobile\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhy it matters\n\n\n\nThis new alliance between SpaceX and T-Mobile will take some time to get up and running but the goal is to see the new satellite-to-cellular service in Beta by the end of 2023. Initially, the service will target SMS, MMS, and participating messaging apps but could eventually include voice and even limited data bandwidth and that is a big deal. Once the new satellite constellation is in place, always-connected devices could, theoretically, finally be truly connected all the time. \n\n\n\nThis matters because we are quickly moving to a place in history where connectivity is no longer a luxury but a necessity. Aside from the obvious benefits here that include safety and security for when you&#8217;re off the beaten path, nationwide and worldwide mobile networks with zero dead spots create a blanket for the on-the-go, mobile, and hybrid workforce. That means less downtime and that equates to more productivity. \n\n\n\nAlways-connected devices are still an emerging market as it pertains to laptops but we are seeing more and more LTE and 5G-enabled devices on the market. With better coverage and the ability to connect anywhere at any time, I suspect that the production of cellular-enabled devices will accelerate aggressively over the next 2-3 years and that includes Chromebooks. Even now, Google is working on giving eligible ChromeOS devices the ability to share their mobile data via a hotspot much the same way we already do with our phones. This will make Chromebooks and other laptop and tablet devices more versatile than ever before. \n\n\n\nSide note: If you&#8217;re a Tesla owner and you&#8217;re reading this, I have some good news. Mr. Musk replied to a tweet from the Tesla Owners Silicon Valley account that yes, this connectivity will extend to Tesla owners that subscribe to the Premium Connectivity plan. Win/Win.

        "description": "The club has been operating at the outer limit of its capabilities to keep pace with far richer opponents – it is starting to tellWhen it was all getting a little too much for Jürgen Klopp at Mainz, when the defeats began to accumulate and the negative thoughts began to spiral, he would clear the schedule, jump in the car and take his squad on an adventure holiday. Long walks in the Hunsrück. Mountain biking in the Black Forest. Two or three days spent knocking back beers, sleeping in tiny huts, having the sort of honest conversations you couldn’t really have in an office. This was Klopp’s terrain, the land where he grew up, and in times of crisis it also became his sanctuary.For Klopp’s players, the occasional jolting change of scenery became not simply invigorating but desperately necessary. The training drills would frequently change, but the rasping cigarette-hardened voice delivering them never did. The limbs and the lungs would be worked to exhaustion from July until May. With every passing year you could feel yourself getting stronger, fitter, harder, tighter. The football was thrilling and relentless. The camaraderie was bracing and intense. Everything worked and worked and worked, right up until the moment it stopped working. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said on Friday she was \"cautiously optimistic\" about the direction of the monkeypox outbreak amid early reports of cases trending down both in the U.S. and globally.\n\n\n\nDuring a press briefing, Walensky noted that some jurisdictions including New York, Chicago and San Francisco have begun to report a downward trend in monkeypox cases.\n\n\n\nThe majority of vaccinations for monkeypox in the U.S. are reported to be first doses so it is unclear how much immunization efforts can be credited with pushing down cases. \n\n\n\nHowever, the White House's national monkeypox response deputy coordinator Demetre Daskalakis noted that recent data from the American Men's Internet Survey (AMIS) found that men who have sex with men have reported changing their sexual habits in response to monkeypox, likely helping reduce transmission.\n\n\n\n\"I want to be cautiously optimistic about this, not only because of the downward trend but because of the AMIS data that Dr. Daskalakis just noted,\" Walensky said.\n\n\n\nSpeaking on the AMIS data, Daskalakis said it indicated that \"the LGBTQIA+ people are doing things that are actually reducing their risk and it's working.\"\n\n\n\n\"And it speaks to the resilience and commitment of this community to addressing the challenge of monkeypox using every tool in their toolkit,\" Daskalakis added.\n\n\n\nWhile cases appear to be trending down in some places, Walensky stressed that they are still on rise nationally. Nearly 17,000 cases have been confirmed by the CDC.\n\n\n\n\"The rate of rise is lower, but we are still seeing increases. And we are of course a very diverse country and things are not even across the country,\" she said. \"So we're watching this with cautious optimism and really hopeful that many of our harm reduction messages and vaccines are getting out there and working.\"\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization said earlier this week that the number of weekly reported monkeypox cases have fallen by 20 percent. The organization attributed the downward trend in Europe to a combination of public health measures, vaccinations and behavioral changes.\n\n\n\nAccording to the White House on Friday, roughly 1.1 million vials of vaccines to treat monkeypox have been made available to the public so far and the U.S. is nearing a point at which it will soon be able to provide two doses to everyone in the at-risk communities.\n\n\n\nAbout 75 percent of jurisdictions are now administering shots intradermally and 20 percent are moving toward this strategy.",

        "description": "Here we go — again. One year after first declaring a water shortage on the Colorado River, triggering cutbacks in water to Arizona, Nevada and Mexico, the federal government recently announced additional cuts are necessary based on dangerously low water levels in Lake Mead and Lake Powell. The announcement's timing coincides with the expiration of a deadline imposed by the Department of the Interior in June.\n\n\n\nThe Colorado River states were given 60 days to create an emergency plan to stop using 2 million to 4 million acre-feet of water in the next year. The federal government warned that cuts would be made unilaterally if the deadline passed with no agreement in place. This is in addition to the federal government's announcement of planned holdbacks from Lake Powell, fearing insufficient water to power the Glen Canyon Dam in May. These announcements form part of a broader trend of increasing federal government intervention in Western water management as collaboration efforts at the state and local levels have repeatedly failed.\n\n\n\nFederalism and historical norms ceded substantial power to the states in the allocation and management of water rights; the federal government has the constitutional authority to play a more significant role. As discussions around water scarcity increasingly highlight the water, energy, and food nexus and the potential national security consequences, a more active role by the federal government is necessary.\n\n\n\nThe Colorado River has come to symbolize the struggle over water in the West. Supplying water to over 40 million people and millions of acres of farmland, it is a key water source for seven states, indigenous communities as well as Mexico, in addition to providing hydropower to the broader region. The Colorado River Compact of 1922 divided the water equitably among the states into an upper basin comprised of Colorado, Wyoming, Utah and New Mexico, as well as a lower basin consisting of Arizona, Nevada and California. The natural tension between the upper and lower basin states with different needs, interests and stakeholders lies at the heart of the problem. Lower basin states are, in many respects, at the mercy of the upper basin states. Since the early 2000s, failing consensus by the states regarding voluntary reductions, the federal government has been forced to issue formal directives, usually with a threat of intervention or possible litigation, to secure agreement.\n\n\n\nAs climate change exacerbates water insecurity, failure is not an option. And yet, cooperation and collaboration remain increasingly elusive. Numerous theories have been proffered regarding the failure of collective action. Theorist Garrett Hardin's, Tragedy of the Commons, long held as fundamental to understanding human action in relation to shared resources, argues that individual self-interest adversely impacts the pursuit of the common good, eventually leading to its destruction or ruin. The theory advocates coercive, top-down action as a way to ensure the sanctity of the commons, or in this case, the protection of the water supply.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, more contemporary theories of collective action have suggested that a collaborative or bottom-up approach is necessary to achieve sustainable solutions. In the domestic water supply context, however, these later theories fail to account for the renewed sense of individualism reflected in the current political and social discourse. Such individualism is antithetical to the principles of collective action, fundamental to solving our water crisis.\n\n\n\nThe federal government's role has evolved from financing infrastructure and development to protecting the environment and indigenous water rights. Today, against a backdrop of growing water insecurity, the focus must be on protecting our national security interests. Greater attention must be paid to the cascading impact of resource depletion on other resource sectors. For example, the increasing importance of, and the significant security implications in the water, energy and food nexus, highlights the need for a more integrated, holistic approach to water management with greater involvement by the federal government.\n\n\n\nHowever, any future role of the federal government must be considered from both a short and long-term perspective. In the short term, emergency measures will be necessary to manage crises, and without more coercive measures, voluntary action by the states is unlikely. Longer-term, the federal government must develop and implement a national water policy incorporating integrated water resource management principles covering water, land and energy, among others. As part of a broader policy, guidelines should be introduced requiring the implementation of demand-side measures in conjunction with monitoring by the states. In the meantime, as time is not on our side, ongoing federal government intervention will be the new reality in the West.\n\n\n\nCarolyn Kissane is the assistant dean at the NYU Center for Global Affairs and director of the SPS Energy, Climate Justice and Sustainability Lab.\n\n\n\n&nbsp;Lisa Craig is an independent energy-climate consultant.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDengue virus is transmitted to humans through mosquito bites.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt can cause severe illness and death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new vaccine candidate was more than 83 percent effective at protecting against hospitalizations over a three-year clinical trial.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDengue virus is a mosquito-borne disease that can cause severe illness and death. Mostly occurring in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world, there’s also the concern of range expansion due to warming climates. Currently, there is a vaccine but access is limited. For example, in the U.S., Dengvaxia is approved only for children 9 to 16 years of age who have had previous exposure to dengue, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A new vaccine candidate from a team of international researchers looks very promising with a high efficacy rate and broad coverage.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTakeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited’s tetravalent dengue vaccine (TAK-003) is a live-attenuated dengue vaccine candidate that has been tested in various clinical trials since 2010. The researchers report in Clinical Infectious Diseases the most recent data from eight dengue-endemic trial locations over the course of three years. They tested this vaccine candidate in children aged 4 to 16.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe difficulty with developing a vaccine for dengue virus is that it has four main strains, and if you’ve had one strain you can still get sick from another one. Similarly, a vaccine that only protects against one strain would not protect you from other strains.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis vaccine is meant to protect against all strains. The initial phase 1 clinical trials were carried out for vaccines for dengue 1, 2 and 4 individually, says professor emeritus Sutee Yoksan, who is Advisor of the Center for Vaccine Development, Mahidol University, Thailand and worked on the vaccine candidate, in an interview with Asia Research News. Then they worked with the vaccine they had developed for dengue 2, but added certain key genes from the other three strains.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You can think of this as having the backbone of a dengue 2 virus with immunogenic elements of the others in the mix. In this way, the immune [system] mounts an antibody response against all four dengue variants,” says Yoksan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe overall three-year efficacy of the vaccine candidate was 62 percent against confirmed infection and more than 83 percent against hospitalization due to dengue virus disease. Efficacy was higher earlier in the clinical trials than at the end of the third year, although the authors note that they plan to evaluate whether to give a booster dose.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTAK-003 has already been approved for use in Indonesia, according to the company’s website. The vaccine candidate trial is registered&nbsp;in the U.S., but is not expected to&nbsp;complete phase 3 clinical trials until March 2024, according to government’s clinical trials website.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Karl Rove, who served as a senior adviser to former President George W. Bush, said on Friday that former President Trump did not have the authority to take presidential documents with him to his Mar-a-Lago residence when he ended his term.\n\n\n\n“Why he was holding on to these materials when he had no legal authority to do so under the Presidential Records Act is beyond me,” Rove, a Fox News contributor, said during an appearance on the network.\n\n\n\nRove’s appearance came shortly after a federal magistrate judge approved the release of a redacted affidavit used to convince him to approve a search warrant for Trump’s Florida residence.\n\n\n\nThe document revealed that authorities found 184 classified documents in boxes recovered by the National Archives in January, and prosecutors argued there was probable cause to believe they would find additional illegally possessed items, including classified national defense information, at Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\nThe previously unsealed search warrant noted that the search came as part of a federal investigation into potential violations of the Espionage Act and two other statutes, which do not rely on documents being classified.\n\n\n\n“The Presidential Records Act is clear,” Rove said on Fox News.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“A president does not have the right to leave the White House and pick and choose what documents he wants to take with him,” he continued. “He can ask for copies, but those are the property of the American people, and since 1978 no president has left with sort of picking and choosing their own documents.”\n\n\n\nThe affidavit revealed that the National Archives first reached out about retrieving records from Mar-a-Lago in May 2021. Trump’s aides alerted the Archives that they had 12 boxes for pick up later that year, and the agency ultimately left with 15, according to the document.\n\n\n\nTrump and many Republicans have denounced the search of Mar-a-Lago as being politically motivated, and the former president has described it as an unnecessary escalation.\n\n\n\n“President Trump has said several times all they had to do was ask,” Rove said on Friday. “Well, my sense is they were asking for a year and a half.”",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/judiciary/3617378-the-trump-affidavit-four-conclusions-on-guilt-and-evidence/",
        "description": "Reading the&nbsp;unredacted portions&nbsp;of the&nbsp;affidavit and appendices&nbsp;which the FBI used to search Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence, leads to some initial conclusions:\n\n\n\nThe affidavit contains sufficient factual basis for Magistrate Judge Reinhardt to find probable cause to issue a search warrant.&nbsp;The standard for issuing a search warrant is very low, and any federal or magistrate judge would have issued a warrant based on the unredacted information contained in the affidavit. So, Magistrate Judge Reinhardt should not be criticized for his decision to issue the warrant.\n\n\n\nThe affidavit and the appendices seem exceptionally broad and virtually unlimited.&nbsp;It excludes rooms at the Mar-a-Lago complex used by third parties — guests and members of the club — but extends to virtually every other area where boxes could be stored. The search warrant itself also seems, to me, to be&nbsp;overly broad and inconsistent&nbsp;with the&nbsp;Fourth Amendment’s requirement&nbsp;of “particularly describing the place to be searched and the personal things to be seized.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe actual search itself may even have exceeded the terms of the warrant, if it is true that it extended to Mrs. Trump’s personal closet and other private areas, absent evidence that relevant material was stored there.\n\n\n\nMost importantly, the unredacted portions of the affidavit do not seem to justify the decision of the Justice Department — as distinguished from the decision of the judge — to seek a warrant, instead of pursuing the subpoena route.&nbsp;There was probable cause for obtaining a search warrant early in the year, yet none was sought. And even when the search warrant was obtained, it was not executed for two days, thus suggesting the absence of real urgency.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt is precisely because search warrants are so easy to obtain that Attorney General Merrick Garland&nbsp;correctly stated&nbsp;that the Justice Department should seek them only when there is no other reasonable option. The unredacted portions of the affidavit do not seem to meet Garland’s own standard.\n\n\n\nFinally, the unredacted portions of the affidavit suggest there may be enough evidence to seek and obtain the indictment of former President Trump.&nbsp;Yet, once\n\n\n\nagain, the standard for obtaining an indictment is very low. As a former judge of the New York Court of Appeals once said:&nbsp;“A prosecutor can get a grand jury to indict a ham sandwich.”\n\n\n\nIt is precisely because it is so easy to obtain an indictment that prosecutorial discretion is so important. In order to indict a former president who may well be a future presidential candidate, two unofficial political/legal standards must be met: The&nbsp;Richard Nixon standard, which means that the evidence of a serious crime must be so overwhelming that even members of the&nbsp;former president’s own party&nbsp;would support an indictment; and the Hillary Clinton standard, which requires the Justice Department to distinguish President Trump’s alleged wrongdoing from Hillary Clinton’s handling of State Department emails that led to a&nbsp;2016 FBI investigation&nbsp;of her conduct — meaning that Trump’s conduct in this instance must be far more deserving of criminal punishment than Clinton’s.\n\n\n\nAs a pure matter of technicality, there probably was enough evidence to secure an indictment of Hillary Clinton; a grand jury would certainly have accepted a prosecutor’s decision to do so. But the decision was made not to seek an indictment in her case. That was the correct decision back then — and it would be the correct decision now, too, if the evidence is no greater than that present in the redacted affidavit. It is possible that the redacted portions would provide evidence that satisfies the Nixon and Clinton standards — but the unredacted portions do not seem to do so.\n\n\n\nAll of these conclusions are based on a quick preliminary review of the unredacted portions of the affidavit; my views may change, depending on whether more information is forthcoming. But based on what I have read, and my 50 years of experience in reading similar documents, these are my conclusions.\n\n\n\nAlan Dershowitz, professor emeritus for Harvard Law School, served on the legal team representing President Trump in his first Senate impeachment trial in 2020.

In a statement, RNC chief of staff Mike Reed confirmed that Dennard was no longer working for the party, but did not provide any details on the situation.\n\n\n\n“Paris Dennard no longer works for the RNC,” Reed said. “We don’t comment on personnel matters.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPolitico reported on Friday that Dennard had been fired&nbsp;from his role at the RNC, though the circumstances surrounding his exit from the committee are unclear.\n\n\n\nDennard worked at the White House under former President George W.

        "description": "Residents of 13 states who receive debt forgiveness from the federal government for their student loans may need to pay some state taxes on their forgiven amount, according to an analysis by the think tank Tax Foundation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJared Walczak, the vice president of state projects for the Center for State Tax Policy at the think tank, said in a blog post on Thursday that loan forgiveness is generally considered to be equivalent to income and is therefore taxable. \n\n\n\nWalczak said that the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion package that President Biden signed into law in March 2021, exempts the forgiveness of student loan debt from 2021 to 2025 from federal income taxes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStates that follow the federal government’s lead will also exclude debt forgiveness, but not all states do.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden announced on Wednesday that the federal government would forgive up to $10,000 in student loans for individuals making less than $125,000 per year and up to $20,000 for those who received a Pell Grant, meant for students with the largest financial need.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe states where residents may need to pay taxes on the forgiven debt are Arkansas, Hawaii, Idaho, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Mississippi, New York, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWalczak also calculated the highest rates that anyone could potentially pay in each of these states for having $10,000 forgiven. \n\n\n\nAll of these states could require residents to pay several hundred dollars in state taxes on the up to $10,000 in forgiven debt, according to Walczak. Hawaii residents could potentially have the highest tax liability at $1,100.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe taxes would be higher for residents who received $20,000 in forgiveness. \n\n\n\nWalczak said states will likely issue guidance in the coming weeks and months on how to treat the forgiven debt.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe told Bloomberg that states will need to act with “some urgency” if they plan to make changes to their tax laws ahead of the debt forgiveness going into effect.",

Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“These policies are a reflection of Texas law and community values,” GCISD Trustee President Casey Ford said Monday, the Dallas Morning News reported.\n\n\n\nStudents at Grapevine High School, one of 21 schools in the district, on Monday said they disagreed with Ford and the three other trustees that had voted to adopt the new policies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Protect trans kids!,” Grapevine students chanted during the walkout.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPolice attending the demonstration did not allow visitors or media on campus, according to the Dallas Morning News, but a small crowd of parents and supporters gathered on the sidewalk outside the school.\n\n\n\nUnder the new policies, library books considered “pervasively vulgar” or “obscene” or that promote subject matter that has been prohibited by law or the school district may be placed in a separate “parental consent area.”\n\n\n\nTrustees, who now hold a conservative majority in Grapevine-Colleyville, under the policy changes are also able to review and challenge library materials more easily.\n\n\n\nChallenged titles that, after an official review, are deemed appropriate for students will not be reconsidered for removal for at least a year, while books that are removed will not be reshelved for at least 10 years. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) of Texas called the changes “draconian.”\n\n\n\nTexas Republicans, meanwhile, have rallied around the new policies.\n\n\n\n“Grapevine-Colleyville ISD is the ONLY school district in the state that has passed a policy relating to CRT, real pronouns, bathroom access, and removing porn from libraries,” reads a state GOP fundraiser on WinRed, a fundraising platform endorsed by the Republican National Committee.\n\n\n\nDonors are encouraged to help bring “common sense back” to classrooms in each of the state’s more than 1,000 public school districts.",

        "description": "Stephanie Ericsson Hinton, 69, is a renter at a senior housing complex in St. Paul who is on a fixed income. She said her landlord wants to raise her rent by almost eight percent.  ”I can’t afford to live there, and I can’t afford to move,” Hinton said. “Last month I had to go to the food shelf for the first time in my life.”The Twin Cities has one of the worst housing shortages in the country, with vacancy rates in the low single digits. Rent stabilization measures that cap most rental increases at three percent were approved by St. Paul voters last November. But city officials have been concerned by what appears to be a decrease in the number of new residential units in St. Paul, according to a report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. The St. Paul Pioneer Press has reported that local numbers may contradict that narrative.Tony Barranco, president of Ryan Companies north region, told the city council earlier this week that rent control measures have brought new construction in the city of St. Paul to a standstill. ”Rent control has never worked to add supply and bring down costs,” Barranco said. “Over the past 18 months, we have wasted so much time and talent debating and implementing a policy that is doomed to fail.” JulyGroup offers recommendations for St. Paul rent stabilizationAprilPublic weighs in on St. Paul rent control measure as state GOP tries to quash local control2021Renters&#x27; advocates cheer Twin Cities voters&#x27; approval of rent control measuresThe city council is now weighing changes to its rent control ordinance. A proposal from Ward 3 Council Member Chris Tolbert would exempt some federally-subsidized housing and would exempt new construction from rent controls for 20 years. That’s five years longer than a working group convened by the city recommended. Tolbert said the changes he proposed make sure that there’s enough housing available, while also allowing property owners to invest in their properties. ”Really the goal of it is to make sure that we have housing stability in the city of St. Paul, while still being able to produce and reinvest in housing,” Tolbert said. “We need to protect quality, naturally-occurring affordable housing while ensuring that we’re also building new affordable housing as well.”Tolbert’s proposal would also allow landlords to “bank” increases in years they require rental increases of less than three percent, and to spread the cost of major renovations over a number of years. He said it’s clear that the city needs new housing to keep up with the population.   ”We have to respect the direction the voters give, but I also think the voters expect us to continue to improve and take information to help implement their will,” Tolbert said. “Ultimately, at the end of the day, the goal is to ensure that housing stability happens in St. Paul.” Renter advocates argue that the changes would undercut the rent stabilization measures passed by voters. Ward 4 Council Member Mitra Jalali said the council needs to take more time and analyze data before they take action.  ”If you believed the narratives that some developers are saying and some people who are heavily aligned with them, there’s been a complete shutdown of construction and the city has been left for dead,” Jalali said. “It’s just hysterical, I’m sorry, but it is — we have to have a rational discussion.”Jalali has introduced four amendments to Tolbert’s proposal. She’s proposing that rent stabilization policies remain in effect for people who live in federally-subsidized housing projects. She also wants to put protections in for tenants who are displaced after rent increases, as well as give more notice to tenants whose landlords have asked for exemptions.  ”The market getting to do what it wants in the hopes that it trickles down to everybody who needs it isn’t enough. Rent stabilization is creating a baseline, finally, to address that,” Jalali said. “I understand that it’s creating change and it’s creating conversation and conflict. I also think that before that we had an inequitable housing market and we are trying to address that.” St. Paul Mayor Melvin Carter supports Tolbert’s proposed changes to the rent stabilization ordinance. The City Council will meet on Sept. 7 to discuss the issue, including Jalali’s amendments. A final vote on the proposal will likely happen in mid-September.",

        "link": "https://blogs.library.duke.edu/scholcomm/2019/04/30/who-owns-the-law/",
        "description": "This post is co-authored by Dave Hansen and Leslie Street, Director of the Mercer University Law Library and incoming Director of the Law Library at William &amp; Mary. \nThere are some categories of information that are so critical to a well-functioning society that restrictions on access or use should almost never be allowed. We could write a long list of those categories, but at the top would be “the law.” Anyone vaguely familiar with the U.S. legal system knows that ignorance of the law is no excuse. The ancient concept, that citizens have the obligation to understand and comply with the law, is an almost absolute presumption across the American legal system. And wrapped up in that presumption is the implicit expectation that citizens have an opportunity to understand the law, and thus necessarily have access to the text of the law itself. Concepts like democratic rule and due process hinge on the concept.\nPublic.Resource.Org and the Official Code of Georgia Annotated\nLater this week an organization called Public.Resource.Org will ask the Supreme Court to address the scope of public access and use rights in &#8220;the law&#8221;, specifically in a case titled Georgia v. Public.Resource.org. The case is about whether the State of Georgia—by way of a publishing contract with Lexis—can hold copyright in the Official Code of Georgia Annotated, which is the official statutory “version of record” that courts, attorneys, and the public must rely on. While courts have been relatively clear about the inapplicability of copyright to the core text of edicts of government, courts have not thoroughly addressed how copyright applies to parts of “official” legal publications that include non-statutory additions such as annotations and comments that are authorized by the state. The state of Georgia asserts that such materials may be protected by copyright and therefore controlled and restricted. The 11th Circuit disagreed, holding that\n&#8220;By wrapping the annotations and the statutory text into a single unified edict, the Georgia General Assembly has made the connection between the two inextricable and, thereby, ensured that obtaining a full understanding of the laws of Georgia requires having unfettered access to the annotations. . . . Thus, we conclude that the annotations in the OCGA are attributable to the constructive authorship of the People. . . . The resulting work is intrinsically public domain material, belonging to the People, and, as such, must be free for publication by all. As a result, no valid copyright can subsist in these works.&#8221;\nWe find the 11th Circuit reasoning persuasive, and so does Public.Resource.org, which is now making the bold move of asking U.S. Supreme Court to review the case it has already won in the court below, in hopes of clarifying the law nationwide.\nLooking beyond Georgia\nWhat’s crazy is that it’s not just the state of Georgia claiming rights over its laws. Over the last year or so we researched and wrote an article titled Who Owns the Law: Why We Must Restore Public Ownership of Legal Publishing, 26 J. Intell. Prop. L. 206 (forthcoming 2019), https://doi.org/10.31228/osf.io/xnbcp, which outlines all the many ways that commercial legal publishers have come to dominate the primary law publishing market. The article explains how those publishers use tools like copyright law and contracts to restrict access today, and how yet more noxious tools such as the CFAA could pose threats in the future.\nIn writing that article we cataloged the status of copyright assertions and publishing arrangements for the court opinions, statutory codes and administrative codes of all 50 states [links here and here, and we hope to make a more usable/readable version of this data soon].  We found that at least 20 states, in addition to Georgia, make some type of copyright assertion over their official statutory code. Many others make claims regarding their administrative codes and judicial opinions. Some of those assertions result in what seem like amusing oddities—for example, one must contractually agree to arbitration in New York to obtain free online access to the Arkansas code—but that have also resulted in real legal battles that can have a chilling effect on access and use.\nSo what can we do? Our paper has some suggestions, specifically for law libraries, state legislatures, and the courts. But ultimately, the solution is likely as complicated and localized as the 50+ jurisdictions that produce the law. In the short term, pay attention to the Public.Resource.Org case before the U.S. Supreme Court. And if you’re a law student, solo practitioner, or legal educator, there is an awesome opportunity to join an amicus brief before that court in support of Public.Resource.Org, asking the court to take the case  (but you’ll have to act fast; signatures are due by May 2).\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe post Who owns the law? appeared first on Scholarly Communications @ Duke.",

        "description": "This is a guest post by Jeff Kosokoff, Assistant University Librarian for Collection Strategy, Duke University; and Curtis Brundy, Associate University Librarian for Scholarly Communications and Collections, Iowa State University\nWith the University of California’s (UC) announcement that they have broken off talks with mega-profitable commercial publisher Elsevier, we have moved closer to a tipping point in the ongoing struggle to correct asymmetries in the scholarly information ecosystem. Elsevier, along with the rest of the Big Five (Wiley, SpringerNature, Taylor &amp; Francis, and Sage), has been put on notice: things as they are cannot stand. UC’s leadership in advancing open access is longstanding, and we applaud their continued efforts to seek new models that would transform scholarly publishing. \nThis is a great day to be a librarian, and a great day for scholars and scholarship. A day when the needle visibly moved in the right direction. Like the UC, we must openly and strongly engage publishers if we want to find mutually agreeable and sustainable long-term solutions to the current crisis. While profit-driven publishers whose business models depend on artificial scarcity to control scholarly content may object, the privatization of the common goods represented by research outputs no longer serves the best interest of academia or society at-large. To be clear, we are not rooting for large commercial publishers to go out of business. The Big Five provide substantial value through their publishing services and journals. However, journal subscription pricing has increased beyond what even the most well-resourced institutions can afford. As a result, an increasing number of preeminent institutions in North America have been quietly cutting their subscription inventories. See SPARC’s Tracking page for an incomplete but helpful list of institutions and packages they have cut. We are not aware of any academic institution that does not have renegotiation of big deals in its plans. \nIn the name of efficiency and effective provision of service, a growing number of librarians seek to create, negotiate and support transformative models that move scholarly publishing to be immediately and openly available. Collections are a service, and we, like the UC, believe the scholarly community will be better served by collection budgets that support and advance open access. These efforts are farther along in Europe, with the recent Wiley-Projekt DEAL agreement serving only as the latest example. But interest in transformative open access models in the United States is rapidly growing. The UC System is not alone in their desire to increase their support for open access while reducing support for subscriptions and paywalls.\nElsevier’s present impasse with California should be understood in the context of the broader worldwide movement to transform scholarly communication. This is a movement that has seen significant recent acceleration, and it is one that transcends country and institution type. If and when Elsevier shuts off access to UC campuses, its researchers will be in good company, joining researchers from Germany and Sweden who have also seen their access cut off after negotiations failed to produce a transformative agreements. One wonders how many of the world’s researchers must lose access to Elsevier content before they finally come around to a position where they will be our partners in solving the scholarly communication problem. Let’s also keep in mind that UC was able to take this stand partially because the libraries have worked hard to help their faculty see the value in openness and the resulting UC Academic Senate support for this difficult decision. \nCosts to institutions and the profit margins of publishers are out of control and unsustainable. It is time for more research to come out from behind paywalls. Paywalls as such only benefit the payee. UC’s approach is an attempt to address the access and the market distortions together, which makes a lot of sense. Libraries have a growing list of trusted partners working to advance open access, including the Open Library of the Humanities, Public Library of Science, Libraria, and Knowledge Unlatched. Many libraries stand ready to support common sense experiments to find ways that work better for our scholars and scholarship. We are always seeking willing partners, be they existing publishers and publications open to re-imagining scholarly publishing, or new platforms seeking more dramatic transformation. It is time to stop pouring our money into the black hole of excessively for-profit publishing that seeks to control scholarly information. Let’s work to open up the ecosystem.\nThe post Enough is Enough: UC Leadership and the Transformation of Scholarly Publishing appeared first on Scholarly Communications @ Duke.",

        "description": "You might recall me writing about ACS v. ResearchGate, a lawsuit filed last fall in the United States by ACS and Elsevier against ResearchGate. It followed a similar lawsuit filed a year earlier in Germany.  In both the German and U.S. versions of this lawsuit, the basic complaint is that ResearchGate infringed the publishers’ copyrights by hosting and publicly distributing scholarly articles for which the publishers claim to own exclusive rights.\nNothing had happened in the U.S. case for months, but yesterday ResearchGate made several filings.  ResearchGate has apparently retained Durie Tangri (the same law firm that represented Google in the Google Books lawsuit) and has invested in making some opening arguments that I think are pretty smart.\nAuthors rights: the argument I’ve been waiting for\nThe most interesting ResearchGate filing isn’t its factual answer to the complaint, but rather the motion that ResearchGate made accompanying its answer. That motion, with the inconspicuous title of “Motion for Notice Under 17 U.S.C. § 501(b)” asks the court to open the door for something big: communicating about the litigation with the actual authors of the articles posted to ResearchGate. Imagine that!\nResearchGate begins its argument by pointing out the unusual nature of the case, and why it is so important to clearly sort out who owns rights (authors versus publishers) in the articles underlying the lawsuit:\nA typical copyright infringement lawsuit about copyrighted material appearing online involves a content creator suing a website owner when an unauthorized third party has posted the creator’s work to the website without the creator’s permission. But here, [the publishers] are suing . . . ResearchGate for allowing scientists to share their own work. . . . Under Plaintiffs’ infringement theories, if ResearchGate is infringing Plaintiffs’ copyrights in the articles at issue here, so are those articles’ authors. Accordingly, a finding that the appearance of those articles on the ResearchGate site was infringing would necessarily mean that the people who conducted the research and wrote the articles did not have the right to share them.\nThe motion goes on to argue that many authors of these articles (almost all of which were co-authored) still hold a valid copyright interest in them that would allow those authors to legally post the articles to ResearchGate. Even assuming that the publishers obtained valid transfers of exclusive rights from the corresponding authors, ResearchGate argues that there is no evidence that the publishers also obtained a valid transfer of exclusive rights from co-authors of the papers. Thus, those co-authors are free to make what uses they want with their papers, including posting to ResearchGate.\nGiven that these authors may hold rights, ResearchGate argues that § 501(b) of the Copyright Act allows (and may even require) the court to order notification of those authors as third parties who have a “claim or interest” in the copyrighted works at issue. Section 501(b) provides that the court:\n\nmay require written notice of the action with a copy of the complaint provided to “any person shown . . . to have or claim an interest in the copyright,” and\nshall require that such notice be served upon any person whose “interest is likely to be affected by a decision in the case,”\n\nIn addition to notification, the statute also provides for a way to actually bring third-parties into the lawsuit. It says that the court “may require the joinder, and shall permit the intervention of any person having or claiming an interest in the copyright” (emphasis mine).\nResearchGate is, for now, just asking the court to order the plaintiffs to notify other potential copyright owners about the lawsuit. Specifically, ResearchGate is asking the court to &#8220;order Plaintiff’s “to serve &#8216;written notice of the action with a copy of the complaint upon’ each co-author of each journal article at issue in the lawsuit who is not a corresponding author. . . .” I don’t know exactly how many authors that is (as I’ve said previously, there are over 3,000 articles), but it’s probably a lot.\nProcedure, procedure, procedure\nYou may think I’m getting all worked up over a little bit of civil procedure. Maybe. But I think it is important because over and over again we’ve seen large-scale copyright infringement suits fought between the large organizations (e.g., Authors Guild v. Google, Authors Guild v. HathiTrust, Elsevier v. SciHub, Cambridge University Press v. Becker (Ga. State)) without much input at all from the actual authors of the works that form the basis of those lawsuits. When those authors have been allowed to have a say, such as in the Google Books class action certification process, their input has meaningfully altered the outcome.\nFor the ResearchGate litigation, it seems like a good start to at least require the Plaintiffs to notify authors that their work is being used as the basis for a copyright infringement lawsuit. I would hope, once authors are notified, that the court would also allow those same authors to intervene, as the statute allows, to have their own say in how their works are shared with the world.\n&nbsp;\nThe post Giving the Authors a Voice in Litigation?  An ACS v.

        "description": "Readers of this blog may know that since 2014, Duke University Libraries have been hosting the Triangle Scholarly Communication Institute, in partnership with our colleagues at NC Central University, NC State University, and UNC-Chapel Hill, with financial support from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation. Each year we invite proposals from teams (rather than individuals) to work on projects they define within their own team and across other teams working on projects around a common theme. This happens across four days in October in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, and expenses for participants whose proposals are selected are covered by a grant from the Mellon Foundation.\nWe&#8217;ve recently announced this year&#8217;s theme &#8211; Equity in Scholarly Communications &#8211; and invite proposals from you! You can find more details in the announcement below and on the trianglesci.org web site, or by following @TriangleSCI on Twitter or seeing what others are saying in the #TriangleSCI hashtag.\nTeams from past years have gone on to launch programs such as these, initially developed at TriangleSCI:\n\n\n\nNHPRC Digital Edition Publishing Cooperatives program\nBuilding a Trusted Framework for Coordinating OA Monograph Usage Data\nTRANsparency in Scholarly Publishing for Open Scholarship Evolution\nDigital Storytelling and the Future(s) of Multimedia Scholarship\nMany voices: Building a consortium of small scholarly societies\nHumane Metrics Initiative\n“Excellence R Us”: university research and the fetishisation of excellence\n\nJoin us and develop your own project! Proposals are due on April 24.\n\n\nThe Scholarly Communication Institute invites you to participate in SCI 2019, its sixth year in North Carolina’s Research Triangle region. This year’s theme will be Equity in Scholarly Communications and the program will take place October 13 through 17, in Chapel Hill, North Carolina.\nTriangle SCI is not your typical academic conference &#8211; it’s four days of concentrated but relaxed time with a diverse cohort of individuals who have come to start new projects they have proposed, in teams they have built and with advice and contributions from participants on other teams and a set of interlocutors and experts who work across teams.\nYou set the agenda, and you define the deliverables &#8211; TriangleSCI provides the scaffolding for your team to develop its project. If your team’s proposal is selected, SCI will cover all the costs for team members to participate, including travel, meals, and accommodations, including for international participants. For more information about how TriangleSCI works, see the FAQ and links from previous years of SCI.\nProbably the best way to get a sense of what it’s like is through the words of participants from past years: they have described TriangleSCI as “One of the best scholarly experiences I’ve had.” and “an amazing incubator of ideas, innovation and collaboration. Grateful to be a part of this incredible experience!” Learn more about TriangleSCI from the perspective of participants via this podcast (with transcript), this summary blog post, and other highlights from SCI 2018 and previous years.\nThis year’s theme is Equity in Scholarly Communications, described this way in the page about the theme:\nDiscussions around scholarly communications, at this Institute and elsewhere in North America and Europe, tend not to account for the wide range of factors that influence whether and how different communities create and access scholarship: not all stakeholders are from well-resourced institutions or nations; not all of us speak, write, read, search, and think in the same language; not all of us enjoy robust support for scholarship, or reliable access to the Internet, or modern research tools, or easy access to libraries, or means of keeping in touch with colleagues and abreast with global developments in our disciplines. Too many platforms, standards, systems, publications, projects, and discussions move forward with only some of us in view.\nFor the 2019 Triangle Scholarly Communication Institute, we invite proposals from teams that aim to build a more inclusive and equitable global network of scholarship. SCI is an opportunity to spend a few days with a diverse set of people to investigate challenges, develop plans, test processes, come to agreements, and launch initiatives. SCI is an ideal place to bring together perspectives and expertise that may not normally intersect, and to build understandings and new models based on them. We encourage pragmatic, proactive optimism, and hope participants will use SCI as a platform to nurture positive change.\nWe especially encourage teams with participants from the “global south”, historically black colleges and universities, Hispanic serving institutions, tribal colleges and universities, community colleges, K-12 schools, independent scholars, and other institutions and backgrounds whose needs and perspectives are often overlooked in discussions about scholarly communications and the infrastructures and processes that support it.\nPlease see the theme page for more information, including some ideas of who you might bring together to form a team, and questions you might address – we’re looking for a broad and diverse set of perspectives, and teams that will address both specific and general problems and opportunities. This is a great opportunity to launch a new project, have some concentrated time to develop an existing project with a broader set of collaborators, or just to begin to explore and experiment with ideas that are difficult to pursue in your usual work context. Remember that if your proposal is selected, your expenses to participate will be covered by SCI, so this is a great opportunity for potential participants who might normally find traveling to such a program cost-prohibitive.\nTo participate, form a team of 4 to 6 people, and submit a proposal along the lines of what’s described in the Request for Proposals (RFP). Proposals are due by the end of the day on April 24, 2019.\nIf you have questions about any of this that aren’t already answered in the FAQ, please contact scholcomm-institute@duke.edu and we’d be glad to help. You might also find some people you know in TriangleSCI cohorts from past years, and you can ask them about their experience and get tips from them about what made their proposal and project successful.\n&nbsp;\nThanks as always to the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation for continuing to provide funding for the Triangle SCI and making all of this possible!\n\nThe post Equity in Scholarly Communications &#8211; join us for TriangleSCI 2019 appeared first on Scholarly Communications @ Duke.",

        "description": "It’s only 280 characters and an image or three. How hard can it be? A well-crafted tweet takes time and thoughtfulness, as all social media-savvy communicators know. For those just getting started – or who simply need a refresher or reference list! – here are some best practices to consider before you press “Tweet.”\n\nHave you checked your grammar and spelling? Is the copy clear and easy to read?\nDoes the tweet state what you want people to do and give them a way to do that? (Ex: A link to read more, a link to register)\nHow does what you’re sharing connect to your department or unit? If you don’t tell people, they won’t know! (Ex: “our faculty member&#8221; or “English student Kathryn Kennedy” or “program alum Quantá Holden” or “our course on…” or “an event/guest speaker we are hosting”)\nCan any person you’re tweeting about be tagged? And if so, are they active? (Note: I generally consider activity within the last six months, and make sure there’s nothing that could be reputationally damaging in what they regularly share.)\nAre there other departments, Duke entities or collaborators (universities, colleagues, journals, funding agencies) who should be tagged?\nHave you included alt text for the image to serve users with screen readers?\n\nWe’ve found that a list like this can also be helpful in illustrating to non-communicators (i.e. your academic bosses and partners) all the work that goes into what may appear to be a simple type-and-post process.

        "description": "Social media analytics is the process of tracking, collecting, and analyzing data from social networks. In University Communications, we use analytics to both understand social media performance and to inform future decisions about how we present and share content on our platforms.\n\n\n\nToday, we’re going to talk about how we collect this valuable information, specifically on Twitter.\n\n\n\nTwitter analytics shows you how your audience is responding to your content, what’s working, and what’s not. You can use data-driven insights to optimize your future content and get better results whether that’s more engagement, more website traffic, or more overall impressions.\n\n\n\nYou can access Twitter Analytics by visiting analytics.twitter.com or by tapping your profile and selecting “Analytics” from the drop down menu:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAccount home\n\n\n\nWhen you first log in, you’ll see the account home page, which is basically a monthly Twitter report card. This page spotlights top-performing tweets and introduces you to influencers in your network:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwitter Activity Dashboard\n\n\n\nAlthough the Twitter analytics home page provides a nice overview, the best information (IMO) is on the Tweet Activity Dashboard. By clicking the &#8220;Tweet&#8221; tab, you&#8217;ll be able to track the number of impressions, engagements, and engagement rate for each and every Tweet you send: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor a more granular view of the volume of each type of engagement, you can click on the specific Tweet:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis allows you to suss out the specific types of engagements your Tweet received. For example, we know that a Tweet with a social media card will on average receive more link clicks than a Tweet with a photo and the link in the Twitter caption. \n\n\n\nBut the most useful feature (again IMO) is the ability to adjust the date range and export your data as a CSV file: \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis feature allows you to sort through the exported data using Excel in ways that are impossible within the platform itself. \n\n\n\nNow what?\n\n\n\nThere are several data columns in the export, so you can develop a customized analysis on whatever metric makes the most sense for your account strategy. Here are a couple common terms and definitions to get you started:\n\n\n\nImpressionsA total tally of all the times a Tweet has been seen.\n\n\n\nReachThe number of users who saw an impression of your Tweet in their timeline. Twitter does not provide this metric in their analytics dashboard, so generally you would need a third-party tool to determine your reach. \n\n\n\nEngagementA Twitter user&#8217;s interaction with a Tweet, including Retweets, replies, likes, links, cards, hashtags, embedded media, username, or Tweet expansion. \n\n\n\nEngagement RateThis varies slightly by platform, but for Twitter engagement rate is calculated by the number of engagements divided by impressions.ClicksThere are several kinds of Twitter &#8220;clicks&#8221; available in the downloaded analytics — user profile clicks, url clicks, hashtag clicks, etc. For our purposes, we track url clicks to determine the amount of traffic we&#8217;re driving to Duke websites. \n\n\n\nWe use Excel to aggregate our data so we can find common trends among our top Tweets, determine particular days/times that work best with our audience, and compare our performance year-over-year.\n\n\n\nDuke University Social Media Twitter Analytics Summary Spreadsheet\n\n\n\n@DukeU Twitter Analytics Over Time\n\n\n\nApril 2021 Analytics Monthly Snapshot\n\n\n\nBy understanding which content items get the most engagement, you can start seeing trends over time — and then applying those insights to future tweets — you’ll be able to better connect with your audience.\nThe post Twitter Analytics: A Quick Look appeared first on Social Media.",

        "description": "Some examples of works in the public domain as of January 1, 2019\nGuest Post by Arnetta Girardeau, Duke University Libraries, Copyright &amp; Information Policy Consultant\nAs you may have already heard, January 1, 2019 marked a very, very special “Public Domain Day.” When Congress extended the term of copyright in 1998 through the Copyright Term Extension Act, it set off a long, cold public-domain winter. For twenty years, no work first published in the United States entered the public domain. But now, spring is here! On January 1, 2019, works first published in 1923 became free to use. And in 2020, works first published in 1924 will enter the public domain, and so on and so on! It’s exciting stuff.  What does that mean to us as creators, makers, teachers, or writers?  It means that we suddenly have access to more materials to rework, reuse, and remix!  Works such as Charlie Chaplain’s The Pilgrim, Agatha Christie’s Murder on the Links, and “The Charleston.”\nThroughout the year and across the country, festivities are planned—including a live streamed panel at the US Copyright Office on January 16, and a incredible lineup of speakers and talks at a live event, “A Grand Re-Opening of the Public Domain,” co-hosted by Creative Commons and the Internet Archive in San Francisco on January 25.\nAt Duke, we&#8217;re celebrating this introduction of new materials into the Public Domain with a competition to showcase what our community can do with the public domain.  We want to see how Duke faculty, staff, and students can use items from 1923 and earlier, all of which are now in the Public Domain!   We have provided a few representative images along with this post, but feel free to create with any works that you find that are in the public domain (if you have questions about what is and isn’t in the public domain, you can contact us and we’d be happy to talk!) Selected entries will be posted on the blog and on Library social media. We have a small number of giveaways to thank you for participating.\nWhat can you do?\n\nWrite new lyrics to a song\nCreate a wallpaper for your mobile phone\nMake a work of art\nCreate a score for a silent movie made in 1923.\n\nWhat else do you need to know?\nAny member of the Duke community may enter.  Faculty, staff, students, and retirees are all welcome.\n\nMultiple entries are allowed;\nSend in entries between January 9 and January 31 at midnight;\nUse public domain content;\nSubmit your entries here https://duke.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_035Q9SkqV5RGmZ7\n\nYou can read more about the Public Domain in this article by the Duke Law Center for the Study of the Public Domain.\nThanks to the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library for providing many of the images!\nIf you have any questions about entering the showcase, or how to incorporate other people’s work into your own, consult the Arnetta Girardeau, Copyright and Information Policy Consultant, at arnetta.girardeau@duke.edu.\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe post Public Domain Showcase 2019! appeared first on Scholarly Communications @ Duke.",

        "description": "To get the most out of your social media efforts, you’ll want to make sure that your website links show up properly. So today, we’re going to talk about the importance of ensuring your website looks great on social media and provide the tools that’ll help enhance your posts on Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nYou’re likely already aware that each page of your website should have a title tag and meta description for SEO reasons. But did you also realize you can specifically customize how your website content displays on social media platforms? The customizations are called social media cards and they make your content more engaging by adding images and summaries when you (or anyone else for that matter) share your links on social media.\n\n\n\nSimilar to the meta tags that tell programmatic robots (like Google) about the pages on your site, social media bots scan the page associated with your link to determine what info should be displayed with it in a user’s newsfeed. If the bots can’t find anything, they take their best guess. The results can vary from boring to comical. But by enabling social media cards on your website, you can control these meta tags so social media platforms accurately determine the title, description, and image that gets displayed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe two main types of tags you’ll need are Twitter Cards and Open Graph.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwitter Cards\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe difference between a bare hyperlink and an engaging Tweet is a small bit of code on your link’s website.\n\n\n\nIn order for these lovely link previews to display on Twitter, your website must have Twitter Cards enabled. Adding a few lines of markup on your website means links to your content will have a “Card” with photo, title, and description to help drive readers to your content.\n\n\n\nThere are technically four different types of Twitter cards, but the one we find most useful is “Summary Card with Large Image.”\n\n\n\nOnce the correct meta tags are added to your webpage (either by you or your website administrator), you can run the URL through the validator tool to test how the link will look on Twitter. This tool also works for any website if you’d like to see what a link would look like before Tweeting. This is helpful since sometimes websites use different images in their meta tags than appear on the site itself.\n\n\n\nA few notes:\n\n\n\nThe most commonly recommended image size for social media cards is 1200&#215;628 since this size fits on Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. For Twitter, you’ll want your image to be at least 300&#215;157 and no bigger than 4096&#215;4096.Often, Twitter Cards are set to pull the first image on a page as a default. Be careful with this since Twitter will crop the image to make it fit the card. You might end up with a pixelated version or a vertical headshot where only the person’s nose is visible.If you update the tags for your page (say you found a typo in your title or need to switch out the image), you’ll want to use the Twitter Card validator to force Twitter to do a fresh scrape of your page’s URL. This will cause Twitter to pull the new meta tag, ensuring that the most recent, accurate information is shared. Otherwise, Twitter might pull from an outdated cache instead.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOpen Graph\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFacebook and LinkedIn both generate link previews based on Open Graph meta tags. Like Twitter, if these Open Graph tags are missing or incomplete, the link preview will also be incomplete.\n\n\n\nFacebook Guide to Sharing for WebmastersMaking Your Website Shareable on LinkedIn\n\n\n\nThe Facebook Debugger is a great tool to see how a Facebook link will look before you post it. It’ll let you see all the information that the Facebook Crawler is pulling. Like Twitter, if you updated the image or preview text and it’s not displaying, click “Scrape Again” once or twice to force Facebook to get the updated information.\n\n\n\nRecommendations from Facebook:\n\n\n\n200&#215;200 pixels is the minimum allowed image dimensions.The image file size cannot exceed 8 MB.If your image is smaller than 600&#215;315 pixels, it’ll still display but the size will be much smaller.When content is shared for the first time, the Facebook Crawler scrapes and caches the meta data from the URL. The crawler has to see an image at least once before it can be rendered, which means the first person who shares your link won’t see a rendered image. You can pre-cache your images and avoid this by running the URL through the Debugger.If you update the image, the original share will continue to show unless you refresh it in the post.\n\n\n\nSince LinkedIn also used Open Graph tags, it functions much like Facebook. The LinkedIn Post Inspector works just like the Facebook Debugger. Paste your URL and select “Inspect” to see what your link will look like on LinkedIn.\n\n\n\nSo if your site doesn’t currently have social media cards, we’d highly recommend having them added.\n\n\n\nHow to Setup Open Graph and Twitter Cards for WordPress\n\n\n\nIf various reasons prevent the addition of social media cards to your website, you can still share your content on social media. It’s just a little bit harder.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOur recommendation is to share your text with the link and applicable image. Make sure to use the correct image size for the social media platform. Also, to meet accessibility standards, you’ll need to add alt text to the image. This can be done natively in Facebook, LinkedIn, and Twitter, but only a few schedulers (Hootsuite, Sprout, etc.) have this feature. And lastly, we do have a Duke-branded link shortener available through Shib login.\n\n\n\nSo in summary, it&#8217;s key to properly manage your website content and how it displays on social media platforms rather than letting Facebook, Twitter, or LinkedIn determine how it&#8217;s displayed for you. By optimizing Twitter Cards and Open Graph and validating the accuracy of your website content in how it&#8217;s displayed, you can curate your content specifically for each audience you have on different social channels.\nThe post How to Make the Most of Your Website on Social Media appeared first on Social Media.",

        "description": "I&#8217;m very pleased to announce a new report, A Framework for Library Support of Expansive Digital Publishing, released today by the team here at Duke University Libraries. The report is about how libraries can more fully embrace their role in the evolving space of digital humanities publishing. This is the summary:\nThis report offers a framework for how libraries can begin to embrace their role in the maturing space of digital humanities publishing, particularly as they seek to support what we call “expansive digital publishing” — challenging digital publications that can span disciplinary and institutional boundaries; use many different technologies; have multiple scholarly outputs; grow over time; operate over the long-term or are multi-phase; aim to engage with multiple audiences; and, in general, use digital tools and methods to explore or enable scholarship that would be more difficult to achieve through traditional publishing.\nThis report is the result of an ambitious project, generously funded by a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, that aims to address how libraries engage with scholars, publishers, humanities institutes, promotion and tenure committees, and many others on expansive digital publishing projects. We covered everything, from financing to producing, evaluating, and preserving some of the most complicated and gnarly digital projects that scholars are now exploring. In our view, these types of publications embody many of the best characteristics of networked digital scholarship. They open new possibilities for engaging in conversation with a broad set of readers — both peer scholars and publics — and, simultaneously, revise and expand knowledge based on this engagement. They are also, for the same reasons, some of the most challenging to truly &#8220;publish&#8221; as scholarly works within the full meaning of that term.\nFor readers of this blog who typically look here for a discussion of legal challenges,  I hope you&#8217;ll indulge me by reading this report, as it grapples with the significant cultural and organizational challenges that face scholars of new, more broadly accessible forms of digital scholarship. For many areas of scholarship, I think these challenges are far more significant than the legal and financial ones that I typically write about.\nOne of the best parts of studying for and writing this report was receiving the generous, thoughtful and diverse comments that the digital publishing community contributed. You&#8217;ll find an impressive list of contributors who have already added their thoughts to this effort in one way or another here. To help further that conversation, we&#8217;re pleased to be able to share the report with the world through PubPub (thank you, MIT Press!), which will allow you to add your own comments or suggestions as you read.\nFull citation:\nFull citation:  Hansen, D., Milewicz, L., Mangiafico, P., Shaw, W., Begali, M., &amp; McGurrin, V.

        "description": "In October, Elsevier and ACS filed a new US copyright infringement lawsuit against ResearchGate [complaint]. Like the German ResearchGate lawsuit I wrote about last year, the basic premise of the suit is the same. This is how Elsevier and ACS describe ResearchGate’s activities in the American lawsuit: \nIn egregious violation of copyright law, ResearchGate provides anyone connected to the Internet with a free trove of infringing digital copies of peer-reviewed published journal articles [PJAs]. ResearchGate has consciously designed and actively maintains the RG Website as a hub for obtaining infringing copies of those PJAs. ResearchGate is not a passive host of a forum where infringement just happens to occur. Rather, ResearchGate actively participates in the ongoing infringement, in which it directly engages by duplicating, displaying, and distributing unauthorized copies of PJAs. ResearchGate also intentionally facilitates, supports, and lures users into uploading and downloading unauthorized copies of PJAs. \nBig, if true. I have some doubts that I will write about later.\nAs far as what this suit and the publishers&#8217; assertions mean for authors, I suggest reading this detailed post by Brandon Butler at UVA on the subject. It’s the best explanation I’ve read yet on copyright, open access and publisher-author sharing policies.  The “tl;dr” for that post is sad but accurate: “You probably can’t share your research as widely as you thought, and this is a problem endemic to academic publishing.” \nThe Authors of the ResearchGate Articles\nOne thing I found so interesting about the complaint in the most recent lawsuit was that it had very little discussion of the authors of the articles involved, or about the research itself (to be fair, if I were writing the complaint for the publishers, I’d try to leave the authors out of it too). Discussion of the authors and their articles is important context, though, for understanding how these articles were created, who posted them to ResearchGate in the first place, and what rights those users might have. Were any authors U.S. government employees who had no rights to be transferred to the publishers? Were any subject to university open access policies that reserve rights to universities or authors? Were any subject to funder OA mandates? Or did authors pay for open access for any of these articles? \nThankfully, to bring a copyright infringement suit, one must actually identify the content alleged to have been infringed, even if you don’t talk much about it in the complaint. In this case, ACS and Elsevier provided a list in “Exhibit A” to the complaint of the 3,143 articles that they claim were infringed. I haven’t had time to fully explore those articles (these is a spreadsheet with information for all 3,143, if you’d like to do your own research). But thanks to some advice from some fantastic colleagues here at Duke, I was able to extract that data and run some searches for information about the articles and authors. I searched those article 3,143 DOIs in Web of Science, which returned 3,082 records. Here’s some of what I learned from those records: \nAuthor Organizations\n\nMost authors of these articles are affiliated with non-US institutions. From among the 3,082 records, the top ten author organizational affiliations are: \n\nChinese Academy Of Science (176 articles, 5.7%)\nCentre National De La Recherche Scientifique Cnr (128 articles, 4.1%)\nUniversite Cote D Azur Comue (100 articles, 3.2%)\nUniversity Of Chinese Academy Of Sciences Cas (68 articles, 2.2%)\nUniversity Of California System (60 articles, 1.9%)\nRussian Academy Of Sciences (49 articles 1.6%)\nIndian Institute Of Technology System IIT System (45 articles, 1.5%)\nState University System Of Florida (37 articles, 1.2%)\nNanyang Technological University (36 articles, 1.2%)\nNanyang Technological University National Institute Of Education Nie Singapore (36 articles, 1.2%)\n\n\n\nI think there is a whole other blog post to be written about publishers going after articles authored in large part by non-Western authors. But I&#8217;ll not touch that for now and focus on the license situation.  I can’t speak about all of those institutions, but at least one (the University of California System) has an open access policy. I’m not sure how that policy/license factors into the posting of the articles to a site like ResearchGate, but it’s worth exploring. Two of the authors are Duke authors, and I know we have an OA policy that affects whether posting the articles to ResearchGate is permissible.\nArticle Funders\n\nUnsurprisingly, given the authorship, most articles with identified funders are not based in the US. The top 10 funders are mostly Chinese.\nNSF funded 38 of the articles, and NIH funded 24.\n\nAgain, unclear how funder OA policies may factor into the posting of these articles, but worth further exploration.\n“Open Access” Articles\n\n155 articles are identified by Web of Science as being “Open Access.” Caution, however,  that the Web of Science definition of OA status is not entirely intuitive (to me at least).\n\nOf those 155 articles, 16 are identified as “Gold OA,” which just means that the publisher made the article available for free online. 12 of those 16 are published under the ACS “AuthorChoice” license, which explicitly prohibits redistribution of the article on platforms that sell advertising.\nThe other 4 are published in Elsevier journals under a CC-BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.\n\n\n\nThese articles raise some important questions about what rights the authors thought they were getting when they paid the OA fees for their articles. Did they understand that posting to ResearchGate would be disallowed? It also raises a question about how Elsevier is interpreting the “non-commercial” clause of the CreativeCommons license (is an author posting to ResearchGate “commercial” use?) and how that matches up to, e.g, the interpretation of that language by Creative Commons and by courts such as in Great Minds v. FedEx.\nI haven’t had as much time as I would like to fully explore these articles and their authors. I should say that I&#8217;m not particularly sympathetic to ResearchGate or its business practices, but I do sympathize with authors who are trying to share their research in the best way they know how. From them, I would be particularly interested in hearing what they think about this lawsuit &#8212; were they consulted before the suit was filed? Are they aware that it was even filed? Do they agree with it? Did they understand their publication contract and its effect on posting to sites like ResearchGate? I’m hopeful that someone out there will take up the important work of developing better information about authors views on lawsuits like this.\nThe post ACS v.

        "description": "Introduction\n\n\n\nOf all the social media platforms we’re going to discuss, Twitter is the medium most built for efficiency and speed. This is due to several mechanics.\n\n\n\nFirst, Twitter limits its users to 280-character posts. Often seen as a hindrance, this is one of my favorite aspects. Twitter is the social media embodiment of William Strunk’s “Omit needless words” and actually forces you to make strategic edits to help capture attention in a concise manner. When I’m converting our website content to social media posts, I almost always start with Twitter because tweeting makes me get to the point and is often the best way to discover the “heart” of a story.\n\n\n\nIn turn, these bite-sized nuggets of information called Tweets make it possible for users to skim a lot of information really fast. Twitter’s feed is ordered, for the most part, chronologically (where Facebook and Instagram are decidedly not) which guarantees fast distribution (although not necessarily quality). The newest stuff is generally on top, making Twitter the place for what’s happening right now. Couple this with hashtags and trending topics and it’s not surprising Twitter is the preferred platform for breaking news.\n\n\n\nAnd once that news is out there we arrive at the key player in the Twitter machine: the retweet button. At the heart of all social media platforms is the ability to share, and Twitter’s retweet mechanic is by far the most efficient example on the World Wide Web today.\n\n\n\nBefore 2009, Twitter users had to manually retweet each other by copying text, pasting it into a new window and physically typing RT before the OP’s handle all before hitting “send.” Twitter decided to build this behavior into its product — a standard practice in tech — and boy did they. Turns out, copying and pasting made people look more closely at what they shared and think about it just a smidge longer. But the retweet button has eliminated that friction and thus exacerbated outrage-sparked sharing and the wanton spread of misinformation.\n\n\n\n[Side note: Facebook took notice and, due to their lack of viralability in the 2012 election, decided to add their version of a RT: the share button. Let’s put a pin in that and come back to it.]\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean for communicators? First, anyone using Twitter has to adjust to the way they think about their use of language due to the character limit. This functionality has a direct impact on vocabulary, grammar and the complexity of the communication. Also, please be advised that navigating the brevity of Twitter lingo does take practice in the actual medium. Re-using website text just isn’t going to cut it.\n\n\n\nSecond, Twitter moves quickly and thus timing influences your success on the platform almost as much as the content itself. When faced with a breaking news type story, you have two choices: Break the news yourself or have Twitter break the news for you. (There are definite pros and cons to both strategies, but for this blog we’re assuming you want to be in control of your own story.)\n\n\n\nAnd lastly, because Twitter is so fast and content is so easily shareable the platform can be responsible for fueling the momentum of false news. MIT researchers found that false news on Twitter spread faster, deeper and more widely than true news. Unfortunately, it’s not just influencers and Russian bots to blame; it’s ordinary Twitter users, with modest followings, who have a bias for the “sensational, unverified, emotional and false” … amplified by the millions. For communicators, this means keeping a vigilant eye out and constantly combatting the untrue.\n\n\n\nWell, that&#8217;s all for now. Next up, Facebook. Until then \nThe post Part I | Twitter appeared first on Social Media.",

        "description": "This post is co-authored by Dave Hansen and Kyle K. Courtney\nWe’re very pleased to announce the release of two documents that we believe have the potential to help greatly expand digital access to print library collections by helping libraries do online what we have always done in print: lend books.\nBoth documents are aimed at addressing the legal and policy rationales for what we term “controlled digital lending” &#8212; a method by which libraries loan digitized print books to digital patrons in a “lend like print” fashion similar to how non-digital patrons check out books in-person. Through CDL, libraries use technical controls to ensure a consistent “owned-to-loaned” ratio, meaning the library circulates the exact number of copies of a specific title it owns, regardless of format, putting controls in place to prevent users from redistributing or copying the digitized version.\nCDL isn’t itself a silver bullet for mass digital access to books. It’s not meant to be a competitor to Overdrive, nor a replacement for licensing e-books of best-sellers or other currently licensable e-book content. But we think CDL does deserve significant attention as a legal strategy, particularly to help address access to the large number of books published in the “20th Century black hole” that have little hope of otherwise bring made available to readers online.\nThe first document is a Position Statement on Controlled Digital Lending, which is meant to help people understand the concept at a glance, give an opportunity for libraries and legal experts to communicate their support for CDL, and provide a centralizing statement around which libraries can build a community of practice. The Statement is signed by a number of leading libraries (some of which are currently employing CDL or actively exploring how to do so) and copyright experts.\n The second document is A White Paper on Controlled Digital Lending of Library Books, which we co-authored. The White Paper delves much deeper into the legal and policy rationales for controlled digital lending, reviewing relevant law, the fair use rationale for CDL, and practical risk and policy considerations for libraries that might consider implementing CDL for some parts of their collections. Our aim with the White Paper is to help libraries and their lawyers become more comfortable with the concept by more fully explaining the legal rationale as well as the situations in which the rationale is the strongest.\nWe, along with several colleagues, have posted more information at www.controlleddigitallending.org, which includes the statement text.\nThe white paper can be found at:\nDavid R.

        "description": "Fifty-six years ago, scholar Marshall McLuhan published “Understanding Media,” and 14 years ago I was assigned to read it as part of an undergraduate elective course, “Media, Culture and Society.” Clocking in at over 500 pages, McLuhan’s seminal work is a bit of a doorstop, but the text’s best-known phrase — “The medium is the message” — is one I haven’t forgotten. Even though McLuhan’s theory predates the digital age, his work still provides perspective on new communication platforms such as social media.\n\n\n\nWhat McLuhan meant by this expression was that the actual content (i.e. this blog post) is beholden to the medium through which it’s being delivered (i.e. the computer or smartphone on which you’re currently reading). That is, the technology delivering the message (i.e. your printing presses, TVS, radios, websites, so forth and so on) inherently change how we communicate and, in so doing, alter or even supersede the message.\n\n\n\nOne of the most famous historical examples is the 1960 Richard Nixon/John F. Kennedy debate. TV audiences thought the good-looking JFK emerged victorious, while radio listeners believed Nixon to be the victor. (Some even go so far as to state that Kennedy would never have been president without the medium of television.) Same content, but what people thought had happened was very different depending on the medium they were using.\n\n\n\nA more recent example is the Andrew Lloyd Webber musical CATS, whose stage version featuring elaborate costumes and much-lauded choreography appealed to millions for years, while its CGI-laden cinematic counterpart, well, didn’t.\n\n\n\nBack to the matter at hand, all this is to say that the way your audience interprets, understands and engages with your content is influenced heavily by the platform you’re using and how you’re using it. From Facebook’s live video to Instagram’s filters to Twitter’s character limit, it’s important to look at each platform as a unique opportunity when crafting a story and to use each platform’s unique parameters to help shape your message. The rest of this blog series will examine how the technology behind each social media platform influences the way its users interpret its messages.\n\n\n\nSo what does this mean for communicators? First, anyone using Twitter has to adjust to the way they think about their use of language due to the character limit. This functionality has a direct impact on vocabulary, grammar and the complexity of the communication. Also, please be advised that navigating the brevity of Twitter lingo does take practice in the actual medium.

        "description": "With coronavirus dominating the headlines recently and disrupting daily life for millions of people in China and beyond, there has been renewed attention to the significant role the platform WeChat plays in information sharing in China. \n\n\n\nWhat is WeChat?\n\n\n\nIn short, WeChat is a social media network, messaging app, e-commerce platform, and more, all in one app. It’s become ubiquitous in daily life in China – with more than 1.1 billion active users.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow do universities use WeChat?\n\n\n\nImportantly for communicators, WeChat is also the first place many users will turn for official news and updates – before looking at an institution’s website, or checking their email. \n\n\n\nAt Duke, we have more students and alumni from China than from any other country outside of the United States. Because Chinese internet restrictions generally prevent prospective students, parents, alumni and others in China from accessing our other social media channels, we’ve been active on Weibo (another prominent Chinese social network) since 2011, and we launched our WeChat presence in 2015.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to posting stories and updates and promoting admissions information sessions in China, we’ve successfully used WeChat groups to host live chat sessions for admitted students – most of whom aren’t able to visit campus before enrolling – who are eager to learn more about life on campus or connect with other students. And it’s an important way our Chinese alumni community stays in touch with one another and the university – there are a number of active Duke alumni chat groups in which members are sharing news and information with each other on a daily basis.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor our communications\ncolleagues at Duke Kunshan University, a joint-venture university founded in\n2014 in Kunshan, China, WeChat is even more critical to their work. In addition\nto sharing stories on the university’s public-facing profile on the platform,\nthe university uses private WeChat groups to connect incoming students,\ncommunicate quickly with and build community among parents, and as a practical\ntool for the small but growing staff and faculty community to share news and\nupdates.\n\n\n\nIn addition to\nits instant-messaging function, another useful component for communicators is\nWeChat Moments. Similar to Facebook, users can post pictures, story links and\nother updates to their feed for all (or selected) connections to view, “like”\nand forward, potentially boosting the reach of their content.\n\n\n\nIf you’re curious\nabout how you might use WeChat to support your connections to Chinese students,\nparents or alumni, I’d encourage you to talk with your students and alumni who\nare active on WeChat to learn how they use it. You can dip a toe in the water\nby following some brands (many American and international brands are quite\nactive there) and universities to get a sense for how they are using the\nplatform. And don’t hesitate to reach out to our team (socialmedia@duke.edu) with questions about this work.\n\n\n\nFollow Duke University\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Duke Kunshan\n\n\n\n\nThe post Why WeChat Matters for Universities appeared first on Social Media.",

        "description": "Hello world! I&#8217;ve left this blog quiet for the last several months as we have eased into some leadership changes at Duke University Libraries that have reinvigorated our focus on addressing information needs across the full research lifecycle, from collections to discovery to research to publication and back again. That focus reflects on several major principles and goals of the Libraries’ strategic plan, Engage, Discover, Transform. I&#8217;m really excited about the direction we&#8217;re headed.\nClosely connected with those goals are a few long-term projects that I&#8217;ll be posting about over the next few months. I&#8217;m pleased to announce one today: The Library Copyright Institute.\nThe Library Copyright Institute is a collaborative project with colleagues from UNC-Chapel Hill, North Carolina Central University and NC State University, all part of the Triangle Research Libraries Network (TRLN).  You can read the full press release here.\nThe project is meant to be a pilot to develop a program of systematic, deep instruction on copyright law for librarians. The Institute is specifically targeted at training librarians at institutions with fewer resources and no copyright expert on staff. The premise of the Institute is that we&#8217;re all better off when the whole library community is widely and deeply engaged on the legal issues that most directly affect our ability to help users. Regardless of what library you work at, we all need to be able to confidently apply fair use, understand licenses, and assess public domain status. Having fewer resources should not mean that the beneficial rights granted by copyright law are unavailable to librarians, researchers, teachers and students at those institutions.\nWe&#8217;ve already identified a number of excellent instructors who have indicated a willingness to help us teach what we expect to be a 3-day intensive experience, hosted sometime in late summer 2019 at NCSU&#8217;s James B. Hunt, Jr. Library. We will have an open call for applications sometime in Spring 2019 and for those selected, attendance will be free (including lodging and food). We&#8217;re aiming to reach librarians in the Southeast with this first version of the Institute, but are designing the program with an eye toward replicating the Institute in other regions in the future.\nI look forward to seeing how this project progresses. If you have an interest in what we are doing, I&#8217;d love to hear from you: david.hansen@duke.edu.\nThe Library Copyright Institute was made possible in part by a grant from the Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS Grant RE‐87‐18‐0081‐18).\nThe post The Library Copyright Institute appeared first on Scholarly Communications @ Duke.",

        "description": "You may have heard about recent legal action against ResearchGate brought by several large academic publishers organized under name of the &#8220;Coalition for Responsible Sharing&#8221; (Elsevier, Wiley, Wolters Kluwer, Brill, and ACS). Some of its members filed a lawsuit against ResearchGate and sent ResearchGate copyright takedown notices for many articles posted there. There are some good summaries of the dispute already, including this one by Mike Wolfe at UC Davis and this one on Science Magazine Online.\nThe dispute is about the millions of copyrighted articles&#8211;the Coalition claims there are 7 million&#8211;made freely available through ResearchGate. The Coalition publishers, whose business model depends on charging for access to those articles, don&#8217;t like that users can get them for free. It’s a familiar dispute, and one that publishers have fought over the years, although on a much smaller scale, with Academia.edu, as well as a variety of universities repositories.\nA natural inclination toward open access \nSo, who posted all those articles to ResearchGate? As far as I can tell, every article shared through ResearchGate was put there by one of its authors. I’m not sure of all of the reasons why authors use ResearchGate, but I believe a major one is that those authors want their work to be as easy to find and read as possible.\nI also believe, based on experience working with academic authors on their publishing contracts, that many authors aren’t aware of the details of how their publishing contracts allow them to share their work. They aren’t lawyers, but they shouldn’t have to be.\nFor most of the ResearchGate articles, I have every reason to think that the publishers are correct in their assertion of legal authority, based on publishing contracts, to remove those articles. Authors often sign publishing contracts that transfer almost all of their rights to publishers. Some agreements grant rights back to authors for some “scholarly sharing”, but the contract terms are often so incomprehensible and limited that they are effectively meaningless to many authors. Some try to figure it out (do a Google search for “Is it legal to post articles to ResearchGate?” and you’ll find lots of advice of varying quality), but it’s far from clear.  So instead, many authors opt to follow their natural inclination—despite the risks—to take what steps they can to make their work easier to find, read, and perhaps be cited.\nOA the “right” way versus “wrong” way\nScholarly publishing has long struggled with authors who don’t especially respect or even understand the dominant pay-for-access business model. Judging by the 7 million articles authors have shared through ResearchGate, many authors seem to view that model with something from outright contempt to self-interested indifference.\n So what are publishers to do with these authors who make their work freely available the “wrong” way? If enough people do it, it may have a serious effect on journal subscriptions. But authors are in a pretty good position; if publishers start actively enforcing copyright law against authors we may react negatively (and possibly very publicly) against not just the particular enforcement action but against the underlying business model. See, e.g., The Cost of Knowledge. So instead, we now see a stream of copyright enforcement not against authors but against the intermediaries that authors use to share their work: ResearchGate, Academia.edu, and university institutional repositories. It puts those organizations in a tough position, but ultimately, the harm is to authors who want to share their work.\nAs many people have stated before, the goals of open access can best be achieved if authors—who have great power as the initial owners of copyright in their works—hold on to their rights and negotiate their publishing contracts for terms that allow them to widely distribute online. For that matter, authors who want to share their work as openly as they can would do well to use alternatives besides posting to proprietary commercial sites like ResearchGate. But right now, that ideal of broad OA the “right” way seems far off.\nOpen in order to be read\nWe’re at the end of Open Access week, as you may have noticed by the encouraging number of OA events over the last few days. This year’s OA Week theme is “Open in order to&#8230;” I find one of the simplest but most powerful “open in order to&#8230;” statements is “open in order to be read.” To me, a silver lining of the ResearchGate takedowns (among other similar recent actions) is that it signals meaningful, author-created, system-wide pressure against a business model that hinders readership, rather than enhances it. The method and platform demonstrating that pressure isn’t ideal, the legality is questionable, and the result for some organizations (and potentially authors) may be painful. But it’s clear that author-initiated sharing, viewed collectively, is seen as a real threat to that business model. I’m hopeful that means we’re just a little bit closer to seeing that model fade out of dominance and yield to one that emphasizes access and readership.\nAs for authors today, we can protect ourselves from the risk of takedown notices by retaining our rights. Publishing contracts are not written in stone; they’re negotiable. Increasingly, we can negotiate to keep the rights we need to post our works anywhere we want to be read. For anyone interested, here are some tools for doing this the right way:\n\nSPARC Author Addendum for publishing contracts \nSHERPA/RoMEO database of publishing self-archiving policies\nAuthors Alliance tools to regain your rights for works already transferred to a publisher (for OA or for other types of distribution on your own terms) through Rights Reversion or Termination of Transfer\n\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\n&nbsp;\nThe post Who posted all those articles to ResearchGate anyway? appeared first on Scholarly Communications @ Duke.",

        "description": "I feel like YouTube has been a part of my higher ed stump speech for a couple of years now, but this year, we&#8217;re finally getting to implement some of the goals we&#8217;ve had around YouTube here at Duke for a while now. Allow me to explain.\n\n\n\nWe&#8217;ve decided that YouTube isn&#8217;t just a bucket for holding video content. It&#8217;s actually social media. I&#8217;ll show you what I mean. Get in, loser.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLots of higher ed institutions and brands use YouTube to house their video content so that they can embed it in other places, like on their website. YouTube works great for that, but there are so many more things that you can do with YouTube. Let me show you.\n\n\n\nHere&#8217;s Doritos&#8217; YouTube channel page:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNot bad, and I really love Doritos as a brand. BUT, here&#8217;s the YouTube channel page of one of my favorite YouTubers, Mamrie Hart.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLooks different, right?\n\n\n\nWe’ve got the Doritos brand account, which basically just holds their video content that they’ve already created for somewhere else, like TV or their website. It isn’t using all of the YouTube channel page features, including custom thumbnails and end cards. Plus it has weird titles on the videos.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(If you haven&#8217;t seen Mean Girls, please ignore all my gif jokes.)\n\n\n\nNow look at the YouTuber channel page. Mamrie is producing content with a series model so subscribers know what they&#8217;re going to get, she&#8217;s using YouTube&#8217;s interactive features, she&#8217;s got a featured video in the feature hole on her channel page, and she&#8217;s got branded thumbnails. Let&#8217;s break all of these down a bit more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeries Model Content\n\n\n\nWhy would you want content in a series model? Well, one of the goals of YouTube is to get subscribers, and one way to do that is to have content that your potential subscribers can expect to see. We want our subscribers to be obsessed with our content.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrash Course does an amazing job with series. They have lots of different series on their channel, but they&#8217;re all branded a little bit differently and they all stay on topic. You can have as many series as you want on your channel, and series content is what&#8217;s really going to get those subscribe clicks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat kind of content should you be creating? Well, rather than re-inventing the wheel, check out Matt Gielen&#8217;s The Taxonomy of YouTube Videos. It&#8217;ll tell you everything you need to know about what kinds of content work best on YouTube.\n\n\n\nExplainers tend to work well for the higher ed space, so a couple of our new series will be this type of video. Extra Credit is a series we&#8217;ve recently launched. Here&#8217;s one episode:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChannel Optimization\n\n\n\nThere are lots of ways to optimize your YouTube channel, beyond just what kind of content you create. Here are the secrets to optimizing your YouTube channel:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescriptions\n\n\n\nYour descriptions should be, well, descriptive. That means that they should say what&#8217;s actually in the video and use keywords that people might use to discover your video. Remember, YouTube is the second-largest search engine in the world, behind only Google. Get those keywords in there! Search engines read just like humans do, so be sure to put the most important words and concepts at the beginning of the description.\n\n\n\nCaptions\n\n\n\nCaptioning your videos is not only important for accessibility, but also for Search Engine Optimization. YouTube actually reads the captions you generate to serve up better search results for people. Also, it&#8217;s just plain nice to caption your videos. Be a good citizen. Caption your videos.\n\n\n\nTitles\n\n\n\nTitles are really important for the search function on YouTube, too. One mistake I see people make with series content is putting the name of the series first before the content of the video. This gives the name of the series more weight in the search algorithm, when really people are probably searching for the actual content of your video, not the series name. Here&#8217;s how LEGO titled one of their videos in the Rebrickulous series:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou&#8217;ll note that important keywords like &#8220;LEGO&#8221; and &#8220;Challenge&#8221; come before the name of the series.\n\n\n\nThumbnails\n\n\n\nThe thumbnails for your video are part of the language of YouTube, and you&#8217;re just going to look like you know what you&#8217;re doing better on YouTube if you create YouTube-esque thumbnails. As in the LEGO example above, thumbnails usually have lots of bright colors, pictures of action and people&#8217;s faces, and the title of the video. They should look good in a small format. Pro tip: Don&#8217;t put your logo or watermark in the bottom right corner, because the time stamp for the video will always go in that corner on the thumbnail.\n\n\n\nWVU has some of the most excellent higher ed thumbnails I&#8217;ve ever seen.\n\n\n\nEnd Screens\n\n\n\nOk, let&#8217;s talk about end screens. I have feelings about end screens. A lot of feelings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnd screens are a YouTube-only functionality. If you&#8217;re using end screens, it tells YouTube viewers that you created this content for them, not for all of your other platforms. It tells them that YouTube isn&#8217;t an afterthought, but a strategy for you.\n\n\n\nBonus, you can also get some Call-To-Actions in your end screens and I know you marketers get all happy about that stuff. (I&#8217;m a marketer too, so I can say that.) Most end screens include a subscribe button and links to a couple other videos that people might like to watch after watching what they just saw. Here&#8217;s ours for the Extra Credit video I embedded above:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChanging How We Promote Video\n\n\n\nNormally when we put video up on social media, it makes the most sense to direct-upload the video file to whatever channel we&#8217;re going to use (Facebook or Twitter or whatever). The channel algorithms highly favor direct uploads because it keeps people on that platform rather than sending them somewhere else.\n\n\n\nBut what do you do when you&#8217;ve got a YouTube-first strategy and want people to interact with end screens and hit the subscribe button? Well, you change how you work a bit.\n\n\n\nEmbedding is, of course, the easiest way to promo YouTube videos. If you&#8217;re embedding the YouTube video, you don&#8217;t lose any of the functionality like end screens and captions, and all of the views get counted in your YouTube analytics, no matter where the video is embedded.\n\n\n\nFor Facebook, we&#8217;ve done a bit of experimenting, and it seems to work best to link to a Duke Today story where we&#8217;ve embedded the video, rather than linking straight to YouTube. The algorithm favors our website over YouTube for some reason.\n\n\n\nFor Twitter and Instagram, we&#8217;re running really cool preview videos, formatted for the platform and using a link to the full YouTube video.\n\n\n\n\nIs stress always bad?Professor @bmartinhard discusses how reframing our ideas about stress can reduce its harmful impacts  https://t.co/ujdVwUDwSi pic.twitter.com/73eTQhmp0l&mdash; Duke University (@DukeU) September 20, 2019\n\n\n\n\nSo Does it Work?\n\n\n\nOur preliminary data says YES, we&#8217;re getting more views compared to our typical non-series videos, and picking up more subscriptions to our channel, but we&#8217;ll get back to you when we have more numbers. We&#8217;re still in the early stages of experimenting with YouTube this way, but we&#8217;re super excited about it and we hope you will be too.\nThe post I&#8217;m Not a Regular Higher Ed YouTuber, I&#8217;m a COOL Higher Ed YouTuber appeared first on Social Media.",

        "description": "Did you know we here at Duke have a suite of channels branded Duke Students and run by a team of actual students?\n\n\n\nFacebook: @DukeStudentsInstagram: @DukeStudentsMedium: @DukeStudentsSnapchat: @DukeStudentsSpotify: DukeStudentsTwitter: @DukeStudentsYouTube: Duke StudentsWebsite: DukeStudents.com\n\n\n\nWell now you do! \n\n\n\nHere&#8217;s how we&#8217;re set up:\n\n\n\nLast year&#8217;s team of editors (I don&#8217;t have a group pic yet this year because several of our editors are studying abroad!)\n\n\n\nWe have approximately one student editor per @DukeStudents channel. I say approximately because we have a couple of people who run multiple channels, and our Instagram channel has two editors. (It works better that way for content flow.) One of these editors is our editor-in-chief, who runs strategy, analytics, and the process of keeping everyone on track. We&#8217;ve found it works a lot better when we let them be in charge of each other. I&#8217;m basically just there in case they get stuck on something.\n\n\n\nThese editors are paid! We meet in person (or via Google Hangouts for the study abroad students) once every two weeks, but the rest of their work is done off-site whenever they have time. We keep things organized on a team Slack. We try really hard not to over-schedule them. They do a lot remotely and they work different hours than I do, so it works better for everyone this way.\n\n\n\nYou might be surprised to know that the student editors have full control over their respective accounts. That means that they don&#8217;t have to submit drafts to anyone for review, and they are allowed to choose and curate what they want to post! (More on how we make that work later.)\n\n\n\nWe also have a team of content contributors. They are mostly underclassmen and are unpaid. There are about 40 of them! We meet with them once a month and keep in touch online via GroupMe. They&#8217;re each assigned one of the paid editors as their mentor for a set period of time, and then they rotate to a different editor. This gives them exposure to a lot of different social media channels. Their job is to contribute content to the editors for each of the different channels. Eventually, we hire our student editors from this group, so being a content contributor is almost part of the interview process to be a student editor.\n\n\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n\n\nPeople usually gasp and clutch their pearls when I tell them the students don&#8217;t have to submit drafts to me before they post, but we do have a pretty solid set of time-tested rules that all of the editors know and follow. I do read their posts once they go up, and on the rare occasion I have to ask them to take something down, but they&#8217;re actually usually even more careful than I would be with the rules I&#8217;ve given them.\n\n\n\nThe rules go thusly:\n\n\n\nThe &#8220;Grandma Rule:&#8221; If your grandma wouldn&#8217;t want to see it, don&#8217;t post it.No references to alcohol, parties, drugs (and no red Solo cups, no matter what&#8217;s in them)Nothing dangerousNo content promoting Greek or SLG organizations (This is because we don&#8217;t want to accidentally play favorites, so it&#8217;s just easier to not promote any of them.)No profanity, including phrases like &#8220;AF,&#8221; or hashtags that contain profanity (like #GTHC and #DDMF)Do not insult other schools, even in reference to sportsFollow NCAA athlete recruitment rulesDo not answer admissions questions. Always redirect to Admissions!\n\n\n\nThese rules really take care of most of the problems we might have with what to post and what not to post. It really helps to begin a group like this with the rules in mind so that you can be clear about expectations. We&#8217;ve found that once the expectations are established, the more freedom we can give them, the better. More freedom equals more creativity!\n\n\n\nIt&#8217;s also helpful to remember that they are students, and students are human, and humans mess up sometimes. They&#8217;re going to mess up. (To be fair, so are you.) So with that in mind, make sure that you have a plan in place for when they mess up or need help and a way they can contact you anytime.\n\n\n\nHiring:\n\n\n\nI mentioned above that we hire to our paid student editors team from the pool of content creators. This gives us at least an academic year to make a determination about whether the student is enthusiastic about @DukeStudents or not, and we&#8217;re hiring for enthusiasm, not necessarily skill. You can teach skills. (Doing social media isn&#8217;t brain surgery, guys&#8211; hate to break it to you.) You cannot teach enthusiasm.\n\n\n\nEnthusiasm!\n\n\n\nOther ways students can help you:\n\n\n\nIf you don&#8217;t want to set up social media that your students can run on their own, there are lots of other ways to use the talent of your students:\n\n\n\nUse them as a focus group! They know really cool stuff. Ask them about new social media channels and how they use social media.Have them collect content for you! Most of them already know how to shoot great video on their phones and have an eye for what will work in an Instagram feed.Occasionally make them do boring stuff. No one likes spreadsheets, but let&#8217;s be real. You&#8217;re the grown-up here and it won&#8217;t kill them to copy-paste for a couple of hours.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, students are awesome!\n\n\n\nGet yourself a team of them and see how much more fun they make your job!\nThe post Student-Run Social Media: Make it Work for You appeared first on Social Media.",

        "description": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Democrat Charlie Crist will pick Karla Hernández-Mats, the head of Miami-Dade County’s largest teachers union, as his running mate as he seeks to unseat Gov. Ron DeSantis. Crist is expected to formally announce his pick during a Saturday rally in Miami that he’s holding to officially kick off his general election campaign. Crist trounced Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried 59-34 in Tuesday night’s primary and is now preparing for an uphill battle against DeSantis, who is a heavy favorite. The Hernández-Mats pick, first reported by CBS Miami, was greeted with high praise from Democrats. The Crist campaign declined to comment for this story. “Love it!” said state Sen. Shev Jones (D-Miami) in a text. “I think it’s a thoughtful and bright move. Karla has ALWAYS had her ear to the ground for people, and she’s a natural galvanizer. Great pick!” Florida Sen. Jason Pizzo, also a Miami Democrat, described her as “bright, warm and tough.” Since 2016, Hernández-Mats has served as president of the United Teachers of Dade, which touts itself as the largest teachers union in the southeast. She is also on the governance board of the Florida Education Association, which is the state’s largest teacher’s union. FEA support of Crist played a pivotal role in the primary. The organization not only endorsed him, but pushed for the rest of the state’s labor organization to follow suit with a primary endorsement, even as some did not want to endorse before the general election. It led to a contested fight during the AFL-CIO’s summer convention in Orlando, which Crist ultimately won. “We’re thrilled by Charlie Crist’s choice for his running mate. Karla Hernández-Mats will be a great lieutenant governor of and for all the people of Florida,” Florida Education Association President Andrew Spar said. “She's a mom with two kids in our public schools, a teacher focused on students with special needs, and cares deeply about children, families and communities.” Crist’s pick ensures education will remain at the forefront of the race, especially since schools have been the main focus of DeSantis’ policy and political agenda. Democrats have been hyper-critical of DeSantis as he has worked to remake Florida’s education system, including championing legislation banning the instruction of gender identity and sexual orientation in classrooms up to third grade, putting intense scrutiny on the approval of classroom textbooks and hammering critical race theory, an academic philosophy that focuses on systemic racism. DeSantis opposes its teaching in state K-12 schools, even though it is not, and his administration has paid $700,000 to a firm that as part of its business model teaches governments how to incorporate CRT. In addition to his focus on education as governor, DeSantis is the first governor in state history to get heavily involved in local school board races, which are nonpartisan by law. At least 20 of 30 DeSantis-backed school board candidates won their Tuesday night contests. Education issues have energized Republican voters, so the party is eager to highlight them in the governor’s race. “Charlie Crist’s lieutenant governor pick is as tone deaf as the Democratic message here in Florida,” said Evan Power, an official with the Republican Party of Florida. “Somehow, he thinks picking a union boss who once compared parents to armed monsters will help him with the voters of Florida.”",

        "description": "For veterans like me, the threat to Afghan women and girls’ freedoms is personal — for although U.S. troops have come home, the war is far from over for the Afghan people.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring the 20 years of U.S. presence in Afghanistan, rights and access to opportunities for Afghan women and girls expanded substantially. While the U.S.’s original mission in Afghanistan was not related to gender equality, advancing Afghan womens’ rights was an important goal of U.S. reconstruction efforts between 2001-2021. Yet, because of the Taliban, Afghanistan continues to be one of the most challenging places for women to live today.\n\n\n\nThis Women’s Equality Day, we must take concrete legislative and administrative action to help preserve Afghan women’s rights and strengthen the global women empowerment movement.\n\n\n\nWhile the Taliban vowed to respect women’s rights within Islamic law, it is evident that Afghan women and girls have lost social capital and mobility under their rule. In the year since the U.S. left Afghanistan, Afghan women and girls have faced extreme political and social whiplash.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe deteriorating situation of Afghan women and girls is apparent in all indicators of gender equality— education, health, safety, autonomy, social standing, political and workforce representation and influence, legal justice, maternal mortality rates, and much more.\n\n\n\nThe U.S., with all of our resources and influence, has a moral responsibility to look beyond our borders and uplift Afghan women and girls. This crisis has drawn repeated calls for their protection, from advocates as high up as all 24 female U.S. senators. However, our country’s commitment to uphold the rights of Afghan women and girls has not yet materialized.\n\n\n\nAs substantiated in our inaugural national gender strategy, the U.S. needs to take immediate action to implement an “interagency plan” that provides a roadmap on how to advance gender equality through strategic, effective actions between U.S. agencies, international organizations and other countries. This can be achieved through an increase in targeted humanitarian aid and specific U.S. legislative action.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEven before the Taliban regained control over Afghanistan, humanitarian and gender specific efforts in Afghanistan were heavily reliant on foreign aid. Since 2021, most sources of aid have been eliminated or reduced, increasing Afghan’s dependence on foreign aid. But just as the Taliban’s control of Afghanistan triggered a reduction in aid, it also prompted an economic crisis that aggravated the humanitarian situation and individual security of Afghans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile some agreements have been reached to continue funding and maintaining critical humanitarian efforts in the country, they are not sufficient enough to address critical needs. The widening gap between the level of aid being delivered and the level of demonstrated need is a life threatening crisis for Afghan women. Among them, an estimated 98.2% have lost economic opportunity since the U.S.’s withdrawal from Afghanistan — according to a recent survey of applicants of the Special Immigrant Visa program. This is especially concerning, considering 88 percent of them reported being the primary breadwinner for their household.\n\n\n\nAfghan women and girls are directly and disproportionately harmed under Taliban rule, exacerbating the backsliding of their rights. With Afghan women and girls facing immediate threats to their wellbeing and lives, there is no question that Afghanistan is at the forefront of the global fight for gender equality.\n\n\n\nUplifting women and girls in other parts of the world uplifts women and girls everywhere. Breaking down gender barriers is a large feat that requires the involvement of global citizens.\n\n\n\nThe motive, desire and responsibility to support Afghan women and children is all accounted for, so why is it taking so long to enact the measures necessary to address this crisis and “to advance the full participation of all people — including women and girls — in the United States and around the world”?\n\n\n\nWe rightfully made promoting gender equality a large part of our mission in Afghanistan, and now I am asking our legislators to take this crisis off the backburner and work alongside experts on the unique political and cultural environment in Afghanistan to best support Afghans.\n\n\n\nEvery American remembers the stories and fear voiced by the Afghan people as the U.S. withdrew from Afghanistan. And pleas from Afghan women and girls, and Afghani military allies are not going to disappear from our memories anytime soon.\n\n\n\nThe time to rejoin the fight for gender equality in Afghanistan passed by 350+ days ago, but if the U.S. takes action immediately, we may still be able to preserve the rights and freedoms that Afghan women have been fighting their whole lives for.\n\n\n\nKaitlynne Hetrick is the Associate Director of Government Affairs of the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America (IAVA).",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEligible borrowers can get up to $10,000 of their federal student loans cancelled, or up to $20,000 for those who received federal Pell Grants during college.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYet millions, including borrowers who earn more than $125,000,&nbsp;would be left holding substantial balances and seeking other options to also receive&nbsp;loan forgiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere&nbsp;is the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program, Borrower Defense program and others that also offer certain eligible borrowers loan forgiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough the Biden administration’s historic student debt forgiveness plan stands to impact upwards of 15 million borrowers, there are still alternative ways borrowers can get their student loans forgiven through targeted programs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEligible borrowers can get up to $10,000 of their federal student loans cancelled, or up to $20,000 for those who received federal Pell Grants during college&nbsp;and in total the balances for 20 million borrowers could be completely cleared. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet millions, including borrowers who earn more than $125,000,&nbsp;would be left holding substantial balances and seeking other avenues toward further forgiveness.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrior to the announcement the administration had approved $32 billion in loan relief for around 16 million borrowers, including for&nbsp;students who were victims of for-profit institutions like DeVry University.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are four more ways to seek&nbsp;federal loan forgiveness.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPublic Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) program&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe PSLF program is designed to encourage students to enter careers like firefighting, teaching, government, nursing and other public interest fields. Those who chose to pursue any of those careers and work for a U.S. federal, state, local, or tribal government or not-for-profit organizations are eligible to have certain federal student loans forgiven.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever,&nbsp;borrowers must&nbsp;hold their public service jobs for ten years and make 120 payments to have the remainder of their balances forgiven. It includes those serving as full-time AmeriCorps or Peace Corps volunteers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo qualify for PSLF, you must work full-time, have direct loans with the Education Department, be under an income-driven repayment plan and make 120 qualifying payments. The payments do not need to be consecutive.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than 175,000 borrowers have collectively received more than $10 billion through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness Program.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs part of Biden’s loan forgiveness announcement, borrowers may receive credit for payments that previously did not qualify for PSLF under a limited waiver program.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBorrower Defense program&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFederal borrowers who believe their institution&nbsp;engaged in misconduct or misrepresented the value of their programs are eligible to apply to have their loans cleared through a Borrower Defense discharge.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Education Department announced earlier in August that it will discharge the remaining loan balances for students who attended the now-defunct ITT Technical Institute from Jan. 1, 2005, through its closure in September 2016.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey found the school lied to students across the country about their ability to transfer credits to other institutions, and falsely guaranteed that students would be able to get&nbsp;jobs upon graduation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOther institutions the Education Department deemed guilty of defrauding their students include Devry University, Corinthian Colleges, and the Marinello School of Beauty.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe administration so far has discharged $13 billion for around 1 million borrowers whose institutions defrauded them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTeacher Loan Forgiveness program&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTeachers that teach full time for five complete and consecutive academic years in a low-income school or education service agency can be eligible for forgiveness of up to $17,500 on direct subsidized and unsubsidized federal loans. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe loans also must have been made before the end of a teacher’s five academic years of qualifying teaching service. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nTotal Permanent Disability Discharge&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnyone with a disability recognized by the Social Security Administration (SSA) will have their federal student loans discharged through a data match. Those who have a disability not on file with SSA can still apply for a discharge of their student loans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis program is designed for those who are unable to work due to a physical or mental impairment, something a physician must sign off on to back up the claim that an impairment is expected to result in death, has lasted continuously for a period of 60 months or greater or is expected to last for a continuous period of 60 months or greater.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDisabilities might also be certified by a licensed physician, or through records from the Department of Veterans Affairs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe administration has granted $9 billion in total and permanent disability discharges for more than 425,000 borrowers.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Photo by Adam Hunger/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Hunter had been on the IL with back pain. The Mets have reinstated right-handed pitcher Tommy Hunter from the injured list and optioned catcher Michael Perez to Triple-A Syracuse. Since catcher Tomás Nido was reinstated from the injured list a few days ago, the Mets had carried three catchers on their active roster, a rare move in the game these days. \nHunter has only thrown 14.1 innings for the Mets this year, as back surgery last year and some back pain this year have limited his ability to stay on the field. But when he has pitched, the 36-year-old has put together a 2.51 ERA and 4.03 FIP. \nPerez had some notable moments in his stint with the Mets, as he notably threw out Ronald Acuña Jr. twice in the Mets’ recent series in Atlanta. In 16 plate appearances with the team, he drove in three runs, but he hit just .143/.250/.143 with a 27 wRC+.",

        "description": "Climate change is accelerating the occurrence of mass fish die-offs in U.S. lakes — posing a significant threat to global food supplies, a new study has found.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo-called “fish kills” — in which large numbers of fish die suddenly —&nbsp;could become six times more common by the end of the century, according to the&nbsp;study, published this week in Limnology and Oceanography.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter studying more than 500 past summer die-offs in Minnesota and Wisconsin, researchers from the University of Arkansas devised an air and water temperature-based model to forecast the frequency of future such kills.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTheir models — which looked at a severe climate change scenario — predicted an approximately sixfold increase in fish kills by 2100 based on water temperature projections, while showing a 34-fold surge in mortality rates based on air temperature projections.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis means that if there were eight such incidents per year in the U.S. today, there would be 41 annually by the end of the century based on water temperature estimates, co-author Simon Tye said in a statement, describing projections as “more realistic” than the air-based estimates.\n\n\n\nClimate change is a particular threat because it is likely to turn normal high summer temperatures into occasional dangerous spikes — raising the chance of a lethal heat event, Tye noted.  \n\n\n\nSince fish are in many cases both predators and prey, the death of large numbers of fish can rapidly destabilize aquatic ecosystems, leading to sudden crises for species dependent on eating fish — including humans.\n\n\n\nWelcome to Equilibrium, a newsletter that tracks the growing global battle over the future of sustainability.

We'll also dive into new concerns around nuclear energy.\n\n\n\nWestern Dems to Biden: Shield public landscapes\n\n\n\nColorado Democrats urged President Biden in&nbsp;a letter&nbsp;on Friday to use his executive powers to&nbsp;preserve the historical legacy&nbsp;of key Rocky Mountain landscapes.\n\n\n\nThe politicians — Rep. Joe Neguse, Sen. Michael Bennet, Sen. John Hickenlooper and Gov. Jared Polis — asked the president to protect public spaces included in the&nbsp;Colorado Outdoor Recreation &amp; Economy (CORE) Act, which has repeatedly passed in the House of Representatives but failed to move forward in the Senate.\n\n\n\nHonoring history:&nbsp;Chief among their requests is the designation of Colorado’s Camp Hale and the Tenmile Range as the “Camp Hale - Continental Divide National Monument,” by means of the Antiquities Act.\n\n\n\nThe Camp Hale region was instrumental “in preparing the 10th Mountain Division for some of the most difficult moments of World War II,” according to the letter.Many veterans returned to establish Colorado’s outdoor recreation economy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEnding oil and gas leases:&nbsp;The politicians also urged the president to protect Colorado’s Thompson Divide — a 221,000-acre parcel of public land — through a Federal Lands Policy and Management Act mineral withdrawal.\n\n\n\nSuch a move would ban new oil and gas leasing, as well as mining, in the region.Farmers, ranchers and community members have all come together in support of this conservation measure, the politicians noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It is clear that Coloradans across the state support the conservation and preservation of these landscapes for future generations,” the letter stated.\n\n\n\nPreserving lands for future Coloradans:&nbsp;In their letter to the president, the Colorado politicians called for new protections to the areas proposed for wilderness designation, mineral withdrawal and special management.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“By taking these steps, you will be making sure that even more of Colorado’s open spaces will be preserved for future generations,” they wrote to Biden.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEquilibrium has reached out to the White House for comment but did not receive a response before press time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo read the full story, please click here.\n\n\n\nHazard designation proposed for two types of PFAS\n\n\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed to designate&nbsp;two types of “forever chemicals” as hazardous substances, our colleague Rachel Frazin reported for The Hill.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat are forever chemicals again?&nbsp;There are thousands of types of these cancer-linked compounds, also known as per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS).\n\n\n\nForever chemicals are notorious for their ability to linger in the human body and the environment.They’re present in a variety of products, including jet-fuel firefighting foam, nonstick pans and waterproof apparel.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat’s in the EPA proposal?&nbsp;The&nbsp;proposal&nbsp;focuses on the two most widely detected types of PFAS, known as PFOA and PFOS.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf finalized, the rule would declare these substances “hazardous” under the Superfund law.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCleaning up communities: Such a designation could help hold polluters responsible and accelerate cleanup processes in affected communities, Frazin reported.\n\n\n\nThe designation would allow the EPA to require the military or private company that contaminated a given area to clean it up.If the polluter refused to do so, the agency would have the power to recoup the costs.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWould the designation be effective?&nbsp;Betsy Southerland, a former official in the EPA’s Office of Water, told Frazin that the proposed designation would incentivize parties to quicken their cleanup efforts.\n\n\n\n“The whole idea behind a hazardous substance is that it can pose imminent and substantial endangerment so you really have to move out on it,” Southerland said.“And if you don’t, if you refuse to, EPA can do it and then sock you with a really big clean up bill,” she added.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIndustry does not agree:&nbsp;The American Chemistry Council — a chemical industry trade group — argued that the designation could result in significant costs for businesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“A proposed [hazardous substance] designation would impose tremendous costs on these parties without defined cleanup standards, making it impossible for these entities to prepare for the impact of this rule,” the organization said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo read the full story, please click here. \n\n\n\nAmid Ukraine worries, Japan turns on nuke plants\n\n\n\nJapan plans to restart its nuclear plants more than a decade after the Fukushima nuclear disaster, a move that comes amid fresh concerns over a recent near-meltdown at Europe's largest nuclear facility.\n\n\n\nJapanese prime minister Fumio Kishida announced this week that his country would&nbsp;restart its idled nuclear plants and consider building new ones, The Guardian reported.That could&nbsp;help lower prices in natural gas markets, International Energy Agency official Keisuke Sadamori told CNBC.\n\n\n\nThe country had idled its nuclear program after the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster, and started “burning a lot of fossil fuels in order to fill the gap from the lack of nuclear power,” Sadamori said.\n\n\n\nJapan’s announcement was “very good and encouraging news both in terms of energy supply security and climate change mitigation,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrading with Russia:&nbsp;Across the Sea of Japan, South Korea — one of the world’s biggest proponents of nuclear power —&nbsp;is partnering with a Russian company&nbsp;on a $2.25 billion plan to build Egypt's first nuclear plant, The Associated Press reported.\n\n\n\nEgypt’s new plant will be built on the Mediterranean coast about 80 miles northwest of Cairo, according to the AP.This was a large win for the country’s nuclear industry — but cut against American attempts to isolate Russia economically over its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nWhile Western countries have sanctioned much of Russian energy production since its invasion, that doesn’t extend to nuclear energy. \n\n\n\nHEIGHTENED CONCERNS\n\n\n\nA recent near-meltdown on Thursday night at Europe's largest nuclear facility is just one way that the fallout from Russia's invasion of Ukraine is leading to urgent questions around nuclear energy.\n\n\n\nKyiv is calling on the international community to pressure Russian troops to abandon the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant — Europe's largest — after the fighting&nbsp;cut off electricity between the plant and the national grid for several hours, as Reuters reported Friday morning.That meant a loss of power to cooling systems that keep the reactor from overheating&nbsp; — with a meltdown narrowly prevented by the operation of diesel generators, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky said in his nightly address.\n\n\n\nZelensky blamed Russian shelling for the disconnection; a Russian official blamed Ukrainian artillery.\n\n\n\nBack online:&nbsp;The Zaporizhzhia plant&nbsp;was reconnected to the Ukrainian electric grid&nbsp;on Friday, CNN reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the plant — which generates 20 percent of Ukraine’s electricity, isn’t out of the woods.\n\n\n\nWith the combination of “shelling around the station and the city, smoke from fires, dust from the ash dump of a thermal power plant,\" the \"situation sometimes looks like the end of the world.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRoulette wheel: \"The Russians are spinning the chamber of the revolver, threatening to blow out the brains of the reactor all over Europe,\" Yale national security expert Paul Bracken told Reuters. \n\n\n\nStates split over California gas car ban\n\n\n\nMassachusetts on Friday announced it would ban the sale of new gasoline-powered cars by 2035 — making it the latest state to sign on to a goal set earlier this week by California and Washington state.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCalifornia’s plan would mandate&nbsp;more than two-thirds of new vehicle&nbsp;sales by 2030 be zero-emission.But federal rules only call for 50 percent of new vehicle sales to be electric by that time.\n\n\n\n\"California had to go first according to federal law,&nbsp;and now states can piggyback on to the California rule, which Governor [Charlie] Baker (R) has pledged to do,” Larry Chretien of Green Energy Consumers Alliance told NBC Boston.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA conservative gauntlet:&nbsp;The move by liberal states to push state auto sellers toward zero-emission vehicles&nbsp;still has a major outstanding challenge&nbsp;— a lawsuit by 17 state attorneys general, as our colleague Zack Budryk reported in May.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublican leaders in states like Missouri argue that California&nbsp;is in effect setting transport policy for their own states, the Saint Louis Post-Dispatch reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We will continue to fight California’s efforts to impose their radical policies on the rest of the country,” a spokesperson for Missouri Attorney General Eric Schmitt (R) said this week.\n\n\n\nFollow-up Friday\n\n\n\nPakistan floods have already killed almost a thousand, drought persists in the Horn of Africa and Beijing tells farmers to trade rice for sweet potatoes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFloods in Pakistan have killed hundreds this summer\n\n\n\nPakistani officials said on Thursday that the country’s monsoons have&nbsp;impacted more than 30 million people&nbsp;in just a few weeks. On Friday, the country’s National Disaster Management Authority reported that&nbsp;more than 900 people had been killed&nbsp;by floods since June — including 34 individuals in the past 24 hours, the BBC reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGreater Horn of Africa bracing for fifth failed rainy season\n\n\n\nUNICEF revealed this week how&nbsp;children enduring drought in the Horn of Africa&nbsp;and the Sahel region are “one disease away from catastrophe.” On Friday, the World Meteorological Organization said that the Greater Horn of Africa region is preparing for its&nbsp;fifth consecutive failed rainy season&nbsp;— amid the region’s longest drought in 40 years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChina tells farmers to switch crops amid drought\n\n\n\nChina’s record heat wave is drying up rivers and crippling hydropower systems. Now the Beijing is calling on farmers in the most drought-afflicted areas to give up on their rice in favor of autumn crops like sweet potatoes, Reuters reported. \"We can't switch to other crops because there's no land,\" one elderly farmer told Reuters.\n\n\n\nPlease visit The Hill’s Sustainability section online for the web version of this newsletter and more stories.

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nU.S. Senator Ron Johnson recently said that parents should have the primary role in their children’s education.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJohnson made the comments during an interview with FOX News Digital at the Wisconsin State Fair earlier this month.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhe comment comes after numerous “parental rights” or “curriculum transparency” bills have been introduced into state legislatures.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nParents should have a “primary” role in their children’s education, according to U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R) of Wisconsin.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJohnson made the comment during an interview with Fox News Digital at the Wisconsin State Fair earlier this month, the outlet reported.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Parents’ role in education should be primary,” Johnson told Fox New Digital. “They should have control over what is taught to their children.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJohnson’s comment is another example of the growing momentum by conservative lawmakers to push for “parental rights” in public schools.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the last year, conservative lawmakers have launched a new campaign to remove things from the classroom deemed offensive, arguing that parents have the right to know what their children are being taught.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMost of the materials targeted by “parental rights” or “curriculum transparency” bills require teachers to upload their&nbsp;reading lists or class materials online or otherwise available for public review, in most cases in order to scrutinize the use of materials that covers critical race theory and experiences of the LGBTQ+ community.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the past year, curriculum transparency bills have been pre-filed or introduced in at least 35 states, according to The74.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe conservative senator is no stranger to polarizing comments, like claiming it is not “society’s responsibility” to take care of “other people’s children” or that that pandemic overcrowding in Wisconsin hospitals was no worse than what would happen&nbsp;during a bad flu season.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJohnson has also pushed false claims about the 2020 election.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe senator most recently came under fire after it was revealed that a top aid tried to give fake, pro-Trump electors from Michigan and Wisconsin to former vice president Mike Pence shortly before he began to count electoral votes on Jan. 6 of last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJohnson’s office has yet to respond to a request for clarification from Changing America.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

Bob Casey (D-Pa.) is pushing the Department of Labor to investigate surveillance technology used by companies to track their employees’ performance and productivity. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, we'll look at&nbsp;Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg's comments this week spoke to podcaster Joe Rogan about Facebook limiting stories related to the New York Post story about President Biden’s son Hunter Biden and his laptop after warnings from the FBI.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is Hillicon Valley, detailing all you need to know about tech and cyber news from Capitol Hill to Silicon Valley. Send tips to The Hill’s Rebecca Klar and Ines Kagubare. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSenator urges Labor to monitor invasive tech\n\n\n\nSen. Bob Casey&nbsp;(D-Pa.), a member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, is urging the Department of Labor to monitor and regulate how companies are using invasive technology to monitor their employees during work hours.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a letter&nbsp;addressed to Labor Secretary Marty Walsh, Casey called for the agency to push for more oversight, accountability and transparency on how these surveillance technologies are being used in the workplace and how they are impacting workers’ privacy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The implementation of novel technologies to track, monitor, manage and discipline workers is growing due to an imbalance of power in the workplace and a lack of legal protections or regulatory restrictions on these behaviors,” Casey said in the letter.&nbsp;“Without oversight, more and more intrusive technologies will be implemented in the workplace,” he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCasey listed examples of how employees are constantly monitored and sometimes punished or fired for low productivity scores that are based on algorithms and automated systems which have “little or no meaningful human oversight.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZuckerberg on the Hunter Biden story  \n\n\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg this week told popular podcaster Joe Rogan that Facebook did limit stories on the news feed related to the New York Post story about President Biden’s son Hunter Biden and his laptop after warnings from the FBI, but defended the law enforcement agency as a “legitimate institution.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZuckerberg said on an episode of Rogan’s podcast, “The Joe Rogan Experience,” that was uploaded on Thursday that the FBI reached out to his company ahead of the 2020 presidential election to warn them to take note of potentially polarizing content.This warning came after Russia used social media platforms, including Facebook, to post content intended to be polarizing ahead of the 2016 election.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZuckerberg said he took the warning seriously. He said the social media platform did not ban people from sharing the Post’s story, but it took action to limit how often the story appeared on feeds.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"None of this is new. Mark testified before the Senate nearly two years ago that in the lead up to the 2020 election, the FBI warned about the threat of foreign hack and leak operations,\" Meta tweeted Thursday amid wide attention to Zuckerberg's remarks.\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLASTPASS SAYS IT WAS HACKED \n\n\n\nThe CEO of password-manager company LastPass said Thursday that it was was recently hacked, but the company sees no evidence the incident exposed any customer data or passwords.&nbsp;&nbsp;“We have determined that an unauthorized party gained access to portions of the LastPass development environment through a single compromised developer account and took portions of source code and some proprietary LastPass technical information,” CEO Karim Toubba&nbsp;wrote in a letter to customers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe software allows users to store their passwords for various accounts and websites in a “vault” that can be unlocked with a singular master password, also providing customers with auto-generated passwords designed to be hard to guess.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBITS &amp; PIECES\n\n\n\nAn op-ed to chew on: China’s property market is on the brink.

        "description": "Caution signs are yellow, and so is much of this week’s “Community Level” assessment map from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention — at least for Minnesota. In addition, while this week’s data on case rates and wastewater are mostly continuing on a high plateau, COVID-related hospitalizations increased a bit over the past week. COVID-related deaths, meanwhile, are trending down after a peak in July.With tens of thousands of Minnesotans getting together daily at the State Fair, and millions of students returning to school in the near future, we wish that the data showed vanishing COVID-19 risks. But, as the graphs and maps below continue to show, that is not the case.3 things to know:1) Hospital bed use is on the rise, even as deaths are falling.2) Latest wastewater data shows small weekly increase in Twin Cities and recent decreases in some areas of greater Minnesota where COVID had been increasing.3) The CDCs weekly “Community Level” COVID-19 risk assessment puts most Minnesotans in a “medium” category.Plus a dive into the economic impact of long COVID, and how many Minnesotans have been affected by it.Hospital bed use is on the rise, even as deaths are fallingIt feels like we’ve been talking about a COVID plateau for ages now, but this time we really mean it. Weekly cases by region show a remarkable lack of change over the past six weeks, even if there are some ups and downs week-to-week.Cases across Minnesota have continued to stay constant. David MontgomeryHospital admissions, though, have been slowly creeping up in recent weeks.Hospitalizations have been creeping up in recent weeks.David MontgomeryAnd looking at COVID-19 hospital bed use shows a clear upward trend among patients with COVID-19 in non-ICU beds. The non-ICU bed usage is just a bit higher than this time last year, when the delta variant was taking off.Intensive Care Unit bed usage is, however, substantially lower than in 2020 or 2021.Non-ICU bed usage for patients with COVID-19 has been on the rise.David MontgomeryDespite the increase in hospitalizations, fewer people are now dying from COVID each day than was the case in July.Deaths have fallen in recent weeks after a relative peak in July.David MontgomeryWastewater: Mostly stagnantAs usual, the most timely wastewater analysis comes from the Metropolitan Council’s on-going collaboration with the University of Minnesota’s Genomic Center. Their analysis of wastewater from the state’s single largest treatment plant, the Metro plant serving nearly 2 million people, shows a 4 percent week-over-week increase in COVID levels for the week ending Aug. 22.This follows weeks of similarly small declines, leaving us with yet another trend line that looks like a bumpy plateau. As we have noted in the past, this plateau is relatively high, with COVID levels similar to those measured during November in last fall’s wave. We are, however, no longer dealing with the delta variant that was dominant at that time, but rather omicron subvariant BA.5.COVID-19 levels measured in at the Metro wastewater treatment plant in St. Paul, Minnesota.David H. Montgomery | MPR NewsThe latest data out of the University of Minnesota’s Wastewater SARS-CoV2 Surveillance Study, through Aug. 14, shows slight monthly and weekly decreases in a more broadly defined Twin Cities Metro region (sampling 13 wastewater treatment plants collectively serving 2.8 million people).Thankfully the climbing levels of COVID-19 evident in last week’s data from the North West, North East and South West regions appear to be turning the corner. But the increasing levels still show up in this week’s monthly change column, and we will have to wait and see if the most recent weekly decline holds.The only region in the study showing both monthly and weekly increases is the South East, which includes samples from treatment plants located in Dakota, Fillmore, Freeborn, Olmsted and Winona counties. Fortunately, those increases are only in the single digits, and the case count data shown above shows southeastern Minnesota cases holding steady.CDC to most Minnesotans: Proceed with cautionLast week we noted that the CDC had ratcheted up the warning level to medium risk for the entire Twin Cities region on the eve of the State Fair, and now we can confirm that the same level of concern has expanded to additional counties: 51, up from 25 last week.A few of those are downgrades from high ratings, which are now in effect for 13 counties instead of last week’s 18. For example, Olmsted County, which the CDC has often rated as high risk, has been downgraded from orange to yellow. But more counties turned from green to yellow; 44 were rated low risk last week, but only 23 this week.The CDC’s “Community Level” map takes into account both COVID-19 case rates and hospitalizations. Looking only at the latest weekly case rates, all but six of Minnesota’s counties meet the CDC’s threshold for high transmission (100+ weekly cases per 100,000 residents). Central Minnesota’s Todd County once again has the state’s highest rate, with over 400 officially reported cases per 100,000 for the week ending Aug. 24. Weekly case rates in Stevens, Chippewa, Watonwan and Wadena counties all exceed 300.Survey Says: Minnesota’s long COVID rates are below national averageA new study out this week from the Brookings Institute estimates that about 3 million full-time equivalent workers in the U.S. are currently out of the labor market due to long COVID. The report uses an average weekly wage of $1,106 to translate that into $168 billion a year in lost earnings.Katie Bach, the report author, notes that this estimate doesn’t include the full economic burden of COVID. Other impacts include lower productivity of people working while ill, the significant health care costs patients incur, and the lost productivity of caretakers, she writes.The Brookings Institute bases part of its study on the results from the Census Bureau’s Household Pulse Survey, which started asking questions about post-COVID conditions in June. That data is available  by state, and defines long COVID as having had COVID with symptoms that lasted three months or longer.The latest data, from the Pulse Survey conducted in late July/early August, shows that Minnesotans overall have fared better than the national average in terms of percentage of the population that has or is experiencing long COVID symptoms: Around 14.8% of Americans, and 13.2% of Minnesotans, have said they have ever experienced long COVID symptoms. Pennsylvania has the lowest percentage of this metric, at 8.8%, and South Dakota has the highest, at 19.6%. Around 7.6% of Americans, and 6.3% of Minnesotans, have said they are currently experiencing long COVID symptoms. Pennsylvania also has the lowest percentage of this metric, at 4.3%, and Iowa has the highest, at 11.3% (Alabama comes in at a very close second, at 11.2%).Minnesota seems to be doing particularly well on long COVID compared to neighboring states. See maps below for more.These survey results provide one indication of the prevalence of long COVID, but estimating how many people have had long COVID is a debated topic in the scientific community, with the estimates ranging from five to 50 percent depending on how it’s defined. Despite this wide range, experts have noted that the take-home point should be that a substantial percentage of the population seems to be affected, and that it’s a real problem.How can the impact of long COVID be improved? The Brookings report details five policy actions that they think could make a difference: better prevention and treatment options, expanded paid sick leave, improved workplace accommodations, wider access to disability insurance and enhanced data collection on long COVID’s economic effects.Not getting long COVID in the first place will probably help the most, although estimates of how well vaccines may help prevent long COVID are uncertain. Recent studies suggest that people can reduce their risk of long COVID by anywhere from 15 to 50 percent by getting vaccinated. Not getting COVID at all, of course, is your best bet.",

To create a spot on the 40-man roster, San Francisco recalled left-hander Sam Long from the minors and placed him on the major league 60-day injured list.\nAlexander is up for the first time as a Giant. The 33-year-old is no stranger to the NL West, having spent the 2018-21 campaigns with the archrival Dodgers. He was a solid situational piece for L.A. skipper Dave Roberts, posting a 3.49 ERA across 111 frames. The sinkerballer only struck out 17.7% of opposing hitters over that stretch, but only Zack Britton and Aaron Bummer had a ground-ball rate superior to Alexander&#8217;s 67.5% clip (among relievers with 100+ innings). He held left-handed opponents to a woeful .196/.262/.312 line in 122 plate appearances over that stretch.\nUnfortunately, Alexander was also no stranger to the injured list. He lost a good chunk of the 2019 season with forearm inflammation, and he spent most of last year on the IL with a shoulder injury. The Dodgers waived him at the end of last season, and he remained a free agent until signing a minor league deal with San Francisco in March. He&#8217;s spent the majority of this year on the IL as well, only reporting to Sacramento three weeks ago. After 7 2/3 scoreless innings over seven games there, Alexander makes his return to the major leagues.\nLong recently suffered a right oblique strain in Triple-A, according to his transactions log at MLB.com. His 2022 season comes to an end after 28 MLB appearances and eight outings in Sacramento. The swingman worked to a 3.61 ERA over 42 1/3 innings at the MLB level, albeit with a modest 18.2% strikeout rate. He&#8217;ll be paid at the prorated $700K league minimum rate for the rest of the season and collect big league service time for the next five weeks.\n @Drew_Smitty first reported Alexander&#8217;s forthcoming promotion yesterday.",

        "description": "Poor results and speculation around his best players see the manager point to ‘expectations not aligned with our finances’Leicester are in a peculiar place; a strange stasis whereby they are desperate not to sell their best players but are acutely aware that without doing so they risk a season of stagnation; an awkward spot where the squad is undeniably weaker than the one that finished eighth in an ultimately disappointing last campaign; an unforgiving world in which a winless start means it is easy to feel as if the walls are caving in at the King Power Stadium. And a situation where supporters – even if only a minority – are happy to join opposition fans in sarcastically chanting about the manager, who led the team to a European semi-final at the Stadio Olimpico in May and to lifting the FA Cup for the first time 12 months earlier, being sacked in the morning.At least Brendan Rodgers was able to grin and bear it when those songs from the stands at Edgeley Park, where Leicester squeezed past Stockport on penalties in the Carabao Cup second round on Tuesday, were put to him this week.

Lazio had two great chances through their captain Ciro Immobile and a third from striker Mattia Zaccagni before Anderson, who had been perfectly set up by Sergej Milinkovic-Savic, put the hosts ahead with a 40th-minute header at the Stadio Olimpico.The visitors equalised from a free-kick as the defender Denzel Dumfries nodded the ball to the unmarked Lautaro Martínez who netted from close range in the 51st minute. A minute later, Inter went close to taking the lead when Dumfries got his head to Federico Dimarco’s high cross and sent the ball bouncing off the ground just in front of the Lazio goalkeeper Ivan Provedel, who managed to tip it over the bar.

        "description": "&#8220;Do unshed tears wait in little lakes?&#8221;\n\n“To lose the appetite for meaning we call thinking and cease to ask unanswerable questions,&#8221; Hannah Arendt wrote in her superb meditation on the life of the mind, would mean to &#8220;lose not only the ability to produce those thought-things that we call works of art but also the capacity to ask all the answerable questions upon which every civilization is founded.”\nBut our questions, besides having the power to civilize us, also have the power &#8212; perhaps even more needed today &#8212; to rewild us. \nOften, our deepest questions are our simplest ones, and our wildest questions &#8212; the most maddeningly unanswerable ones &#8212; are our most resaning, most redolent with meaning. This is why children&#8217;s questions are so often portals to the profoundest answers.\nPablo Neruda (July 12, 1904&ndash;September 23, 1973) channeled 320 such questions &#8212; questions earthly and cosmic about art and life, dreams and death, nature and human nature; magical-realist questions that could have been asked by a child or a sage &#8212; into his final work of poetry, originally published months before his sudden death. \n\n\nHis Book of Questions (public library) now comes alive in a stunning bilingual picture-book, illustrated by Chilean artist Paloma Valdivia, whose father grew up in the same coastal region that shaped Neruda&#8217;s boyhood and whose grandmother was friends with Neruda&#8217;s sister.\n\n\nOf Neruda&#8217;s original questions &#8212; each of them unanswerable, all of them worth asking, crackling with some vital spark of playfulness or poignancy &#8212; seventy come ablaze amid the vibrant illustrations and fold-out delights, radiant with the colors and textures of Latin American tapestry. \n\n\n\n\n\nOut of the totality arises a larger sense of reckoning &#8212; a person of uncommon soulfulness and sensitivity to the subterranean strata of life, approaching the end of his days with a cascade of curiosity, singing the ultimate question: What is all this? \nWhat emerges is the abstract, lyrical counterpart to the questions of meaning Tolstoy faced at the end of his own days.\n\n\nWhy do trees hide\nthe splendor of their roots?\nGiven Valdivia&#8217;s roots and her personal resonance with Neruda, many of the illustrated questions are chosen for and filtered through the lens of landscape and its ecosystems. \nSome are laced with the abstract wonderment of astronomy. \n\n\nMany are aimed at bodies of water, evocative of poet, painter, and philosopher Etel Adnan&#8217;s sublime meditation on the sea and the soul.\n\n\n\nWhy do the waves ask me\nthe same questions I ask them?\nSome both sting and salve with their almost unbearable soulfulness:\nDo unshed tears\nwait in little lakes?\nSome break us free from the solitary confinement of our own consciousness:\nIs 4, 4 for everyone?\nAre all sevens the same?\n\n\nThree and a half centuries after Kepler composed his Harmony of the World, envisioning the Earth as an ensouled body that breathes and sounds &#8212; a vision that landed his mother in a witchcraft trial &#8212; and a century after Ernst Haeckel birthed the notion of ecology, Neruda asks:\nDoes the earth chirp like a cricket\nin the symphony of the skies?\n\n\n\nValdivia reflects in her artist&#8217;s afterword:\nIllustrating these poems was like deciphering a map of the poet, exploring the territories of his words, looking for meanings in his houses and among his collections, tracing symbolic pathways &#8212; only to arrive at understanding, after five years of creative labor, that there are no answers, only more questions arising from Neruda&#8217;s questions.\n\n\nComplement the paper-cast enchantment that is this Book of Questions with Neruda&#8217;s love letter to the forest, his ode to silence, his stirring Nobel Prize acceptance speech, and a lovely picture-book about his life, then revisit artist Margaret C. Cook&#8217;s stunning century-old illustrations for Walt Whitman&#8217;s Leaves of Grass.\nIllustrations courtesy of Enchanted Lion Books; photographs by Maria Popova\ndonating = lovingFor a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

        "description": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday announced nearly $50 million in grants for assault survivors to obtain legal services.\n\n\n\nThe department’s Office on Violence Against Women (OVW) will distribute the money to survivors of sexual assault, domestic violence, dating violence and stalking to help cover legal fees and “improve effective coordination of justice systems impacting victim and family safety.”\n\n\n\n“These grants will help expand access to the services and support that are essential to bringing justice within reach for survivors of gender-based violence,” Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement with the announcement.\n\n\n\n“The Department’s Office on Violence Against Women will continue its important work to empower survivors with the resources they need to navigate our justice system, including by expanding access to legal representation, language assistance, and court-related programs.”\n\n\n\nThe $49.85 million in grants is divided by the OVW between the legal assistance for victims program, which was awarded $35.7 million, and the justice for families program, awarded $14.2 million.\n\n\n\nThe legal assistance for victims program encompasses 59 grantees that directly aid survivors with pro bono legal services.\n\n\n\n“Legal services and systems, including family courts, have a tremendous impact on survivors’ and their families’ livelihood, wellbeing, and freedom,” OVW Acting Director Allison Randall said of the grant announcement.\n\n\n\nShe added: “Grantees under OVW’s Legal Assistance for Victims and Justice for Families Programs help survivors navigate complicated processes and potentially dangerous points along the way, including supervised visitation, protection orders, and divorce.”\n\n\n\nThe justice for families program consists of 26 projects focused on bolstering justice system responses to families with a history of domestic violence and supporting “supervised visitation and safe exchange of children.”\n\n\n\nFunds are also given to court-related programs and training programs for relevant officials, including court personnel and child protective services workers.\n\n\n\nThe DOJ announced an additional $35.7 million in grants through the OVW last week, which will be awarded to all 50 states, five U.S. territories and the District of Columbia to fund direct intervention services for sexual assault.\n\n\n\nThe department announced its new grants shortly after the conclusion of the National Sexual Assault Conference, an annual meeting on sexual assault prevention that occurred last week.",

        "description": "The chairman of the Federal Reserve had a stark warning: The central bank will keep hiking rates to fight inflation, and no one is going to like how it feels. We’ll also look at the evolving price tag of President Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan and a welcome decline in inflation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut first, check out the most popular potential 2024 presidential candidate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelcome to On The Money, your nightly guide to everything affecting your bills, bank account and bottom line. For The Hill, we’re Sylvan Lane, Aris Folley and Karl Evers-Hillstrom. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFed chief says there’s no end in sight for rate hikes \n\n\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said Friday the central bank will lean into interest rates meant to restrict the economy until inflation steadily declines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSpeaking at the Fed’s annual policy summit in Jackson Hole, Wyo., the Fed chief said the bank will keep taking “forceful and rapid” steps to curb price growth even though it could cause higher unemployment and a recession. \n\n\n\n“While higher interest rates, slower growth and softer labor market conditions will bring down inflation, they will also bring some pain to households and businesses,” Powell said Friday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These are the unfortunate costs of reducing inflation. But a failure to restore price stability would mean far greater pain,” he continued.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe background: Powell’s speech comes as the Fed races to bring inflation down from levels last reached during the 1980s. Annual inflation as measured by personal consumption expenditures (PCE) index, the Fed’s preferred inflation gauge, was6.3 percent in July — more than three times the Fed’s target of 2 percent.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Fed has already raised its baseline interest rate range from a span of 0 to 0.25 percent in March to 2.25 to 2.5 percent as of July, hiking borrowing costs at a historically rapid pace.&nbsp;&nbsp;Powell did not specify whether the Fed’s monetary policy panel will raise rates by 0.75 percentage points for the third consecutive meeting at its meeting in September, or if it would opt for a smaller 0.5 percentage point hike. But he made clear the Fed will keep hiking rates and leave them at levels intended to slow the economy enough to curb price growth.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“History shows that the employment costs of bringing down inflation are likely to increase with delay, as high inflation becomes more entrenched in wage and price setting,” Powell said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Our aim is to avoid that outcome by acting with resolve now,” he continued.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSylvan has more here.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more: Consumer prices fell, incomes rose in July as inflation eases \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOUCH\n\n\n\nDow drops 1,000 points following Powell speech at Jackson Hole&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStocks closed sharply down on Friday following comments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell that the Fed will press forward with raising interest rates amid lingering inflation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 1,000 points, while the Nasdaq composite dropped almost 500 points. The S&amp;P 500 dropped by more than 140 points.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAll three declines meant a more than 3 percent drop. All are still slightly above their levels a month ago, but much of their gains in that time were erased on Friday.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCRUNCHING NUMBERS\n\n\n\nWhite House estimates student loan plan to cost $240B&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House on Friday offered a cost estimate for President Biden’s student loan forgiveness plan, saying it would cost $24 billion annually over 10 years, or$240 billion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDeputy Director of the White House National Economic Council Bharat Ramamurti told reporters at a White House briefing that the estimate assumed that 75 percent of those eligible for the student loan relief would take advantage of it.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House estimate is significantly lower than other outside estimates, and comes after administration officials for days declined to offer a precise figure amid criticisms from Republicans and some Democrats about the potential for the relief plans to exacerbate inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An analysis released by the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business estimated that the cost of Biden’s changes to student loans could balloon to $1 trillion over the next decade.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Morgan Chalfant breaks it down here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGREEN SCREEN\n\n\n\nGOP targets powerhouse Wall Street firms over investments meant to fight climate change&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublicans are fighting against a social movement in the financial sector meant to address systemic issues like climate change.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGovernmental initiatives in Florida, West Virginia and Texas are targeting powerhouse Wall Street firms that they say are engaging in environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, which they view to be harmful to their states’ economies.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe letter to Blackrock requested “all documents and communications relating to the actual or potential effects of ESG integration practices on the financial outlook, risk/return profile, performance, or profitability of any of your funds, portfolio companies, or institutional accounts of ESG integration practices.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile ESG doesn’t have a hard and fast definition, it generally aligns with the United Nations’s sustainable development goals (SDGs), a massive international program of environmental and social equality objectives agreed to by all of the U.N.’s 193 member states, including the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Tobias Burns digs in here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood to Know\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration announced a historic student debt forgiveness plan for eligible borrowers, but the Education Department has multiple other options for borrowers that also offer loan forgiveness.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere’s what else have our eye on:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Bob Casey (D-Pa.), a member of the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, is urging the Department of Labor to regulate how companies are using invasive technology to monitor their employees during work hours. Liberal lawmakers are pressing Democratic leaders in the House to not include a side deal undercutting environmental reviews worked out with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in a short-term measure funding the government.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for today. Thanks for reading and check out The Hill’s Finance page for the latest news and coverage. We’ll see you next week. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIEW FULL VERSION HERE",

Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.).\n\n\n\nThe Senate Leadership Fund called off its advertisement reservations that were set to air in Arizona between Sept. 6 and Oct. 3, according to AdImpact.\n\n\n\nThe cancellation totaled about $8 million, according to Politico, which is roughly half of what the PAC had initially planned to run in the Grand Canyon State. Advertisements from the group are now set to begin in the beginning of October instead of early fall.\n\n\n\nThe decrease in advertising money comes as Republican Senate nominee Blake Masters continues to struggle in his bid against Kelly, who remains ahead in FiveThirtyEight’s average of polls, 50.3 percent to 42 percent.\n\n\n\nFormer President Trump and GOP megadonor Peter Thiel both support Masters’s candidacy, but other Republicans feared he would be a weaker opponent to Kelly.\n\n\n\nSenate Leadership Fund President Steven Law said the change was in part due to the $28 million ad buy the PAC made in Ohio last week to bolster Republican nominee J.D. Vance, who is running against Rep. Tim Ryan (D) for the seat being vacated by retiring Sen. Rob Portman (R).\n\n\n\nRyan and Vance appear to be in a close race in Ohio, a state the GOP had hoped would be more safely in its grasp.\n\n\n\n“We’re leaving the door wide open in Arizona, but we want to move additional resources to other offensive opportunities that have become increasingly competitive, as well as an unexpected expense in Ohio,” Law told Politico.\n\n\n\n“We think the fundamentals of this election strongly favor Republicans, we see multiple paths to winning the majority, and we are going to invest heavily and strategically to achieve that goal,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe super PAC is also slashing advertising in Alaska, where Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) is running for reelection, according to Politico. The incumbent advanced to the general election, along with Trump-backed candidate Kelly Tshibaka.\n\n\n\nMurkowski secured roughly 44 percent of the vote, while Tshibaka won 39 percent support.\n\n\n\nThe advertising dollar decrease in Alaska — roughly $1.7 million, according to Politico —&nbsp;is a sign that the party is confident with the incumbent’s odds, Law said. The super PAC’s ads supporting the candidate are set to begin on Sept. 20.\n\n\n\n“We are all-in for Senator Murkowski. Senator Murkowski is in a very strong position and based on that decided to push back our start date,” Law told Politico.\n\n\n\nThe shift in advertisement funding comes as odds of flipping the Senate red in November appear to be diminishing.\n\n\n\nIn Kentucky last week, McConnell told reporters Republicans had a better chance of winning control of the House than the Senate, pointing to “candidate quality” — a veiled reference to Masters, Vance and Trump-backed nominees in Pennsylvania and Georgia.\n\n\n\n“I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different — they’re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” McConnell said when asked about his midterm expectations.\n\n\n\n“Right now, we have a 50-50 Senate and a 50-50 country, but I think when all is said and done this fall, we’re likely to have an extremely close Senate, either our side up slightly or their side up slightly,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe statement was a stark contrast to McConnell’s comments in November, when he said the midterm races would be “very good” for Republicans.\n\n\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight, Democrats are favored to win control of the upper chamber over Republicans, 65 percent to 35 percent.",

        "description": "Don’t forget to apply sunscreen when you head out to enjoy the Minnesota State Fair.Minnesota ranked third among states with the highest rate of melanoma, one form of skin cancer, according to a study released last month by QuoteWizard. From 2015-2019, 35 skin cancer cases were reported in Minnesota for every 100,000 people — a whopping 13 percent increase in cases from 2015-2019.Comparatively, Utah, ranked No. 1 in skin cancer cases per 100,000 population with 41, and Vermont, ranked 2 with 37, had lower increases over the same period: Utah saw an 8 percent increase and Vermont experienced a 1 percent rise in cases.More concerning news for Minnesota and skin cancer, according to the Centers for Disease Control: In 2019, the number of skin cancer cases per 100,000 population inched up to 36.The states with the lowest rates include Texas (50), Alaska (49) and New Mexico (48). Cooler states have nearly triple the skin cancer cases than warmer states, QuoteWizard noted, attributing that trend due to sunnier state residents “doing a better job of protecting themselves from the sun by applying sunscreen, wearing protective clothing and avoiding severe sunburns.”If it does slip your mind to slather on the SPF, the health care professionals at the fair’s Free Skin Cancer Screenings Tent will remind you on Saturday of the importance of sunscreen as well as provide other skin health tips to visitors.M Health Fairview and the University of Minnesota Masonic Cancer Center will administer free skin cancer checks Saturday to the public from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. Dermatologists and University of Minnesota Medical School residents will be on hand to conduct the screenings and answer questions from interested parties.They will also alert visitors to any concerning skin issues found during the screening that should be followed up on with their medical provider. Although the screenings end at 3 p.m., the tent will remain open to 9 p.m. with medical residents providing sun safety information and handing out product giveaways.  Dr. Ingrid Polcari, with the U of M medical school, M Health Fairview and the Masonic Cancer Center defined the most common cell skin cancers as basal cell and squamous cell, both are often curable with surgery, but rarely spread. Melanoma is a less common skin cancer, “but it’s the most dangerous and can be deadly if it’s not detected early,” Polcari said in an interview on the medical school’s website.The dermatologist urged preventative measures such as wearing a wide-brimmed hat to protect your scalp and ears, and sunglasses to protect your eyes; sunscreen with an SPF 30 or higher that is labeled “broad-spectrum.” Sensitive skin types should choose products with zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, she said.The skin cancer screening tent, with four private screening areas, is located on the fairgrounds at Underwood Street and Wright Avenue.",

        "description": "The Angels announced a host of roster moves before tonight&#8217;s series in Toronto. Relievers Aaron Loup and Ryan Tepera and outfielder Taylor Ward were all placed on the restricted list. That&#8217;s standard procedure for players who haven&#8217;t been vaccinated against COVID-19 and are thus prohibited from traveling into Canada. In order to replace them on the roster, the Halos recalled righty José Marte and selected the contracts of reliever Gerardo Reyes and outfielder Ryan Aguilar. All three players have been designated as &#8220;substitutes,&#8221; meaning they can later be taken off the roster and returned to the minor leagues without passing through waivers.\nIt&#8217;s likely to be a temporary promotion for that trio, but Reyes and Aguilar have long-awaited opportunities to make an impact at the major league level. Reyes has a bit of big league experience, having come out of the bullpen 27 times for the 2019 Padres. The right-hander posted a 7.62 ERA over 26 innings. He spent 2020 at the alternate training site and was dealt from San Diego to Anaheim that deadline in exchange for veteran catcher Jason Castro.\nReyes was outrighted off the 40-man roster last March and underwent Tommy John surgery not long after, but he&#8217;s returned to action in Salt Lake this season. Through 39 innings with the Bees, the 29-year-old has a 3.69 ERA. He&#8217;s punched out an above-average 29.2% of opposing hitters but issued walks at an elevated 15.7% clip.\nAguilar, meanwhile, could get a chance to make his MLB debut. A 31st round pick of the Brewers out of the University of Arizona in 2016, he remained in the Milwaukee farm system through the end of last season. The 27-year-old signed a minor league deal with the Halos over the offseason and has spent the year at Double-A Rocket City. He&#8217;s posted an excellent .280/.427/.517 line with a massive 19% walk rate (albeit against generally younger competition) to earn a big league call. A left-handed hitter, he&#8217;s played primarily right field with the Trash Pandas.\nLoup, Tepera and Ward will miss the weekend series. They&#8217;ll presumably rejoin the club on Monday, when they return home to host the Yankees. Sam Blum of the Athletic tweets that hitting coach Jeremy Reed also did not make the trip to Toronto.",

        "description": "Crowds came from far and wide. Photographs by Anna Mejorada.\nBy Anna Mejorada\nOn this sunny Friday morning, a crowd of New Yorkers of all ages, and several canines, waited in anticipation in Riverside Park at West 120th Street to hear if their candidate had been elected.\n“Yes, voting is important, but voting for the goats is more fun than voting for elected officials,” quipped Gale Brewer, New York City Council Member for the Upper West Side.\nTwo winners, Chech and City Councilmember Gale Brewer.\nFour votes were all that stood between 1st and 2nd place in this year’s Riverside’s Go(a)t Talent competition held by the Riverside Park Conservancy.\nBefore revealing the results, Whitney Dearden, the Conservancy’s Director of Public Programming, offered the crowd a bit of comfort, “Don’t feel bad for the runners up, they will all be given a weed bouquet.”\nFourth place was awarded to Big G who graciously accepted his prize.\nElenor has a beard.\nIn 3rd came Elenor who broke free from her handler when her name was called and proudly strutted in front of her fans.\nNext came the moment everyone was waiting for: the top two, Skittles and Cheech, were summoned to the front for the big reveal. Then Deardon proclaimed, “The Riverside Park 2022 Greatest of All Time Winner this year is… CHEECH!&#8221; and the crowd erupted with cheers!\nStruttin&#8217; his stuff.\nThe goats are now on their way back to join their friends—roughly 200 goats—at their home-base farm in Rhinebeck, New York. The internship that brought them to Riverside Park came to an end earlier than expected because the foursome was too good at their jobs. “They goat the job done,” declared Deardon. The goats ate through their allotment of non-native plants and pesky poison ivy at a faster rate than anticipated, an estimated 6,000 pounds of vegetation since they arrived at the end of June.\nThe Conservancy is working with their conservation partners to determine whether the goats will be back next summer, but their adoring fans definitely want them back.\nCheech and Elenor with their handlers.\n“I love goats! I bottle fed goats when I was a little girl and I’ve been obsessed with them ever since,” exclaimed Deena Schmitz, who lives on the Upper East Side. “I always come over here for the goats!” She also highly recommends using soap made with goat’s milk.\n“They are so sweet and docile,” shared Heather Stahl, who lives near Riverside Park and volunteered this summer, along with one of her teenagers, to wrangle the goats into their sleeping quarters at the end of the day. She first found out about the goats in Riverside Park after spotting another fan sporting some Riverside Park Conservancy Go(a)tham merch last summer. “It’s such a cool thing to do and you get to meet other like-minded goat lovers. It was a real highlight of my summer!”\nFun Fact: Elenor and Big G are LaMancha goats and do not have horns, and Cheech and Skittles are Alpine goats and do have horns.",

        "description": "New York state Assemblywoman Yuh-Line Niou (D) is mulling a run for the U.S. House as a member of the Working Families Party after she lost the Democratic primary for the Empire State’s 10th Congressional District this week.\n\n\n\nNiou fell short in Tuesday’s Democratic primary for the district to Dan Goldman, an attorney who served as the lead counsel during former President Trump’s first impeachment trial. Goldman secured 25.8 percent of the vote, while Niou raked in 23.7 percent.\n\n\n\nRep. Mondaire Jones (D-N.Y.), who decided to run in the 10th District after redistricting, won 18.2 percent of the vote.\n\n\n\nBut days after narrowly losing the contest in the Big Apple, Niou is thinking about jumping back into the race —&nbsp;this time as a candidate from the Working Families Party.\n\n\n\n“I’m currently speaking with WFP and my community about how we can best represent the needs of this district. Because what we can do together is too important to give up this fight, we must count every vote,” Niou told The Hill in a statement on Friday.\n\n\n\n“I’m so grateful for the outpouring of support and all of the people who showed up and turned out. Our people need and deserve a voice,” she added.\n\n\n\nThe progressive Working Families Party endorsed Niou in the Democratic primary in June. The party's New York state director, Sochie Nnaemeka, in a statement on Twitter said the assemblywoman would “put the needs of everyday New Yorkers before the whims of billionaires and special interests.”\n\n\n\nMajor outlets have called the race for Goldman — with more than 95 percent of the vote in, he is leading Niou by upwards of 1,300 votes — but the assemblywoman has not yet conceded. As of Thursday, roughly 600 absentee ballots remained to be tallied, according to The Washington Post.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Niou wrote on Twitter, “We’re going to keep working until every vote is counted,” teasing at the end “More to come soon!”\n\n\n\nNiou and Jones campaigned together towards the end of the Democratic primary campaign in an attempt to counter Goldman, an heir to Levi Strauss &amp; Co. who invested millions of dollars of his personal wealth into his campaign. He secured the coveted New York Times endorsement.\n\n\n\n“We can’t let a candidate so out of step with this district’s values buy themselves a congressional seat,” Niou said, according to Spectrum News NY1.\n\n\n\nGoldman shot back, asserting, “I think what the voters recognize is that my progressive ideals are aligned very much with theirs,” according to the outlet.\n\n\n\nThe seat for New York’s 10th Congressional District was left open after redistricting. Jones decided to run in the area — which includes parts of Lower Manhattan — after Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney (D-N.Y.), who leads the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, decided to run in a newly drawn district that included much of Jones’s old area.\n\n\n\nFormer New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio (D) announced his candidacy for the Democratic nomination in the 10th Congressional District, but eventually dropped out in July.",

        "description": "The Cubs announced they&#8217;ve reinstated reliever Manuel Rodríguez from the 60-day injured list. He&#8217;ll be on the roster for tonight&#8217;s game against the Brewers. Chicago optioned righty Kervin Castro to Triple-A Iowa to open an active roster spot, while starter Alec Mills was moved from the 15-day to the 60-day injured list to clear a spot on the 40-man roster.\nRodríguez, who recently turned 26, is in line for his first MLB action of the season. He made his big league debut last year, appearing in 20 games and throwing 17 2/3 innings. The righty scuffled to a 6.11 ERA during that brief look, walking an untenable 14.5% of opponents. He averaged more than 97 MPH on his fastball and induced ground-balls at a whopping 53.7% clip, though, showcasing some potential to emerge as a possible middle innings arm for skipper David Ross.\nThis season hasn&#8217;t gone according to plan, as Rodríguez made just five appearances in Iowa. He lost a good chunk of time with a strain in his throwing elbow, but he&#8217;s back and will look to stake his claim to a spot in the season-opening bullpen for next year. This is Rodríguez&#8217;s final minor league option year, meaning the Cubs will have to keep him on the active roster at the start of 2023 or make him available to other teams via trade or waivers.\nMills has been out since July 3 with a lower back strain. The righty&#8217;s IL transfer backdates to that point, so he&#8217;ll be eligible to return around a week from now. He&#8217;s unlikely to be ready by that point, as he&#8217;s yet to start a minor league rehab assignment.",

        "description": "Larissa Kosmos is a Ukrainian-American writer. Her essays have appeared in The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Christian Science Monitor and in other various outlets.&nbsp;She also works as a copywriter for Adcom.\n\n\n\nWhen my grandmother fled the Soviet invasion of Ukraine in 1944 with my then three-year-old mother in tow, the family caravan of horse-drawn wagons just a day or two ahead of the advancing Red Army, she carried her late father’s war medal with her. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Cross of Simon Petlura — a small black cross inlaid with a silver sword and the Ukrainian trident, hooked onto a blue, yellow and black striped ribbon — had been awarded to him in recognition of his service during battles for Ukraine’s independence. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBetween 1918 and 1920, he had defended the cities of Kharkiv, Poltava, Kremenchuk and Proskuriv from the Bolsheviks, who had stormed Ukraine under Vladimir Lenin’s command. Then taken captive by the Russians, my great-grandfather managed to escape, finding his way to a new regiment in Berdychiv.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs a child, my grandmother was struck by the prominent scar on his back — a mark of a severe injury and a permanent reminder of his fight for an independent Ukraine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToday, over 100 years since my great-grandfather battled Russian forces, writing in English but kindled by a Ukrainian heart as the American-born descendant of four Ukrainian immigrant grandparents, I follow news of the war closely, my pain and pride interlocked. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSix months into this cruel reality, I am certain my motherland will prevail. We have persisted against Russia’s chronic, violent desire to smother Ukraine for generations, and we will forever persist — individually and collectively, both in Ukraine and in the diaspora.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe will continue raising individuals of strength and character.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOur strength cannot be manufactured or imported by railway or measured in stockpiles. It is borne from a legacy of courage, conviction and perseverance. Just as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army fought tirelessly in the 1940’s against both the Soviets and the Nazis, so too are today’s warriors a model of resistance and tenacity. Beyond defiance, what they’ve inherited from their forebears is humility, and the understanding that Ukraine’s right to independence is greater than any of our single Ukrainian lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe will keep our culture thriving.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOur pysanky — exquisitely and intricately painted Easter eggs, so delicate in the palm of a hand — are impenetrable to the force of Russian missiles. Our Ukrainian Bandurist Chorus — featuring our country’s unique 60-stringed instrument, the bandura — has survived for over a century; and as the voice of Ukraine, the bandura will never be silenced. \n\n\n\nOur vibrant dancers — with colorful ribbons on the women’s wreaths, fluttering as they spin, and the men with their astounding acrobatics —will be executing a triumphant hopak as Russia’s tanks stall and rust. When one generation concludes the dance, the next will pick up where they left off, a recurring storm of Ukrainian energy. And our famous borsch? Hands off, Russia. It’s ours. \n\n\n\n&nbsp;We will ensure our children know Ukraine’s history.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThrough our diaspora’s Saturday schools and scout organizations, through our writing and films, through our museums and archives, through the work of our historians and professors, and through our own determination and agency, we will help preserve Ukraine’s story and relay it to the next generation. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe will illuminate the true version of events, leaving Russia’s fabrications in the shadows. Our history will be shared not only publicly but privately. “Listen,” my grandmother would say to me in Ukrainian as she began unspooling her World War II stories, “so that you know.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs so many of our grandparents did before, today’s survivors will convey their experiences of trauma and resilience, fixing these realities in the minds of their grandchildren.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA young woman walks past a World War II-era Soviet T-34 tank at an outdoor commemorative display extolling the battles and victories of the Soviet Red Army in liberating the Soviet Union against Nazi Germany occupation during World War II in Kyiv, Ukraine | Sean Gallup/Getty Images\n\n\n\nWe will honor our victims, and we will raise the world’s awareness of them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOur Holodomor Memorial in Washington stands as a tribute to the millions who starved to death between 1932 and 1933 in Joseph Stalin’s engineered famine — a genocide in which Ukrainian farmers’ grain, crops and livestock were confiscated. We have endeavored to grant those millions of souls a measure of dignity, a permanent marker on the earth and in memory, with the creation of a bronze wall in the United States capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToday’s victims will be honored too: The soldiers killed in battle, the civilians tortured and executed, the children and women raped, the innocents maimed by explosives buried under rubble . . . We will memorialize them and pursue justice for their pain.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe will be led by our heroes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe strongest steel is forged in the hottest fire, and now in the throes of hell, Ukraine’s heroes are multiplying. While the blood being spilled is inciting tremendous grief as it runs throughout the land, seeping even beyond the country’s borders, it’s also nourishing august pride. Ukraine is amassing an army of role models that will be inspirational and immortal.\n\n\n\nWe will rebuild Ukraine — regardless of how long it takes. \n\n\n\nUkrainians worldwide will contribute money and muscle to reconstruction. With the same tenacity that built St. Sophia’s Cathedral, the Kyiv Monastery of the Caves and Potocki Palace, we will see it through — every brick replaced, every shard of hatred removed, every beam standing tall once more. No amount of ruin can destroy our will to resurrect our homeland.\n\n\n\nAnd we will steadfastly support Ukraine.\n\n\n\nUkrainians in the diaspora have always helped the motherland.&nbsp;After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, we began serving as election observers in a newly free Ukraine. Many of us moved there to work, investing our talents and energies into developing the country’s nascent democratic government and free-market economy. Fueled by the descendants of World War II refugees, philanthropic organizations began emerging in Ukraine, and our youth began lending a hand, traveling to volunteer at summer camps for Ukrainian orphans. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen Russia invaded eastern Ukraine in the spring of 2014, grassroots groups like the Cleveland Maidan Association mobilized to support war efforts, supplying overwhelmed hospitals with medical aid and funding the purchase of ambulances to transport injured soldiers. Some of the wounded were brought to the U.S. for specialized surgeries, and were welcomed into the homes of Ukrainians they had never before met and who supported their recovery.   \n\n\n\nFor the last six months of Russia’s invasion, the diaspora has been similarly helping to sustain Ukraine, extensively, passionately and tirelessly. Numerous organizations in the U.S. and Europe are contributing: dispatching protective helmets and vests for civil resistance; buying generators; sending donated firefighter gear for emergency service personnel; mobilizing communities to pack individual first-aid kits for soldiers; sending medical supplies and equipment to hospitals and aid to refugee camps; and bringing pediatric cancer patients, and their families, out of the conflict zone for continued medical care. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor those of us born outside of Ukraine, our citizenship and proximity to the country have never mattered. We are one Ukrainian family, devoted to each other for life.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe will persevere, despite our injuries and profound losses. When today’s fighting ends, the new scar on Ukraine’s back will remind our children of their legacy — and their duty. 100 years from now, and beyond, we will defend and support our homeland.\n\n\n\nMy great-grandfather’s war medal, which my grandmother safeguarded through her nine-month escape in a covered wagon, four years in Germany’s refugee camps, a two-week voyage across the Atlantic to the Port of New York, and a lifetime of working and raising a family in Cleveland — not living an American dream but recovering from a Russia-inflicted nightmare — is now in my care. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nI’ve instructed my children to donate it to Cleveland’s Ukrainian Museum Archives when I’m gone, so that others may also see this small, concrete symbol of Ukraine’s long-standing fight for freedom.",

        "description": "EU-China relations are about to get bumpier.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBrussels will present its forced labor ban in early September — a move that will target products made by persecuted Uyghur Muslims in China. Meanwhile, the EU&#8217;s institutions are negotiating just how tough its newest trade weapon, aimed at tackling economic threats from countries like China, will be.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe EU&#8217;s China hawks are battling the pragmatists in discussions on both policies, with the pragmatists — especially export-driven Germany — afraid the EU can’t afford to upset Beijing while it&#8217;s cutting trade and energy ties with Russia.\n\n\n\n&#8220;EU-China relations are at a low point, but like it or not, we rely on each other, in particular in the fight against climate change,&#8221; said Jörg Wuttke, president of the EU Chamber of Commerce in China.\n\n\n\nThe hawks argue the EU should draw lessons from dealing with Russia and move away from China toward more like-minded partners, and quick.\n\n\n\nA European trade official stressed the need for more diversification and strengthening the EU’s trade defense instruments. “We are fully committed to ramping up our trade defense toolbox and won’t change that strategy all of the sudden over Ukraine or Taiwan,” the trade official said.\n\n\n\nThe sense of urgency has been heightened in recent weeks, as Beijing put military pressure on Taiwan following U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s visit to the self-ruling democratic island, sparking fears of a Chinese invasion that could trigger the kind of Western response like that against Russia.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTackling forced labor\n\n\n\nMEPs want an embargo at the EU’s borders on imports and exports of products made under duress, but the Commission fears such measures might fall afoul of international trade law. The instrument also got pushback from the EU’s trade department, which critics accuse of being one of the more Sinophilic parts of the Commission.\n\n\n\nBut even the Sinophiles can&#8217;t ignore China&#8217;s human rights record. In August, a United Nations expert found “reasonable” evidence to show the existence of forced labor in Xinjiang. According to a new report by Tomoya Obokata, the U.N. special rapporteur on contemporary forms of slavery, the “involuntary nature” of work rendered by affected communities served as “indicators of forced labor … in many cases.”\n\n\n\nThat puts the Commission in an awkward situation in which it&#8217;s trying to maintain a trading relationship with China while at the same standing up to it. Hélène de Rengervé, from the NGO Anti-Slavery International, said that “what we are missing is someone championing the issue … The feeling I have is that [the Commission is] trying to get that proposal off their desks.&#8221; She said the Commission&#8217;s moves feel more like an &#8220;administrative process with no impact for workers.”\n\n\n\nAfter months of passing the buck on the forced labor initiative across different departments, the Commission is now expected to present a proposal on September 13. It wants to ensure the ban isn’t just directed against China, but to all forms of forced labor. But it won’t require much reading between the lines to understand whom the ban wants to target first.\n\n\n\nFighting blackmail\n\n\n\nBrussels is also ramping up its defense to fight what it considers economic blackmail from China and other rivals. After years of the EU complaining that it is vulnerable to trading partners punishing individual EU countries, the upcoming so-called anti-coercion tool would allow the Commission to impose commercial sanctions against a country outside the bloc.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt wants to prevent the kind of scenario that took place earlier this year, when Beijing stopped all trade with Lithuania in response to the country’s diplomatic support for Taiwan. The bill isn&#8217;t meant for one specific country, &#8220;but it is written with China in the back of their minds,” said Nikolas Keßels from Germany&#8217;s BDI industrial lobby, which supports the anti-coercion instrument.\n\n\n\nThe move is meant to deter countries from bullying the EU, but experts have warned it also risks creating a spiral of retaliation measures that could escalate tensions further.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n​​As a result, Beijing has accused Brussels of kowtowing to Washington. \n\n\n\n“Europe needs to sort out domestic affairs and figure out how much of its anxiety around China really comes from China, and how much comes from surrendering strategic autonomy to the U.S.,” according to an August editorial in the Global Times, a Chinese state media outlet. “With a highly complementary industrial chain and great economic interdependence, it stands to reason that the trade war should not have become a serious topic in Europe&#8217;s China policy discussion.”\n\n\n\nSome Europeans agree that Europe should avoid a trade war. “This has huge foreign policy implications,” said one EU diplomat about the anti-coercion instrument.\n\n\n\nBut both the European Parliament and EU countries are struggling to strike the balance between having an assertive trade defence arsenal, while not appearing too hostile.\n\n\n\n“We need to make sure that this will be a dog that bites,” said Green trade MEP Reinhard Bütikofer.\n\n\n\nThat the new trade defense instruments come on top of previous legislation to help the EU tackle unfair trading practices only raises the political stakes. The EU already adopted measures to screen foreign subsidies, limit the access to the EU’s procurement market for non-European companies and to ramp up the EU’s anti-dumping measures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEscalation\n\n\n\nThe war with Ukraine and China&#8217;s tensions with Taiwan has made Europe&#8217;s balancing act all the more perilous, especially at a time when China&#8217;s own foreign policy is at odds with Europe&#8217;s.\n\n\n\nWhile Europe has frozen out Moscow, Beijing continues to be friendly to it, citing its “no-limits” friendship while buying up Russian oil. It&#8217;s also openly threatening to “take back” Taiwan by force, conducting threatening military exercises near the island, which Europe counts on for the bulk of its microchip imports.\n\n\n\nEurope has approached Taiwan clumsily at times. The EU’s foreign policy chief Josep Borrell did not endear himself to China when he referred to Taiwan as a “small country,” leading to an immediate rebuke from Beijing’s diplomats, who believe the island is a part of the People&#8217;s Republic. The Continent also risks further ire as parliamentary delegations are being planned across EU capitals to visit Taiwan, with the German Bundestag scheduling two trips in October alone.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nChina can still hurt Europe — and Germany in particular — if the relationship becomes more fraught.\n\n\n\nAccording to a study from Germany’s Ifo Institute for Economic Research, decoupling from China would cost the bloc’s biggest economy six times as much as Brexit. (A German Socialist politician, though, snubbed the findings: “Just six times? Have you felt much pain from Brexit?”)\n\n\n\n“We are not looking for decoupling, but we are clearly in favor of diversification,” one German official also said on the condition of anonymity.\n\n\n\nBerlin is working on a new China Strategy that is likely move away from former Chancellor Angela Merkel’s business-over-all-else approach. While the ruling coalition&#8217;s two junior parties — including the Greens, who control the Foreign Ministry that is principally in charge of drafting the strategy — favor a tough approach, “the Chancellory will be the one trying to tone it down,” a German diplomat said.\n\n\n\n“But even that,” the diplomat added, “it would hardly be a nice read for Beijing.”\n\n\n\nSarah Anne Aarup contributed reporting.",

        "description": "The Environmental Protection Agency is cracking down on cancer-linked “forever chemicals,” Democrats are bracing for a clash over permitting — which could end up impacting government funding — and Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm is asking fuel refiners to rein in their exports.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is Overnight Energy &amp; Environment, your source for the latest news focused on energy, the environment and beyond. For The Hill, we’re Rachel Frazin and Zack Budryk. Subscribe here.\n\n\n\nEPA: More clean up, liability for toxic contamination\n\n\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to designate two types of “forever chemicals” as hazardous substances, aiming to expand both cleanup and accountability for this pollution.\n\n\n\n“Forever chemicals,” also called PFAS, have been linked to illnesses including kidney and testicular cancer and thyroid disease. They’re also notorious for lingering for decades in the environment and human body instead of breaking down over time.PFAS contamination has become widespread across the U.S. as it has been discharged over the years by both industrial facilities and military bases, the latter of which used it in firefighting foam. The compounds can be found in a number of household products including nonstick pans, cosmetics and waterproof apparel. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe new proposal from the Biden administration seeks to help impacted communities clean up this waste. If it’s finalized, declaring these substances as “hazardous” under the Superfund law is expected to both speed up the cleanup process and hold polluters responsible. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMelanie Benesh, Vice President for Government Affairs at the Environmental Working Group, said that the proposal would “jumpstart the cleanup process at a lot of contaminated sites and help the EPA hold polluters accountable for the mess that they have been making over decades.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn the hook:&nbsp;The hazardous substance designation would allow the EPA to put either the military or a private company that contaminated a given area with these substances on the hook to clean it up, and, if they refuse to do so, would give the EPA the power to recoup the costs.\n\n\n\n“Both private parties and [the] Department of Defense will really be incentivized to move out on cleanup when they’re responsible for this now that this designation is going to take place,” said Betsy Southerland, former director of the Office of Science and Technology in the EPA’s Office of Water.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe designation would also require the reporting of releases of the substances, which is expected to give communities information on where these chemicals are being discharged. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe two types in focus:&nbsp;While there are thousands of types of PFAS — an acronym that refers to per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances — the EPA’s proposal only addresses the two most notorious types, called PFOA and PFOS. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRecently, the agency said that these two substances are dangerous to drink, even in miniscule amounts. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn industry perspective:&nbsp;A chemical industry trade group pushed back on the EPA’s latest proposal, arguing that it would impose significant costs on businesses. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“A proposed [hazardous substance] designation would impose tremendous costs on these parties without defined cleanup standards,” the organization said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the proposal here.  \n\n\n\nDems set for permitting clash, raising shutdown risk\n\n\n\nLiberal lawmakers are pressing Democratic leaders in the House to not include a side deal undercutting environmental reviews worked out with Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in a short-term measure funding the government.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nHouse Natural Resources Chairman Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.) is circulating a letter asking leadership to separate the Manchin deal out from a continuing resolution that would temporarily avert a government shutdown. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Don’t attach it to a budget, to a CR, must-pass legislation and therefore take this essential Republican agenda and have Democrats pass it,” he told The Hill earlier this month.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe issue is expected to come to a head in September, when lawmakers return from recess, as Democrats try to secure funding for the government and prevent a shutdown.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nA refresher:&nbsp;The deal was part of the agreement Manchin made with Democratic leaders as they won his support for their now-passed climate, tax and health care bill.\n\n\n\nUnder the deal with Manchin, worked out by President Biden, Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the trio agreed “to pass comprehensive permitting reform legislation before the end of this fiscal year,” which ends on Oct. 1.The provisions are designed to expedite energy and infrastructure projects subject to environmental reviews. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat sets up a potential shutdown crisis if progressives block a funding bill over the inclusion of the permitting reform language and Democrats can’t find the votes elsewhere.\n\n\n\nBetween the lines:&nbsp;An actual shutdown is highly unlikely, as Democrats don't want to shutter the government months before the midterm elections.\n\n\n\nWhile Grijalva’s office declined to say Thursday how many lawmakers are signing his letter, at least a few others have signaled resistance to the deal.\n\n\n\nA potential wrinkle:&nbsp;If progressives do make a stand, it will complicate life for House Democratic leaders.\n\n\n\nDemocrats enjoy a very narrow majority in the House, meaning even a handful of progressive votes could block a measure to fund the government — if there’s not the Republican support to make up the difference. The more signatures on the Grijalva letter, the more leverage progressives could have.\n\n\n\nDemocratic leaders would face a difficult choice between passing a clean continuing resolution, or \"CR,\" funding stopgap and potentially angering Manchin; convincing their own members to shed their environmental concerns and back the Manchin side deal; or leaning on GOP votes to prevent a shutdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA number of GOP members support the permitting changes advanced by Manchin. Whether they’ll want to back a Democratic funding measure that includes them — or allow Democrats to fight it out internally ahead of the elections — is another question.\n\n\n\nAnd some Republicans are skeptical of the way it came about:&nbsp;Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) has pledged to vote against the permitting deal on principle, even if he may actually like the policies included in it.\n\n\n\n“I will not vote for a continuing resolution that is part of a political payback scheme,” Graham said in a press conference this month. “Senator Manchin, if you think you’re going to get 60 votes to get the sweeteners that can’t be done in reconciliation, you need to think long and hard about what you’re doing.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the tensions here.  \n\n\n\nGRANHOLM TO REFINERS: CUT EXPORTS\n\n\n\nEnergy Secretary Jennifer Granholm called on major U.S. oil refiners to build up capacity and reduce exports of refined products ahead of the winter in a letter shared with The Hill.\n\n\n\nIn the letter, written last week, Granholm noted the reduced availability of diesel inventories along the East Coast, which are nearly 50 percent below the five-year average. Refined product exports are at a record high.A likely above-average hurricane season, followed shortly by the winter heating season, is likely to compound demand in the northeast.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Given the historic level of U.S. refined product exports, I again urge you to focus in the near term on building inventories in the United States, rather than selling down current stocks and further increasing exports,” Granholm wrote, saying that such a buildup would be an alternative to emergency measures such as releases from the Northeast Gasoline Supply Reserve.\n\n\n\nThe letter was reported first by The Wall Street Journal. The paper accused Granholm in&nbsp;a Wednesday&nbsp;editorial&nbsp;of attempting to strong-arm the energy industry and abandoning European nations weaning themselves off Russian imports.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn Energy Department official sharply disputed this characterization, saying “as we get closer and closer to peak hurricane season right now, and we’re running our internal models, we are calling on [the industry] to be more proactive.”\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\nCOLORADO DEMS ASK BIDEN TO PROTECT LOCAL LAND \n\n\n\nColorado Democrats urged President Biden in a letter on Friday to use his executive powers to preserve the historical legacy of key Rocky Mountain landscapes and ban new oil and gas leasing in certain spaces. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe politicians — Rep. Joe Neguse, Sen. Michael Bennet, Sen. John Hickenlooper and Gov. Jared Polis — asked the president to protect the public spaces included in the Colorado Outdoor Recreation &amp; Economy (CORE) Act, the progress of which has stalled in Congress, despite strong local support. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nChief among their requests is the designation of Colorado’s Camp Hale and the Tenmile Range as the “Camp Hale – Continental Divide National Monument,” by means of the Antiquities Act. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis area, they explained, was instrumental “in preparing the 10th Mountain Division for some of the most difficult moments of World War II,” while many veterans returned to establish Colorado’s outdoor recreation economy. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe politicians also urged the president to protect Colorado’s Thompson Divide through a Federal Lands Policy and Management Act mineral withdrawal, which would ban new oil and gas leasing, as well as mining, in the region.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about their request here, from The Hill's Sharon Udasin.\n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nEnvironmental groups sue to stop federal approval of exploration at Alaska oil project (Anchorage Daily News) Drought threatens coal plant operations — and electricity — across the West (NPR) Fears of a radiation leak mount near Ukrainian nuclear plant (The Associated Press) St. Louis, Death Valley and now Dallas: Why '1,000-year' floods suddenly seem so common (NBC News) Ukraine Reconnects Power to Nuclear Plant Amid Pressure for U.N.

        "description": "The Department of Justice (DOJ) on Friday released the much-anticipated affidavit that convinced a federal judge to approve a warrant to search former President Trump’s Florida home.\n\n\n\nWe’ll take a deep dive into the warrant. Plus, we’ll talk about the 1-year anniversary of the bombing in Kabul, Afghanistan, that killed 13 U.S. service members.\n\n\n\nThis is Defense &amp; National Security, your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. For The Hill, I’m Jordan Williams. Subscribe here.\n\n\n\nAffidavit: 184 classified docs found at Trump's resort\n\n\n\nA redacted FBI affidavit used to convince a judge for a search warrant for former President Trump’s Florida home noted that authorities found 184 classified documents in their initial review of boxes recovered from the home in an effort that began just a few months after he left office.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAuthorities’ concern that Trump may have additional national security information at his private residence was spurred by a review of the 15 boxes recovered by the National Archives in January.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInside the affidavit:&nbsp;The affidavit indicates that among the 184 documents were 25 that contained top secret information, including those gained from “clandestine human sources,” information prohibited from being shared with foreign governments, and information obtained by monitoring “foreign communications signals.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 28-page affidavit contains numerous redactions but indicates authorities believed “evidence, contraband, fruits of crime, or other items illegally possessed” would be found at Mar-a-Lago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEntirely redacted is a provision explaining why the government believed additional “classified [national defense information]” would be found on the premises.\n\n\n\nWhat else is new?&nbsp;The affidavit offers new information about the extent of the saga to recover documents from Mar-a-Lago. The document says the National Archives first reached out about retrieving records as early as May 6, 2021 — just a few months after Trump left office.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet it wasn’t until late that year that the Trump team alerted Archives that they had 12 boxes ready for pick up. The agency would instead leave with 15.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump’s response:&nbsp;In a statement from Trump shortly after the affidavit’s release, the former president called the document “a total public relations subterfuge by the FBI &amp; DOJ” that was not reflective of “our close working relationship regarding document turnover – WE GAVE THEM MUCH.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA few disclaimers:&nbsp;Trump has not been charged in connection with the search, and the affidavit does not name him as having potentially violated various statutes, instead saying evidence of violations may be found at the premises.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump had called for the release of both the warrant and the affidavit. He filed a separate case, however, seeking an injunction to stall the FBI’s investigation and asking a court to appoint a special master for the case. Doing so would let an outside party approved by the court first review the evidence taken during the search before the FBI can review it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCheck out other coverage of the affidavit:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFive takeaways from the Mar-a-Lago search affidavitAffidavit suggests ‘some of our most sensitive intelligence’ mishandled” Senate intel chairRead the unsealed warrant affidavit here\n\n\n\nBiden marks 1 year since deadly Afghan bombing\n\n\n\nPresident Biden on Friday marked the anniversary of the “heinous” terrorist attack amid the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan that killed 13 American service members and dozens of civilians.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden issued a statement in which he recognized each of the 13 American service members by name. They died in a suicide bombing outside the airport in Kabul last year in the thick of chaotic attempts to evacuate Americans from Afghanistan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat Biden said:&nbsp;“Today, I am praying for the families of those 13 fallen warriors, who lost a piece of their soul one year ago. Our nation can never repay such incredible sacrifice—but we will never fail to honor our sacred obligation to the families and survivors they left behind,” Biden said Friday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I am also holding in my heart all those who lost their child, partner, parent, sibling, loved one, or battle buddy over our two decades of war in Afghanistan. 2,461 American troops made the ultimate sacrifice. 20,744 were wounded, so many whose lives are forever marked by their injuries. It is a painful reminder that there is nothing low-cost or low-grade about war for those we ask to fight for us.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWho died?&nbsp;The attack, which was attributed to a branch of the terrorist group ISIS, killed Marine Corps Staff Sgt. Darin T. Hoover; Marine Corps Sgt. Johanny Rosario; Marine Corps Sgt. Nicole L. Gee; Marine Corps Cpl. Hunter Lopez; Marine Corps Cpl. Daegan W. Page; Marine Corps Cpl. Humberto A. Sanchez; Marine Corps Lance Cpl. David L. Espinoza; Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Jared M. Schmitz; Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Rylee J. McCollum; Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Dylan R. Merola; Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Kareem M. Nikoui; Navy Petty Officer Third Class Maxton W. Soviak; and Army Staff Sgt. Ryan C. Knauss.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA low point:&nbsp;The terrorist attack at Abbey Gate in Kabul a year ago is widely regarded as the low point of Biden’s first term by officials within the administration. It also served as a flashpoint for critics of his decision to pull U.S. troops out of Afghanistan after roughly 20 years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden has insisted he does not regret the handling of the U.S. withdrawal, even as accounts have shown the administration appeared unprepared for the rapid collapse of the Afghan government and a chaotic effort to get civilians out of the country culminated with the terrorist bombing that killed 13 U.S. troops and more than 100 Afghans in the area.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe president has argued that remaining in Afghanistan would have cost more American lives and forced the U.S. to commit more forces to fight off the Taliban.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n\n\nBiden faces calls to let Vindman twin retire as colonel\n\n\n\nPresident Biden is facing calls to allow Col. Yevgeny “Eugene” Vindman, who alongside his twin brother Alexander blew the whistle on former President Trump’s July 2019 call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, to retire with the title of colonel.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVindman was promoted to colonel in March of last year by Biden after his career was sidetracked by a bad review — something the Defense Department’s inspector general later determined was likely a reprisal for his involvement in expressing concerns over Trump’s actions on the phone call.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut to officially retire as a colonel, one must hold the rank for three years.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe backstory:&nbsp;Two days after Trump was acquitted of impeachment charges over his dealings with Ukraine in the Senate, both Vindman brothers were escorted out of the White House. Their promotions to colonel were delayed.\n\n\n\nWhile Alexander Vindman retired, Eugene Vindman received a career-damaging negative performance review from a superior who, one year earlier, had praised him as one of the best military lawyers and officers he had ever worked with.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEugene Vindman is set to retire this coming Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe argument:&nbsp;Lawyers Defending American Democracy, which wrote the letter to Biden, said the move would have significance beyond a formal title.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In granting this waiver, you will reinforce a critical message: those who stand up with courage for the constitution and the rule of law will be rewarded, and retaliation will not be tolerated,” they write.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVindmans are ‘military heroes’:&nbsp;“There are military heroes. There are legal heroes. Then there are those like Colonel Vindman who are both. He deserves to retire with the rank that he has so well earned,” Norm Eisen, an attorney who served as co-counsel for the House Judiciary Committee during Trump’s first impeachment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\nON TAP FOR MONDAY\n\n\n\nThe American Enterprise Institute will host an event, “An (Air) Force to Be Reckoned With: Defense Strategy and Innovation with Gen.

        "description": "Behold, dear readers, a poem that the people at NPR wrote about that one time a scientist unearthed and then ate part of a 55,000-year-old frozen bison. We don’t know.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToday in health care, two of the major COVID-19 vaccine makers, Moderna and Pfizer, are now in a legal battle over patents.\n\n\n\nWelcome to Overnight Health Care, where we’re following the latest moves on policy and news affecting your health. For The Hill, we’re Peter Sullivan, Nathaniel Weixel and Joseph Choi. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModerna sues over COVID-19 vaccine patents \n\n\n\nModerna said Friday it is suing Pfizer and its German partner BioNTech, alleging patent infringement over the COVID-19 vaccine. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe move sets up a showdown between two major vaccine makers that together have helped blunt the impacts of the pandemic in the United States and other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We believe that Pfizer and BioNTech unlawfully copied Moderna’s inventions, and they have continued to use them without permission,” Moderna Chief Legal Officer Shannon Thyme Klinger said in a statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nModerna is seeking compensation from Pfizer for the use of technology that Moderna says it pioneered.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNew phase of pandemic?The move also indicates Moderna views the pandemic as being in a different phase. The company said that it previously pledged not to enforce it patents while the pandemic continued. But, it said, “in March 2022, when the collective fight against COVID-19 entered a new phase and vaccine supply was no longer a barrier to access in many parts of the world, Moderna updated its pledge.”&nbsp;&nbsp;It now says that while it will not enforce its patents in 92 low and middle-income countries, it will in other parts of the world.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPfizer is going to fight: Pfizer said it would “vigorously” defend against the suit.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Pfizer/BioNTech has not yet fully reviewed the complaint but we are surprised by the litigation given the Pfizer/BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine was based on BioNTech’s proprietary mRNA technology and developed by both BioNTech and Pfizer,” Pfizer said in a statement. “We remain confident in our intellectual property supporting the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine and will vigorously defend against the allegations of the lawsuit.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs Fauci exits, public health experts lament attacks  \n\n\n\nAnthony Fauci is preparing to leave the public stage — but health experts are worried the toxic atmosphere that tailed him will hang around for years to come. \n\n\n\nOpinions of Fauci among the general public cleave along partisan lines, but most experts think he did about as good a job as anyone could in managing a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey worry that the unremitting personal attacks he faced are emblematic of a broader, sneering tone toward scientific expertise and advice.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLawrence Gostin, a professor at Georgetown Law who specializes in public health, has known Fauci for almost half a century and considers him a friend.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n‘Rabid politicization’ “He has got caught in the rabid politicization of American culture,” Gostin lamented, “and he has got caught right in the crosshairs of the COVID culture wars these past years.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGostin, who said he shared Fauci’s dismay at the “venom” of some of the attacks, also expressed concern about the general climate surrounding science, which seems unlikely to change after Fauci leaves government service in December.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Public health and science itself has been pilloried. There is an enormous fatigue, resignation and sheer exhaustion in the entire scientific community. People are quitting their jobs, or when they are keeping their jobs, they are keeping their heads down,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDNC ROLLS OUT NEW AD ON ABORTION AS TRIGGER BANS TAKE EFFECT \n\n\n\nThe Democratic National Committee rolled out a digital ad buy in four states hitting Republicans on abortion following bans on the procedure going into effect in Idaho, Texas and Tennessee.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;five-figure ad buy, which was first reported on by The Hill, is slated to run in Nevada, Pennsylvania, New Mexico and Colorado. The spots will air on video mediums and be seen on platforms like YouTube and Facebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe spots highlight efforts to restrict abortion. One fifteen-second clip ends with the caption “your state could be next.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Democrats will continue to remind voters that if Republicans gain power this November, they will go even further than overturning Roe and work to take away the freedom for millions more women to make their own health care decisions,” DNC Chairman&nbsp;Jaime Harrison&nbsp;said in a statement to The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBig picture: &nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats have been more aggressively messaging on the issue since Kansas voters rejected a ballot measure earlier this month that would give the state legislature the authority to ban abortion. &nbsp;On Tuesday, Democrat Pat Ryan defied expectations in the special election for New York’s 19th Congressional District, winning the election after centering his message on abortion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUP TO 4M OF AMERICANS REMAIN OUT OF WORK DUE TO LONG COVID \n\n\n\nUp to 4 million Americans may be out of work due to long Covid and it carries steep economic repercussions for not just the U.S. economy but the productivity of working people.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Census Bureau found 16.3 million working-age Americans have long Covid today and of those 2 to 4 million are out of work because of the condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;The annual cost of wages lost to long Covid is around $170 billion a year and could potentially run as high as $230 billion. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLong Covid is defined as having symptoms of COVID-19 for at least 12 weeks after being infected with the virus and&nbsp;it comes in multiple forms&nbsp;— including respiratory symptoms and neurological problems like brain fog, poor memory and headaches.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearchers at the Brookings Institution analyzed Census Bureau data, along with other studies that looked at rates of people with long Covid, and found the loss of jobs is consistent with the current labor market shortages, like in education, transportation, food service, hospitality and health and social care industries.\n\n\n\nTaking a closer look at wages, Brookings found that the average U.S. worker earns $1,106 per week, and if up to 4 million Americans are out of work due to long Covid, that translates to $230 billion a year in lost earnings — nearly 1 percent of the total U.S. gross domestic product. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCDC director ‘cautiously optimistic’ on monkeypox cases \n\n\n\nRochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), said on Friday she was “cautiously optimistic” about the direction of the monkeypox outbreak amid early reports of cases trending down both in the U.S. and globally.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring a press briefing, Walensky noted that some jurisdictions including New York, Chicago and San Francisco have begun to report a downward trend in monkeypox cases.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat may be driving down cases:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe majority of vaccinations for monkeypox in the U.S. are reported to be first doses so it is unclear how much immunization efforts can be credited with pushing down cases.&nbsp;However, the White House’s national monkeypox response deputy coordinator Demetre Daskalakis noted that recent data from the American Men’s Internet Survey (AMIS) found that men who have sex with men have reported changing their sexual habits in response to monkeypox, likely helping reduce transmission.&nbsp;Speaking on the AMIS data, Daskalakis said it indicated that “the LGBTQIA+ people are doing things that are actually reducing their risk and it’s working.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I want to be cautiously optimistic about this, not only because of the downward trend but because of the AMIS data that Dr. Daskalakis just noted,” Walensky said. \n\n\n\nWhile cases appear to be trending down in some places, Walensky stressed that they are still on rise nationally. Nearly 17,000 cases have been confirmed by the CDC. \n\n\n\nToo soon to celebrate: “The rate of rise is lower, but we are still seeing increases. And we are of course a very diverse country and things are not even across the country,” she said. “So we’re watching this with cautious optimism and really hopeful that many of our harm reduction messages and vaccines are getting out there and working.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nWhite House directs health, science agencies to make federally funded studies free to access (Stat) EPA wants to label certain 'forever chemicals' as hazardous substances (CNN) At 988 call centers, crisis counselors offer empathy — and juggle limited resources (NPR) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATE BY STATE\n\n\n\n‘He stood his ground’: state senator will leave office as champion of tough vaccine laws (California Healthline) More polio virus detected in upstate New York wastewater (Associated Press) USDA begins airdropping rabies vaccines for wildlife in 13 states (Axios) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTHE HILL OPEDS\n\n\n\nThe loss of Roe complicates Biden’s plan for safer pregnancies Privacy is being ignored as lines blur between health care and social care The monkeypox mistake the US government won’t stop making \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat's it for today, thanks for reading.

        "description": "Right-hander Chi Chi González has triggered an opt-out clause in his minor league contract with the Tigers, reports Jon Heyman of the New York Post (Twitter link). He returns to the open market.\nIt was a brief run in Detroit for the 30-year-old, who signed one month ago. He started four of five outings with Triple-A Toledo, working to a 5.48 ERA over 21 1/3 innings. González only struck out 19.4% of opposing hitters during that time, but he induced ground-balls at a huge 58.5% clip. Detroit nevertheless decided against adding him to the big league roster, and he&#8217;ll explore his other options.\nGonzález has already gotten to the majors with two teams this season. He began this season on a non-roster pact with the Twins and was selected to the majors on two separate occasions. After being designated for assignment in June, he was claimed off waivers by the Brewers. He started two of four games for Milwaukee before being taken off the roster again. That time around, González cleared waivers and elected free agency.\nBetween the two clubs, he has a 6.87 ERA in 18 1/3 frames. González also posted an ERA north of 6.00 with the Rockies from 2020-21, but he&#8217;s capable of serving as either rotation or long relief depth. It seems likely he&#8217;ll get another minor league opportunity elsewhere. If he signs before September 1, he&#8217;d be eligible for a new team&#8217;s postseason roster.",

        "description": "Top House Democrats are pressing the Senate to vote on a bill to remove the bust of former Chief Justice Roger Brooke Taney, the author of the Dred Scott v. Sanford ruling, from the Capitol.\n\n\n\nIn June 2021, the House passed a bill 285-120 that would replace the bust of Taney with that of former Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, and remove statues of individuals who served in the Confederacy. All opposition came from Republican lawmakers.\n\n\n\nThe legislation, however, has not yet been brought up for a vote in the Senate, which House Democrats are now pushing for.\n\n\n\nIn a letter on Friday, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.), Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.) and other Democrats asked that the upper chamber bring up the bill for a vote “without delay” as the end of the current Congress approaches.\n\n\n\n“Memorialization as part of the collection of artwork in the U.S. Capitol is one of the highest honors available to Americans and those who have stood with our country in defense of liberty and democracy. It is shameful that individuals who fought to uphold slavery, participated in seditious rebellion, or worked to promote segregation remain honored in such a way,” the House Democrats wrote.\n\n\n\nThe note was addressed to Senate Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), Senate Rules Committee Chairwoman Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) and Rules Committee Ranking Member Roy Blunt (R-Mo.).\n\n\n\nHouse Democrats said it is “an indignity” that African American individuals in the Senate are “confronted with these memorials to those who viewed African Americans as inferior and unworthy of full and equal inclusion under our Constitution.”\n\n\n\n“It is essential that we correct this injustice now,” the lawmakers add.\n\n\n\nHoyer introduced the bill in May 2021.\n\n\n\nTaney wrote the majority opinion in the 1857 Dred Scott v. Sandford decision, in which the Supreme Court upheld slavery and ruled that Black people could not be American citizens. The 13th Amendment abolishing slavery and the 14th Amendment granting citizenship to all individuals born in the U.S. overturned the ruling.\n\n\n\nHoyer, Clyburn and others previously penned a letter to Schumer in September asking that the Senate hold a vote on the bill.\n\n\n\nFriday’s letter cited the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, noting that “Americans were shocked and appalled to see the Confederate battle flag carried into the Capitol by&nbsp; insurrectionists; African-American Members, staff, and visitors must see just as poignant a symbol of injustice every single day in the likenesses of these individuals who were at the root of what that flag represents.”\n\n\n\n“That must end,” they added.\n\n\n\nThe Democrats specifically called for the removal of busts of former Vice President John C. Calhoun, who defended slavery, and Jefferson Davis, who served as president of the Confederate States of America, among others.\n\n\n\nCongressional Black Caucus Chairwoman Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) and Democratic Reps. Barbara Lee (Calif.), Karen Bass (Calif.) G.K. Butterfield (N.C.), Bennie Thompson (Miss.), Dutch Ruppersberger (Md.), John Sarbanes (Md.), Anthony Brown (Md.), Jamie Raskin (Md.), David Trone (Md.), Kweisi Mfume (Md.), Jim McGovern (N.J.), Nikema Williams (Ga.) and Del. Eleanor Holmes Norton (D.C.) joined Hoyer and Clyburn in signing the letter.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3617662-biden-is-failing-to-defend-religious-freedom-abroad/",
        "description": "This past Thursday there was an interesting exchange between White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre and a correspondent for the Catholic Eternal World Television Network. When Jean-Pierre was asked about the White House’s reaction to the latest persecution of Catholics in Nicaragua — the abduction of a bishop, incarceration of priests and seminarians, and the shutting down of Catholic radio stations — her answer was baffling: “There has been a dramatic deterioration of democratic principles and human rights by the regime in Nicaragua including the imprisonment of democratic leaders, members of the political opposition, students and journalists. The Biden-Harris administration finds this unacceptable and condemns these actions.”  \n\n\n\nWait, what? Madam Press Secretary, did you not hear the question?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDon’t get me wrong. I agree that Daniel Ortega and his thugs are trying to silence “political opponents, students and journalists.” And I’m relieved that the Biden-Harris administration finds this “unacceptable and condemns these actions.” But there is something different going on here that cries out for a response. I’d really like to know what our country’s second Catholic president has to say about Daniel Ortega’s war against the Catholic Church.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEarlier this summer, Ortega’s government&nbsp;outlawed the missionary order&nbsp;founded by Mother Teresa and expelled the order’s nuns from the country. Their exile followed the&nbsp;expulsion in March of the Vatican’s envoy to Nicaragua, Archbishop Waldemar Stanislaw Sommertag.&nbsp;Bishop Rolando Álvarez,&nbsp;who heads the diocese of Matagalpa in Nicaragua,&nbsp;was recently&nbsp;arrested&nbsp;and thrown into jail together with eight of&nbsp;his companions.&nbsp;Police previously arrested seven other priests on&nbsp;trumped up charges. Father Uriel Vallejos went into hiding after the police raided his parish’s radio station and&nbsp;surrounded his residence&nbsp;for several days. The radio station managed by Vallejos was among the Catholic television and radio channels that have recently been&nbsp;shut down by the government.&nbsp;Ortega’s government&nbsp;silenced&nbsp;yet another Catholic radio station earlier this week.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe United States is a country with an unusually&nbsp;deep commitment to religious liberty. Ours was the first nation to guarantee religious freedom in&nbsp;its constitution. And for over 20 years, we have expressly advanced the cause of international religious freedom. Congress unanimously passed the&nbsp;International Religious Freedom Act&nbsp;(IRFA) in 1998, establishing the Office of International Religious Freedom in the State Department, led by an IRF Ambassador at Large. IRFA was&nbsp;amended&nbsp;in 2016 to further bolster religious freedom as a foreign policy priority. But today, religious freedom experts&nbsp;warn&nbsp;that the Biden administration is ignoring our responsibility under the IRFA.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Biden often remarks on the importance of his Catholic faith. His administration’s tone-deaf response to the plight of persecuted Catholics in Nicaragua, however, is yet&nbsp;more evidence that this administration has little concern for religious freedom — not only here at home but also abroad.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the president's apparent indifference to this scandal doesn't justify a similar reaction from the American people. There is so much at stake here. Ortega is simultaneously attempting to squash the Catholic Church and democracy&nbsp;— for the simple reason that the Church is upholding democratic rights in a country where its voice is powerful; Nicaragua, after all, is an overwhelmingly Catholic country.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt's vital that Americans don't allow our response to Ortega's brutality to be influenced by our own political views. Back in the 1980s, Nicaragua's dictator headed a Sandinista government that was routinely portrayed by liberals as a utopia of social justice. It would be a terrible thing if residual affection for the Sandinistas, and the socialist sympathies of some young Democrats led them to play down the horrors of today's Ortega regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe have, after all, been down that road before. For decades, some left-wingers sought to minimize the suffering of those in Fidel Castro's Cuba.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt would be shameful if, before assessing their reaction to the escalating persecution of Catholics in Nicaragua, Americans were to first ask themselves, in the words of the old protest song, \"Which side are you on?\" On this occasion there&nbsp;can be no debate about \"sides.\" The rights of the human person are being viciously attacked, and our solemn duty is to mobilize domestic and world opinion in support of the persecuted in Nicaragua. Even if our government can't be bothered to.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAndrea Picciotti-Bayer&nbsp;runs the Conscience Project and is director of strategy for the Institute for Human Ecology at the Catholic University of America, the only national university of the Catholic Church in America.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky announced on Friday that the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant is connected to its power grid, but cautioned that the “situation remains very risky.”\n\n\n\n“I want to emphasize that the situation remains very risky and dangerous,” said Zelensky in a presidential address.\n\n\n\n“Any repeat of yesterday's events, that is, any disconnection of the plant from the grid, any actions by Russia that could trigger the shutdown of the reactors, will again put the plant one step away from disaster.”\n\n\n\nZelensky applauded nuclear scientists for protecting the power plant, which he said is “constantly being provoked by Russian forces,” from the “worst-case scenario.”\n\n\n\nUkraine’s nuclear power plants have caused concern amid the Russian invasion that warfare could prompt a nuclear disaster.  The Russians seized control over the plant at the start of the conflict.\n\n\n\nThe Zaporizhzhia plant was disconnected from its grid on Thursday after fire broke out around the lines connecting to the grid. \n\n\n\nShortly after the disconnection, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) announced that it would send a delegation to the nuclear power plant for safety and security reasons.\n\n\n\nThe delegation was previously scheduled to visit Zaporizhzhia to take inventory of its resources. \n\n\n\nZelensky addressed the IAEA visit during his speech on Friday, supporting its involvement with the nuclear power plant.\n\n\n\n“That is why it is so important that the IAEA mission arrives at the plant as soon as possible and helps keep the NPP under continuous control of Ukraine,” Zelensky said, referencing possible future dangers resulting from Russian possession of the plant.\n\n\n\nZelensky called on the international community to support Ukraine both in supervision of the Zaporizhzhia plant and in holding Russia accountable for the delays the war has caused in grain exportation from Ukraine.\n\n\n\n“I emphasize that it is the full responsibility of the partners to prevent any Russian provocations and disruption of exports,” he said.\n\n\n\nZelesnky shared that the recent “grain export initiative” had moved a million tons of food out of the country and that Ukraine intends to continue that work.\n\n\n\n“This is a victory,” said Zelensky, adding that 44 grain vessels were sent to 15 countries while Ukraine waits on 70 additional applications for the arrival of vessels at ports.",

        "description": "Julio Rodriguez is on the verge of a massive contract extension. Who will be the next prospect to ink a mega-deal? Today’s Big Hype Prospects won’t answer that question, but it’s possible we’ll discuss them all the same.\nFive Big Hype Prospects\nFrancisco Alvarez, 20, C, NYM (AAA)\n141 PA, 6 HR, .180/.340/.378\nDespite the triumphant return of Jacob deGrom, the Mets divisional aspirations are endangered. Their once dominant lead over the Braves has dwindled to just two games. The club has received exactly 0.0 WAR from their catchers. Alvarez, whose combination of discipline and rare raw power can lead to some irresponsible comps (like former Met Mike Piazza), has held his own at Triple-A. The low batting average is the result of an unfortunate .209 BABIP. Low BABIPs in the minors can be symptomatic of a flaw. Sometimes, they’re just bad luck over a small sample. Alvarez had similar issues in High-A last season (.260 BABIP) so it’s possible his plodding speed and pull-heavy approach might yield an all-or-nothing slugger, especially early in his career. Defensive reviews are mixed and can sometimes leave a Gary Sanchez-like taste on the tongue. He has the capacity and work ethic to stick at the position, but maybe his bat is too potent to subject to the rigors of battery work?\nAlvarez would certainly upgrade the Mets lineup over the likes of James McCann and Tomas Nido. However, they’re both talented defenders who have experience with the Mets pitching staff. If New York wants to experiment with Alvarez ahead of the postseason, now is the time to do it.\nBrett Baty, 22, 3B, NYM (MLB)\n35 PA, 1 HR, .161/.235/.258\nBaty’s first exposure to Major League pitching hasn’t exactly gone according to plan. He had only 26 successful plate appearances at Triple-A before he was called upon. Much of his season was spent in Double-A where he hit .312/.406/.544 in 394 plate appearances. Baty is a disciplined hitter who makes hard, low-angle contact. With 91-mph average and 113-mph max exit velocities, he’s already demonstrated his power in just 24 batted ball events. His tendency to keep the ball on the ground could yield a contact profile something like a less-extreme Yandy Diaz. Whereas Diaz is nigh immune to strikeouts, Baty has a bit of swing-and-miss in his game.\nEduardo Escobar is nearing a return which could spell the end of the Baty experiment – at least for 2022. It’s also worth noting that his struggles have occurred over just nine games. He wouldn’t be the first player to need a couple beats before catching his stride.\nPete Crow-Armstrong, 20, OF, CHC (A+)\n235 PA, 9 HR, 16 SB, .286/.332/.521\nKnown to many prospect-watchers by his initials “PCA,” Crow-Armstrong was acquired from the Mets as part of the Javier Baez trade in 2021. The Cubs instigated a mechanical change to his swing which has led to above average pull-side power this season. Including a thorough stomping of Low-A pitchers, PCA has 16 home runs and 29 stolen bases across 418 total plate appearances. He’s a gifted center fielder who was originally expected to fit in the Majors as a defensive savant. The addition of power to his profile could unlock a star-level ceiling. There remain issues with his bat including elevated strikeout and swinging strike rates. He&#8217;s young for his level and showed better plate discipline in the past. Consider him a volatile work-in-progress who now appears likely to have a role as a future regular.\nShea Langeliers, 24, C, OAK (MLB)\n36 PA, 2 HR, .294/.306/.647\nA key component of the Matt Olson trade, Langeliers has made an impactful debut. He’s already popped two home runs, four doubles, and a triple in just nine games. That’s par for the course with Langeliers. He has middling plate discipline, plus power, and a below average feel for contact. When he does connect, it tends to be loud. His best trait is defense where he’s expected to be a comfortably positive contributor. The presence of Sean Murphy is only a temporary impediment – it’s widely assumed the veteran Athletic will be traded over the winter.\nBrayan Bello, 23, SP, BOS (MLB)\n22 IP, 9.00 K/9, 4.91 BB/9, 7.36 ERA\nRecently returned from the injured list, Bello had his best big league outing against the division rival Blue Jays. He tossed five innings of two-run ball while compiling seven strikeouts. Bello has a four-pitch repertoire led by a bowling ball 96.5-mph sinker. He also has a slightly harder fastball he can locate up in the zone. A slider and frequently-used changeup round out his pitch mix. In 18 minor league appearances he posted 12.10 K/9, 3.40 BB/9, and a 2.34 ERA. His carrying trait is an over-60 percent ground ball rate which, if maintained, would rank second among qualified starters between southpaw Framber Valdez (67.5%) and right-hander Logan Webb (58.4%). Like many sinker specialists making their debuts, Bello has struggled with free passes. He got away with iffy command in the minors because his stuff played even when thrown down the pike. He’s liable to need an adjustment period in the Majors.\nFive More\nMark Vientos, NYM (22): A possible alternative to Baty and Escobar, Vientos is red hot for the month of August. He’s batting .403/.448/.661 with four home runs in 67 plate appearances. He draws negative reviews for his third base defense and is in the process of switching over to first base. The bat appears as if it should play in the Majors at either position, though he might be a tad ordinary at the cold corner. He’s just shy of a 30 percent strikeout rate for a second consecutive season in the upper-minors.\nGrayson Rodriguez, BAL (22): Rodriguez has been sidelined for nearly three months with a lat strain. He is due to face hitters in a simulated game later this week. It’s possible he could make his debut in late-September.\nGunnar Henderson, BAL (21): Rumors abound of an impending callup for Henderson. Club officials are supposedly pondering the implications on his development. Henderson hasn’t exactly knocked down doors in August, batting .259/.364/.435 with 12.1 percent walk and 31.3 percent strikeout rates.\nRobert Hassell III, WSH (21): One of the prizes acquired for Juan Soto, the Nationals aggressively promoted Hassell to Double-A where he’s hit .147/.237/.206 through his first eight games. Like Baty above, it’s not uncommon for young players to scuffle when first presented with a new challenge. And even Mike Trout has eight-game slumps. Strikeouts have been an issue for Hassell since joining the Nats org.\nCurtis Mead, TB, (21): Recently recovered from a month-long injury to his elbow, Mead has five hits and two walks over 14 plate appearances. The right-handed slugger could make a useful platoonmate with David Peralta, especially once rosters expand in a few days. He’s Rule 5 eligible this winter so getting a jump on his service clock should be seen as acceptable – assuming the Rays can find a 40-man spot. He’s hitting .299/.391/.536 on the year, mostly at Double-A.",
