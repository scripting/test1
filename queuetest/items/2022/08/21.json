        "description": "Earlier this month, on August 2, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and a Democratic delegation commanded headlines when they traveled to Taiwan, an independently governed East Asian country made up of 168 islands on which about 24 million people live, and which China claims. Since 1979 the U.S. has helped to maintain the defensive capabilities of the democratically governed area, although it has been vague about whether it would intervene if China attacks Taiwan.Pelosi&#8217;s visit made her the highest-ranking U.S. politician to visit Taiwan since 1997, when Republican speaker Newt Gingrich visited the self-ruled island. Pelosi and a delegation of House Democrats who lead committees relevant to U.S. foreign relations&#8212;Gregory Meeks (NY), Mark Takano (CA), Suzan DelBene (WA), Raja Krishnamoorthi (IL), and Andy Kim (NJ)&#8212;visited Singapore, Malaysia, South Korea, and Japan. Taiwan was added quietly.Since then, another, bipartisan, congressional delegation has visited Taiwan. Senator Ed Markey (D-MA); Representatives John Garamendi (D-CA), Alan Lowenthal (D-CA), and Don Beyer (D-VA); and Delegate Aumua Amata Coleman Radewagen (R&#8211;American Samoa) visited Taiwan earlier this week. Markey chairs the Senate Foreign Relations East Asia, Pacific, and International Cybersecurity Subcommittee, and Beyer is chair of the U.S. Congress Joint Economic Committee (JEC); the rest of the delegation represents people in or near the Pacific Ocean.&nbsp;Before visiting Taiwan, Markey was in South Korea to talk about trade and technology, including the green technologies the U.S. is now funding through the Inflation Reduction Act, as well as &#8220;shared values and interests.&#8221;There is a larger story behind these visits to Taiwan. Early this year, the Biden administration launched a new, comprehensive initiative in the Indo-Pacific. Beginning with the tsunami in the Indian Ocean in 2004, the U.S. began to work informally with the &#8220;Quad,&#8221; the Quadrilateral Security Dialogue, consisting of the U.S., Australia, India, and Japan. In 2016, Japan introduced the concept of a free and open Indo-Pacific.&nbsp;&nbsp;When former president Trump withdrew the U.S. from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, he left the participants to continue without the U.S., which they did as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP). He also left open the way for a free trade deal in the region dominated by China, called the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement, or RCEP, which went into effect on January 1, 2022.&nbsp;This left the Biden administration with two politically poor choices: try to reestablish U.S. participation in the region through the CPTPP, which would have been hotly contested at home and thus unlikely to get through Congress, or let China dominate the region, with damaging long-term effects. So the administration found a third way.After some complaints that the administration had focused its attention too closely on the Middle East and Europe, in February the Biden administration released a document outlining its &#8220;Indo-Pacific Strategy,&#8221; claiming that the U.S. is part of the Indo-Pacific region, which stretches from our Pacific coastline to the Indian Ocean. The area, the report says, &#8220;is home to more than half of the world&#8217;s people, nearly two-thirds of the world&#8217;s economy, and seven of the world&#8217;s largest militaries. More members of the U.S. military are based in the region than in any other outside the United States. It supports more than three million American jobs and is the source of nearly $900 billion in foreign direct investment in the United States. In the years ahead, as the region drives as much as two-thirds of global economic growth, its influence will only grow&#8212;as will its importance to the United States.&#8221;The document notes the long history of the U.S. and the countries in the region, and it warns against the rising power of the People&#8217;s Republic of China there. The document promises to compete responsibly with China by balancing influence in the world, creating an environment in the region &#8220;that is maximally favorable to the United States, our allies and partners, and the interests and values we share.&#8221;Crucially, the document focuses not on the trade deals that made the TPP so unpopular, but on ideological ones, promoting &#8220;a free and open Indo-Pacific,&#8221; where countries &#8220;can make independent political choices free from coercion.&#8221; The U.S. will contribute to that atmosphere, the document says, &#8220;through investments in democratic institutions, a free press, and a vibrant civil society,&#8221; by strengthening partnerships within the region and outside it, such as the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). The plan promises that the U.S. will invest in the region through diplomacy, education, and security.&nbsp;In May, President Joe Biden hosted the U.S.&#8211;Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Special Summit in the U.S. for the first time &#8220;to re-affirm the United States&#8217; enduring commitment to Southeast Asia and underscore the importance of U.S.-ASEAN cooperation in ensuring security, prosperity, and respect for human rights.&#8221; And the State Department announced that &#8220;[t]he United States has provided over $12.1 billion in development, economic, health, and security assistance to Southeast Asian allies and partners since 2002, as well as over $1.4 billion in humanitarian assistance.&#8221;Also in May, in Japan, Biden and a dozen Indo-Pacific nations announced a new, loose economic bloc, one that Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo has called &#8220;by any account the most significant international economic engagement that the United States has ever had in this region.&#8221; The bloc includes the U.S., India, Japan, South Korea, Australia, Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, but not Taiwan. These countries represent about 40% of the global economy.&nbsp;The new plan promised to streamline supply chains, back clean energy, fight corruption, and expand technology transfers. But with no guaranteed access to U.S. markets, there was uncertainty about how effective the administration&#8217;s calls for better labor and environmental standards would be.Meanwhile, Secretary of State Antony Blinken also traveled to the region in early August, making stops in Cambodia, where he attended the U.S.-ASEAN ministerial meeting, the East Asia Summit Foreign Ministers&#8217; Meeting, and the ASEAN Regional Forum, and in the Philippines. Before leaving, he promised to &#8220;emphasize the United States&#8217; commitment to ASEAN centrality and successful implementation of the ASEAN Outlook on the Indo-Pacific&#8221; and to &#8220;address the COVID-19 pandemic, economic cooperation, the fight against climate change, the crisis in Burma, and Russia&#8217;s war in Ukraine.&#8221;&nbsp;Chinese leaders warned the U.S. there would be &#8220;serious consequences&#8221; if Pelosi visited, and pundits suggested that she was reckless for going. But both Biden and Blinken made it clear that any potential visit would not mean any change in U.S. policy toward Taiwan, and 26 Republican lawmakers made a public statement praising the visit and noting that it has precedent.&nbsp;Pelosi&#8217;s visit seemed to echo Biden and Blinken&#8217;s focus on world democracy. She championed Taiwan as a leading democracy, &#8220;a leader in peace, security and economic dynamism: with an entrepreneurial spirit, culture of innovation and technological prowess that are envies of the world.&#8221; She explicitly said her visit was intended to reaffirm &#8220;our shared interests [in]...advancing a free and open Indo-Pacific region.&#8221; &#8220;By traveling to Taiwan, we honor our commitment to democracy: reaffirming that the freedoms of Taiwan&#8212;and all democracies&#8212;must be respected.&#8221;&nbsp;When Pelosi&#8217;s plane landed, China immediately announced live fire operations nearby and cut certain diplomatic communications with the U.S. But Director of the Centre for Russia Europe Asia Studies Theresa Fallon noted that the Chinese blockade/live fire exercise &#8220;is likely to boomerang on Xi. This will&#8230;scare just about every other country in Asia,&#8221; she wrote on Twitter.&nbsp;Yesterday, U.S. Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns, six months into the job, did his first television interview. Emphasizing that Pelosi&#8217;s visit was in keeping with longstanding history, he said, &#8220;We do not believe there should be a crisis in US-China relations over the visit&#8212;the peaceful visit&#8212;of the Speaker of the House of Representatives to Taiwan...it was a manufactured crisis by the government in Beijing. It was an overreaction.&#8221; Burns added that it is now &#8220;incumbent upon the government here in Beijing to convince the rest of the world that it will act peacefully in the future&#8221; and observed that &#8220;there's a lot of concern around the world that China has now become an agent of instability in the Taiwan Strait and that's not in anyone's interest.&#8221;As drought, coronavirus lockdowns, and the Russian invasion of Ukraine hamstring the Chinese economy, China&#8217;s domination of the region seems wobbly. Apple is currently talking to Vietnam about making Apple Watches and MacBooks, moving production away from China. Vietnam already builds Apple products, but these new contracts would upgrade the Vietnamese technical sector in advance of what are expected to be more contracts.&nbsp;This week, the EU and Indonesia launched their first ever joint naval exercise in the Arabian Sea, with an announcement that &#8220;[t]he EU and Indonesia are committed to a free, open, inclusive and rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific region, underpinned by respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty, democracy, rule of law, transparency, freedom of navigation and overflight, unimpeded lawful commerce, and peaceful resolution of disputes. They reaffirm the primacy of international law, including the United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea (UNCLOS).&#8221;The U.S. and Taiwan, which was not included in the earlier economic organization, will start formal trade talks in the fall.&#8212;Notes:https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-leads-bipartisan-delegation-to-taiwan-reaffirmsimportance-ofpeace-and-partnershiphttps://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/mass-senator-ed-markey-among-lawmakers-visiting-taiwan-12-days-after-pelosi-trip/2807650/https://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-visits-south-korea-meets-with-president-yoon-to-reaffirm-us-south-korean-alliancehttps://www.cnn.com/2022/08/14/politics/congressional-delegation-taiwan/index.htmlhttps://www.markey.senate.gov/news/press-releases/senator-markey-leads-bipartisan-delegation-to-taiwan-reaffirmsimportance-ofpeace-and-partnershipVincent Chao @vyctwIn this context, Pelosi's visit makes sense. Stronger ties with both Democrat &amp; Republican leadership ensure continuity in the Taiwan-US relationship. Support for Taiwan - symbolic &amp; substantive - is essential as we face growing PRC pressure. Other countries will take note.

He&#8217;s hit safely in 27 of 34 games since July 11, with 13 multi-hit games, and is slashing .356/.400/.481 with three homers, eight doubles, and 16 RBIs over that span.\n&#8220;We&#8217;ve seen this coming,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;You take April away and look at it. Everybody should do that. Look at the numbers since April. Look where he ranks in regard to all second basemen in baseball and what he&#8217;s done.&#8221;\nIn April, Rodgers hit .078. Since then, he&#8217;s slashed .308/.357/.472 in 95 games. He leads all big-league second\nbasemen in hits (123) and leads all NL second basemen in batting average (.286), extra-base hits (39) and total bases (186).\nIn the seventh, Bernard drove in pinch-runner Sam Hilliard with a go-ahead single off Alex Cobb. Connor Joe led off the inning with a single and was then replaced by Hilliard. Black said the move was made for Hilliard&#8217;s speed and outfield defense.\nThe Rockies had limited the Giants to three hits entering the ninth inning but the Giants tagged closer Daniel Bard for a run on two hits. Bard yielded a two-out single to pinch hitter Tommy La Stella, who was replaced by pinch runner Austin Slater, who then swiped second base.\nUp stepped the dangerous Brandon Crawford, who had homered earlier in the game. He worked Bard to a 3-1 count before ripping an RBI double down the left-field line to tie the game. With first base open, the Rockies chose not to intentionally walk Crawford.\n&#8220;We thought about it,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;With two outs, maybe it makes some sense, right? But I trust Daniel and I think Daniel was going to pitch around him. I didn&#8217;t see that 3-1 pitch, whether it was a strike or not. &#8230; He probably didn&#8217;t locate the pitch where he wanted to.&#8221;\nFor Bard, it was just the third blown save of the season, after converting 16 straight.\nFeltner, making his 11th big-league start in what&#8217;s been a mixed-bag-of-a-season, gave up just one run on two hits over six innings. He struck out five, walked two, and threw an economical 86 pitches. His only major goof was giving up a leadoff homer to Joey Bart in the sixth.\n&#8220;There was a lot to like, starting with the intent to keep the ball down,&#8221;  Black said. &#8220;He did a pretty good job of that. He stayed under control with his mechanics until maybe the last eight to 10 pitches in the sixth. But he threw the ball extremely well. I&#8217;m very proud of him.&#8221;\nPrior to the game, Black went through a litany of things he wants to see from Feltner as the season winds down, including pitch command within the strike zone, pitch mix, and poise during certain moments of the game and certain at-bats. Saturday night, Feltner checked them all off his list.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Ryan McMahon endures sad glove story on bizarre second-inning play\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies rally twice but lose 11-inning heartbreaker to Giants\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMoneyball: MLB&#8217;s big-spending losers and frugal winners of 2022\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBaseball edges closer to implementing automatic strike zone in major leagues\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Jose Iglesias, who defected from Cuba, reaches 10 years in majors\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\nThe sixth inning was a case in point.

The exception was Colorado&#8217;s two-run third when it strung together four hits, the clutch hits an RBI double by Rodgers and a run-scoring single by Ryan McMahon.\nThe Rockies, who snapped a five-game losing streak with a 7-4 win over the Giants on Friday night, will go for the three-game sweep Sunday afternoon at Coors Field.\nColorado has won five of its last six games against the Giants since May 18 following a 12-game losing streak that stretched back to Aug. 15, 2021.",

In the dance programme alone there are two shows about living with chronic pain, and this funny, angry and wistful one by Australian Liz Lea about a severe case of endometriosis that had her regularly necking 10 Nurofen before lunchtime.Dancers make a living out of getting their bodies to behave and, as Lea tells us, by pushing the fine line between good pain and bad pain. Her pain tolerance was so high that her surgeon doubted she even needed the surgery (she really did) and compared cutting through her abdominal muscles to cutting through a brick wall – both are sources of misplaced pride in a body that was working against Lea and her dreams of having it all.Red is at Dance Base, Edinburgh, until 28 August.All our Edinburgh festival reviews.

        "description": "Gossip can work as a glue – and there is a more tactful way of communicating. Be less hard on yourself and learn to make ‘I statements’The question I can’t seem to stop gossiping and complaining about the people around me. This primarily happens at work and I am not the only person who does it; it is a toxic environment where bitching is the norm, so it is hard to resist. Every day I give myself a little talk about how I am not going to say a bad word about someone and every day I get sucked into gossip or end up saying something mean.

        "description": "In the looming clmate crisis, will old grape vines cope better with the drought and extreme heat than younger plants?Taste the Difference Old Vine Garnacha, Calatayud, Spain 2019 (£10, Sainsbury’s) Winemakers love old vines for many reasons. They love them for the history and continuity they represent. They love them for the extra depth of flavour and natural balance their grapes seem to deliver (in wines such as Sainsbury’s vividly brambly northern Spanish red). They even love them for the way they look: the roughly wrinkled bark of their twisted trunks inspiring a certain anthropomorphic association with the wisdom of elders. Perhaps most importantly and urgently of all however – not least in this unceasingly baking northern hemisphere summer – winemakers love older vines for the way they cope with the increasingly demented weather patterns brought about by the climate crisis. This last idea was the subject of a fascinating article on wine lovers’ website jancisrobinson.com earlier this month, in which the wine writer Tamlyn Currin gathered a wealth of first-person testimony from winemakers all over the world who have discovered that their older vines (35 years and older) cope far better with extreme heat and drought (as well as frost, flooding and disease pressure) than younger plants.Bellingham The Bernard Series Old Vine Chenin Blanc, Stellenbosch, South Africa 2020 (£11, Tesco) Why do old vines seem so much more resilient? Currin’s piece posits a handful of hypotheses, starting with the deeper roots that old vines have when compared to their younger peers – the consequence of a life without irrigation in which the vines have been forced to burrow deep down to find their water supply from the moment they were planted. Other possibilities, which Currin concedes require greater study, take in genetics, the complex interactions with fungus in old vines’ root systems, their structure and the possibility that, in Currin’s words, “like trees, vines ‘learn’ with time and age, and can even ‘support’ each other”. Whatever the reason, there is a gathering consensus in the wine world that old vines will have an essential role to play in wine production as the climate crisis worsens – a notion that makes vines such as the 40-year-olds used to make Bellingham’s magnificently rich, complex, toasty, tropically fruited Cape Chenin seem all the more valuable.

So if the opinions mean nothing now, what did they mean when they were alive? I would say they meant nothing then too. And if it applied to them it must certainly apply to me. I find it relaxing to know I don't have to figure everything out, because it doesn't matter what I think. It just doesn't matter. Now innovation might matter, but most of it goes unrecognized. My uncle for example, invented a windmill that didn't need to be repositioned to catch the wind. If the wind was blowing it would capture the energy. Earlier this evening I saw it had been invented again, because no one heard about my uncle's invention, except for people who loved him.

        "description": "Next week the former BBC stars launch The News Agents, their new daily podcast for Global. They talk about impartiality, making their TikTok debut – and how they both amuse and drive each other madIn February, it was announced – cue a certain amount of high drama on Twitter – that Emily Maitlis, the presenter of the BBC’s Newsnight, and Jon Sopel, its North America editor, would be leaving the broadcaster after 20 and 40 years respectively and joining Global, the owner of, among other radio stations, Classic FM, LBC and Heart. They would, we were told, be presenting a daily news podcast together, a format inspired by their partnership on Americast, a BBC series that had been a huge hit (at moments, it was the UK’s most listened to podcast in any genre). Was this a coup? It certainly was. Inside the BBC, no one had any idea that two of its biggest names were about to depart until after the pair had been driven, in a car with blacked-out windows, to Global’s HQ in Leicester Square to sign the deal of their lives in conditions of utmost secrecy. In media circles, the gossip thereafter was energetic and, possibly, somewhat envious. Both were reported to have won hefty pay rises in the process (at the BBC, Sopel earned at least £235,000 and Maitlis at least £325,000).And now here they are, the nearest thing British news has to a pair of high-octane celebrities, waiting to greet me on the other side of a set of security barriers, a small PR retinue in tow. How are they feeling? Are they nervous, excited or both? In fact, their mood seems to be set today to lightly giddy. Having worked on the podcast for weeks – dummies have been made, complete with real-life interviewees – both are about to disappear for a holiday before their launch at the end of this month. There is a feeling that school is out, at least for a while; Maitlis is wearing shorts with her heeled mules. Continue reading...",

A serial killer known as Babysitter is on the loose. Assumed to be “non-white” and “from the city”, he abducts and murders young white children, usually boys, leaving their bathed, naked bodies to be found with – “as in a cruel parody of mothering” – their freshly laundered clothes folded neatly beside them.Meanwhile, in the middle of the day, Hannah Jarrett – affluent 39-year-old Michigan housewife and mother of two – is making her nervous way down a plushly carpeted corridor on the 61st floor of the Renaissance Grand hotel. She’s here to meet a man she only knows as YK.

The kommunalka survived the Soviet years, but after the collapse of communism many were sold off and restored to private ownership. In St Petersburg, in particular, however, a housing crisis meant that a large number of the buildings remained communal. By the time the French photographer Françoise Huguier began to document them in 2001, perhaps 300,000 people still lived in these crumbling houses. Some had been resident since before the war.Huguier rented a room in one of the buildings and over the following decade lived there on and off for months at a time. She recalled her first night clearly: “Someone was kicking my bedroom door: I woke up with a jolt. It was four in the morning. Two guys holding bottles of vodka insisted we got to know one another. Their room was at the end of the corridor. On the way we bumped into an old woman. With a wave of her hand she seemed to say: don’t worry, I keep watch day and night…”Discretion, a retrospective of Françoise Huguier’s work, is being shown as part of the International Festival of Photojournalism in Perpignan, France, 27 August-11 September Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photograph by Gretchen Berger.\nBy Gretchen Berger\nFriday night marked the second and final performance of the Ukrainian Freedom Tour in New York City, with two free outdoor evening concerts at Lincoln Center’s Damrosch Park. The concerts were the culmination of Lincoln Center&#8217;s Summer for the City festival, which began in May.\nUkrainian Freedom Orchestra. Photograph by Peggy Taylor.\nThe Ukrainian Freedom Orchestra brings together world-class Ukrainian musicians in the artistic defense of their homeland, organized by the Metropolitan Opera and the Polish National Opera in solidarity with the victims of the Russian invasion.\nMaestro Keri-Lynn Wilson. Photograph by Peggy Taylor.\nThe 75-piece orchestra is led by Canadian-Ukrainian maestro Keri-Lynn Wilson, originally from Winnipeg, Canada, whose husband is the Metropolitan Opera General Manager, Peter Gelb. It was her idea to create the orchestra, whose members include many refugees from all over Ukraine – featuring some of the country’s top musicians, who perform in orchestras all over Europe.\nOpening night featured the orchestra playing the Ukrainian National Anthem. The program included masterful and rousing performances of the contemporary Ukrainian composer Valentin Silvestrov’s Symphony No. 7, Chopin’s Piano Concerto No. 2, Brahm’s Fourth Symphony, arias from Beethoven’s Fidelio and Verdi’s Aida, and Dvorak’s iconic From the New World symphony.\nAnna Fedorova, in red, and Monastyrska, in green. Photograph by Peggy Taylor.\nThe arias were performed by Ukrainian soprano Liudmyla Monastyrska, who replaced the Met’s Anna Netrebko after her contracts were cancelled in the wake of Russia’s invasion. The Chopin concerto was performed by renowned Ukrainian pianist Anna Fedorova. The band shell and park surroundings were beautifully lit, and the stage backlit, in the bright blue and yellow colors of the Ukrainian flag.\nThe audience loved it. Photograph by Peggy Taylor.\nThe park was packed with an audience of young and old, who were moved and elated by the orchestra’s amazing offerings on these beautiful nights. The orchestra’s 12-city tour ends on Saturday, with its final stop at the Kennedy Center in Washington, DC, after having toured earlier all over Europe.\nOne of the orchestra’s musicians best captured the spirit of these concerts with, “I don’t have a gun, but I have my cello.”",

But make no mistake:  this poisonous regime will always need its Great SatanIf any one man is to blame for gleeful Iranian crowing over the attack on Salman Rushdie, it is the country’s 83-year-old supreme leader, Ali Khamenei. The black-turbaned ayatollah’s bigoted, blinkered outlook has been poisoning the well of Iranian politics and society since he first took power in 1989.Kayhan newspaper, known as Khamenei’s mouthpiece, praised Rushdie’s assailant, saying “his hands should be showered with kisses”. A jubilant headline declared: “Devil’s neck under the sword”. While Iran denies responsibility for the attack, Khamenei has repeatedly endorsed the late Ruhollah Khomeini’s fatwa ordering Rushdie’s murder. Continue reading...",

That conjures up conflicting images in popular culture: is it knitwear and cruises, or divorce and microdosing? Either way, there’s a notion of freedom – to take up ceramics, become a sourdough bore, do an Open University degree or, as a woman from my choir apparently did, just stand in the garden and scream.About the screaming: I’m not actually feeling the need, for now. I have always enjoyed my sons’ progress towards autonomy. It’s not wholly selfish (though I can’t wait to live off toast and takeaways).

She talks about giggling on set and why British shows need to be braverIt might be the medical breakthrough the world has been waiting for. Based on a sample size of one, it appears that an Emmy nod can cure Covid. Sarah Niles was laid up in bed at home in London when she heard that, 5,000 miles away in Los Angeles, she’d been nominated for best supporting actress in a comedy series. “I was feeling really sick,” she says, “but I soon got better. A few hours later I started testing negative.”Her role as the sports psychologist Dr Sharon Fieldstone in the hit football comedy Ted Lasso has brought overdue acclaim for an actor who’s been flitting between stage and screen for two decades. Niles is a regular performer at the National Theatre, the Royal Court, the Old Vic and the RSC. TV viewers might recognise her from I May Destroy You, as Officer Funmi, who interviews Michaela Coel’s character after she’s raped. Or from Catastrophe, as Sharon Horgan’s sarky schoolteacher colleague Melissa. Film fans might know her from Mike Leigh’s Happy-Go-Lucky, or Sarah Gavron’s Rocks. Continue reading...",

Two years before the next general election it is obvious – just as it was in 1977 before Margaret Thatcher won in 1979 – that the existing policy framework has reached its sell-by date. Then it was the postwar settlement – including incomes policies and public ownership – whose weaknesses were becoming ever harder to defend, even among those of us who recognised its strengths. At the very least it needed a wholesale rethink and makeover, or, as Thatcher argued, be repudiated with a bracing new framework adopted in its place.So, in 2022 we have the prospect of 13% inflation or even higher, swingeing energy bills that will topple millions into destitution. Add in the failures of privatisation dramatised by excessive water leakages and raw sewage blighting many beaches and rivers, an impossibly overstretched NHS, and workers being badged as irresponsible for merely trying to resist dramatic cuts in their real incomes. All this has crystallised how the whole Thatcherite edifice of economic and social policy, decaying for years, is suddenly and obviously redundant. Continue reading...",

        "description": "A new US television deal enriches the Premier League further still. Will the game remain insulated from wider society, or help reshape it?Last week, the Premier League announced a $2.7bn (£2.3bn), six-year American TV deal with Comcast NBC, a sum that will push the league’s annual turnover above £6bn and marks the moment at which income from foreign media rights income exceeds domestic income. It is a fitting marker for the league’s 30th season and its three decades of hyper-globalisation. First, the Premier League’s global TV audience outstripped domestic viewership. Then the entirely foreign XI fielded by Chelsea in 1999 announced the globalisation of the league’s labour market; foreign players now make up around three-quarters of the club’s squads. Foreign coaches, once entirely absent, are now in the majority, as are foreign owners, who hold majority stakes in 16 out of the 20 clubs.The league has benefited from an income-sharing model among the clubs that ensures, if not widespread competition for the top spots, a fiercely competitive league on a game by game basis, as it has from astute marketing, world-class broadcasting and the value of English as a global language. But it is economic globalisation itself that has been the main driver, generating an upward spiral of growth. Over the past 30 years, seemingly impervious to the global financial crisis, austerity and Brexit, the league’s annual turnover has soared by an astronomical 2,900%. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Trees, shrubs and borders are quite happy without fertiliserThere is much received wisdom in horticulture that essentially takes a standard idea from agriculture and scales it down to the level of a domestic garden plot. While this might initially seem sensible, it turns out that pretty much every aspect of a garden is totally different to a farmer’s field, so, in reality, this approach rarely works. Perhaps the most important of these mistaken approaches lies in how we fertilise our plots. Changing how you do this will almost certainly save you time, money and even help the environment, too.A lot of standard horticultural advice is based on the premise that regular applications of fertiliser are absolutely crucial to healthy plant growth. This means lugging around big bags of manure to dig in each autumn, often after a summer of dosing up hundreds of watering cans with liquid feed. According to some advice on growing tomatoes, for example, you’d likely spend more on fertiliser than the value of the fruit you get. However, the scientific reality is that the vast majority of these laborious applications are not just entirely unnecessary, but can actually produce worse results. Excess nitrogen, for example, has been widely demonstrated to result in soft, sappy, growth that is less resistant to environmental stresses, reduces the sugar content of harvests and even suppresses flowering. That’s before we consider the fact that run-off can pollute groundwater and the huge amount of carbon emissions created in the production of fertiliser in the first place. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Created by artist Annie Lord as a commission from Art Walk Projects, &#8216;The Neighbouring Orchard&#8217; is a network of 160 apple trees planted by individuals across the East of Edinburgh and East Lothian. It spans several neighbourhoods including the coastal suburbs of Portobello and Musselburgh and, further inland, Craigmillar. Each tree is planted in a visible location – in front gardens, in shared tenement greens, in school playgrounds and in communal land. The first trees were planted in the winter of 2020. The following is an excerpt from Annie&#8217;s book documenting the project, accompanied by photos by Ellie J McMaster.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbi\n\n\n\nMeetings\n\n\n\nTo begin with, the growers meet each other not in their gardens but through their screens. In late spring 2021, when the leaves of the apples unfurl, I begin to meet a group of them for a weekly online drawing class. I parcel up packages of notebooks, pencils and charcoal and send them out in the post. Each week we sit down at our computers and learn how to really look at our trees. Our pencils echo the gentle serrated edges of the leaves. Our charcoal smudges across the page, giving form and shape to our markings. At the end of the session, we hold up the drawings of our trees to the screen, a small digital orchard taking shape.\n\n\n\nWe set up a Facebook page, so that we can share photos, ask questions and post updates. At first, the trees show up as brown sticks, planted in dormant wintery gardens. Here is one in a neatly organised front garden, another in a muddy back green, another surrounded by a group of happy but cold gardeners. And then, in a flurry of spring, the buds appear, and the growers’ comments are punctuated with an increasing number of exclamation points.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCindy\n\n\n\nLater, we begin to meet in person. On a warm September day, a small group of the growers meet on a piece of land by the shoreline, where two of the Neighbouring Orchard trees are planted. There, we light a small bonfire, and gather round it while I show the group how to make drawing charcoal from the winter prunings of their apple trees. It is a jewel of a day, filled with laughter and a buoyant sense of lightness. We make the charcoal in old, round sweetie tins. The prunings are packed in, brown and twiggy, and nestled into the flames of the fire. When they are ready, I lift them out and we impatiently wait for them to be cool enough to handle. With gloved hands, I open the still toasty tin, and laugh out loud as the small group gasp at the sight of transformation. Our prunings are now sticks of velvet black charcoal – ready to be picked up in fingertips and dragged across a piece of paper, a rock, or the tarmacked pavement. Everything feels heightened, and as I leave, I feel a dull ache form at my temples, my brain unaccustomed to this much joy.\n\n\n\n160 trees have been planted. And each of these trees is looked after by either an individual, a family, a group of colleagues or neighbours. I have met many of them, some in passing as they collect their trees, others for long conversations over cups of coffee. Many of them I stop and say hello to on the street, others I have only talked to by email or through Facebook posts. It is a source of great happiness to find points of connection with so many people, to share with them this desire to plant and grow. There are other growers whom I have never met, and for them their connection to their trees, and to this wider artwork, remains private. This is no matter; to plant the tree is enough. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHelen\n\n\n\nEarth, Tarmac, Sea\n\n\n\nIt is rough land: a strip of earth, a stretch of tarmac to house the bins, a tumble of defensive boulders and beyond them – the sea. Alongside his neighbours, Robin has begun to tend to this land, planting fruit trees and bushes. They are some of the most coastal trees of The Neighbouring Orchard. Robin sits on the wooden steps which link his garden to this patch of ground and gestures to what he and his neighbours have created.\n\n\n\n“Well sadly it’s a short-term thing. I mean climate change and rising sea levels are inevitable and this will be underwater here. This is only going to be for thirty, forty years or so. It’s a good time for an apple tree but it’s not as long as it could be. And it is sad to think of that&#8230; Our house, all the forecasts are that it won’t be able to survive fifty years&#8230; It definitely doesn’t feel like a safe thing. I don’t know when people are going to start realising. It feels like we’re walking into this thing going, ah yeah, but it’s a nice day today.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIslay\n\n\n\nThe neighbours who have lived here for decades have watched tidal surges swoop over the rocks. The garden, hopes Robin, in all its rootedness, “helps a little bit against that&#8230;This space, it feels really nice to be doing something. It’s still quite a long period for a garden.”\n\n\n\nAnd when the waters rise further, “Those apples can be grafted, they can move on, they can be in different places.” He gestures inland to an imagined, future orchard, “These were the trees that were by Eastfield.”\n\n\n\nIt is a strange place to occupy, holding hope for the future of the trees, whilst also acknowledging the inevitable loss of ground.\n\n\n\n“I hope that they can withstand the sea and that they’ll be a place where we can sit under, where we can make things together with the apples that we grow. And it’s not just them, it’s a lot more than them, so I’m imagining fruit bushes round here. Picnics, hanging out, just being together. Maybe there’ll be a hammock between a couple of trees at some point. A welcoming space.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRobin\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\nThe book that accompanies &#8216;The Neighbouring Orchard&#8217; is to be released on 1 September. More information about the project and the book&#8217;s launch and sale can be found via Annie Lord&#8217;s website.",

        "description": "(Anti-)The turbulent, everyday lives of others populate the California singer-songwriter’s masterly new albumWhose emotions are these, anyway? Cass McCombs’s 10th album is an easy, rolling record that grapples with inner complexity, telling stories about musicians and soldiers, lovers and seekers. Even as this seasoned US singer-songwriter butts up against philosophical quandaries or quotes from Sufism, he never loses track of the everyday. When he isn’t making singular records, McCombs has worked in demolition and crashed on couches; his is a landscape of fast-food restaurants and karaoke machines, where vans break down, people make mistakes and die too soon.A gentle, psychedelic wash glazes this set of songs whose musical erudition is worn lightly. The album’s opener, Music Is Blue, is a masterclass in how to wring effortless prettiness out of progressive time signatures and jazz drums. The lovely Karaoke is a lovelorn Teenage Fanclub shuffle that wonders whether we all just perform secondhand emotions, where McCombs questions a relationship quoting everything from Unchained Melody to Stand By Your Man. The exceptional Unproud Warrior, by contrast, spins the tale of a soldier returned from war, living with the consequences of choices he has made; the question of his culpability is greyed out magnificently.

        "description": "The German film-maker’s partly fictionalised account of an imperial army soldier who refused to surrender until 1974 frustratingly fails to get inside its fascinating subject’s headWe’ve all heard about the Japanese soldier who, after the second world war ended, stayed on the Philippine jungle island where he was stationed, armed and lethal, dismissing all signs that Japan had been defeated as enemy propaganda. His name was Hiroo Onoda; he finally stood down in 1974 after almost 30 years of delusional guerrilla warfare and died in 2014. Werner Herzog, the prolific German film-maker who narrates his documentaries in a Wagnerian register (wonderfully parodied in the YouTube video Werner Herzog Reads Where’s Waldo?), contrived to meet Onoda in 1997 and has now written a very short, only partially satisfying book about him. The Twilight World is best described as a nonfiction account of Onoda’s long, pointless mission that phases in and out of fiction – or vice versa.So why didn’t Herzog do the obvious thing and make a film about Onoda instead? Perhaps because another film-maker got there first: Arthur Harari, whose impressive feature Onoda: 10,000 Nights in the Jungle has recently been released. Stretches of The Twilight World read like a screenplay or documentary outline that’s been injected with prose fiction growth hormones. In the expository and digressive passages, it’s impossible not to hear Herzog’s famous voice ringing charismatically in the inner ear (just as that of Quentin Tarantino resounded unmistakably in his recent novelisation Once Upon a Time in Hollywood). If a less celebrated figure than Herzog presented their editor with a book this slight, they’d probably be sent back to their desk to imagine their way deeper into the psychic jungle, fleshing it out with a few more chapters. Which is to say: we’re here for the writer as much as for the story. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Laughter has been far more than a coping mechanism amid repression and economic crisis – it has rid the island of tyrantsSri Lanka’s been a joke for a while. At least for those compelled to live here. A deeply unfunny joke without a punchline. An island of uncanny beauty, blessed with an abundance of resources and a vibrant and literate population, Sri Lanka manages to produce ugliness on a consistent basis across a range of catastrophes.The country has an unending supply of tragedy, absurdity and unorthodox cricketers, though it has run short of most other things – like petrol, gas, electricity, imports and competent leaders. As the economic crisis deepens, queues lengthen and prices soar, the output of jokes, memes, cartoons, skits, TikToks and fake news sites has been prolific. Continue reading...",

Inflation has burst above 10% for the first time since Argentina was gearing up to invade the Falklands in early 1982. Prices are rising far more quickly than wages. Consumer confidence has plumbed depths not seen during any of the many misfortunes of the past half century.And yet, the official data shows the British public is carrying on shopping regardless. Retail sales were higher in July than they were in June despite the progressively tighter squeeze on living standards. Airports are busy with holidaymakers, house prices keep on rising. Odd sort of crisis, you might think. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Children’s TV stars dressed as Elizabethans have my four-year-old and me enthralledAs we stroll into the Globe, my son gasps. ‘We’re here!’ he says, heartily impressed. It would be wonderful to say this was due to some precocious adoration of England’s bard on his part, but he’s actually recognising it from the ads he’d seen for the Globe on the tube a few days earlier, and which I’d painstakingly reminded him he would be visiting very soon. Since this poster was right beside a much brighter poster advertising Paw Patrol LIVE at Wembley Arena, it took considerably more time to explain that his favourite troupe of libertarian canines would not be in attendance. He would, however, see some of his favourite TV characters, since this was a CBeebies performance of As You Like It, featuring some of the channel’s biggest stars.CBeebies is, of course, a staple of both our lives. To my son, Justin Fletcher’s Mr Tumble is something between Elvis and Jesus Christ. To me, he’s often been something like a co-parent. I don’t think there’s a parent in the UK who doesn’t value the contribution they make to society, and there’s a fair majority who’d burn Downing Street to the ground if their proposed, unjustified cuts to CBBC exceed their reach and target its younger sibling. This is not a neutral position, but I refuse to adopt one. There is such a thing as a public good, and thoughtful, diverse and informative free-to-air children’s programming is just such a thing. We’re just lucky that beyond all that, CBeebies programming is also funnier, smarter, sillier and wiser than it has to be, year after year. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The daughter of a close ally to Russian President Vladimir Putin has been killed in a car explosion that, reports claim, was targeted at her father.\n\n\n\nDarya Dugina died when the car she was driving exploded on Saturday evening after leaving a literary festival near Moscow, which she had attended with her father, Alexander Dugin.\n\n\n\nDugina, a prominent journalist who openly supported Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, was driving her father’s car, a Toyota Land Cruiser Prado. For some reason, her father took a different vehicle at the last minute, reported Russian news service TASS.\n\n\n\n“As far as I understand, Alexander or probably they together, were the target,&#8221; said Andrey Krasnov, the head of the Russian Horizon social movement and a person familiar with her, according to the news service.\n\n\n\nDugina was sanctioned by the U.K. government last month for being a “frequent and high-profile contributor of disinformation in relation to Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Ukraine on various online platforms.” She promoted “policies or actions that destabilize Ukraine,” the U.K. government stated.\n\n\n\nHer father, Dugin, a political strategist, is believed to be a key adviser to Putin. Dugin&#8217;s philosophy, known as the &#8220;Russian world,&#8221; has been cited as a motivation for the invasions of both Ukraine and, prior to that, Georgia.\n\n\n\nDugin is an ultra-nationalist whose previous publication, Foundations of Geopolitics, has been widely used to influence the Russian military, police, and foreign policy elites, according to reports. He also employed his daughter Dugina as his&nbsp;press secretary.\n\n\n\nDugina died at the scene, according to the press service of the Russian Investigative Committee in the Moscow region, reported TASS on Sunday. The car was engulfed in flames and left the road, hitting a building in the Odintsovo urban district near the village of Bolshiye Vyazemy.\n\n\n\nThe head of the Donetsk People&#8217;s Republic has blamed “terrorists of the Ukrainian regime.&#8221;\n\n\n\n&#8220;The progress and results of the investigation of the criminal case are under the control of the Moscow Region Prosecutor&#8217;s Office,&#8221; the press service said.\n\n\n\n“All possible versions of the crime are being probed,&#8221; the press service added.",

        "description": "Donmar Warehouse, LondonThe ‘dinosaur’ generation is put on trial in Dawn King’s near-future new play, graced by some nicely nuanced performances from its youthful castThe Trials is fuelled by more than one mission. The centre of Dawn King’s new play is a debate about the climate crisis: when a window is opened on to Georgia Lowe’s sweatily crammed set, gusts of sepia smoke belch in; the world outside is bilious. Yet it goes beyond this to look at intergenerational acrimony and at what counts as justice. As important, Natalie Abrahami’s production aims to open up the idea of who appears on stage and, so, of who owns the default gaze in a theatre. More than half the cast are teenagers making their professional debuts.In an unspecified time – a future now – the youth are gathered to decide whether particular members of their parents’ generation are climate crisis criminals. The arraigned – played by Lucy Cohu, Nigel Lindsay and Sharon Small – have worked for an oil company, had several non-vegan children, flown around the world. Can guilt be graded? Is remorse a mitigating factor? When does justice become revenge, and suspicion of a “dinosaur” generation begin to interfere with making out the facts? The penalties, delivered to a fizz of red fluorescence, are severe.The Trials is at the Donmar Warehouse, London, until 27 August Continue reading...",

There’s a castle on an island, a beer fountain and miles of wild flowers.

But can planting a trillion trees really save the world?Visiting the Eden Reforestation Projects in Goiás, Brazil, and interviewing numerous international scientists and activists, the journalist Zach St. George offers a vivid insight into the root of the tree-planting movement — from the Green Belt Movement of the 1970s to the Trillion Tree Campaign of the 2010s — and considers the concept’s environmental potential, as well as the movement’s shortcomings.This story was written by Zach St. George and recorded by Audm.

Razvozhaev said it involved a single drone. Footage from a local Telegram channel appears to back that up.

Think Alfred and the cakes or Robert the Bruce and his study of spiders. For Russia, it has long been Grand Prince Vladimir, who had 800 concubines and wives before choosing Christ over Muhammad at the end of the first millennium for the very Russian reason that Islam did not permit alcohol. In truth, Vladimir (or Volodymyr to the Ukrainians) is a classic founding figure, now a saint, about whom almost nothing is known. Yet according to President Putin, unveiling a monstrous statue to him in 2016, he “gathered and defended Russia’s lands… by founding a strong, united and centralised state”.As Orlando Figes’s new history methodically lays bare, this is both myth-making of the first order and of profound importance to understanding Russia today. From Ivan to Peter, Catherine to Nicholas, Russia’s rulers have reforged these myths to suit their own purposes, sometimes as a defensive standard for the people to rally round, sometimes as a badge of celestial honour to cement Moscow’s place as the saviour of the west.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/3608441-trump-pushes-for-un-redacted-affidavits-release-despite-the-risks/",
        "description": "Former President Trump is pushing for the full, unredacted release of the affidavit that led to the search warrant for his Mar-a-Lago estate, a move that carries risks for both Trump and the Justice Department.\n\n\n\n“Pres. Trump has made his view clear that the American people should be permitted to see the unredacted affidavit related to the raid and break-in of his home,” Taylor Budowich, a spokesperson for the former president, said Thursday after Federal Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart said he may be willing to unseal portions of the document.\n\n\n\nReinhart ordered Justice Department officials to suggest redactions to the document by next Thursday.\n\n\n\n“Today, magistrate Judge Reinhard rejected the DOJ’s [Justice Department's] cynical attempt to hide the whole affidavit from Americans,” Budowich continued. “However, no redactions should be necessary and the whole affidavit should be released, given the Democrats’ penchant for using redactions to hide government corruption, just like they did with the Russia hoax.”\n\n\n\nTrump and his supporters have for years believed the FBI and Justice Department are biased against the former president, arguing that the bureau improperly surveilled his 2016 presidential campaign.\n\n\n\nTrump separately posted on Truth Social, his social media platform, calling for the “immediate release” of the unredacted affidavit, citing the need for transparency. He also called for Reinhart to recuse himself from the case without giving a clear reason.\n\n\n\nThe rhetoric from Trump and his camp follows a similar playbook, experts say, in which the former president demands the release of potentially sensitive information.\n\n\n\nIf the government and judge decline to release the full, unredacted document, it allows Trump and his allies to claim federal law enforcement is hiding something, further fueling distrust among Trump supporters.\n\n\n\n“It certainly is consistent with a project of delegitimizing law enforcement and law enforcement targeting him in particular,” said Dan Richman, a law professor at Columbia University. “Because he knows, as everybody knows, the government will regardless of the case be averse to the disclosure of search warrants as an institutional matter.”\n\n\n\nThe affidavit, which was used to convince Reinhart that there was enough evidence to support the probable cause needed to obtain a search warrant, contains information about the federal law enforcement investigation into Trump’s handling of material marked classified following his departure from the White House.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department has argued that released the affidavit could jeopardize an ongoing investigation, as well as the sources of information in the case. Releasing identifying information about those sources could lead to threats. Reinhart, for example, has been subjected to threats since signing off on the warrant for the Mar-a-Lago search.\n\n\n\nBeyond the risks for the Justice Department, there could be some risks for Trump should the full affidavit come out.\n\n\n\n“There is a risk if it seems like he was sharing intel with unauthorized parties while out of office,” said one former Trump adviser, who noted that such details could ultimately be redacted by the government.\n\n\n\nExperts also pointed out that the affidavit could reveal exchanges between the Justice Department and Trump’s team discussing the need to return sensitive materials, ultimately showing the government had made multiple good faith efforts to secure the documents in question before resorting to a search warrant.\n\n\n\nThe release of the affidavit could also carry political risks for Trump if it bolsters the case that Trump mishandled classified information.\n\n\n\nPolling has already showed a significant percentage of voters believe Trump may have broken the law as president.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Politico-Morning Consult poll released days after the Mar-a-Lago search found roughly half of registered voters approved of the raid, though only 15 percent of Republicans approved. And 58 percent of voters said they believe Trump definitely or probably broke the law as president.\n\n\n\nWhile calls to release the affidavit are likely to galvanize his hardcore supporters, it could ultimately create further concerns for the broader public. Trump will have to win over a broader base to win the White House if he runs for president in 2024.\n\n\n\nRichman, the Columbia law professor, said he would not expect it to be the end of the matter if the judge opts to release the affidavit with limited or no redactions, saying the government would likely appeal such a decision.\n\n\n\n“I would expect that central to the appeal would be the broader institutional question of whether this ought to be done,” Richman said. “It could set a really poor precedent for high profile searches in the future.”",

With the score reset at 2-2, the Syracuse bullpen blinked first, as Trey Cobb gave up solo homers in the seventh and eighth innings. Vientos closed the gap with a solo homer of his own- and man, he’s been on fire lately- but Daniel Palka and Travis Blankenhorn weren’t able to follow him with late inning heroics.\n\nCF Travis Jankowski: 1-4, RBI, BB, 2 K\n1B Dominic Smith: 1-4, R, HBP\n3B Mark Vientos: 2-5, R, 2B, HR (22), 2 RBI, K\nDH Daniel Palka: 1-5, 2 K\nRF Travis Blankenhorn: 0-2, 3 BB, 2 K\nLF Khalil Lee: 0-4, 3 K\nSS JT Riddle: 2-4, R, K, E (8)\n2B Gosuke Katoh: 1-3\nC Juan Loyo: 1-4, 3 K\nRHP Jose Rodriguez: 5.0 IP, 2 H, 2 R, 0 ER, 3 BB, 0 K\nRHP Trey Cobb: 3.0 IP, 2 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 1 BB, 3 K, HBP, L (6-2)\n\nROSTER ALERT: New York Mets selected the contract of LHP Rob Zastryzny from Syracuse Mets.\nROSTER ALERT: New York Mets optioned LHP Sam Clay to Syracuse Mets.\nROSTER ALERT: New York Mets sent RHP R.J.

While Binghamton was able to pound out seven hits, not a single one went for extra bases; that’s not exactly conducive to scoring runs last time I checked. \n\n2B Wyatt Young: 1-3, BB, K\nC Nick Meyer: 1-4\nSS Ronny Mauricio: 1-4, K\nCF Brandon McIlwain: 0-4, 2 K\n3B Luke Ritter: 0-4, K\nLF Carlos Cortes: 2-4, R\nDH Jeremy Vasquez: 1-4, RBI, K\nRF Zach Ashford: 0-3\n1B Matt Winaker: 1-3, K\nRHP Alex Valverde: 3.2 IP, 5 H, 4 R, 4 ER, 3 BB, 3 K, L (1-6)\nRHP Hunter Parsons: 2.1 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 2 BB, 1 K\nRHP Joe Zanghi: 2.0 IP, 1 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 0 BB, 6 K\n\n\nHigh-A: Brooklyn Cyclones (26-21/56-57)\n\nHUDSON VALLEY 5, BROOKLYN 1 (BOX)\nLuis Moreno was playing with fire all evening, issuing a ton of walks and giving up plenty of contact, but things finally came to a head in the sixth. He started off the frame with a walk, hit the next batter, and after a mound visit settled him down enough to record an out, he wasn’t able to finish the frame, as he served up a three-run homer. Sammy Tavarez gave up two more runs during his time on the mound but they really wouldn’t matter as Brooklyn was barely able to manage one.\n\nLF Matt Rudick: 0-3, R, BB\nDH Alex Ramirez: 2-4, SB (4)\n1B JT Schwartz: 0-3, K, HBP\n2B Jose Peroza: 2-3, 2B, BB\n3B William Lugo: 0-3, K, HBP\nRF Stanley Consuegra: 1-4, SB (4)\nC Matt O’Neill: 0-3, BB, 2 K\nCF Jaylen Palmer: 0-3, 2 K\nSS Shervyen Newton: 0-3, 2 K\nRHP Luis Moreno: 5.1 IP, 3 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 6 BB, 4 K, HBP, E (2), L (1-7)\nRHP Sammy Tavarez: 2.2 IP, 2 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 0 BB, 3 K\nLHP Daniel Juarez: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 0 K\n\nROSTER ALERT: LHP Daniel Juarez assigned to Brooklyn Cyclones from St. Lucie Mets.\n\nSingle-A: St. Lucie Mets (25-22/65-47)\n\nLAKELAND 5, ST. LUCIE 3 (BOX)\nThe Flying Tigers took an early lead, but St. Lucie quickly found themselves on top in the third. That lead would not last long, as Benito Garcia gave up three runs in the bottom of the fourth to put Lakeland on top. Chase Estep put them within a run with a seventh inning solo shot, but Manuel Sequera hit a solo shot of his own in the bottom of the inning off of Jace Beck to give Lakeland the breathing room back- breathing room that would ultimately end up unneeded.\n\nCF Tanner Murphy: 1-5\n3B Chase Estep: 1-4, 2 R, HR (2), RBI\nLF Omar De Los Santos: 1-4, R, 2 K\nRF Carlos Dominguez: 0-4, 2 K\n1B Raul Beracierta: 2-4\n2B Justin Guerrera: 0-3, BB, 2 K, E (14)\nSS Brad Malm: 1-4, 2 K\nDH Blaine McIntosh: 1-4, K, CS (2)\nC Gregory Leal: 1-3, 2 E (1, 2)\nPH Eduardo Salazar: 0-1\nRHP Calvin Ziegler: 2.1 IP, 1 H, 1 R, 0 ER, 3 BB, 2 K\nRHP Benito Garcia: 2.2 IP, 2 H, 3 R, 3 ER, 3 BB, 3 K, WP, L (2-2)\nRHP Jace Beck: 3.0 IP, 2 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 2 BB, 3 K\n\n\nComplex: FCL Mets (33-20)\n\nFCL METS 5, FCL NATIONALS 0 (BOX)\n\n\nREHAB ALERT CF Jake Mangum: 1-3, 3B, RBI, 2 BB\nSS Jett Williams: 0-3, RBI, BB, K, HBP, 2 SB (5, 6)\nDH Kevin Parada: 0-3, RBI, BB, BP\n3B Jacob Reimer: 0-4\n1B Vincent Perozo: 3-4, R, 2B\n2B D’Andre Smith: 0-4, E (1)\nRF Dyron Campos: 1-4, 2 R, RBI\nC Andriel Lantigua: 0-3, R, 2 K, PB (3)\nLF Rhylan Thomas: 3-4, R, 2B\nRHP Douglas Orellana: 5.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 8 K, W (3-4)\nLHP Luke Bartnicki: 1.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 1 BB, 2 K, H (1)\nRHP Jawilme Ramirez: 3.0 IP, 1 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 4 K, S (1)\n\nROSTER ALERT: LHP Luke Bartnicki assigned to FCL Mets.\nROSTER ALERT: RHP Mathieu Voros assigned to FCL Mets.\nStar of the Night\nMark Vientos\nGoat of the Night\nTrey Cobb",

The string quartet playing in the pit turns shrill and discordant.This is not a show for the faint-hearted. Nor would you expect an adaptation of Hanya Yanagihara’s bestselling novel to be. Its 720 pages are an exercise in wretchedness, a relentless picking apart of wounds in which Jude, incessantly abused as a child, navigates an adult life in which everyone loves him, even as he hates himself.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/3605783-lets-talk-about-the-next-chips-act/",
        "description": "President Biden and lawmakers from both sides of the aisle gathered recently in the Rose Garden to sign the CHIPS and Science Act into law. Heralded by supporters as a significant investment in U.S. competitiveness and innovation, this legislation has been the cause for recent bipartisan praise — and rightfully so. The bill injects more than $280 billion into U.S. manufacturing and research of semiconductor chips, but it’s only a first step toward solving global chip production issues. \n\n\n\nTensions with Russia and China have disrupted supply chains already weakened by two years of the pandemic and strained economies. As a result, these overburdened supply chains continue to hamstring companies’ yearly targets.The CEO of Lucid Group, a U.S.-based electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer, cited “extraordinary supply chain and logistics challenges” as the reason for their halved production forecast, primarily due to a limited supply of semiconductors from China. The five major automakers were not spared, either; this year, Toyota marked a drastic 42 percent drop in profit after struggling with rising materials prices.\n\n\n\nNone of this is news in global manufacturing. The funding earmarked in the CHIPS and Science Act seeks to reduce these vulnerabilities by incentivizing U.S. production of semiconductors. But what about the critical metals and minerals needed to make these semiconductors and revive other U.S. manufacturing? The materials required to build the parts are not addressed at all in the bill, and that supply chain is almost as dire, if not more so, than the one for semiconductors.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToday, the U.S. relies almost entirely on foreign sources to supply critical metals such as titanium, lithium and rare earths. Without access to these materials, there can be no advanced American manufacturing. Furthermore, these metals and their mineral feedstocks are essential parts of the technologies required to reduce our carbon emissions and secure our national defense. It’s a matter of U.S. national security.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTake titanium, for example. Titanium metal is widely used, most notably in the global aerospace, medical, and defense sectors. Its excellent resistance to corrosion and high strength-to-weight ratio make titanium a formidable and lasting material in everything from airplanes to electric vehicles, medical devices, and even consumer goods such as watches, phones and computers. Lighter weight and longer lasting than steel, titanium also plays a critical role in the production of U.S. military equipment like fighter jets and missiles.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet, despite America’s increasing demand for titanium, we no longer produce almost any of it in the United States. The last titanium metal sponge plant closed in Nevada over two years ago, and now the U.S. relies on a titanium supply chain largely controlled by Russia and China. With so much of our defense and national infrastructure dependent on titanium, the U.S. cannot afford to delay investing in its own domestic titanium supply infrastructure. \n\n\n\nIn addition to the funds set aside to re-shore semiconductor production, the CHIPS and Science Act pumps billions of dollars into cutting-edge research and development for technologies that will help the U.S. produce semiconductors and other advanced materials.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome of these technologies already exist, including our technology, the Hydrogen Assisted Metallothermic Reduction (HAMR) process developed by metallurgist Dr. Zhigang Zak Fang of the University of Utah, with support from the U.S. Department of Energy. This technology can transform almost any form of titanium mineral or titanium scrap feedstock into low-cost, low-carbon titanium metal. The technology can use scrap metal that is sitting in landfills to make essential components for space exploration, defense and electric vehicles.  \n\n\n\nThe CHIPS and Science Act deserves its place among landmark legislation of the past quarter-century, but the government should act quickly to catalyze targeted investment in U.S. critical metal and mineral production. If we take advantage of the resources under our feet and scale up domestic innovative production technologies, U.S. industry can outpace foreign competitors and reshore supplies critical for a stronger America.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnastasios “Taso” Arima is the co-founder and CEO of IperionX, a developer of U.S.-based sustainable critical minerals, including titanium, and critical material supply chains. The company holds the rights to the Titan Project, a critical mineral project in west Tennessee. ",

        "description": "Earlier this week, I reported that the Acer Chromebook Spin 514 appeared on Acer&#x2019;s site for purchase. And like clockwork, this ChromeOS laptop with a AMD Ryzen CPU showed up at Best Buy for the same price. It&#x2019;s new and shiny, so you should get it, right?  I&#x2019;m not so sure. I&#x2019;d probably pass on this new AMD Ryzen Chromebook at $549.\n\n\n\nNo, I don&#x2019;t have a review unit. Nor have I used it. Typically, I try not to pass judgment on devices that I haven&#x2019;t personally tested. In this case, I&#x2019;m making an exception though. \n\n\n\nHere&#x2019;s why.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcer announced this device back in May, saying there were four AMD processors in upcoming Chromebooks. These chipsets were said to use AMD&#x2019;s Zen 3 chip architecture. Out of the four chipsets, the new Acer Chromebook Spin 514 uses base Ryzen chip. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpecifically, it&#x2019;s the AMD Ryzen 3 5125C. That chip has 2 CPU cores, each capable of running a pair of processing threads, for a total of 4. The maximum clock speed is 3.0 GHz. These CPUs are supplemented by a trio of GPU cores. The 8 GB of included memory is shared between the Radeon graphics and the CPU.\n\n\n\nWhile that may sound good, this is really a slight upgrade from the prior AMD chipsets found in Chromebooks from 2019. Of course, if you never used an AMD Chromebook from then, you haven nothing to compare this model to. \n\n\n\nThat&#x2019;s where Geekbench comes in. This benchmarking toolset lets you compare performance test results between two different devices. And in the case of this new AMD Ryzen Chromebook, the results are on par with a 10th gen Intel Core i5 processor, notes Chrome Unboxed.\n\n\n\nImage courtesy of Chrome Unboxed\n\n\n\nArmed with that info, from a performance standpoint, I&#x2019;m wondering why any significant number of buyers would drop $549 on this. \n\n\n\nYou could pick up an Amazon refurbished Acer Chromebook 713 with 11th gen Intel Core i5 with the same 8 GB of memory and double the storage for $519.00? It was my pick for Chromebook of the year in 2020. \n\n\n\nIf the refurbished condition scares you, the old Acer Chromebook 713 with Intel Core i5 can still be found for $539, brand new.\n\n\n\nAcer Chromebook Spin 713\n\n\nThe newest Acer Chromebook Spin 514 just feels like a stop-gap, transition device that&#x2019;s late to the game. But maybe I&#x2019;m being too harsh here. Perhaps there&#x2019;s some aspect of this 2022 device that you couldn&#x2019;t get in 2020, or those devices were simply too expensive at the time. Let me know what you think.\n\n\n\nMe, personally, I&#x2019;d probably pass on this new AMD Ryzen Chromebook. At least at its full price; a discount of $100 or more changes the equation.\n\n\n\nThe device isn&#x2019;t really pushing the needle forward in a meaningful way, at least not on paper, anyway. And it essentially competes with the higher performing Spin 713 from 2021, which can often be found on sale at a similar price.\n\n\n\nIt&#x2019;s really the next generation of AMD processors, or one of the more capable ones from this generation, that I expect to really appeal. Maybe some hands on time, or upcoming reviews will change my mind. What do you think?\nThe post I’d pass on the new AMD Ryzen Chromebook at $549 appeared first on About Chromebooks.",

        "link": "https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/reviews/first-impressions-2022-acer-chromebook-spin-714/",
        "description": "Well, I put my money where my mouth is and picked up the 2022 Acer Chromebook Spin 714 earlier this week. Acer&#8217;s first 12th gen Intel Chromebook is typically priced at $729 but a current Best Buy sale drops that by $100. So I figured I&#8217;d take the plunge, knowing I could return the laptop within 14 days. How is it so far? Read on for my first impressions of the 2022 Acer Chromebook Spin 714.\n\n\n\nSince I just reviewed another 12th gen Intel Chromebook, the HP Elite Dragonfly, I have some comparison thoughts sprinkled throughout my first impressions. While these two devices aren&#8217;t close in price, they are close in terms of what you get. You can see the specs of all the 12th gen Intel Chromebooks here, for reference.\n\n\n\nAcer Chromebook Spin 714 design and build\n\n\n\nFor starters, the HP hardware is certainly nicer. So too is the overall build quality and materials used. That&#8217;s not to say the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 isn&#8217;t designed well or is poorly built. It&#8217;s just not as premium. Put another way, the overall look and feel of this ChromeOS laptop are what you&#8217;d expect at this price. The same holds true for the HP Elite Dragonfly, which costs $400 more at full retail price.\n\n\n\nIn fact, there&#8217;s little new here in terms of design and materials. Acer made slight modifications from its Spin 713 such as moving the speakers between the keyboard and display. The aspect ratio of the display is different from the 3:2 on the 713 as well; the Spin 714 uses a 16:10 panel. Other than that and a few changes to the device edges, there&#8217;s not much to say. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis doesn&#8217;t really bother me, to be honest. I consider Acer&#8217;s high-end Chromebooks to be more utilitarian than fashion-forward. And compared to my 2018 Acer Chromebook Spin 13 that the Spin 714 is replacing, it&#8217;s a step up. This laptop is thinner and nicer looking than my old workhorse. (Sorry, Spin 13, but it&#8217;s true.)\n\n\n\nA good but not great display\n\n\n\nSince I mentioned the display, I&#8217;ll share thoughts on that next. While my preferred screen aspect ratio is 3:2, I am liking the 16:10 display here. It&#8217;s working well for multiple windows when I browse, use Twitter, code, etc&#8230; And it&#8217;s better for content consumption than a 3:2 screen as wider content fits better.\n\n\n\nColor reproduction is quite good as are the viewing angles. Right now the only nitpick I have is the 340 nit brightness of the screen. It actually doesn&#8217;t even seem that bright to me. I&#8217;m not sure why and I&#8217;ll have to do some side-by-side comparison testing with dimmer and brighter screens. But even indoors, I need the screen brightness level at around 70% for comfortable use.\n\n\n\nKeyboard, trackpad, stylus, and speakers\n\n\n\nObviously, you&#8217;re not getting the haptic trackpad of the HP on the Acer. It&#8217;s a standard multitouch trackpad that&#8217;s a bit small but certainly fine. I haven&#8217;t had any issues with random mouse taps or mouse movement. It works. I&#8217;ll admit I do like the haptic trackpad on the HP, having used those for years on Macs. Can I live without it? Of course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI&#8217;d consider the keyboard on the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 to be above average so far. There&#8217;s a fair amount of light-bleed under the keys, but I can say the same about the HP. The typing experience has been solid as the keys are well spaced and sized, and have a good amount of travel. It&#8217;s not too loud of a keyboard either. \n\n\n\nAlthough I don&#8217;t use a digital stylus that often, it&#8217;s nice to see Acer include it with the Spin 714 at this price. It&#8217;s a dockable USI pen so there&#8217;s a place to keep it at all times. It charges while inside the chassis. I haven&#8217;t yet tested it on the display but I will in my full review.\n\n\n\nI had high hopes for the Spin 714&#8217;s speakers since they&#8217;re not downward firing. But this is probably the biggest letdown so far. They&#8217;re just not loud nor rich sounding. Now that may be due to a software fix and if so, it means this could improve. I heard from several early owners of this device and they said the speakers cracked and popped. Mine do not, which suggests a software change to address that problem. It may have fixed that issue but it appears that speaker output went too far the other way. \n\n\n\nOverall performance is outstanding\n\n\n\nThe star of the show here is the 12th gen Intel chipset inside this Chromebook. Unlike the Core i3 used in the HP Elite Dragonfly, Acer popped a Core i5 inside. Paired with 8 GB of memory, this ChromeOS laptop is every bit as fast as the HP,  as you&#8217;d expect. What I didn&#8217;t expect is that the Core i5 doesn&#8217;t &#8220;test&#8221; much faster than the Core i3. \n\n\n\nI&#8217;ve only performed a few Octane benchmark tests on the Spin 714 at this point. The first one cracked 80,000 points, which is the highest I&#8217;ve ever seen on a Chromebook. Subsequent tests were slightly lower but within a few hundred points. As good as that sounds, the Core i3 in the HP returns Octane numbers in the 76 to 77-thousand range. So synthetic benchmarks, so far, are very comparable. And I can&#8217;t tell any difference in speed when using the HP and Acer side-by-side on the same tasks. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor those that eventually look for a 12th gen Intel Chromebook of their own, a Core i3 might be all that&#8217;s needed. And this is definitely overkill for someone who just needs to browse the web a few hours a day, run an Android app or two, and doesn&#8217;t use Linux on Chromebooks. You can easily be happy by spending $200 less for an everyday Chromebook.\n\n\n\nOther observations, in no particular order\n\n\n\nI don&#8217;t test battery life on any Chromebook until it&#8217;s been charged and recharged a few times, so I can&#8217;t speak to that yet. I love that Acer split up the power and volume buttons. Power is on the left and volume is on the right. I&#8217;ve lost track of how many times I&#8217;ve hit the wrong one on other Chromebooks because they&#8217;re next to each other.I appreciate the sliding camera shutter and fully expect it on every Chromebook I use going forward.I thought I&#8217;d miss the fingerprint sensor found on the HP. Nope, this model of the Spin 714 doesn&#8217;t have one. Turns out I don&#8217;t miss it, although I know others might. I only log in to a Chromebook once or twice a day because I use it so much.The 1080p webcam is a nice upgrade from older models. It doesn&#8217;t handle backlighting as well as the HP does as you can see. Outside of that, it&#8217;s impressive.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat&#8217;s about it for now as I&#8217;ve only had a few days with the device. \n\n\n\nIf there are specific questions you have, drop them in the comments and I&#8217;ll either answer them here or in the full review. \nThe post First impressions of the 2022 Acer Chromebook Spin 714 appeared first on About Chromebooks.",

        "description": "Earlier this week, I asked the question &#8220;Is Google Reader coming back?&#8221; That was based on a new &#8220;Feed&#8221; option in the ChromeOS side panel. I wasn&#8217;t sure if this upcoming feature was based on RSS or some Google interpretation of it. Now, I&#8217;m pretty definitely sure the side panel in Chrome and ChromeOS will use RSS (see update after the post). The latest Dev Channel version of ChromeOS 106 adds a &#8220;Follow site&#8221; menu option.\n\n\n\nI discovered the new &#8220;Follow site&#8221; choice after updating my Chromebook&#8217;s software earlier today. And I did follow a few sites by using it. Unfortunately, the Feed view in the ChromeOS side panel still isn&#8217;t functional.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo why am thinking that in a way, Google Reader is making a comeback, albeit only in the Chrome browser and on ChromeOS?\n\n\n\nTravel back to October with me for a second. \n\n\n\nThat&#8217;s when Google added a &#8220;Follow&#8221; option to Chrome for Android. It&#8217;s the same feature: By clicking Follow, you&#8217;re subscribing to the RSS feed of a site. Here&#8217;s confirmation of that, along with the big hint that the feature would be coming to Chrome for iOS and the desktop, i.e.; the Chrome browser and ChromeOS.\n\n\n\n\nIt&#39;s on already for some % of people, or you can enable it in chrome://flags under &quot;web feed&quot; (Chrome 94+ for Android). To follow, click on the three dot menu and use the Follow button at the bottom. iOS version coming soon. pic.twitter.com/IJeQh1DJMe&mdash; Adriana Porter Felt (@__apf__) October 8, 2021\n\n\n\n\nI&#8217;ll go one step further here though. See how Adriana, a Director of Engineering at Google for Chrome, specifically mentions this feature enables following a &#8220;web feed&#8221;? \n\n\n\nThe code I combed through earlier this week uses the same terminology:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a coincidence at all. The code may say &#8220;web feed&#8221; but it&#8217;s now reasonable to assume that means RSS. (Update: Confirmed at the bottom of the post that it is RSS)\n\n\n\nI know these web feeds appear on the new tab page in Android, but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what Google intends for the desktop. It would clutter up the new tab page far too much. It makes more sense to use the real estate of a pop-out, resizable side panel to display RSS feeds on a Chromebook, Mac, or PC.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy the way, I followed a few sites during my testing because I wanted to verify a related hunch. \n\n\n\nI know that Google News has a &#8220;Following&#8221; section. I use it quite to view news outside of my traditional RSS feed reader. Specifically when I&#8217;m browsing through Google News. I wanted to see if my newly followed sites appeared there. They don&#8217;t.\n\n\n\nThat doesn&#8217;t mean they won&#8217;t be available there in the future. But it strongly suggests that Chrome and ChromeOS getting a &#8220;Follow site&#8221; feature is tied to the new Feeds option on the side panel. Google Reader lives again?\n\n\n\nUpdated on 8/17 at 3pm ET: I reached out to Adriana on Twitter, asking if this feature would be using RSS. The answer is yes for sites that offer a RSS feed; Google will also push content to the Feed side panel for those that don&#x2019;t have use RSS.\n\n\n\n\nyou can play around with it right now on Chrome Android, it&#39;s RSS plus additional corpus content pulled from sites without RSS&mdash; Adriana Porter Felt (@__apf__) August 17, 2022\n\nThe post ChromeOS 106 gets a Follow site option for desktop RSS (updated) appeared first on About Chromebooks.",

        "description": "Back in May, news of an upcoming, updated Acer Chromebook Spin 514 landed. Now you can see the full specifications and pricing. Acer&#8217;s new AMD Chromebook starts at $559.99.\n\n\n\nTo be clear, there is an Acer Chromebook Spin 514 with an older AMD processor that launched in 2021. And there&#8217;s also a model with a MediaTek Kompanio 828 chipset. This new device is neither of these and has a model number of CP514-3H-R2D2. No, the final four characters of the model name aren&#8217;t lost on this lifelong Star Wars fan.\n\n\n\nWith an AMD Ryzen 3 5125C processor clocked at 3 GHz, this Acer Chromebook Spin 514 should easily outperform its predecessors. And it should do well in the graphics department too as the 5152C leans on an improved, integrated AMD Radeon GPU. The two CPU cores of the 5125C use AMD&#8217;s Zen 3 architecture. Since this particular chipset is so new, I haven&#8217;t found any benchmark results to offer a comparable Intel processor.\n\n\n\nRounding out the other specifications, you see much of what the prior Acer Chromebook Spin 514 design and hardware offer. Here&#8217;s what you get for $559.99:\n\n\n\nCPU2 core (4 threads) AMD Ryzen 5125C (3.0 GHz)GPUAMD Radeon GPU with 3 cores and up to 2 GB of video memoryDisplay14-inch, 1920 x 1080 touchscreen, IPS,100% sRGB&nbsp;color gamut supportMemory8 GB LPDDR4x memoryStorage128 GB flash memory, type not specifiedConnectivity802.11ax (2&#215;2) WiFi 6, Bluetooth 5.2InputBacklit keyboard, multi-touch trackpadwebcam with privacy shutter, dual-array microphone, fingerprint sensorPorts2 USB Type-C Gen 3.2 ports, 1 USB Type-A Gen 3.2 port, 1 HDMI, headphone/microphone combo jackBattery3-cell battery with up to 10 hours expected runtimeWeight3.31 poundsSoftwareChromeOS automatic updates through June 2030\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAside from the updated processor, this AMD Chromebook from Acer boasts fantastic color reproduction on the 14-inch touch display. I noticed that there&#8217;s no fingerprint sensor, which shouldn&#8217;t be a deal-breaker for most people. However, the specs indicate there&#8217;s no microSD card slot, which may give more people some pause. At least the stereo speakers aren&#8217;t bottom firing as you&#8217;ll find on several older Acer Chromebooks. The speakers flank the keyboard.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt&#8217;s hard to say if the $559.99 price is a good value or not because there are still too many unknowns. How will this AMD Chromebook perform? How good is the webcam? Is the battery claim accurate or not?\n\n\n\nI won&#8217;t know the answers until I get my hands on the new Acer Chromebook Spin 514. And it&#8217;s not due out until the third quarter of the year. That could mean we see some review units handed out in the next few weeks, so we&#8217;ll have to wait and see.\nThe post Acer&#8217;s new AMD Chromebook comes in at $559.99 appeared first on About Chromebooks.",

        "description": "After seeing HP and Lenovo discount their first 12th gen Intel Chromebooks, Acer is doing the same. Or rather, Best Buy is doing it for them. The $729 Acer Chromebook Spin 714 discount price is already down to $629. That&#x2019;s a compelling deal on a 12th gen Intel Chromebook with Core i5 processor.\n\n\n\nIt&#x2019;s interesting to see the prices of all available 12th gen Intel Chromebooks see a price reduction so quickly after launching. The Spin 714, for example, only became available on July 7. It was preceded by both the HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook at $1,149 and the Lenovo ThinkPad C14 Chromebook at $1,049. Those were quickly dropped to $869 and $866.15, respectively.\n\n\n\nAlthough I really liked the HP in my review, it&#x2019;s still a little expensive. And I&#x2019;m not a fan of the ThinkPad dual-button mouse and pointing nub, although I&#x2019;m likely in the minority on that. \n\n\n\nSo the Acer has been on the radar for my next Chromebook. It&#x2019;s time to upgrade from the 2018 Acer Chromebook Spin 13.\n\n\n\nThis ChromeOS laptop may not have the build materials and design of the HP. And it certainly doesn&#x2019;t have the haptic trackpad found on the Dragonfly either. When compared to the other 12th gen Intel Chromebooks though, you can see what it does have. And for less money.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere&#x2019;s the Intel Core i5-1235 CPU with Intel Xe graphics, for example. That should offer performance in between the chips in the HP and ThinkPad. It also has 8 GB of RAM, which all three devices include. And the 256 GB SSD is double than what the Dragonfly provides while being on par with the ThinkPad.\n\n\n\nAll three Chromebooks have the same capabilities when it comes to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. And all three offer the standard range of USB and Thunderbolt ports. The ThinkPad does have a pair of USB Type-A ports, which is one more than its competitors.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn terms of displays, the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 is right in the middle of these options too. It&#x2019;s a 14-inch, 16:10 touch panel with 1920 x 1200 resolution. The HP has my preferred 3:2 aspect ratio with a 13.5-inch screen, while the ThinkPad goes wide with a 16:9, 14-inch display. \n\n\n\nAll in all, the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 is very competitive when it comes to specifications. And even at its full price of $729, it&#x2019;s less expensive than the other 12th Intel Chromebook options. \n\n\n\nI know I said this model wasn&#x2019;t likely for me as I would rather have 16 GB of memory to support my daily Linux usage. But at the Acer Chromebook Spin 714 discount price of $629, I think I&#x2019;ll take the plunge and order one. \n\n\n\nIt&#x2019;s worth it to see if this can be my new daily driver for the next several years. After taking it for a spin, I&#x2019;ll decide to keep it or return it. \nThe post 2022 Acer Chromebook Spin 714 discount price already $629 appeared first on About Chromebooks.",

        "link": "https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/is-google-reader-coming-back/",
        "description": "I&#8217;ve been digging deeper into RSS lately, so this article from Chrome Story is rather timely. Dinsan reports that the Side Panel in both the Chrome browser and ChromeOS is getting a &#8220;Feed&#8221; option. The question now: Is Google Reader coming back?\n\n\n\nAs a refresher, Google Reader was depreciated (a nicer way to say killed in software words) back in 2013. It was a fairly popular RSS web app that provided a way to follow website feeds. I was a heavy user of the app and among the many who weren&#8217;t happy to see Google pull the plug.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut maybe it&#8217;s coming back, of sorts. It&#8217;s difficult to tell, so let&#8217;s examine the evidence.\n\n\n\nThere&#8217;s an experimental feature flag in the ChromeOS Canary channel at chrome://flags#following-feed-sidepanel. This adds a &#8220;Feed&#8221; option to the other side panel actions, which are Reading List, Bookmarks, and Journeys.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was able to add the option to my side panel, as shown because I&#8217;m using the Canary Channel of Lacros. \n\n\n\nUnfortunately, the functionality doesn&#8217;t yet work. Navigating to Feed in my side panel shows a connection error. And I don&#8217;t yet see a way to add an RSS feed to the side panel. \n\n\n\nChrome Story is ruling out a full feed reader here:\n\n\n\n&#8220;It will be tricky to incorporate an RSS feed reader into the side panel. So, let&#x2019;s rule that out for now.&#8221;\n\n\n\nI can understand Dinsan&#8217;s thought process here. The side panel is rather small for reading full-text RSS feeds. \n\n\n\nHowever, there is an experimental feature I have installed that lets me adjust the size of the side panel. So, in theory, screen space isn&#8217;t really an issue from keeping Google out of the feed reader market again.\n\n\n\nI could easily read RSS feeds with an expanded side panel\n\n\n\nThis doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s a lock that we&#8217;ll see RSS feeds in the side panel though. Google sometimes plays fast and loose with standard words, such as the word &#8220;feed&#8221;. They could mean the RSS feed of a site or something else entirely.\n\n\n\nIn fact, the existing code for the Feed functionality isn&#8217;t clear that it will be using RSS or something else to create and display content. All I can tell at this point is that it will read and display a file called &#8220;feed.html&#8221;. It&#8217;s not clear what the input to that file is. \n\n\n\nIndeed, the flag description says this feature &#8220;Enables the following feed in the sidepanel.&#8221; Following to me and following to Google could be different things entirely. \n\n\n\nI did a little more digging into supporting code though and I believe that when Google says &#8220;feed&#8221; it does mean the RSS feed. Here&#8217;s the clue:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhere I read &#8220;web feed&#8221;, I think RSS feed. Not a Google Discover feed, not a Google Follow feed, but an RSS feed. While I can&#8217;t be 100% confident, I think this clue strongly suggests that yes, Google Reader is coming back. Maybe it&#8217;s not quite the Reader of old since it would be integrated into the browser, but still.\n\n\n\nPersonally, if I&#8217;m wrong on this, I&#8217;ll be highly disappointed. I don&#8217;t want an algorithmic Google list of interests in the Feed tab. I want to pick and choose the sites I want to follow through RSS.\n\n\n\nThoughts?\n\n\n\nUpdate: There&#8217;s additional information and more evidence that RSS will be supported in the Chrome and ChromeOS Side Panel.\nThe post Is Google Reader coming back? appeared first on About Chromebooks.",

        "link": "https://www.aboutchromebooks.com/news/chrome-os-106-google-photos-memories-on-chromebooks/",
        "description": "The latest ChromeOS 106 Dev Channel update updates a nice feature to the NTP or new tab pages. When I opened a blank new tab using ChromeOS 106, I saw an option to enable photo memories. This integrates Google Photos Memories on Chromebooks, so you can see images from this day or week from previous years. It&#8217;s a feature that has been in the works for a while but hidden behind an experimental flag.\n\n\n\nPreviously, you could enable chrome://flags#ntp-photo-module to see this feature. With ChromeOS 106, that flag is set to &#8220;Default&#8221; on my Chromebook. \n\n\n\nThat suggests this will be available for all supported devices once ChromeOS 106 lands on the Stable Channel. And it will be available in the Chrome browser for Linux, macOS, and Windows too.\n\n\n\nI noticed this option at the bottom of a new tab page, which provides a brief description of what it is. To actually see my memories from this day over the past several years, I had to click on the See Memories button.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbove, you can also see options to disable this feature and to customize other cards. Currently, there are recipe and cart cards.\n\n\n\nAfter clicking the See memories button, I saw photos taken one year, two years, and four years ago on this day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe photos will change each day, of course. When I open a new tab page tomorrow, I expect to see three different images from my Google Photos Memories. But this isn&#8217;t just a static slideshow of images. ChromeOS 106 integrates Google Photos Memories on Chromebooks too.\n\n\n\nClicking any one of the three images opens up a Google Photos Memories slideshow in a new browser tab. Here you can scrub forward or back in time through your photo memories. \n\n\n\nSix years ago, for example, I was at the Google NYC office, where I took the below picture on August 9th. I believe this is from the terrace of the 11th-floor cafeteria.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt first, I wasn&#8217;t sure why Google is adding this integrated Google Photos Memories experience on the new tab page. That&#8217;s mainly because you can view your images from the Photos website. Then I realized, I really don&#8217;t do that too often. And I enjoy viewing those captured memories.\n\n\n\nBy including this optional feature on the new tab page, I&#8217;m more likely to see those memories on a daily basis. So it makes sense from that perspective. If you want to see your memories, you&#8217;ll likely appreciate this. If not, you can just disable the Memories card.\nThe post ChromeOS 106 integrates Google Photos Memories on Chromebooks appeared first on About Chromebooks.",

        "description": "More than 20 years after their first collection of recipes, chefs Sam and Sam Clark prove their brand of simple north African and Spanish cooking is – like them – here to stayEveryone loves toast. But there is toast and… toast. In Moro Easy, a new cookbook by Sam and Sam Clark, there are no fewer than 10 recipes for things on toast. Some are straightforward, almost austere: I can’t imagine the person who wouldn’t be able to rustle up a few slices of their tomato and jamon toast (the secret lies with a grater and just the right amount of garlic). Others are luxuriant: imagine a crisp oval of sourdough topped with a thin tortilla and aioli – a breakfast treat they first ate in Barcelona’s Boqueria market – or with crab warmed in butter and Oloroso sherry and lightly seasoned with fresh chilli and thyme.Moro Easy is the Clarks’ first book since 2014 and it is, at least in part, a result of the pandemic: their London restaurants – Moro in Clerkenwell and Morito in Hackney – suddenly shuttered, the pair found themselves unexpectedly at home with their three children (running a delivery service, they decided, was not for them). “It was extraordinary,” says the first Sam (to avoid confusion, I will hereafter refer to her husband as Samuel), “cooking three meals a day for five, rather than however many covers in the restaurant.” Some of the ideas that eventually went into Moro Easy were old ones, reworked for the home cook. But others were born of this period, when they were cooking off the cuff. “We felt a bit smug,” says Samuel. “At the supermarkets, there were long queues. But our local shops had no queues, and they sell everything you could want. I loved having the time to shop. We’ve lived here for 15 years, and I’d never really used the high street before.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "On holiday last week, I read How To Do Nothing: Resisting the attention economy by Jenny Odell. It&#8217;s an inspirational book, based on a blog post she published a few years ago; I should have read it when it first came out.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI&#8217;m going to quote a fair few sections of it, out of order, to make a few points. First, it&#8217;s really good to see so many authors of non-fiction books I&#8217;ve read recently to say that they&#8217;re explicitly anti-capitalist.\n\n\n\n\nMy argument is obviously anticapitalist, especially concerning technologies that encourage a capitalist perception of time, place, self, and community. It is also environmental and historical: I propose that rerouting and deepening one’s attention to place will likely lead to awareness of one’s participation in history and in a more-than-human community. From either a social or ecological perspective, the ultimate goal of “doing nothing” is to wrest our focus from the attention economy and replant it in the public, physical realm.\n\n\n\n\nOdell has in her crosshairs the &#8216;attention economy&#8217; which largely is synonymous with centralised social media platforms such as Twitter and Instagram. What I find interesting is the way she weaves her own story and sense of place around her philosophical and historical investigations of what it means to be human.\n\n\n\n\nIt’s important for me to link my critique of the attention economy to the promise of bioregional awareness because I believe that capitalism, colonialist thinking, loneliness, and an abusive stance toward the environment all coproduce one another. It’s also important because of the parallels between what the economy does to an ecological system and what the attention economy does to our attention. In both cases, there’s a tendency toward an aggressive monoculture, where those components that are seen as “not useful” and which cannot be appropriated (by loggers or by Facebook) are the first to go. Because it proceeds from a false understanding of life as atomized and optimizable, this view of usefulness fails to recognize the ecosystem as a living whole that in fact needs all of its parts to function.\n\n\n\n\nPlaces, by definition, have context. You are in this place doing this thing. Social media feeds, on the other hand, suffer from what danah boyd calls &#8216;context collapse&#8217;: lots of things posted by different people one after another with no semblance of cohesion.\n\n\n\nLike Odell, I spent many years on Twitter in particular, playing to the gallery and thinking in tweet-sized chunks. It does not lead to a flourishing life.\n\n\n\n\nI think often about how much time and energy we use thinking up things to say that would go over well with a context-collapsed crowd—not to mention checking back on how that crowd is responding. This is its own form of “research,” and when I do it, it feels not only pathetic but like a waste of energy\n\n\n\n\nWhile I&#8217;d argue that things were different in the very early days, nowadays spending a lot of time on centralised social media services is an exercise in thinking with the herd. Outliers are ostracised.\n\n\n\n\nWilliam Deresiewicz warns&#8230; in “Solitude and Leadership,” a speech to an audience of college students in 2010 [that by] spending too much time on social media and chained to the news cycle, he says, “[y]ou are marinating yourself in the conventional wisdom. In other people’s reality: for others, not for yourself. You are creating a cacophony in which it is impossible to hear your own voice, whether it’s yourself you’re thinking about or anything else.”\n\n\n\n\nThe apotheosis of this is shaping your &#8216;personal brand&#8217; so that others have a fixed view of who you and what you offer. This is acquiescing to a capitalist frame of reference where value is extracted for the benefit of others.\n\n\n\n\nUltimately, I argue for a view of the self and of identity that is the opposite of the personal brand: an unstable, shapeshifting thing determined by interactions with others and with different kinds of places.\n\n\n\n\nOdell suggests that we should disengage from such personal branding activities and instead engage in activities which she calls &#8216;resisting in place&#8217;.\n\n\n\n\nTo resist in place is to make oneself into a shape that cannot so easily be appropriated by a capitalist value system. To do this means refusing the frame of reference: in this case, a frame of reference in which value is determined by productivity, the strength of one’s career, and individual entrepreneurship. It means embracing and trying to inhabit somewhat fuzzier or blobbier ideas: of maintenance as productivity, of the importance of nonverbal communication, and of the mere experience of life as the highest goal. It means recognizing and celebrating a form of the self that changes over time, exceeds algorithmic description, and whose identity doesn’t always stop at the boundary of the individual.\n\n\n\n\nSo, instead of presenting oneself as a unified, unchanging &#8216;brand&#8217; separate from others and the world, Odell suggests that we should recognise that we are unavoidably shaped by the interactions we have with others and the world.\n\n\n\n\nWhat’s especially tragic about a mind that imagines itself as something separate, defensible, and capable of “efficiency” is not just that it results in a probably very boring (and bored) person; it’s that it’s based on a complete fallacy about the constitution of the self as something separate from others and from the world. Although I can understand it as the logical outcome of a very human craving for stability and categories, I also see this desire as, ironically, the intersection of many forces inside and outside this imagined “self”: fear of change, capitalist ideas of time and value, and an inability to accept mortality. It’s also about control, since if we recognize that what we experience as the self is completely bound to others, determined not by essential qualities but by relationships, then we must further relinquish the ideas of a controllable identity and of a neutral, apolitical existence (the mythology that attends gentrification). But whether we are the fluid product of our interactions with others is not our choice to make. The only choice is whether to recognize this reality or not.\n\n\n\n\nOne way of thinking about two different ways of interacting online is to differentiate between connectivity and sensitivity. One is about unambiguously spreading information, the other about encountering others.\n\n\n\n\nWriting about the circulation of information, Berardi makes a distinction that’s especially helpful here, between what he calls connectivity and sensitivity. Connectivity is the rapid circulation of information among compatible units—an example would be an article racking up a bunch of shares very quickly and unthinkingly by like-minded people on Facebook. With connectivity, you either are or are not compatible. Red or blue: check the box. In this transmission of information, the units don’t change, nor does the information. \n\n\n\nSensitivity, in contrast, involves a difficult, awkward, ambiguous encounter between two differently shaped bodies that are themselves ambiguous—and this meeting, this sensing, requires and takes place in time. Not only that, due to the effort of sensing, the two entities might come away from the encounter a bit different than they went in.\n\n\n\n[&#8230;]\n\n\n\nSo connectivity is a share or, conversely, a trigger; sensitivity is an in-person conversation, whether pleasant or difficult, or both. Obviously, online platforms favor connectivity, not simply by virtue of being online, but also arguably for profit, since the difference between connectivity and sensitivity is time, and time is money. Again, too expensive.\n\n\n\n\nAs humans, we tend to only notice big changes; small things that drip-feed escape our notice. We don&#8217;t tens to think they&#8217;re particularly important. This is true of small changes to seasonal temperatures that over time constitute climate change, but also applies to changes in our behaviour. \n\n\n\nAn example of this comes from James Williams who, writing about ad blockers on the University of Oxford’s &#8216;Practical Ethics&#8217; blog, explains what&#8217;s at stake: nothing less than our freedom. Odell paraphrases him as saying that what we see as merely irritating actually prevent us from flourishing.\n\n\n\n\nWe experience the externalities of the attention economy in little drips, so we tend to describe them with words of mild bemusement like “annoying” or “distracting.” But this is a grave misreading of their nature. In the short term, distractions can keep us from doing the things we want to do. In the longer term, however, they can accumulate and keep us from living the lives we want to live, or, even worse, undermine our capacities for reflection and self-regulation, making it harder, in the words of Harry Frankfurt, to “want what we want to want.” Thus there are deep ethical implications lurking here for freedom, wellbeing, and even the integrity of the self.\n\n\n\n\nWhat we need to be doing, therefore, is to be seeking out spaces for context collection rather than context collapse. I like this way of framing things, as it&#8217;s both a philosophical and practical approach. I&#8217;ve already had discussions with the Bonfire team about ways in which posts can be displayed in ways that are neither algorithmic nor merely pile one contextless thing after another.\n\n\n\n\nIf, as I’ve argued, certain types of thought require certain types of spaces, then any attempt at “context collection” will have to deal not only with context collapse online, but with preserving public and open space, as well as the meeting public and open space, as well as the meeting places important to threatened cultures and communities.\n\n\n\n\nThis book has really made me question what I&#8217;ve been doing (and what I will be doing in the future) online. Not more of the same, that&#8217;s for sure.The post Context collection, not context collapse first appeared on Open Thinkering.",

        "description": "A couple of months ago, over at Thought Shrapnel, I posted something I entitled Losing followers, gaining friends, which linked to an article by Steve Lord about how the web, and in particular social media, foregrounds &#8216;System 1&#8217; type thinking. The fast, reactive-style thinking which makes judgements based on incomplete information. This is opposed to &#8216;System 2&#8217; thinking which is slower and more high-level, involving data analysis.\n\n\n\nI&#8217;ve been thinking about this I continue to interact with people primarily through Mastodon, Slack, and email. I&#8217;ve given up on other things like Twitter at this point, and haven&#8217;t been near social stuff owned by Facebook for well over a decade. But even these spaces are arranged chronologically. Steve Lord references Amy Hoy as saying how problematic this chronology has been for the social web:\n\n\n\n\nWhen you produce your whole site by hand, from HEAD to /BODY, you begin in a world of infinite possibility. You can tailor your content exactly how you like it, and organize it in any way you please. Every design decision you make represents roughly equal work because, heck, you’ve gotta do it by hand either way. Whether it’s reverse chronological entries or a tidy table of contents. You might as well do what you want.\n\n\n\nBut once you are given a tool that operates effortlessly —&nbsp;but only in a certain way&nbsp;— every choice that deviates from the standard represents a major cost.\n\n\n\n[&#8230;]\n\n\n\nAnd the damn reverse chronology bias —&nbsp;once called into creation, it hungers eternally&nbsp;— sought its next victim. Myspace. Facebook. Twitter. Instagram. Pinterest, of all things. Today these social publishing tools are beginning to buck reverse chronological sort; they’re introducing algorithm sort, to surface content not by time posted but by popularity, or expected interactions, based on individual and group history. There is even less control than ever before.\n\n\n\n\nWhat would a social network look like that wasn&#8217;t chronological? What would a workplace chat app look like that didn&#8217;t just put one damn thing after another? What about an inbox that didn&#8217;t just stack messages up by the order in which they were received? 🧐The post Chronological social interaction first appeared on Open Thinkering.",

        "description": "Three suspected Kremlin spies have been arrested in Albania after an attack on two guards at a military base with what is believed to be a chemical agent.\n\n\n\nTwo Russians and one Ukrainian citizen were taken into custody on Saturday, while the two Albanian soldiers are receiving hospital treatment, according to local media reports.\n\n\n\nOne man was spotted with a camera and trying to take pictures at the perimeter of the arms manufacturing plant in the town of Gramsh,&nbsp;about 80 kilometers south of the capital of Tirana.\n\n\n\nWhen the guards confronted him, he sprayed a neuro-paralyzing agent at the soldiers, according to an announcement from the Çekin Military Plant in Gramsh, reported Top Channel.\n\n\n\nThe police received information that this man was not alone and immediately set up checkpoints and blocked a vehicle with another Russian and a Ukrainian citizen, who are also in police custody, the news site reported. The three are a Russian man aged 24, a Russian woman aged 33, and a Ukrainian man aged 25, according to the report.\n\n\n\nIt’s not the first time suspected Russian agents have infiltrated the Mediterranean country, which is a member of NATO, for military intelligence gathering or attacks. Last summer, two Russian citizens were caught in the outer perimeter of the Kučova air base, carrying a drone.\n\n\n\nOn both occasions, the suspected spies entered as tourists, under rules which allow Russians to enter without a visa for the summer holiday period —&nbsp;a loophole which some are now calling to be scrapped.\n\n\n\nAlbania, an EU candidate country, is a firm supporter of Ukrainian sovereignty. At a meeting with NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg last month, Albanian Prime Minister Edi Rama said they “firmly stand in full solidarity with Ukraine, and of course it goes without even saying that our support for Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity, within the internationally recognized borders of Ukraine, is as firm as ever.”\n\n\n\nHe added that, “it is important that we continue our conversation vis-à-vis the situation, as well as the obligations we have in the Western Balkans to exactly prevent every escalation and prevent every bad influence become a trouble for our region.”\n\n\n\nAlbania was one of the first allied parliaments to ratify Finland’s and Sweden’s accession protocols to NATO. Earlier this year, NATO began efforts to transform the former communist-era air base of Kučova from an aircraft cemetery into a a modern station for operations in the Western Balkans, EuroNews reported.",

        "description": "As she entered the federal courthouse in West Palm Beach on Thursday to bear witness to a hearing on the potential release of the FBI’s basis for searching Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump’s attorney Christina Bobb paused to ask one of the law enforcement officers outside a question.\nWhere, exactly, did she need to go?\nSoon, Bobb found a front-row seat and sat quietly throughout, telling reporters she was just there to observe.\nRare is the case that a Trump emissary is an addendum to, and not the focus of, a high-profile proceeding. And Bobb’s decision to observe rather than partake ended up earning her a grilling from typically friendly Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who wondered whether she had forfeited Trump’s right to help shape the process behind the potential release of the FBI’s affidavit.\n“We really just chose to see how it would play out,” Bobb replied.\n \n\nThe moment underscored an increasingly apparent truth about Donald Trump’s legal strategy in the week since the FBI searched his Mar-a-Lago home: He and his team haven’t settled on a singular approach and appear in the dark about what may come next. Trump has often used litigation to delay but has been loath to go on offense, particularly when he’s likely to lose. His vow Friday to make a “major motion” appeared in keeping with that approach.\nWhile it’s unclear whether the former president or any of his top allies are at imminent risk of criminal charges, they have sketched out competing and sometimes conflicting positions that may come into play as the investigation — now in its “early stages” — accelerates.\nHere’s a look at the Trump team’s early, shifting strategies and how they may fare:\nCalls for transparency that don’t show up in court\nBobb’s quiet approach to Thursday’s hearing in Florida differed conspicuously from the tack taken by Trump, who has loudly insisted that DOJ release the unredacted affidavit underlying the search warrant executed at Mar-a-Lago. Several media organizations and conservative Judicial Watch filed motions with a federal magistrate judge to do just that.\nBut Trump never authorized his legal team to make that formal request.\nHis demand for the release of the affidavit was itself a shift. He and his team initially resisted public release of the search warrant itself, which they had access to on Aug. 8. Only after Attorney General Merrick Garland took the unusual step of moving to release the warrant did Trump start calling for transparency.\n\nThe public clamor that avoids an actual legal battle suggests Trump is treading cautiously — lest his legal team commit to a course of action he can’t take back later.\nWhen Trump got his publicly stated wish to release the search warrant, Americans learned about dozens of boxes containing classified material he had squirreled away at his estate, and that DOJ was probing potential felonies, including mishandling of classified material and obstruction of justice.\nPresidential vs. Personal\nTrump’s team, via media ally John Solomon — one of the former president’s authorized representatives to the National Archives — floated a new defense on Thursday: Trump told people he considered the materials he stashed at his house to be “personal” items that belonged to him.&nbsp;\nIt’s unclear whether and how Trump actually made such a designation, and his team has yet to produce evidence of it. But it’s not a trivial issue. A mishmash of past court rulings have suggested presidents wield enormous sway over their own materials, including the ability to designate some as “personal,” which removes them from the strict requirements of the Presidential Records Act.\nThough the laws governing these designations have made clear that documents deemed “personal” should also have no inherent value to the operations of government, there’s no mechanism to question a president’s decision on this score — unless the Archives chooses to challenge it.\n\n\n\nBut there’s one problem for Trump in this defense: The power to deem records “personal” ended the moment his presidency did. So, if he hadn’t designated the records taken to Mar-a-Lago by that point, then the determination was no longer his to make.\nGiven that several of Trump’s allies and aides have suggested he didn’t know what was packed in the boxes that were shipped to his estate, it would be hard to argue he had designated them as personal items.\nGoing after the judge\nSince the FBI went into Mar-a-Lago, Trump and his attorneys have argued that the search warrant itself was deficient — overly broad and approved by a biased magistrate judge.\nTheir evidence of Judge Bruce Reinhart’s bias? He donated to Barack Obama. Some Trump supporters have pointed as well to his work more than a decade ago for employees and associates of Jeffrey Epstein. But it’s unclear how that creates a conflict with issues related to Trump. And Reinhart also gave contributions to Jeb Bush.\nTrump’s team has also suggested that Reinhart’s recusal from a sprawling lawsuit by Trump against Hillary Clinton and dozens of current and former DOJ officials is proof of bias. But Reinhart, one of six magistrates to recuse from that case, never indicated the reason for his decision. In fact, it’s far likelier that he recused for a more mundane reason: a prior working relationship with one of the dozens of defendants in the case or their attorneys.\n\nBut the approach to Reinhart has also been mixed. After a week of pounding the judge as biased, Trump’s team embraced his resistance to keeping the affidavit fully sealed.\nAn important side note: While Trump asked that Reinhart recuse from “this case,” there really isn’t a case to step aside from at the moment, simply a search warrant that was requested and granted, followed by a dispute over how much of those records should be public. If Trump or someone else is charged criminally in connection with the missing records, a judge would be randomly assigned.\nClaiming the FBI overstepped\nEven if the search warrant passes legal muster, Trump’s allies say, the FBI blew past its constraints, seizing boxes at random and just hoarding as much as possible. While there’s significant evidence to the contrary, Trump hammered on this point days after the search, focusing on alleged passports that were taken from his estate.\nWhat Trump didn’t mention at the time was what the DOJ officials had told him: the passports were flagged by a team of investigators specifically appointed to screen out any improper or privileged information that might be scooped up in an FBI search. The involvement of a so-called filter team signals that DOJ had taken care to ensure investigators didn’t lay eyes on evidence they weren’t meant to see.\nEven so, Trump’s legal team indicated late Friday it was prepared to make a more concerted push on this front. Attorney Jim Trusty joined pro-Trump radio host Mark Levin to outline Trump’s intention to seek a “special master” to review the materials seized by the FBI and ensure any privileged information isn’t seen by the bureau.\nTrusty didn’t address why it took the legal team 11 days to settle on that strategy, following a year or more of dialogue with archivists and government lawyers. But he said a special master could review “large swaths” of material that Trump’s team believes is subject to privilege claims, arguing that a DOJ-led filter team couldn’t be trusted.\n\nTrump promised in a social media post Friday that a legal filing would be forthcoming on this point, but by Sunday morning it still hadn’t arrived.\nTrump took a similarly lax approach when his former attorney, John Eastman, was fending off efforts by the Jan. 6 select committee to obtain thousands of emails that Eastman had claimed were protected by attorney client privilege — with Trump being the client.\nFor months, a federal judge asked probing questions about Eastman’s legal relationship with Trump and demanded that the former law professor produce paperwork proving when he became Trump’s lawyer. But the ex-president never engaged in the suit, leaving Eastman wielding only an unsigned retainer agreement. The result? Eastman lost at nearly every turn and the judge issued a damaging ruling that he and Trump likely joined in a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election.\nArguing DOJ didn’t exhaust all other options\n\nTrump’s attorneys have also contended that the FBI resorted to its most aggressive tactic — an unannounced search and seizure of a former president’s home — before exhausting less intrusive means. Bobb and other Trump allies noted that DOJ officials made a cordial visit to Mar-a-Lago on June 3. A few days later, DOJ called up Trump’s attorneys and asked them to install a padlock on a basement storage room where some of the targeted records were being housed. Then there was radio silence for two months, Trump allies say, until the FBI executed the warrant.\nWhat’s missing from that timeline has seeped out in subsequent reporting: DOJ’s interactions with Trump’s team began only after the Archives had sought for more than a year to obtain the full slate of records held at Mar-a-Lago. The Archives asked DOJ to get involved after it discovered tranches of classified records on site.\nIn the spring, DOJ used a grand jury subpoena to try to obtain files housed at Mar-a-Lago. Then, soon after officials visited Trump’s estate in June, the department issued a new subpoena for surveillance footage that might show important files being moved. Bobb told Ingraham that she believed the Trump team was open to releasing some of that surveillance footage. But they have not released that, or the subpoenas.\nDelay is Trump’s friend\nThe best thing that Trump can probably hope for at the moment is that the search warrant was primarily a mechanism to recover records the government thought it was entitled to and isn’t much of an indication of whether he or anyone else will face criminal charges.\nSeveral former top DOJ officials have offered a similar take. But a lot remains unknown.\n\nDOJ counterintelligence official Jay Bratt told Reinhart during Thursday’s hearing that the investigation was “in its early stages,” suggesting that the matter isn’t settled but also that charging decisions are a long way off.\nMost cases about intentional or unintentional mishandling of classified information don’t end in criminal charges. The government’s primary goal is typically to end the so-called “spill” of material as quickly and completely as possible, with consequences for those responsible attended to later.\nThat means there’s a remote likelihood of imminent developments as dramatic as the Aug. 8 Mar-a-Lago search.\nBut Trump’s lawyers will stay busy. The other legal threats he faces include DOJ investigations into the attempted overturning of the 2020 presidential election; civil suits over the violence that unfolded at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021; a criminal election-fraud probe in Georgia; and a pair of New York investigations into the tax and accounting practices of his real estate empire and marketing of the Trump brand.\nMeridith McGraw contributed.",

        "description": "One Sunday afternoon in November, several of President Jimmy Carter’s former aides and advisers met on Zoom for a private call. Madeleine Albright, the former secretary of State, made an appearance, along with Dick Gephardt, the former House Democratic leader. Les Francis, a former deputy White House chief of staff in the Carter administration, was watching the waiting room for late arrivals while, from his log house in the foothills outside of Denver, Gary Hart, the former senator from Colorado, was having difficulty logging on.\nFor three or four years, the Carter administration veterans had been meeting like this to keep in touch. But more recently, as Republicans went from initial, brief discomfort with the Jan. 6 attack to rallying behind former President Donald Trump’s false assertions that the election was stolen, their conversations had begun to become more urgent, focusing on the state of American democracy. And the assessment was grim.\nTrump had tried to overturn an election. Now, with the GOP widely expected to control the House and, potentially, critical statehouses in 2024, it appeared at least possible that a second attempt by Trump or some like-minded Republican to seize or cling to power undemocratically might just succeed.\n“It’s time to ring the alarm bells, and it’s time to say to people, ‘Hey, wake up. There’s nothing written that democracy always has to exist,” Gephardt told them. “In fact, most writers on democracy say that the average life of a democracy in history is about 300 years. Well, we’re moving into the 300-year mark. So, this is an alarming situation.”\nHe said, “It’s scary as hell.”\n\n\n\nYet as members of the Carter group discussed the prospect of democracy’s collapse, there was another crisis that troubled them just as much: The fact that, as a voting issue, so few Democrats&nbsp;seemed to care.\nEven after the experience of 2020 and the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — and even as Republicans in the midterms parrot Trump’s falsehoods — democracy has polled relatively low on the electorate’s list of concerns. The Jan. 6 committee hearings were encouraging. But Democrats competing in elections this year have not been pressing the issue anywhere near as hard as other concerns.\nOf the more than $300 million spent by Democrats on broadcast advertisements this year throughout the country, ads that mentioned Jan. 6, the insurrection, democracy or stolen elections accounted for less than 4 percent of all spending, according to an analysis compiled for POLITICO by the ad tracking firm AdImpact. That’s less than Democrats spent on subjects ranging from energy and the environment to education, roads and infrastructure, abortion, health care, Trump and guns.\nAnd the problem was even worse than that. In some cases, Democrats were themselves taking anti-democratic positions, spending millions of dollars in Republican primaries to elevate hard-right candidates they viewed as more beatable opponents in the fall. It didn’t seem to matter that some of those candidates were election conspiracy theorists — or that Democrats, if their own candidates faltered in November, could be helping them win.\nTo some members of the Carter group, the discussion surrounding democracy was beginning to feel like the early days of the climate movement, when scientists and some Democrats spoke urgently about a looming crisis, but were often mocked or ignored. Starting late last year, I was granted access to some of their Zoom calls and was in contact with some participants more directly, and the question that kept coming up was how to mainstream their concerns about democracy — and do it more quickly than the climate’s still-halting march into the political consciousness.\n“It’s that tired old metaphor of the frog and the water,” Bo Cutter, a veteran of both the Carter and Clinton administrations, told me recently. “If you raise it with people who are … actively involved in policy and politics, you tend to get sort of a patronizing pat on the head and a, ‘Well, America has always come through in the end’ kind of thing.’”\n“It’s incredibly hard for people to come together around something like this,” he said. “There’s just so much else on people’s minds.”\nEarlier this year, when I visited Francis, the organizer of the Carter group calls, at his home in Camino, Calif., in the Sierra Nevada foothills east of Sacramento, he said he’d been heartened by the amount of coverage democracy was getting on Sunday morning talk shows and in national newspaper opinion pages.\nBut it was mostly talk. In the midterm campaign, the Democratic Party was pinning its hopes for November not on some upswell in reverence for democracy, but on Roe v. Wade&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.politico.com/news/2022/06/25/the-dog-that-caught-the-car-republicans-brace-for-the-impact-of-reversing-roe-00042387&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-c79a-deb4-a9a2-d7df53990004&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-c79a-deb4-a9a2-d7df53990005&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">public outrage over the Supreme Court’s overturning of&nbsp;Roe v. Wade and, to a lesser degree, cooling inflation and President Joe Biden’s improving legislative record, including the recent passage of a major tax, health care and climate change bill.\nIt's possible the strategists making those decisions have it right — that they value the nation’s democratic enterprise just as much as their predecessors but have concluded the only way to protect it is by keeping Democrats in as many offices as they can. If accomplishing that means focusing ads on issues voters care more about than democracy, or intervening in a Republican primary, there may not be much downside.\n\n\n\nOne Democratic strategist who advises major party donors told me, “Most Americans can’t even spell democracy.”\nWhether they can or not might fall beside the point. If anything, the Democratic Party’s prospects look marginally better today than they did just a few weeks ago. Democrats are still widely expected to lose the House, but perhaps not by the margins they once feared. And they may hold onto the Senate.\nBut to Francis, a former executive director of both the Democratic National Committee and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party was missing the longer view. He sat back in his home office chair and groaned.\nDemocracy, he said, “is more important to the survival of the country than, frankly, daycare for kids or prescription drug prices.”\n“This may be generational,” said Francis, who is 79. “But for people of my generation who came of age politically in the 1960s, and we were involved with civil rights, anti-war, student rights, all these things, we just are having a hard time believing that this is happening, it’s happening in our lifetime, and it’s happening on our watch.”\nThe midterms are now less than three months away. Trump may announce his 2024 campaign any day. And Republicans in this year’s primaries have been nominating gubernatorial and secretary of state candidates who, if elected, could influence the outcome of the next presidential election, overseeing the machinery of the election and its certification at the state level.\nThe worst-case scenario, said Hart, a two-time presidential candidate, would be “the 2020 election quadrupled: Every state count challenged in state courts and federal courts, all 50 cases going to the Supreme Court, and who knows how this Court’s going to rule on things like that.” Cutter described that prospect as a “doomsday scenario” with more than trivial odds.\nNone of this is news to Democrats. Biden recently sat for a conversation with historians at the White House at which comparisons reportedly were drawn to the run-up to the Civil War. And if Democrats were going to do anything about it, it would largely be on them, with majorities of Republicans still clinging to the false belief that the last election was rigged. To several of the Carter group people I spoke with, the party wasn’t doing nearly enough.\n“The question we all have is, ‘Is there time to fix it?’” Francis said. “I have to say I’m doubtful.”\nHe said, “We still haven’t reached critical mass on recognizing the severity of the problem.”\n\nEver since the 2020 election, a hodgepodge of Democratic and nonpartisan groups has been focusing more intently on issues surrounding the health of our democracy. Major institutions like the American Civil Liberties Union and the NAACP have engaged in efforts to combat state-level voting restrictions. Former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, a former chair of the Democratic National Committee, is chairing a super PAC opposing the 147 Republican members of Congress who went in with Trump and voted against certifying the 2020 election. Run for Something, a Democratic-candidate recruiting group, announced a long-term plan in April to find and support thousands of candidates for local offices overseeing elections. And in Michigan — a critical swing state and home to one of the GOP’s more overt efforts to overturn the last election — a leading democracy and voting rights group announced this month an independent expenditure effort that will run digital ads and focus volunteer efforts on defeating election deniers.\n\n\n\nJamie Lyons-Eddy, deputy director of the Michigan group Voters Not Politicians, said of the public’s recognition of threats to democracy: “I feel like this is moving really quickly, what’s happening in the country and people’s awareness of it.”\nAnd there are high-level conversations going on. A group called “Keep Our Republic,” whose board includes Gephardt and Hart, has been holding briefings in Pennsylvania in recent months, including at Villanova University. The Safeguarding Democracy Project at the University of California, Los Angeles, is planning early next year to host a symposium: “Can American Democracy Survive the 2024 elections?”\n“That’s all we talk about is democracy, and we share articles — anything anybody runs across about a threat to democracy,” Hart said.\nEveryone he knows in Democratic politics, he said, “is traumatized by what is shaping up to be possibly the greatest threat to America in our history, and that dominates all of our conversations.”\nThe value of panels and other forums, he said, is “raising the understanding of the threat.”\nThe problem is that little appears to be breaking through. Americans typically say democracy matters to them, with 52 percent of Americans listing improving the political system as a top priority, according to Pew. But that’s still low on the list of Americans’ concerns, lagging behind the economy, health care, education, Social Security and defending against terrorism. Last month, in a New York Times/Siena College poll, only 11 percent of voters listed the state of democracy and political division as the most important problem facing the country. In some polls, democracy barely registers at all.\nEven worse for Democrats, it isn’t their voters, but Republicans, who seem most concerned about the state of the nation’s democracy. According to an NPR/Ipsos poll released ahead of the anniversary of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, nearly two-thirds of Americans agreed with the idea that democracy is at risk of failing. But Republicans were slightly more likely to agree strongly with that idea than Democrats. They’d already suffered through an election they thought, wrongly, was stolen. And Trump, in their view, had been wronged not only by election administrators, but all the system’s institutions — the House, in its two impeachments of him, the press, in its coverage of his behavior, and most recently, the FBI, with the search of his residence in Florida.\nFor Democrats hoping that pointing out a Republican’s anti-democratic behavior might move large portions of the electorate, the picture hasn’t improved much since before the 2020 election, when researchers at Yale University used hypothetical and real-world scenarios to test how important democratic principles were to voters. They found candidates who violate democratic principles could typically expect to lose less than 4 percent of their&nbsp;share of the vote.\n“Americans value democracy,” the researchers wrote, “but not much.”\nIt is that lesson — not the one advanced by the Carter groups of the Democratic Party — that Democratic political professionals appear to have internalized.\nOne day after Blake Masters, an election denier, won his Senate primary in the closely watched swing state of Arizona, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee released an ad introducing Masters as “too dangerous for Arizona.” But the positions it highlighted were his views on Social Security, abortion and the Democratic Party — not an election he falsely maintains Trump won.\n\n\n\nArizona Democrats are running ads depicting Kari Lake, the state’s Republican nominee for governor and a leading election conspiracy theorist, as “radical” — but for her views on abortion, guns and education. In Wisconsin, Democrats are hammering Sen. Ron Johnson on Social Security and health care.\nIn a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee memo this month, the DCCC called Republican candidates’ positions on abortion “the top testing negative in battleground polls.”\nAt the center-left group Third Way, Matt Bennett said that what Democrats “would really like to do is go out there and pound Republicans for being anti-democratic people who don’t want you to vote. And while I believe that is the most important issue of our time — the assault on our democracy — I also believe that it is absolutely not politically salient for most voters. They don’t think about it, and I don’t think they can change that.”\nThe challenge for Democrats, he said, “is that the major catastrophes of our time … are not political winners for us. They’re extraordinarily important and just ignored by most voters.”\nWhen I asked Bennett, a veteran of the Michael Dukakis, Bill Clinton and Wesley Clark presidential campaigns, if Democrats should try to change that, he said, “It can’t be done.”\n“The climate movement has tried to change that for years, and they’ve made, at most, marginal gains in that regard,” Bennett said. “People do care about climate change, sort of, but they don’t vote on it.”\nDemocracy, he said, “is in the bucket with climate change.”\nIt’s that comparison — between democracy and climate — that comes up repeatedly in conversations with Democratic strategists.\n“It’s exactly the same thing,” said Ken Martin, chair of Minnesota’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party and head of the Association of State Democratic Committees.\nVoters, he said, are “just thinking about how the hell you put food on the table and how you keep your job.”\nEven on the Carter group calls, there is a recognition that the issue may not resonate as much as members of the group would like it to.\nFor many voters, said Greg Schneiders, a former Carter aide and Democratic pollster, “if the choice is a benevolent autocrat on your side or a representative of the coastal elites and the ‘deep state’ who might obey all the niceties of a functioning democracy but isn’t on your side, yeah, they’ll take the autocrat.”\nHe said, “If you can’t show that living in a democracy actually ends up with a better result for you personally than living in an autocracy, then you’re asking a lot of people … It’s a tough sell.”\nAs a result, even some true believers in the risk to democracy are approaching it in less abstract ways — not dissimilar from when climate change advocates suggested talking to the public less about climate than the immediate public health or economic risks it posed.\n\n\n\nWhen I asked Skye Perryman, the president of Democracy Forward, about the resonance of democracy in the midterms, she mentioned health care, the minimum wage, education, the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas, and economic unrest all as issues of concern to voters.\n“What we see every day is people deeply concerned about democracy and about the broader promise of democracy — what are their wages going to be, what is their economic opportunity going to be, can they educate their kids, are they going to be able to raise their kids in safe communities? These are broader democracy issues,” she said. “There is a movement that is seeking to eradicate and undermine the very foundation of our democracy … But that same movement is also engaged in a range of conduct that is harmful to people and communities, and that is a democracy issue, too.”\n\nDemocratic messaging about democracy itself may pick up once Trump announces he’s running again for president, as is widely expected, especially if Biden seeks a second term.\nBiden, who was in the Senate even before Carter got to Washington, is steeped in institutional concerns. He cast his 2020 campaign broadly as a return to democratic norms, and in a preview of his likely messaging in 2024, he said of Trump last month: “You can’t be pro-insurrection and pro-democracy. You can’t be pro-insurrection and pro-American.”\nIf the electorate’s attention to threats to democracy can be fleeting, said John Anzalone, the longtime Biden pollster, “the fact is, in some ways we forget democracy worked.”\n“The fact is that we had a threat,” Anzalone said, referring to the 2020 election. “America rose up, and it kicked its ass.”\nStill, he said it “wouldn’t surprise anyone” if Biden or Democrats running in some midterm elections make it more of an issue as the campaign season unfolds.\nThere may still be time for that. Most of the party’s paid messaging will not come until after Labor Day. Democrats in some races are issuing fundraising appeals based on their opponents’ statements about elections, and they have found criticizing Republicans for election denialism effective when wrapped into a broader critique of a candidate as “extreme.”\nOn the call in November with the Carter group, Gephardt, who is 81 and living in Florida, said, “Us old people don’t have much of an audience … And we shouldn’t. We’re has-beens. But we love this country, we love this democracy, and we’ve got to play the role of Paul Revere.”\nBut that was in November. This spring, the Carter group met less often, disrupted by a run of deaths and memorial services for members of the group or people close to them. Between March and May, among other people, Albright and two former House representatives — Vic Fazio and Norman Mineta, also a former transportation secretary — passed away. There was a memorial service in May for Walter Mondale, the former vice president who, before his death last year, had been a regular on the calls.\nBy the time the group resumed its regular meetings earlier this summer, the anxiety some members had about democracy in the fall was no less severe. In some ways, they were even more dispirited. (Carter was aware of the group’s meetings, Francis said, but has yet to participate in one. He has publicly warned the country is at risk of “losing our precious democracy,” while the Carter Center, long involved in monitoring elections abroad, turned its focus to the United States for the first time in 2020.)\nIt’s conventional wisdom among pro-democracy activists globally that one strategy for protecting the ballot is to boost pro-democracy candidates regardless of their party. But instead, in a handful of states including Michigan, Maryland and Pennsylvania, Democratic groups had been meddling in Republican primaries, spending millions of dollars elevating pro-Trump hard-liners they believed would be easier for Democrats to defeat in the fall.\nIt may have been smart politics. In Maryland, the candidate helped by the Democratic Governors Association, Dan Cox — a state lawmaker who organized buses to Washington for the rally preceding the riot at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 — is running in such a heavily Democratic state that he is almost certain to lose. By helping to sink Rep. Peter Meijer of Michigan, one of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump — the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee may have given Democrats a better chance of flipping a congressional seat there.\n\n\n\nLast month, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California defended such interventions, describing them as political decisions “made in furtherance of our winning the election.”\nAnd there’s an argument to be made that she’s right. In 2012, then-Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri was all but written off before she intervened in the Republican primary to elevate a weak opponent, Todd Akin, whose campaign imploded after his remarks about “legitimate rape.” One Democratic National Committee member told me, “The practicality of it has been proven in several races.” And given the significance of party affiliation in Washington, he said — when it comes to elections, but also everything else on the Democratic agenda — it may be worth it if it helps a Democrat win.\nCriticism of the practice may also overstate the risk. There’s a likelihood in some contests that Republicans would have voted for the hard-liner in the primary regardless of anything Democrats did. Highlighting a Republican’s Trump-ian credentials may help him or her in a primary, but it can also serve to define them at a critical moment early in the campaign, blunting any effort they might make to walk back their positions in the general election.\n“Having them defined early means there is a subset of voters who are never going to consider them” in the general election, said David Turner of the Democratic Governors Association. “It’s educating them about how extreme they are.”\nStill, there is a queasiness within the Democratic Party about it. For Democrats who had been elevating concerns about democracy, the interventions in Republican primaries — in some cases on behalf of election deniers — seemed this year to be dicier than in the past. Moreover, it undercut the idea that Democrats were treating democracy as an existential concern.\nIn a sign of the fracture within the party over the practice, about three dozen former Democratic House and Senate members, including Gephardt and Hart, signed on to an open letter criticizing it this month.\nHart called the meddling “beneath us” and “the worst kind of political manipulation.” And at his home in California, Francis said, “It plays into the cynicism of the public who thinks it’s all just a fucking game.”\n“It’s not a game,” Francis said. “Governing and democracy is serious business.”\nLast week, Francis said he was thinking of ways to “start inventorying what is going on on the pro-democracy side, what activities are underway, where’s the leadership, who’s doing the public opinion research and the messaging, where are the gaps.”\n“Somebody needs to pull them together, it seems to me,” he said.\nYet Francis worried Republicans were way ahead of Democrats on the issue. While Democrats were still talking about raising the public’s awareness, election denialism had become one of the chief motivating forces on the right, with Republicans nominating candidates in this year’s midterms who reject the results of the last election and could have enormous influence over future ones.\n“What we’re doing is such a drop in the bucket,” Francis said. “The question is how to turn this into a movement. And it hasn’t yet, not in the same way that it has turned into a movement on the right.”\nFrancis said he doubted anything meaningful could be accomplished before the midterm election. And he wasn’t optimistic, either, about 2024.\n“No,” he said. “No.”\nHe paused, then added, “I’m deathly afraid of where we’re going, and where we’re going to end up.”",

        "description": "The Inflation Reduction Act that President Joe Biden signed into law last week includes $369 billion for climate and energy programs — tens of billions of which are intended to directly benefit American consumers.\nThose subsidies for homeowners, low-income Americans and even farmers are sprinkled throughout the sprawling package, which modeling suggests could cut U.S. emissions of planet-warming gases 40 percent from 2005 levels by the end of the decade.\nBut getting consumers to take advantage of the new benefits — and the emissions reductions they'll entail — will be a challenge for the Biden administration and its allies.\n\"Implementation of all of this, it's gonna take a bunch of work,\" said Sam Calisch, the head of special projects at the environmental group Rewiring America. He added: \"Because in the end, the amount of money that goes out the door is totally dependent on uptake.\"\n \n\nAmong the barriers consumers could face in accessing the benefits are the sometimes sizable personal investments needed to qualify for the federal tax credits and the need for states — including those led by Republican governors — to administer some direct subsidy programs. Then there is the complexity of qualifying for the benefits, some of which need to be sorted out by the Internal Revenue Service, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Energy or other government bodies.\nHere's a breakdown of how people can gain access to the new law’s climate and energy benefits — and the obstacles that may lie in wait:\nElectric vehicle subsidies\n\n\n\nIf you were in the market for an electric vehicle, it’s your lucky day. Sorta.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act expands the tax credits available to electric vehicle buyers. At full value, the credit is worth $7,500. That’s particularly good news for someone looking to buy a vehicle from Tesla or General Motors, which makes the Chevrolet Bolt. Neither automaker had been eligible for the federal tax credits after hitting a quota under the government’s preexisting subsidy program. Other companies, such as Ford and Nissan, were on track to hit the cap in the next couple of years.\nThe good news doesn’t stop there. Instead of claiming the credit on their taxes as they would have needed to do in the past, car buyers will be able to directly apply it to the purchase price of the vehicle starting in 2024.\n“The big picture is you are going to have an EV tax credit that is around longer than the status quo,” said Corey Cantor, an EV analyst at Bloomberg New Energy Finance.\nSo time to head to the local dealership and buy a new EV, right? Well, it’s not so simple.\nThe new tax credit comes with strings attached. The vehicle needs to be assembled in North America. The buyer will need to satisfy income eligibility requirements. Individuals making more than $150,000 a year or couples making more than $300,000 annually don’t qualify. And if you're eyeing a sleek Lucid Air, with a base price of $87,400, you’re out of luck. The law caps the value of new sedans eligible for the credit at $55,000 and trucks and SUVs at $80,000.\nMost importantly, the car will need to satisfy two manufacturing requirements to be eligible for the credit. The first requires a portion of the battery parts to be made in North America. The second provision requires a percentage of the minerals that go into that battery to be mined domestically or in countries with a free-trade agreement with the U.S.\nSo what’s that mean for car buyers?\n“It is going to be bumpy for consumers in the short term as they implement this,” Cantor said, noting that consumers should expect varying credit values based on a vehicle's make and model.\nIn the near term, consumers can reasonably expect to receive partial credit ($3,750) for domestically made vehicles. Think Tesla, GM, Ford — all of which have battery manufacturing in the United States or North America.\nWho’s going to be disappointed? Consumers interested in buying a Hyundai Ioniq, which has emerged as a particularly popular EV model in recent years. Hyundai is building a new electric vehicle factory in Georgia, which would make it eligible for the partial credit. But that facility isn’t expected to be completed until 2024.\nCantor said he was optimistic that automakers will tool up to meet the law’s requirements. Companies such as Hyundai are investing in U.S. manufacturing, and battery chemistries are evolving, which could make it easier to comply with the mineral requirements over time.\nThe bill also includes a used electric vehicle tax credit of $4,000 or 30 percent of the vehicle’s value, depending on which is lower.\nThe fine print: If you had put money down on a new EV before Tuesday, when Biden signed the Inflation Reduction Act, you still qualify for the preexisting tax credits. This will matter to folks who have signed up to buy an EV but are waiting for it to be delivered. Vehicles purchased after the law was enacted will need to comply with the new North American assembly requirements. The Department of Energy has a list of vehicle modules that comply with the new requirements, and the IRS has also posted updated guidance for EV buyers.\nFor the resale tax credit, the used electric vehicle must be at least 2 years old, and it can only qualify once for the subsidy.\n\nHome energy efficiency tax credits\nThe law can also help people who need to upgrade their home electric panel to handle EV charging and other new electrical devices.\nEach year for the next decade, consumers can claim a tax credit for 30 percent of the cost of qualified projects that make their home less drafty or improve the energy efficiency of the devices within it. With a couple of exceptions (which are detailed in the next section), the law sets an aggregate annual limit of $1,200 for those credits.\nThe law also sets specific limits for certain projects or products allowed under the tax credit. There is up to $150 for a home energy audit, $600 for new energy-efficient exterior windows or skylights and $500 for exterior doors.\nThe credit also includes up to $600 for highly efficient central air conditioners; electric panel upgrades; and water heaters, furnaces and water boilers that run on natural gas, propane or oil. But it won’t be easy to find fossil-fuel-powered appliances that qualify for the credit.\nThe law says they have to \"meet or exceed the highest efficiency tier\" of the Consortium for Energy Efficiency, a nonprofit standard-setting group. That means the appliances generally must be more efficient than Energy Star-certified products. And the consortium doesn't even rate propane or oil-fired products, according to John Taylor, the group's deputy director.\nHeat pumps and wood-burning stoves\n\n\n\nThe Democratic staffers who drafted the Inflation Reduction Act apparently had a soft spot for heat pumps and biomass.\nIf you purchase an energy-efficient electric or gas-powered heat pump for space heating and cooling or a heat pump water heater, you'd qualify for 30 percent tax credits up to $2,000.\nElectric heat pumps for heating and cooling can cost more than $20,000 to purchase and install, according to estimates from Rewiring America. Electric heat pump water heaters generally cost less than $4,000.\nThe same-sized tax credits are also available for highly rated stoves and boilers that generate heat from burning wood or other biomass feedstocks.\nThe credits for heat pumps or biomass stoves and boilers also wouldn't count against the $1,200 annual limit for the home energy efficiency tax credit detailed in the previous section.\nElectrification rebates\nA subsidy could even be available for people who don't have thousands of dollars on hand to pay for a new heat pump.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act includes $4.5 billion over 10 years for state and tribal programs that are intended to deeply discount or fully fund electrification and efficiency projects or electrical appliances for low- and moderate-income households. The qualifying households are defined in the law as individuals or families whose annual incomes are less than 80 percent of the area median or not greater than 150 percent of the median.\nThe lowest-income households are eligible for point-of-sale rebates covering the full cost of certain electrical appliances or efficiency projects. Moderate-income individuals and families can get half off. The cumulative rebates available to each household total $14,000.\nThe law sets rebate caps for selected electric product classes. There is up to $8,000 available for purchasing space heating and cooling heat pumps. For heat pump water heaters, the max is $1,750. For electric stoves, it's $840.\nThe high-efficiency electric home rebates should also cover half or all the cost of upgrading electric panels up to a $4,000 limit. Other covered services are electrical work, with a $2,500 max, and insulation projects, up to $1,600.\nOne complicating factor: In some states, those programs would be administered by Republican governors who opposed the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\"There's going to be guidance issued by the Department of Energy on how state energy offices can do this,\" Rewiring America's Calisch said of the rebates. \"There are plenty of opportunities where friction could pop up, so there's a bunch of work to do to make sure that doesn't happen.\"\nRewiring America also created an Inflation Reduction Act benefits calculator that helps households determine whether they would qualify for the tax credits or rebate programs.\nSolar, batteries and geothermal\n\n\n\nHave you been considering adding solar panels to your home or subscribing to a community solar project? The Inflation Reduction Act made both of those options more financially rewarding.\nThe tax credit for solar power and geothermal heating projects that came online this year was limited to 26 percent of their cost. That benefit was also set to fall to 22 percent in the next few years. But the new law immediately bumped the tax credit to 30 percent, where it will stay over the next decade before ramping down.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act also added a similarly long-lasting tax credit for home battery units with more than 3 kilowatt-hours of storage capacity. Those units can help solar-powered homes run on renewable energy even when the sun isn't shining.\nThe longevity of the tax credit should come in handy for homeowners looking to go solar, said Justin Baca, vice president of markets and research at the Solar Energy Industries Association. In the past, many customers encountered a rush to get projects done by the end of the year, hoping to claim the higher tax credit before it declined. Now, consumers won’t feel the same time pressures.\n“That’s probably very welcome news for a lot of people,” Baca said.\nFunds for farmers\nOne of the most overlooked aspects of the law is the $20 billion made available to farmers. The Inflation Reduction Act pumps that money into preexisting agricultural programs that aim to promote environmental stewardship and conservation. Farmers interested in the money can go to their local Natural Resource Conservation Service office to apply, just as they would for existing federal programs.\nThe Inflation Reduction Act is the single largest investment in agricultural conservation in the country’s history, said Scott Faber, who tracks agricultural stewardship programs at the nonprofit Environmental Working Group. Today, the country spends about $6 billion annually on farmers to promote environmental sustainability.\n“That sounds like a lot — it is a lot,” Faber said.\nBut so too is the need for that expanded funding.\n“We turn away about two out of three farmers who are offering to reduce [greenhouse gas] emissions, improve water quality or help the environment because there simply isn’t the funding,” he said.\nThe money in the Inflation Reduction Act could make a massive difference in pushing down agriculture’s famously stubborn emissions. Yet the extent of those emission reductions will largely depend on how the new money is spent, Faber said.\nTake the Environmental Quality Incentives Program, or EQIP as the long-standing environmental stewardship program is known. EQIP will receive $8.5 billion under the Inflation Reduction Act, the most of any agricultural program. Farmers can receive federal funding to plant cover crops, add trees that form wind breaks along their fields, and restore wetlands and riparian areas. All these things could help reduce emissions, Faber said.\nBut other EQIP offerings actually could increase emissions. When the program was established in 1996, Congress was concerned about waste lagoons at large-scale farms failing and contaminating local water supplies. So EQIP money can be spent repairing or improving those lagoons, which happen to emit large amounts of methane — a potent heat-trapping gas.\n“If this money is wisely spent on practices that reduce emissions, especially [nitrogen oxides] and methane, the Inflation Reduction Act could be a game-changer for farmers and the planet,” Faber said. “If it is squandered the way so much conservation spending has been, it could be ag’s Solyndra moment.”\nSolyndra was the solar panel maker that famously went bankrupt after receiving a $535 million loan backed by the Obama-era Energy Department, triggering years of attacks from Republicans.\nOther agricultural programs received funding too. The Regional Conservation Partnership Program got $4.95 billion to support its efforts to provide money to groups of farmers working together on conservation projects. The Conservation Stewardship Program received $3 billion for its initiatives to provide financial incentives for everything from habitat restoration to water management. And the Agricultural Conservation Easement Program got $1.4 billion to protect farmland threatened by sprawl.\nIn a statement, the Department of Agriculture said it intends to target funding for fertilizer management. Fertilizer is a source of nitrogen oxide emissions, which can fuel acid rain or fish-killing algae blooms. Conservation programs can reduce those emissions by promoting fertilizers with less NOx or with sustainable application practices, Faber said. Prices on fertilizer have increased following Russia's invasion of Ukraine.\nEmissions impact\nSo when you add up all these individual incentives, what do you get in terms of greenhouse gas reduction? The truth is their near-term impact is limited.\nMost emissions modeling expects large-scale clean energy projects to do much of the emissions cutting this decade. The Rhodium Group, an economic consulting firm, thinks the power sector will contribute 65 to 70 percent of U.S. emission reductions by 2030.\nSuch estimates can understate the impact of consumers' decisions. A new EV or heat pump that plugs into a greener grid has a multiplier effect, making the whole energy system cleaner, said Rewiring America’s Calisch.\n\"All these systems are really interlinked with each other,\" he said. \"So pulling apart different portions of [the Inflation Reduction Act] is hard, because a bunch of the emissions reductions come from the combination of switching your home and your car to run on electricity and then also the greening of the grid, which get categorized differently in the emissions reductions.\"\nOne reason the incentives for individuals are important is because it will likely take a long time to decarbonize buildings and transportation, said Ben King, a Rhodium analyst. Timing is one of the biggest challenges to reducing the carbon output of buildings and transportation. The average age of a vehicle on the road in the United States today is 12 years. Refrigerators, one of the most energy-intensive appliances in a home, also last an average of a dozen years, according to the Energy Department. And homeowners might replace a heating system once every couple of decades.\nIn other words, it will take time for the adoption of clean vehicles and appliances to achieve the critical mass needed to reduce emissions.\nElectric vehicles are a helpful example for understanding the emissions math. Rhodium thinks EVs will make up 19 to 57 percent of light-duty vehicle sales in 2030, in large part depending on the price of gasoline and diesel. But even in a scenario where EVs are 57 percent of new vehicle sales, they would amount to only 13 percent of light-duty vehicles on the road. In that case, EVs would produce an emission reduction of 31 million metric tons, according to Rhodium’s calculations. For reference, total passenger vehicle emissions were 605 million tons in 2020, according to EPA data.\nYet the individual incentives are important because they are critical to speeding up clean energy alternatives to the masses, King said. Contractors need more experience installing and serving heat pumps, as do appliance stores. The same can be said of car dealerships and EVs.\n“We’re still in the early adoption phase,” King said. “The bill makes an important investment in moving in that direction.”\nA version of this story first ran in E&amp;E News’ Climatewire.&nbsp;Get access to more comprehensive and in-depth reporting&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.eenews.net/&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-c79a-deb4-a9a2-d7df5371000e&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-c79a-deb4-a9a2-d7df5371000f&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Get access to more comprehensive and in-depth reporting&nbsp;on the energy transition, natural resources, climate change and more in POLITICO’s E&amp;E News.",

        "description": "TALLAHASSEE, Fla. — Jacqueline Rosario, a school board member in Indian River County in Florida, was recently chatting with a cashier at an ice cream shop when she mentioned she was running for reelection.\nA staunch supporter of school choice and parental rights, Rosario earned the backing of Gov. Ron DeSantis for her upcoming race in part because she voted against masking students during the pandemic.\nAnd, as it turns out, that endorsement was enough to score a potential new voter.\n“She said, because I’ve been endorsed by him, ‘you have my vote,’” Rosario said in an interview. “She didn’t even ask my stance on issues or why I’m running.”\nRosario is one of more than two dozen conservative school board candidates DeSantis endorsed this election cycle, a move that came with $1,000 donations and subsequently set off a series of partisan-fueled races across the state that have seen a huge amount of campaign money flowing into them.\n \n\nBy wading into school board races and endorsing local candidates, DeSantis is attempting to reshape the education landscape in the country’s third most populous state. The move is also leading Florida Republicans to send cash and campaign help on the eve of the primaries, in many cases targeting incumbents who have opposed some of the GOP’s policies.\nSome candidates have received hundreds of thousands of dollars from individual donors. Political committees tied to Florida Republicans and Democrats are also pouring tens of thousands of dollars into these normally sleepy races — eclipsing the amount in the 2018 midterm — underscoring the importance of K-12 education and mobilizing parents ahead of November.\n“Parental rights, curriculum transparency and classrooms free of woke ideology are all on the ballot this election, and it starts with school board elections,” DeSantis said last week when announcing a statewide campaign tour ahead of the midterms.\nOut of those endorsements, the DeSantis campaign is targeting 15 school board races among several counties that defied him and the GOP last fall by passing local student mask mandates.\nDeSantis is also challenging at least 10 incumbents who are running for reelection. In most instances, incumbents, regardless of affiliation, are being pushed to raise significantly more cash to defend their seats compared to four years ago, a sign of how endorsements are affecting campaigns this year.\nIf he succeeds, DeSantis could end up with new allies on school boards who can help him as he continues to rail against teacher unions and Democrats who oppose the handling of Covid-19 mandates and how schools should teach lessons on race and sexual identity.\nCampaigns turn ugly\nIn some cases, the races have been heated.\nIn Sarasota County, a mobile billboard blasted one local school board candidate — who is endorsed by Democrats — as a “LIAR” and “A BABY KILLER” for previously working at Planned Parenthood. The local Democratic Party called the ad a “new low” while slamming “DeSantis and other GOP operatives,” although the candidate endorsed by the Republican governor also denounced the billboard, which was paid for by Sarasota County-based political action committee ABCD.\nIn Miami-Dade County, a school board candidate was hit with a cease-and-desist from the DeSantis campaign in July for using a picture of DeSantis in an ad when the governor already endorsed her opponent.\n“It’s gotten fairy ugly,” Misty Belford, a Brevard County School Board member endorsed by the Florida Democratic Party, said in an interview.\nBelford’s race is one of seven pitting a candidate endorsed by DeSantis against one backed by Democrats, blurring the lines in what are non-partisan contests by law.\nThe stark differences between the two sides are playing out at the hyper-local level, illustrated by dueling yard signs in Brevard County that demonstrate the heated rhetoric in some of these school board races. Next to signs advocating to reelect Belford, a parent propped up signs saying she “illegally masked your children.”\n\n\n\nBelford said she’s “not investing a lot of energy” into the negative campaigning as she continues to knock on doors and canvass ahead of Tuesday’s election.\n“The shift in school board races has matched the divisiveness of our people’s perspectives,” Belford said.\nBelford in her bid for reelection is facing a political newcomer in Megan Wright, who has the backing of DeSantis.\nWright says she wants to be an advocate for parents on the school board and aligns with the Republican governor on key issues conservatives are pushing for in 2022. She’s against gender orientation and sexual identity being brought into the classroom and lessons that “focus on one race as an oppressor and one race as an oppressed,” which the GOP has branded as vestiges of “critical race theory.”\n“The school board believes they are the parent to the children, and that’s not their role whatsoever,” Wright said in an interview.\nThe DeSantis endorsements each came with a $1,000 contribution from his political committee. And on top of that, they also directed conservative state lawmakers where to donate their money.\nSome candidates backed by DeSantis are blowing out the competition on fundraising. Yet others are facing tighter margins or even losing their races.\n\n\n\nWright, for example, is leading the incumbent Belford by raising $41,565 compared to $40,120. Four years ago, Belford’s campaign raised $18,709 to defeat an opponent who raised $28,902.\nOne race in Sarasota County — which leans Republican despite the board supporting masking students in 2021 — has two candidates who have combined to raise more than $237,000. In this high profile clash, Bridget Ziegler, an incumbent endorsed by DeSantis who is married to the vice chair of Florida’s Republican Party, is facing Dawnyelle Singleton, a first time political candidate with Democratic support vying to be Sarasota’s first Black school board member.\nWith the election days away, Ziegler’s campaign has eclipsed $138,817 in donations, including $11,250 from political committees tied to conservatives.\nAnd Singleton, who has raised $134,648, has been backed by supporters including Rosalie Danbury, a Democratic donor who has sent $200,000 to the party, and Anita Springer, a member of the board of directors for Planned Parenthood in New England, the Sarasota Herald-Tribune reports.\nZiegler, by comparison, raised nearly $64,000 during her successful reelection campaign in 2018, records show.\nIn Miami-Dade County, a DeSantis endorsement is sparking a fundraising contest currently surpassing $405,000 between two candidates, records show.\nMarta Perez, a 24-year school board member, has raised about $244,000 against an educator backed by DeSantis, Monica Colucci, who has raised nearly $162,000, records show. Colucci has received more than $42,000 in donations from political committees tied to conservatives, including state lawmakers from all over Florida like former state House Speaker Chris Sprowls (R-Palm Harbor) and incoming Speaker Paul Renner (R-Palm Coast).\nThe power of endorsements\nAside from money, the DeSantis endorsements carry weight that isn’t measured in cash.\nWright said that her campaign has gotten more attention from all over the country since the endorsement from DeSantis, even though some of it comes from “keyboard commandos” calling her nasty names on the internet.\n“It absolutely helps,” Wright said of scoring an endorsement. “It lets people know this is where my policies are, where I stand.”\nOnce DeSantis dropped his wave of school board endorsements, Democrats ramped up their efforts to get involved in local races ahead of the primaries.\nThe Florida Democratic Party endorsed 28 candidates in total and Democrat Congressman Charlie Crist, vying for the party’s nomination, also offered up endorsements.\nThe Collective PAC — which helps elect Black candidates and previously ran TV ads for Democrat gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum — on Thursday endorsed Singleton, who is battling against Ziegler.\n\nThe FEA, which is technically nonpartisan but typically aligns with Democrats, donated $31,500 to 34 candidates since July, a list that includes four people running against DeSantis-backed candidates.\nAnd progressive activist group Florida Rising endorsed a slate of candidates, claiming that the “Florida GOP represents its corporate interests and the career ambitions of the Governor.”\nTo that end, some Democrats and the candidates they back wonder about the effects of school boards being openly politicized. They claim DeSantis created a “circus” for candidates, and fear the election may ultimately give him more sway on local boards, something state leaders elsewhere could seize on.\n“If DeSantis is successful in this, we’re going to start to see this type of rhetoric throughout the nation,” Justin Kennedy, a candidate running for the Volusia County board who is endorsed by Democrats, told reporters Friday. “It started in Virginia in 2020 where the governor was able to get some traction on some of these school issues. My fear is that this politization of schools will spread like wildfire.”\nBut candidates who DeSantis is supporting see it in a different light. They sought out his endorsement because they believe in the same ideas, which are proving to resonate with voters in Florida and beyond.\n“I’m proud of the endorsement,” Rosario said. “I endorse the governor as he has endorsed me.”\nGary Fineout contributed to this report.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/technology/3608606-midterm-elections-to-put-misinformation-policies-to-the-test/",
        "description": "Social media platforms’ plans to tackle election-related misinformation will be put to the test as congressional candidates ramp up online activity in the final months of midterm campaigns.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince the 2020 election, mainstream platforms like Twitter and Facebook have been more liberal in applying measures to block, label and remove politicians — including their watershed decisions to suspend former President Trump’s accounts last year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut as more politicians test the boundaries of the platforms’ rules with incendiary posts, especially after an uptick in violent rhetoric following last week’s FBI search of Mar-a-Lago, critics warn that tech companies need to do more than dust off their 2020 playbooks to follow through on their commitments to block misinformation and hate speech.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNew York University researcher Laura Edelson said to get at the core of the issue, platforms need to reassess the algorithms recommending content to users.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe compared taking content down after amplifying it to a wide online audience — the approach most platforms use, and plan to use ahead of November based on their public posts — to creating a car with no brakes and only airbags.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“By the time those are useful, the car’s crashed,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeta, Twitter and TikTok&nbsp;released their plans&nbsp;to&nbsp;moderate midterm election-related content in the past two weeks. Largely, the companies plan to deploy the same tactics as they did in 2020. All three said they will label such posts and point users to their respective election centers with authoritative voting&nbsp;information from partner organizations and local officials.\n\n\n\nTikTok gained more widespread appeal since the last election. And despite some warnings about national security concerns over its parent company ByteDance being based in China, which&nbsp;TiKTok has refuted, more candidates are using the platform to reach voters — especially young ones.\n\n\n\nTikTok does not allow paid political advertising, meaning the content it's moderating will mostly be organic posts.&nbsp;The company&nbsp;said it will label all posts related to midterm elections, regardless of if there’s a disputed comment.\n\n\n\nFacebook, now under the parent company name Meta, took that approach in 2020, but the company signaled a shift for this season. Meta President of Global Affairs Nick Clegg said in a blog post if labels are deployed, they will be used in a “targeted and strategic way” after feedback from users that the 2020 labels were “over-used.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to a Meta fact sheet, the company has “hundreds of people focused on the midterms across more than 40 teams” and spent $5 billion on global safety and security last year. But reports indicate the company is cutting back on content moderation to a degree. About 60 contract workers at Accenture working for Facebook for services like content moderation&nbsp;would&nbsp;be losing their jobs, Insider reported&nbsp;Thursday.\n\n\n\nA Meta spokesperson declined to comment about the report.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFacebook has been criticized over its handling of misinformation in the 2020 election, with critics saying the company didn’t do enough to stop the spread of false narratives casting doubt on election results or false claims about voter fraud.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Facebook again hasn’t fundamentally changed anything and they have defunded their own program of whack-a-mole,” Edelson said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe said the lack of change is worrying due to a spike in conspiracy theories about local elections and federal law enforcement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“And now they’re being tied together as if this is some grand conspiracy,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwitter said in a blog post last week it would label posts with misleading content or claims about voting, including false information about the outcome of the election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe election-specific policies from social media giants appear focused on claims of voter fraud or suppression, referencing the Stop the Steal movement&nbsp;casting doubt on President Biden’s win&nbsp;that gained steam online in 2020, despite platforms' efforts to fight such misinformation.&nbsp;The false narrative, amplified by Trump and his allies, gave rise to the violent riot at the Capitol&nbsp;on Jan. 6&nbsp;of last year.\n\n\n\nAfter the FBI searched Mar-a-Lago, there’s been an increase in violent rhetoric on mainstream and fringe sites that are casting the move as politically motivated against Trump. The posts are raising alarms about potential real world attacks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJacqueline Maralet, an assistant director at the Digital Forensic Research Lab, said the platforms’ election policies address far-right extremism “mostly&nbsp;insofar as, ‘This type of speech is already not allowed under our content moderation policies.’”\n\n\n\nThey may take actions against specific candidates that “push too far into” the edge of “clearly inciting violence,” she said, but it's not yet clear how strictly platforms will enforce their guidelines.\n\n\n\nFacebook and Twitter have been taking stricter action against politicians than they did before the 2020 election, including cutting elected officials off from their accounts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn addition to the suspensions of Trump — Twitter's permanent and Facebook’s lasting until at least 2023 — over the past year the companies have suspended various lawmakers, mostly for violations of their COVID-19 misinformation policy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwitter, for example, permanently suspended Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene’s (R-Ga.) personal account in January&nbsp;for that reason,&nbsp;although her official congressional account remains active.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMartin Rooke, a research fellow at Harvard’s Shorenstein Center, said moderating content for medical misinformation is “far simpler” than it is for posts linked to events like the FBI search of Mar-a-Lago which are “inherently political,” however.\n\n\n\nRegarding medical misinformation,&nbsp;“there are scientific authorities that can be consulted with,”&nbsp;he&nbsp;said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“But with this Mar-a-Lago event, when does content moderation really start to step on freedom of expression around being critical of law enforcement agencies, being critical of the government as well? I think that's where the more mainstream social media platforms are really going to run up against their limit of what they are prepared to do or what they can legally do,” Rooke said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat can be just as challenging around campaign-centered language, he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You could say, ‘Alright, well, we'll try and tamper down on sort of jingoistic expressions.’ But almost every election there's language about it being a contest, a battle, a flight for freedom, fight for the future — stuff like that,” Rooke said. “That combative language is embedded in our very modern way of discussing politics. So unless the social media platforms are going to be hiring people to sit there and monitor and observe these networks on an almost consistent basis it's going to be very, very hard to pick up.”\n\n\n\nAnother challenge is the “gray area” posts being spread by some Republican officials on mainstream platforms, Maralet said.\n\n\n\nShe&nbsp;characterized these as part of a&nbsp;“call and response” type of relationship in which a post from a Republican official on Twitter or Facebook may not explicitly call for violence, but leads to a more direct call from users on fringe sites.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBeyond incendiary posts about the FBI search, advocacy groups are also raising concerns about how social media platforms are handling other forms of hate speech, including a rise in anti-LGBTQ posts identified after the passage of Florida’s “Don’t Say Gay or Trans” bill.\n\n\n\nA report released by the Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC) earlier this month found that just 10 Twitter accounts drove 66 percent of impressions for the 500 most viewed anti-LGBTQ tweets using “groomer” as a slur between January and July.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmong them were&nbsp;the accounts of&nbsp;Reps. Greene and Lauren Boebert (R-Colo.), who are both seeking reelection in November.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe posts seemingly violate Twitter’s policy. A&nbsp;Twitter spokesperson confirmed that use of the term “groomer” is prohibited under the hateful conduct policy when used as a descriptor in context of discussion of gender identity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We agree that we can and must do better. Our mission and our responsibility is to proactively enforce all of our policies, and to do so as quickly as possible. We continue to invest in our automated tools and teams of specialist reviewers, to identify and address gaps in our enforcement,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThrough Meta’s Ad Library, researchers found 59 paid ads served to Facebook and Instagram users that shared a dangerous narrative that the LGBTQ community and allies are “grooming” children, according to the report.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Are social media companies prepared for the impact of this dangerous rhetoric in the wake of the 2022 elections? As we approach 2022 midterm elections, are social media companies prepared to enforce their policies and prevent some of the real life consequences we've seen in association with this language being used in previous elections,” Justin Unga, director of strategic initiatives at HRC, said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Meta said, “We reviewed the ads flagged in the report and have taken action on any content that violates our policies.”\n\n\n\nTo mitigate the issues, HRC officials said the platforms need to do a better job at enforcing the policies they already have in place.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This has real world consequences. It has political consequences. But we're really worried about the actual danger they're putting people in,” Jay Brown, senior vice president of programs at HRC, said.\n\n\n\n\"These platforms need to do better enforcing their own policies,\" he added.",

The concert formed part of this season’s exploration of the music of Ethel Smyth with a performance of her Mass in D, written in 1891, and premiered two years later, also at the Albert Hall.An imposing work, it was begun in 1889 following Smyth’s return to the UK after a decade in Germany, and is very much written in a European tradition that peers back through Brahms to Beethoven’s Missa Solemnis, also in the key of D. In part, it’s an affirmation of Smyth’s return to Anglicanism (it didn’t last), though it was also strongly influenced by her relationship with the Catholic Pauline Trevelyan, with whom she was in love. Yet it nevertheless rebels, iconoclastically, against liturgical tradition by wrenching the Gloria out of context and placing it last for purely musical reasons. Stylistically more consistent and less derivative than her later The Wreckers, it is also less immediate, hampered by a certain lofty stiffness in places, as much forbidding as it is impressive.Available on BBC Sounds until 19 August next year. The BBC Proms continue until 10 September. Continue reading...",

We might invoke grandchildren, at a push great-grandchildren, but after that, it all becomes a bit vague and, well, unimaginable.And while we look with awe and fascination at the Egyptian pyramids, built 5,000 years ago, we seem incapable of thinking, or even contemplating, 5,000 years in the future. That lies in the realm of science fiction, which is tantamount to fantasy. But the chances are, barring a global catastrophe, humanity will still be very much around in 5,000 years, and going by the average existence of mammal species, should still be thriving in 500,000 years.

You don’t just need a plausible legal case that tests interesting questions about presidential declassification powers; you need an easy-to-explain slam-dunk.”\n\n\n\n“So if you have Trump taking design documents for nuclear weapons and shopping them to his pals in Saudi Arabia, congratulations — you got him; lock him up. If you have him taking boxes of notes from foreign leaders because he’s a childish egomaniac who thinks that he’s earned his White House souvenirs, well, then take the documents back, declare victory for the public interest and stop there. And if he took documents about the Russia investigation itself, of the sort that he wanted declassified during his presidency, well, tread carefully, lest you trap us all in an awful time loop where it’s forever 2017.”",

        "description": "Social media companies are grappling with a flood of misinformation onan unexpected topic since&nbsp;Roe v. Wade&nbsp;was overturned: Posts promoting “abortion reversal pills.”\n\n\n\nThe dangerous and unproven treatment is being touted as a way for a pregnant person to halt a medication abortion before it can take effect. And while claims about these pills have existed on social media for years, they’re now skyrocketing — and getting a lot more traction with users.\n\n\n\nA POLITICO analysis of abortion-reversal content across the major social media platforms showed engagement — such as liking, reposting or commenting — increased significantly after the&nbsp;Dobbs&nbsp;decision. Facebook, for example, saw a dramatic spike of 3,500 interactions with “abortion reversal pill” content on June 24 — the day of the Supreme Court decision — up from 20 interactions on June 23, according to data compiled using CrowdTangle, a social media analysis tool.\n\n\n\nThis type of content falls into a gray area in many social media platforms’ policies about how to handle misinformation — one where definitive research doesn’t exist and the level of danger is unclear. As a result, they’re struggling to find the right approach and sometimes allowing abortion-reversal content even as they block posts about how to obtain medication abortions.\n\n\n\nIt’s a predicament that highlights the unique challenges facing companies from Facebook to Twitter and YouTube as they try to moderate mistruths about abortion on their sites without inserting themselves into a highly politicized debate.\n\n\n\nMisinformation researchers say the increase in abortion reversal content appears to be sowing doubt and confusion online, muddying the waters around the effectiveness of medication abortions, which pregnant people can still obtain through the mail even in states that have banned the procedure.\n\n\n\n“Mis- and disinformation is really designed to confuse you in that situation and make it more about the ideological arguments and conspiracies in a way to cloud your judgment about how easy or safe it is to access an abortion,” said Rachel Moran, a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Washington’s Information School studying health misinformation.\n\n\n\nThe posts allege that these abortion reversal treatments— which involve giving an individual progesterone after ingesting the first pill (mifepristone) in the two-pill medication abortion treatment — will stop the abortion. Websites and hotlines touting abortion reversal said progesterone is given as a pill, though it has been researched as an injection. Mifepristone blocks the flow of progesterone needed to support a pregnancy, and misoprostol causes cramping which expels the biological tissue.\n\n\n\nThe National Right to Life Committee — one of largest anti-abortion-rights groups — stands behind the alleged treatment and says women deserve to know it’s an option.\n\n\n\nBut the&nbsp;American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the nation’s leading organization of reproductive health clinicians, has said the reversal treatment is not supported by science and can cause dangerous hemorrhaging. And a&nbsp;2019 trial evaluating abortion reversal treatment&nbsp;with progesterone ended early due to three participants experiencing high levels of internal bleeding.\n\n\n\nDr. Mary Jacobson, chief medical officer of Alpha Medical, a women’s health telemedicine group that is in the process of adding medication abortion as a service, called the progesterone treatment “an unproven and unethical idea that suggests a flawed oversimplification of how complex hormonal and neurochemical processes of a medication abortion can be manipulated.”\n\n\n\nHowever, to date, federal health agencies like the Food and Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention haven’t weighed in on the safety or efficacy of administering progesterone as a way to reverse a medication abortion, making it more challenging for platforms to navigate the disinformation without a federal authoritative voice to cite. An FDA spokesperson said it has not approved any abortion reversal pill products.\n\n\n\nAbortion reversal pill content is just one subset of misinformation spreading online as debates about the&nbsp;Dobbs&nbsp;decision proliferate on social media.Other false content from anti-abortion groups includes posts saying the FDA-approved medication abortion causes cancer and infertility,&nbsp;even though medication abortion has been proven to be safer than Tylenol.And on the abortion-rights side, individuals are spreading misinformation about at-home herbal treatments to induce abortion, which can be potentially poisonous.\n\n\n\nOverall, the largest platforms have removed more content related to potentially dangerous herbal treatments from abortion rights groups, and less content about abortion reversal treatments from anti-abortion groups, said Jenna Sherman, a program manager at Meedan’s Digital Health Lab, a global tech non-profit focused on health misinformation research.\n\n\n\n“It’s good that any posts about natural remedies for abortion are being regulated, but it’s concerning that they’re being overly regulated in comparison to anti-choice rhetoric, which is also very harmful,” she said.\n\n\n\nThe largest social media platforms have taken differentapproaches to moderating the onslaught of mistruths about abortion. ByteDance’s TikTok and Google’s YouTube have instituted new policies to specifically combat content promoting unsafe abortion procedures and false claims about abortion treatments.\n\n\n\nTikTok’s&nbsp;medical misinformation policy&nbsp;prohibits content that can physical harm, and that includes abortion reversal and herbal abortion content, spokesperson Jamie Favazza said. But enforcement has been uneven. POLITICO identified videos promoting abortion reversal hotlines and alleged reversal treatment testimonials and flagged them to TikTok, which later took them down because they violated its policies, Favazza said.\n\n\n\nThe company had blocked all content related to the search for “herbal abortions” earlier this year and in August blocked searches related to the search terms “abortion pill reversal” and “abortion reversal pill,” after POLITICO identified videos on the topic. However, the search term “abortion reversal” is still unblocked because it also includes content related to the overturning&nbsp;Roe v. Wade, Favazza said. However, the results also include videos pushing abortion reversal pill content, which TikTok removed after POLITICO flagged them.\n\n\n\nYouTube started&nbsp;removing videos in July&nbsp;that provided instructions for unsafe abortions or promoted false claims about abortion safety under its&nbsp;medical misinformation policies.Those included videos incorrectly claiming abortion leads to cancer or infertility. It also prohibits videos that sell pharmaceuticals without a prescription, which would include abortion reversal pills. And YouTube added&nbsp;“context labels” to abortion content&nbsp;that links to the National Library of Medicine’s description of abortion.\n\n\n\nHowever, YouTube allows general discussion of abortion reversal treatments. Spokesperson Ivy Choi said the company will look to CDC, NIH, and WHO if they set guidance on such alleged treatments.YouTube has also added labels to posts by pregnancy crisis centers — which counsel pregnant people against abortion and sometimes push abortion reversal pills — to note that they don’t provide abortions.\n\n\n\nTwitter allows discussion of abortion — including abortion reversal content — but is using its&nbsp;Twitter Moments&nbsp;and&nbsp;Events pages&nbsp;to promote authoritative information and dispel misleading narratives, spokesperson Elizabeth Busby said.\n\n\n\nMeta,parent company of Facebook and Instagram, bans the promotion of&nbsp;medical misinformation&nbsp;if it is shown to cause harm, along with the sale of&nbsp;pharmaceutical drugs. Ads&nbsp;promoting prescription drugs&nbsp;also&nbsp;require pre-approval&nbsp;(including those that cause abortions) and must come from verified pharmaceutical companies, pharmacies or telehealth providers.\n\n\n\nStill,&nbsp;two ads promoting&nbsp;an abortion pill reversal hotline from anti-abortion groups were active on Facebook asof Friday afternoon.&nbsp;A Facebook spokesperson said the ads were allowed since they didn’t mention a pharmaceutical drug — like progesterone — by name. Meanwhile, Plan C, an advocacy organization that provides resources on medication abortion,&nbsp;showed POLITICO multiple ads&nbsp;on how to obtain medication abortion pills that Facebook rejected. The Facebook spokesperson said the ads were blocked because the landing page of websites on the ads listed pharmaceutical abortion drugs by name.\n\n\n\nSome of the surge of abortion-reversal content online may be connected to efforts by abortion rights groups to debunk it.\n\n\n\nPeople’s engagement with all sort of abortion posts on social media platforms tends to increase after new restrictions on abortion go into effect, said Rachel Muller Heyndyk, a senior fact checker at the U.K. based Logically.ai. As the conversation gains momentum, content from anti-abortion groups promoting abortion reversal pills gets swept up in it.\n\n\n\n“The more we engage with it, even if it is to criticize it, the more we’ll see it on our feed,” said Muller Heyndyk. She said because Facebook isn’t deciding whether abortion reversal content is dangerous or not, “it is inadvertently rewarding those pages.”\n\n\n\nFor example, the week after Texas’ six-week abortion ban went into effect last September, there were 170,000 interactions on abortion reversal pill content on Facebook compared to fewer than 200 interactions the month prior, according to CrowdTangle data.\n\n\n\nIf the social media companies are waiting for more guidance from the federal government on how to treat information about abortion reversal procedures, it may be awhile.\n\n\n\nWhile FDA chief Robert Califf has promised to&nbsp;make tackling health misinformation a priority, the agency has so far put more resources into countering falsehoods on Covid-19 and monkeypox. The agency launched a new website in early August called&nbsp;“Rumor Control”&nbsp;that tackles those two diseases, but doesn’t address abortion misinformation.",

        "description": "Sometimes, crunching numbers puts things in perspective.\nWe&#8217;re not talking about OPS+, wRC+, BABIP, or UZR.\nWe&#8217;re talking about Moneyball. No, not Michael Lewis&#8217; best-selling book, nor Brad Pitt&#8217;s movie interpretation.\nWe&#8217;re talking about the mega-millions of dollars spent to produce wins in Major League Baseball. When you look at dollars spent and how much those wins have cost each team this season, it&#8217;s eye-opening.\nLet&#8217;s begin with the Local Nine. According to Spotrac.com&#8217;s MLB payroll tracker, the Rockies&#8217; team payroll sits just above $140 million, ranking 17th in the majors. Entering Saturday&#8217;s games, the Rockies were in last place in the National League West with a 52-69 record. That figures out to $2.69 million per victory.\nIt sure hasn&#8217;t helped that Kris Bryant, who&#8217;s making $18 million this season, has been limited to 42 games because of injuries. The Rockies are 20-22 in the games in which he&#8217;s played.\nThe Diamondbacks, 55-64 and four games up on the Rockies in the NL West, have a relatively meager payroll of $84.6 million, translating to $1.54 million a win. The mighty Dodgers have both the highest payroll ($265.2 million) and the best record (82-36) in the majors. Cost per win: a cool $3.23 million.\nAt least the wealthy Dodgers are winning, although their expectant fans will surely consider 2022 a disappointment if the Dodgers don&#8217;t win the World Series.\nA number of big-spending, but low-rolling teams are getting very little bang for their buck. Start with the disappointing Red Sox, who are 59-61, with a $207 million payroll that costs them $3.39 million per win.\nThe White Sox (61-59, $196.4 million) are still alive in the wide-open AL Central, but each of their 61 wins has cost them $3.21 million. The White Sox are chasing the Twins (62-55, $143.1 million, $2.31 million per win), as well as the frugal but successful Guardians. The Guardians lead the AL Central with a 64-55 record and they&#8217;ve done it by doling out just $66.2 million in salaries and bonuses. In Cleveland, it&#8217;s costing only $1.03 million per W.\nThe biggest financial loser of all? That would be the Angels, a 52-67 team with $179.8 million payroll that computes to $3.46 million per victory. I imagine that ineptitude is not lost on superstar Shohei Ohtani, who&#8217;s eligible for free agency after 2023. The Angels are reportedly going to approach him about a contract extension that probably will start with an annual salary of about $50 million.\nNow for the big Moneyball winner. Drumroll, please &#8230;\nThe Orioles, yes, those Orioles, are paying just $706,452 per win. With a 62-57 record in the tough AL East, they remain very much alive for a wild-card playoff spot. Baltimore&#8217;s $43.8 million payroll is the lowest in the majors. Yes, even lower than the Athletics&#8217; $47.8 million. The awful A&#8217;s have paid $1.11 million for each of their 43 victories.\nHow big a surprise have the thrifty Orioles been?  Before the season, FanGraphs predicted that the O&#8217;s would be the worst team in the majors.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Ryan McMahon endures sad glove story on bizarre second-inning play\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies rally twice but lose 11-inning heartbreaker to Giants\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBaseball edges closer to implementing automatic strike zone in major leagues\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Ryan Feltner passes test, Wynton Bernard delivers in win over Giants\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Jose Iglesias, who defected from Cuba, reaches 10 years in majors\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\nFinally, consider this nugget from ESPN&#8217;s David Schoenfield:\n&#8220;(Baltimore) is trying to become one of the biggest surprise teams in recent history. In the wild-card era (since 1995), the best year-to-year improvement came from the 1999 Diamondbacks, who went from 65 wins as an expansion team to 100 wins &#8212; a 35-win increase. If the Orioles can get to 88 wins, they&#8217;ll be 36 wins better than last season.&#8221;\nSometimes, even in Major League Baseball, money really isn&#8217;t everything.",

        "description": "May 17 was a red-letter day for Pacific Coast League baseball, and Josh Suchon had his antenna up.\nAs the play-by-play man for the Albuquerque Isotopes, the Rockies&#8217; Triple-A farm team, Suchon was aware that he was witnessing baseball&#8217;s future. For the first time, balls and strikes were being called by a computer program during a PCL game..\nMore than three months later, &#8220;Robo Umps&#8221; &#8212; officially called the Automated Ball-Strike System (ABS) &#8212; have faded into the background at Isotopes games.\n&#8220;Most fans are oblivious that a computer is calling balls and strikes instead of an umpire,&#8221; Suchon said with a laugh. &#8220;You know how I can tell? The fans are still yelling at the umpire. That goes to show you how seamless it is.&#8221;\nBut that&#8217;s not to say that there aren&#8217;t bugs to be worked out as Major League Baseball approaches its next technological leap. Plus, there are alternatives to be considered and likely controversy ahead before MLB fully commits to using robot umps.\nCommissioner Rob Manfred has said he could see ABS in place at the major league level as early as 2024. He&#8217;s mentioned two possibilities: a) have the computer call all of the balls and strikes or b) leave the home plate umpire in charge of calling balls and strikes but institute a challenge system whereby each team would have a limited number of chances to contest a ball/strike call during the game.\n&#8220;We hear all the time from players, &#8216;Why don’t we have an electronic strike zone?&#8217; Well, we try to be responsive to those sorts of expressions of concern,&#8221; Manfred told The Athletic. &#8220;We have spent a lot of time and money on the technology. It’s not just to address player concerns. It obviously has broadcasting uses. That same technology can be used in our broadcasts, which has value to our fans.&#8221;\nBut there are many in the game who don&#8217;t want the human element to be replaced by a machine.\nDodgers left-hander Clayton Kershaw, a future Hall of Famer, has said he&#8217;s opposed to robot umps. So is Rockies right-hander German Marquez, who likes jawing with the men behind the plate.\n&#8220;It would be weird,&#8221; Marquez said. &#8220;I think we&#8217;re going to lose some of the essentials of baseball. Sometimes you fight with the umpire. I like that. I would miss that.&#8221;\nRockies manager Bud Black, 65, is proudly old-school in a lot of ways. As a major-league player, coach, and manager, he&#8217;s lived with his share of controversial calls, including in Game 6 of the 1985 World Series.\nDon Denkinger blew a call that stands as one of the biggest umpiring mistakes in baseball history. The Cardinals held a 1-0 lead and were three outs away from raising the trophy when Denkinger, the first-base umpire, ruled Royals pinch hitter Jorge Orta safe. TV replays clearly showed that pitcher Todd Worrell, taking a flip throw from first baseman Jack Clark, won the race to the bag. The blown call gave the Royals life, setting the stage for a two-run rally that sent the series to Game 7, which the Royals won.\nNearly 37 years later, Black, who was warming up in the Royals bullpen at the time, is on board with robot umps.\n&#8220;I think it’s like anything in this modern era of our culture,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Technology is becoming so good that I think it makes sense. I was originally reluctant about replay because I think that the human element is part of the game. But in the spirit of true competition, it makes sense.&#8221;\n* * *\nMajor league umpires, as never before, are open to criticism because they operate in an age when high-speed video cameras enable broadcasters and fans to dissect every pitch.\nIn reality, the umps get most of it right.\nDuring the first half of the season, according to UmpireScorecards.com, Jeremie Rehak and Pat Hoberg were the most accurate home plate umpires, getting 95.6% of balls-and-strikes calls correct. Among umpires who have worked more than one game calling balls and strikes, Andy Fletcher (91.4%) and CB Bucknor (91.7%) were the least accurate.\nBlack said that during a recent game, he had issues with about 10 out of the 150 pitches his pitchers threw, 6.7%.\nStill, the demand for perfection exists and technology is in place to lessen the margin of error.\nABS works by using the Hawk-Eye tracking system that&#8217;s installed in every major-league ballpark. A computer program determines whether a pitch is a ball or a strike and that information is relayed to the home-plate umpire who wears an earpiece into which a computer-generated voice tells him the call. If the technology fails, the umpire calls balls and strikes.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s almost instantaneous, the umpire gets the call in a flash,&#8221; Suchon said. &#8220;That was one of my questions going it. But it&#8217;s very fast and that’s what feeds into fans not even knowing there is a computer making the call.&#8221;\nJulio Cortez, The Associated PressA radar device is seen on the roof behind home plate at PeoplesBank Park during the third inning of the Atlantic League All-Star minor league baseball game, Wednesday, July 10, 2019, in York, Pa. Home plate umpire Brian deBrauwere wore the earpiece connected to an iPhone in his ball bag which relayed ball and strike calls upon receiving it from a TrackMan computer system that uses Doppler radar. The independent Atlantic League became the first American professional baseball league to let the computer call balls and strikes during the all star game.\nFormer Rockies outfielders Cory Sullivan and Ryan Spilborghs, both of whom work as analysts for AT&amp;T SportsNet, prefer a different route.\n&#8220;We want a version of the ABS, but it wouldn&#8217;t be fully automatic,&#8221; Spilborghs said. &#8220;We want a challenge system.&#8221;\nSpilborghs advocates that each team would have five balls-and-strikes challenges per game. Sullivan wants eight.\n&#8220;The idea is that the umpire still calls ball and strikes, but if there is a borderline call, there can be a challenge,&#8221; Sullivan said. &#8220;The automated system has already alerted the umpire if it&#8217;s a ball or a strike. It would take no time at all.&#8221;\nLast season, the low-A Florida State League, which is being used as a pilot program by MLB, employed the ABS full-time. This season, the league uses the robot umps in the first two games of each series, then has a human call ball and strikes in the remaining game with a challenge system. Each team gets three challenges and keeps its challenge if successful. Only the pitcher, catcher or batter may appeal, not the manager.\n&#8220;I would love that,&#8221; Astros ace Justin Verlander told The Associated Press. &#8220;These (umpires) get a lot of flak, but they have one of the hardest jobs in the world. We’re throwing 100 mph, nicking corners. If I were an umpire, I like that: &#8216;Oh, you think you’re better than me? Appeal it and find out.&#8217; I think it’s a fun back and forth.&#8221;\nRockies players who have played in games utilizing ABS have some major issues with it.\nThe first is that ABS creates a bigger strike zone because every pitch that clips the strike zone is called a strike. That has not gone over well with some hitters in the PCL.\n&#8220;I wish there was more of, &#8216;You have to have X percentage of the ball that crosses the zone for it to be a strike,&#8221; said Rockies left fielder Kris Bryant, who did a rehab stint with the Isotopes earlier this season. &#8220;Because the ones that just nick the corner, that&#8217;s the gray area. As a pitcher, you’re like, ‘maybe it&#8217;s a strike?’ And as a hitter you&#8217;re like, ‘I don&#8217;t know either.&#8217; &#8221;\nLeft-hander Austin Gomber said there needs to be a better definition of what constitutes the strike zone.\n&#8220;Technically, it&#8217;s supposed to be the letters to the knees, but everyone knows that it’s not actually been the letters to the knees for the past 50 years,&#8221; Gomber said. &#8220;If we are going to implement an automated strike zone, we are going to have to have black and white on what it is.&#8221;\n* * *\nThe width of home plate is 17 inches, and the official strike zone is the area over home plate from the midpoint between a batter&#8217;s shoulders and the top of the uniform pants &#8212; when the batter is in his stance and prepared to swing at a pitched ball &#8212; and a point just below the kneecap. In order to get a strike called, part of the ball must cross over part of home plate while in the aforementioned area.\nIn practice, of course, the width is sometimes extended an inch or two off of both corners of the plate. Plus, the actual top of the strike zone is not regularly called a strike. There are other variables as well, depending on who&#8217;s behind the plate and what the pitch count is. Studies have shown that with a 3-0 pitch, umps are more likely to call a close pitch a strike, and often call an 0-2 pitch a ball.\nABS does adjust for each hitter, creating a strike zone based on a hitter’s height and usual crouch at the plate. That way, 6-foot-7 Yankees slugger Aaron Judge has a different zone than Astros 5-foot-6 second baseman Jose Altuve.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Ryan McMahon endures sad glove story on bizarre second-inning play\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies rally twice but lose 11-inning heartbreaker to Giants\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMoneyball: MLB&#8217;s big-spending losers and frugal winners of 2022\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Ryan Feltner passes test, Wynton Bernard delivers in win over Giants\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Jose Iglesias, who defected from Cuba, reaches 10 years in majors\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\nDuring ABS&#8217;s test run in the Florida State League last season, there were a lot of walks early in the season, and not just because young pitchers tend to be wild at the low-A level.

MLB’s Competition Committee would have to approve any changes to the strike zone.\nPerhaps lost in the conversation is the fact that robot umpires would eliminate pitch framing, one of a catcher&#8217;s most valued skills. Rockies catcher Dom Nunez would hate to see pitch framing become obsolete.\n&#8220;My goal is to stay in the big leagues and framing is still an important skill,&#8221; he said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve been doing it for a long time, so it&#8217;s become pretty secondary to me. I would hate not being able to get a call for your pitcher.&#8221;\nBut like it or loathe it, robot umpires, in some form, are coming to Major League Baseball.\nCount Rockies outfielder Sam Hilliard, who experienced the automatic strike zone firsthand earlier this season in Triple-A, as a skeptic.\n&#8220;I don’t think it would be received well by a lot of people at first, but I don’t think there is a way where everybody is going to be happy,&#8221; he said.\nBlack looks at baseball&#8217;s high-tech future with a mixture of nostalgia and realism.\n&#8220;We don&#8217;t see the manager running out to second base to argue a call anymore,&#8221; he said. &#8220;We don&#8217;t see Earl Weaver kicking dirt on home plate. That&#8217;s all gone. Is that progress? I don’t know. But I do know that I don&#8217;t want baseball to be stuck in the mud.&#8221;",

The Pittsburgh Pirates came into Saturday’s game on a two-game winning streak and looking for number three against the Cincinnati Reds, but the game was a referendum on the typical overall bad baseball that’s plagued the Buccos all year in a 10-1 defeat.\nThere was bad hitting. The Bucs were held to one run and four total hits on the day. Two of those hits came from Rodolfo Castro, who finished 2-for-4 and was also responsible for Pittsburgh’s only run of the day with a solo homer in the fourth inning. \n\n\nRodolfo Castro JUST clears the fence for a homer! pic.twitter.com/ZvoUIb7rL8— Mr Matthew CFB (@MrMatthewCFB) August 21, 2022\n\n\n\nIn addition, Pittsburgh batters went 0-for-5 with runners in scoring position and they also struck out 10 total times as a team.\nThere was bad fielding, with errors attributed to Oneil Cruz (on a throw) and another to Tyler Heineman on catcher interference. Cruz’s eighth error of the year allowed Cincy’s first run to score in the third inning. \nThere was bad starting pitching. Tyler Beede went four innings, giving up five runs, four of them earned, on six hits with two strikeouts and a walk.\nAnd there was bad relief pitching. Eric Stout gave up five runs on six hits with one strikeout and no walks in just one-third of an inning, which allowed the Reds to turn a convincing lead into a shellacking. \nBad baseball. 2022 in a nutshell. Not much else to say.\nThe series rubbermatch is this afternoon at 1:35pm.",

        "description": "BERLIN — On the second anniversary of the poisoning attack on Russian opposition figure Alexei Navalny, Germany and the United States hailed the determination of the Kremlin critic who is still imprisoned in Russia on charges those nations consider politically motivated.\n“He barely survived the assassination attempt. He was able to recover in Germany,” German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a video message released Saturday, praising the Russian dissident’s bravery for going back to his homeland.\n“I spoke with him during this time and got to know a courageous man who returned to Russia because he wanted to fight for democracy, freedom and the rule of law,” the chancellor added. “We should think about that now.”\nThe U.S. State Department called for the immediate release of Navalny and condemned the Russian government’s crackdown on opposition figures and independent media. Navalny is Russian President Vladimir Putin’s most well-known critic and has detailed huge incidents of corruption by his regime.\n“It is no coincidence that the Kremlin’s aggression in Ukraine has been accompanied by intensified repression at home,” U.S. State Department spokesman Ned Price said.\n“The Kremlin seeks to prevent the people of Russia from knowing about the atrocities its forces are inflicting on Ukrainian civilians, and also from learning about the needless Russian military casualties for the sake of this unjust war,” he added, referring to Russia’s six-month brutal war in Ukraine.\nNavalny himself tweeted Saturday that “this is the second time I celebrate my second birthday. The day they tried to kill me, but for some reason I didn’t die.”\nHe also wrote that his case “has exposed both Putin himself and his system to such an extent that it has shown not only the criminality, but also the dysfunctionality and failure of his regime.”\nNavalny was arrested in Russia in January 2021 upon returning from Germany, where he had been recuperating from nerve-agent poisoning that he blames on the Kremlin. He was handed a 2½-year sentence for a parole violation.\nIn March, Navalny was sentenced to nine years in prison on charges of fraud and contempt of court, which he rejected as politically motivated and an attempt by the authorities to keep him behind bars for as long as possible.\nEarlier this week, Navalny says prison officials ordered him to serve at least three days in solitary confinement, citing a minor infraction, in retaliation for his activism behind bars.",

Those songs form the soundtrack of US choreographer Kyle Abraham’s An Untitled Love, a piece that’s like eavesdropping on a house party, full of convivial warmth, glowing light, oozing music and the tactility of friends and nascent relationships. On stage, a sofa, rug and plant – a domestic setup where people gather and part, confess, conspire, laugh and flirt. A slice of African American life that’s both specific and universal.There’s a clear romcom influence (Abraham has cited the films of actor Sanaa Lathan) and we hear their chat as well as see them dance: a gossip about a couple from church, a debate about what outfit to wear, a caddish charmer trying to woo a girl out of his league. The dancing is delicious: honeyed limbs and snaking muscularity and hips finding the funk. A dancer might sashay into a pirouette; retiré before a soft shoe shuffle, in Abraham’s inimitable way of merging styles, classical, modern, social, street, into what feels like a naturalistic language on his dancers.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3609333-why-democrats-are-regaining-momentum/",
        "description": "This summer, high temperature records were shattered across the United States; wildfires burned millions of acres from Oklahoma to Alaska; droughts ravaged Western states, and floods devastated Appalachia. These disasters contributed to a sense of urgency that helped Democrats pass a boatload of bills, including the most sweeping climate change legislation in American history. In the run up to the midterm elections they have regained some momentum.\n\n\n\nAnd the contrast with Congressional Republicans on policies and priorities could not be more stark.\n\n\n\nRepublicans have blocked consideration of voting rights, childcare tax credits and restrictions on purchases of assault weapons. They have offered no proposals to spur economic growth or reduce inflation. Republicans have made irresponsible and inflammatory claims that the legally authorized search for top secret and classified documents at Mar-a-Lago was a “military occupation,” conducted by “rogue” FBI agents, who “planted” evidence. They have advocated the impeachment of Attorney General Merrick Garland and defunding the FBI. They continue to undermine our democracy by spreading the lie of widespread fraud in the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, despite a 50-50 split in the Senate and a slim majority in the House, Democrats are enacting legislation Americans want and need:\n\n\n\nThe Chips and Science Act allocates more than $50 billion for research and production of semi-conductors, which are essential to (among many other products) cars, weapons, washing machines and video games. This investment will reduce America’s dependence on China and increase the U.S. share of the world market from 2 to 10 percent. The Chips Act complements the $1 trillion Infrastructure Bill, signed by President Biden in November 2021, which allocates funds to repair or replace roads, bridges, rail systems, airports, and hazardous water pipes, increase access to broadband internet, and create hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\n\n\nThe Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics (PACT) Act is the largest expansion of health care and disability benefits for veterans of the armed services (deployed in Vietnam, the first Gulf War, Iraq and Afghanistan) in more than 50 years. PACT grants preemptive benefits to claims of respiratory illness and cancers related to exposure to burn pits and other toxins, 70 percent of which were denied between 2007 and 2020. The legislation, which was held up by Republicans, could affect millions of veterans.\n\n\n\nPassed without a single Republican vote in the Senate or the House, the Inflation Reduction Act is a massive climate, health, and tax bill. The legislation’s energy initiatives (including subsidies for electric cars) are expected to reduce carbon emissions in the United States by 40 percent in 2030. The bill reduces insurance costs in the Affordable Care Act; empowers Medicare to negotiate the prices of 100 prescription drugs over the next ten years; and caps out-of-pocket prescription drug costs at $2,000 a year for each Medicare recipient. The legislation levies a 15 percent minimum tax on the nation’s largest corporations and a 1 percent tax on stock buybacks. The whole package will reduce the deficit by about $300 billion.\n\n\n\nThis summer Democrats also discovered the political potency of support for reproductive rights. When the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, Donald Trump declared (with uncharacteristic modesty), “God made the decision.” The ruling “will work out for everybody,” the former president added. Mike Pence said, “We must not rest and will not relent until abortion is banned through the United States.” House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters he would support a nationwide ban on abortion. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), had already indicated that Congress “certainly could legislate in that area;” nor was it a “secret where Senate Republicans stand.”\n\n\n\nHouse Democrats quickly passed bills ensuring the right of pregnant women to travel across state lines to get abortions and protecting health care professionals who provide abortions and patients who obtain them from civil or criminal penalties. Not surprisingly, given the filibuster, the Senate did not even consider the House bills.\n\n\n\nThat said, the turnout and landslide vote of Kansans against amending the state constitution to allow their legislature to ban abortions strongly suggests that Democrats are energized on an issue that previously brought conservative, evangelical Republicans to the polls.\n\n\n\nIn the 2022 midterms, the issues and the legislative record seem to favor the Democrats. That said, as long as a large percentage of Americans do not approve of the president’s performance in office, remain deeply concerned about inflation, and give credence to culture war canards about immigration, race, and sexual identity, retaining control of the House and Senate is unlikely.\n\n\n\nBut the odds are better, maybe even a lot better, than they were a few months ago.\n\n\n\nGlenn C.

        "description": "Russian authorities are investigating a blast in the outskirts of Moscow on Sunday that killed the daughter of a close ally to Russian President Vladimir Putin.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Investigative Committee of the Russian Federation said in a statement that Daria Dugina, a journalist and political scientist, was killed after an explosive device that was planted under her Toyota Land Cruiser went off. \n\n\n\nDugina was the daughter of Alexander Dugin, a political philosopher and an outspoken supporter of Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nDugin, who pushed a vision of Russia becoming more “powerful” and “aggressive,” has been featured on Russian state television and is described as “Putin’s brain” by many. \n\n\n\nU.S. officials hit Dugin with sanctions in March for his support of Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, while Dugina was sanctioned for her work at a media outlet that the U.S. has said spreads disinformation. \n\n\n\nDugina appeared on Russian nationalist network Tsargrad as a radio commentator and news anchor.\n\n\n\nBritish officials imposed sanctions on Dugina last month, calling her a prominent “contributor of disinformation in relation to Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Ukraine on various online platforms,” The New York Times noted. \n\n\n\nAuthorities said that both Dugin and his daughter were in attendance at a Russian nationalist festival called “Traditions” on Saturday before the blast. \n\n\n\nOfficials in Ukraine have denied any responsibility for the blast.\n\n\n\n“Ukraine certainly had nothing to do with yesterday’s explosion,” Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Ukraine’s President Volodymyr Zelensky, said in a televised address on Sunday. \"We are not a criminal state like the Russian Federation, much less a terrorist one.”",

        "description": "Discovery's purchase of CNN earlier this year promised changes at the struggling network, and now those changes appear to be coming to fruition.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe big, albeit not surprising, media news earlier this week entails CNN media critic Brian Stelter leaving the network&nbsp;not long after publicly criticizing one of the power brokers at Discovery. And unless career self-destruction was the goal, it's hard to see why Stelter thought it was a good idea to say the following about Discovery's largest shareholder, John Malone.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The people who say the Zucker-era CNN was lacking in real journalism clearly were not watching CNN directly,” Stelter proclaimed earlier this&nbsp;year after then-CNN President Jeff Zucker was shown the door. “My best guess is that they were watching talking heads and reading columnists complain about CNN. And yes, I’m including John Malone in this.”\n\n\n\nYep, you read that correctly. The network's top media reporter publicly accused one of his new bosses of being misinformed while defending his former boss, who ran the network into the ground both from a ratings and credibility perspective. \n\n\n\nCNN’s viewership is down more than 75 percent since Joe Biden took office. This collapse was predicted by none other than former ABC&nbsp;“Nightline”&nbsp;anchor Ted Koppel in 2018, when CNN was enjoying relative success as an anti-Trump network.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The ratings are up, it means you can’t do without Donald Trump. You would be lost without Donald Trump,” Koppel told Stelter at the time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Ted, you know that’s not true,” Stelter said.“CNN’s ratings would be in the toilet without Donald Trump,” Koppel said as the audience at the National Press Club in Washington, D.C., laughed.“You know that’s not true. You’re playing for laughs,” Stelter retorted.&nbsp;“I reject the premise that these networks are making so much money off of Trump,” Stelter said.\n\n\n\nNo, Koppel wasn't playing for laughs but making an obvious point. And on cue, after Trump left the stage in January 2021, CNN's ratings fell to lows not seen since the beginning of the century. The precipitous drop included Stelter's show, which in June saw its lowest ratings since 2001.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZucker’s replacement, Chris Licht, was brought in to change the company’s fortunes and overall culture.\n\n\n\n“This is a time of change, and I know that it’s unsettling,\" Licht told staffers on Friday, according to the Daily Beast. \"There will be more changes and you might not understand it or like it all.”\n\n\n\nThis wasn't about just ratings, of course, but also credibility. During the Biden era, Stelter's fawning interviews with Biden administration officials revealed how hyperpartisan the once-serious show analyzing the crossroads between media and politics had become.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"What does the press get wrong when covering Biden’s agenda? When you watch the news, when you read the news, what do you think we get wrong?\" Stelter once asked then-White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki, a former CNN employee, during a Reliable Sources interview.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Do you fear that given the craziness we’re seeing from the GOP, do you fear that for our kids, your kids and mine?\" he asked Psaki later in the interview.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe media reporter's departure comes a week after Jeffrey Toobin announced he wouldn't be rejoining the network. In 2020, Toobin was infamously seen pleasuring himself during a work Zoom call as female coworkers looked on. For this breach of journalist ethics (if that’s what it can be called), The New Yorker, where Toobin had been employed for nearly 20 years, fired him. But CNN merely put him on paid vacation for a few months before bringing him back. Again, credibility matters —&nbsp;and Discovery execs and Licht appear to be trying to clean things up.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBrian Stelter will be just fine. He’ll probably jump to MSNBC or return to a job he once had as a media reporter for The New York Times.\n\n\n\nCNN is undergoing change. The changes, we're told, will continue. More employees, unfortunately, will be axed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe question is: Can CNN return to the network it was in the days of Bernard Shaw?&nbsp;In a media environment&nbsp;that increasingly values sizzle over steak and partisan opinion over straight reporting, that may be a very difficult task.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJoe Concha is a media and politics columnist and a Fox News contributor.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3605143-republicans-wage-war-on-environmental-investing-rules/",
        "description": "A groundswell of Republicans in states across the U.S. are waging a war against environmental, social and governance (ESG) investing, framing the fight against the economic strategy as a stance against what they call liberal policies interfering in the free market.\n\n\n\nProminent GOP figures including former Vice President Mike Pence and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, both potential 2024 contenders, have latched onto the issue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut so have state-level Republicans, who are implementing restrictions that blacklist certain firms from doing business with their state, usually because of what they perceive as unfavorable stances toward an industry that is the main driver of the global crisis of climate change: fossil fuel.\n\n\n\n“I am leading the charge on this, but there is an army behind me,” West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore said in an interview with The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn July, Moore barred five of the largest banks in the country, including BlackRock and Goldman Sachs, from receiving state banking contracts. He says the banks are involved in “boycotts of fossil fuel companies” — a notion both companies denied.\n\n\n\nGoldman touted in a letter to the state that month the more than $118 billion it had given to fossil fuel companies since 2016. A Blackrock spokesperson told The Hill the bank does not boycott energy companies.\n\n\n\n“We disagree with Treasurer Moore's determination,” the spokesperson said. “We do not pursue divestment from sectors and industries as a policy.”\n\n\n\nOver the last two years, Republican lawmakers in at least 12 states have announced plans to introduce bills that aim to strictly curb ESG investing, ranging from the West Virginia-like practice of blacklisting banks to barring state money managers from considering ESG factors when investing.\n\n\n\nESG requires investors to make capital decisions based not only on likely financial return, but also with an eye on the company’s impact on the environment, wider society and its own employees.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe burning of fossil fuels, especially carbon dioxide, is the main driver of climate change, causing a worldwide crisis that is altering the earth’s ecosystems and is causing health problems for people as well as subjecting them to worse floods, droughts, food insecurity and sometimes death.\n\n\n\nIn May, the Securities and Exchange Commission proposed rule changes aimed at cracking down on what is known as ESG “greenwashing,” the misleading marketing of unsustainable investments under the ESG label.\n\n\n\nThe backlash goes beyond the state level.\n\n\n\nHouse Republicans said they expect GOP lawmakers to overturn the agency’s proposed rule if they take the chamber after November’s midterms.\n\n\n\nRep. John Rose (R-Tenn.) and a bipartisan group of 117 lawmakers, mostly Republicans, sent a letter to SEC Chair Gary Gensler last month saying the new rules would place too great a regulatory burden on farmers to report the required data, potentially squashing small farms and worsening supply chain issues.\n\n\n\nESG investing has accelerated in the last decade, as banks have listed more and more funds under the category, capitalizing on the growing demand from investors.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPence recently pressured states to curb the use of ESG investing factors at a speech in Houston in May.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“[Democrats] have weaponized the Securities and Exchange Commission… to choke off financing for traditional energy sources through capricious new ESG regulations that allow left wing radicals to destroy American energy producers from within,” Pence said during the speech.\n\n\n\nDeSantis announced plans in late July to push Florida lawmakers to effectively ban the consideration of ESG factors when investing state money. This includes money in the state’s pension system.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Our investment funds should be for the best interests of our beneficiaries… it should not be a vehicle to impose an ideological agenda,” DeSantis said.\n\n\n\nWhile some states have smaller financial assets stowed away in state retirement funds, others have massive pension systems, according to Josh Lichtenstein, a partner at law firm Ropes &amp; Gray. When these states make moves to regulate investments, the market goes on alert.\n\n\n\n“When a state like Texas or Florida does something, or a state like California or New York … people pay more attention,” Lichtenstein said. “These are really significant and important institutional investors.”\n\n\n\nBut as state officials maneuver against ESG practices, experts warn the counterpunches may only muddy the waters more for investors and money managers. Some ESG factors, experts say, are conventional factors of risk for investors, and outlawing their consideration could make managing decisions difficult.\n\n\n\nLichtenstein believes there is a risk the new rules are interpreted so broadly that they actually shut down consideration of ESG factors all together. Asset managers have a duty to maximize return for investors, and Lichtenstein said the rules may mandate managers to ignore what they think are important sources of risk, a situation he deemed “untenable.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Moore and other Republicans categorically deny that environmental considerations mean anything when it comes to return on investment, asking, “How do greenhouse gas emissions affect the bottom line and financial outcomes of a given financial institution?”\n\n\n\nSupport for the fossil fuel industry is central to the Republican party’s concerns about ESG investing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUtah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks, a critic of the investing strategy, said ESG has driven money away from fossil fuel projects in the U.S. He argues underinvestment in domestic energy projects has contributed to high energy costs.\n\n\n\n“We have coercion happening in the capital markets to try and drive a political agenda,” said Oaks in an interview with The Hill. “The result is the misallocation of capital … underinvesting in oil and gas so we have a serious lack of supply.”\n\n\n\nBut climate activists are quick to point out that the banks continue to be major financial backers of fossil fuels. Ben Cushing, campaign manager of the Sierra Club’s Fossil-Free Finance campaign, said “Wall Street is the largest center of fossil fuel financing in the world.”\n\n\n\nCushing characterized the front against ESG investing as the GOP realizing that the free market is moving away from fossil fuels, with coal and oil company-backed politicians trying to stop the trend.\n\n\n\n“This bizarre notion that banks are ‘boycotting’ fossil fuels is really just a talking point cooked up by right wing politicians and the fossil fuel industry to prevent the free market from moving against them,” Cushing said.\n\n\n\nRepublicans can claim some early victories on the issue. US Bank, which was originally on West Virginia’s blacklist, changed their lending policies to no longer boycott the fossil fuel industry, according to Moore.\n\n\n\nUS Bank’s ESG policies do not prohibit relationships with fossil fuel companies, according to a spokesperson for the bank. While it is “​​pleased to not be excluded from doing business in West Virginia,” its ESG policies were in place prior to the state’s law, the spokesperson said.\n\n\n\nSome banks have even publicly trumpeted the amount of financing they have given fossil fuel companies, an attempt to convince state officials they have not gone too far in subscribing to ESG regulations.\n\n\n\nAnd while Republicans have just begun their crusade against ESG, Moore is adamant there is more coming down the pike.\n\n\n\n“I’m working with states all around the country … to get this legislation introduced in the next legislative session,” Moore said. “I think that it's going to be a lot more palatable rolling into 2023 and you’re going to see a lot more states do this.”",

        "description": "Atlantic City by Helen Saunders discovered under Praxitella by Wyndham Lewis, who may have painted over it on purposeA lost masterpiece by a leading abstract artist of the early 20th century has been discovered beneath a portrait by a contemporary who may have painted over the original in a “fit of pique”.Atlantic City by Helen Saunders, a member of the radical and short-lived vorticist movement, depicts a fragmented modern metropolis, almost certainly in the vibrant colours associated with the group. A black and white image of the painting appeared in Blast, the avant garde journal of the vorticists produced shortly before the outbreak of the first world war. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Brighton CCAHe died aged 53 without ever having shown his work, but Bill Lynch’s paintings on salvaged wood transfix with their dual power of primitive joy and high sophisticationThe great American artist Bill Lynch (1960-2013) never had a single exhibition in his lifetime. Almost nothing was written about his wild and beautiful paintings – ancient yet modern, mythological yet supremely contemporary – and they have only gradually started to emerge. Brighton Centre for Contemporary Arts has somehow managed to lay hands on 15 of his elusive works on wood from scattered locations to mount this mesmerising show, the first in a public gallery in the UK. The result is a coup.Lynch was born in Albuquerque, New Mexico, the heartlands of Breaking Bad, and studied art at the Cooper Union in New York. He lived in California for a time but ended up in Raleigh, North California, to be close to his family. He seems to have worked intermittently, sometimes as a carpenter, though it is surprisingly hard to discover very much about him. Continue reading...",

He has taken note of how many Republican politicians issued statements criticizing the FBI, even from some he did not expect.”\n\n\n\nSaid Trump to one adviser: “Everyone is on our side.”\n\n\n\n“In another rant several days after the search, he described the FBI in profane terms, calling them ‘fuckers’ who were out ‘to get him,’ according to a person who heard his comments. The former president has grown somewhat paranoid since FBI agents were on his property, positing they might have left behind recording devices, a person who spoke to him said.”",

You don’t just need a plausible legal case that tests interesting questions about presidential declassification powers; you need an easy-to-explain slam-dunk.”\n\n\n\n“So if you have Trump taking design documents for nuclear weapons and shopping them to his pals in Saudi Arabia, congratulations — you got him; lock him up. If you have him taking boxes of notes from foreign leaders because he’s a childish egomaniac who thinks that he’s earned his White House souvenirs, well, then take the documents back, declare victory for the public interest and stop there. And if he took documents about the Russia investigation itself, of the sort that he wanted declassified during his presidency, well, tread carefully, lest you trap us all in an awful time loop where it’s forever 2017.”",

The hefty tome that is perhaps the world’s most extraordinary example of this, from Vienna’s five-star hotel Palais Coburg, sprawls across some 100 tightly spaced pages, with many prices running to the high three figures, and many more advertised with one of two pithy German euphemisms for “you almost certainly cannot afford this”: preis vor ort and raritat.As out-of-this-world decadent as this kind of list undoubtedly is, I do understand the once in a lifetime appeal that leads some well-heeled wine lovers to save up for a night at the Palais Coburg or other blockbusting wine-led restaurants around the world, such as New York City’s Eleven Madison Park or London’s Sketch. Increasingly, however, you don’t have to be a plutocrat – or even, for one night only, pretend to be a plutocrat – to enjoy some of the best restaurant wines around. Continue reading...",

A black and white image of the painting appeared in Blast, the avant garde journal of the vorticists produced shortly before the outbreak of the first world war. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Photo by Rich Schultz/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Your Sunday morning dose of New York Mets and MLB news, notes, and links. Meet the Mets\n\nThe Mets split a doubleheader with the Phillies yesterday, with Trevor Williams coming up huge for four strong innings of work in Game 1, which the Mets won 8-2. Michael Pérez’s first hit as a Met was the RBI single that gave the Mets a 2-0 lead and they never looked back, adding two more against Zack Wheeler and piling on against the Phillies bullpen. Starling Marte and Jeff McNeil each collected two hits in the victory.\nBut the bats went cold in Game 2, as rookie Bailey Falter held the Mets to just one run on two hits over six innings of work. David Peterson negotiated traffic nearly every inning and took the loss, allowing three runs on eight hits in 4 2⁄3 innings. The Mets brought the tying run to the plate in the ninth, but David Robertson was able to complete the six-out save to secure the doubleheader split for the Phillies.\nChoose your recap: Amazin’ Avenue (Game 1 | Game 2), NY Post, Daily News, Newsday, North Jersey, MLB.com, ESPN (Game 1 | Game 2)\nThe Mets brought up Rob Zastryzny yesterday, who pitched in the second game of the doubleheader, and optioned Sam Clay. Meanwhile, R.J. Alvarez cleared waivers and was outrighted to Syracuse.\nTaijuan Walker, who is dealing with a bulging disc in his back, will not start today, but could be ready as soon as Tuesday against the Yankees. In Walker’s stead, José Butto will make his major league debut.\nJohn Harper of SNY spoke to scouts about Brett Baty—his defense, ability to hit lefties, and more.\nThe FCL Mets clinched a spot in the Florida Complex League playoffs yesterday.\nRecently Willie Randolph selected David Cone with the first overall pick in the Old Timers’ Day draft. Opposing manager Terry Collins picked Bartolo Colón with his first pick.\nAround the National League East\nThe Braves walked off the Astros in the 11th inning 5-4 in an exciting back-and-forth World Series rematch.\nJustin Toscano reviews the different avenues the Braves might pursue regarding Marcell Ozuna, who was recently arrested for DUI.\nThe Dodgers shut out the Marlins 7-0 in Dustin May’s return. Braxton Garrett was set to make the start for Miami, but he went on the injured list with an oblique strain and Bryan Hoeing made his major league debut filling in for Garrett. \nThe Nationals rallied in the ninth, but were unable to come back and fell to the Padres 2-1. Juan Soto went 2-for-3 and hit the go-ahead homer for San Diego.\nAround Major League Baseball\nAlbert Pujols continued his quest for history last night, hitting his 691st and 692nd career home runs and passing Stan Musial for career total bases. He now trails only Hank Aaron for most total bases in MLB history.\nThe Red Sox and Orioles will meet today in Williamsport for the Little League Classic.\nGunnar Henderson might be the latest young player to be promoted by the Orioles, according to reporting from Ken Rosenthal.\nAfter a health scare, Yordan Álvarez was released from the hospital Friday night after all testing came back normal.\nRon Gardenhire was inducted into the Twins Hall of Fame yesterday.\nYesterday at Amazin’ Avenue\nLukas Vlahos brought us the Daily Prospect Report.\nThis Date in Mets History\nHappy Birthday Félix Millán!",

        "description": "Underbelly, EdinburghOutlandish physical antics and a spontaneous stage presence keep Wardeh’s audience laughing as he clowns through a cast of oddball charactersClown is in vogue again, coming at us wide-eyed wherever you look on the fringe – at Frankie Thompson’s Catts, Julia Masli’s Choosh!, or with this fine debut from Sami Abu Wardeh. The show introduces us to a clown in character-comic’s clothing, as a faux-naif, Palestinian-accented Wardeh depicts the co-workers he met while cleaning on a cruise ship. These dancers, martial artists and sauna attendants give full rein to Wardeh’s flexible physicality: most of the laughs – and there are plenty – come from our host’s outlandish physical antics, be they prancing, street fighting or catching innumerable cherry tomatoes the audience lob towards his mouth.While Wardeh himself makes for an engaging and spontaneous stage presence, as he chases those tomatoes and beats us to attention on his tabla drum, there’s no doubt who his standout character is here. Giralomo is an Italian movement guru, inflated with the importance of his chosen calling. He depicts for us the practical applications of dance in everyday life – if not in England, whose movement traditions he disdains. (“Billy Elliot? For me, it is better if he stays in the mine.”) He solicits favourite films from the crowd – films he will then turn into pure choreography. Wardeh is blissfully funny here while barely speaking a word, signalling boredom with his audience’s film synopses, and (having agreed to enact The Sound of Music) ungraciously accepting the burden of depicting Nazis in dance.Sami Abu Wardeh is at Underbelly, Edinburgh, until 28 August.All our Edinburgh festival reviews.

        "description": "(NEXSTAR) – It’s not just you: Even the founder of Ruth’s Chris Steak House was perturbed by its name.\n\n\n\nRuth’s Chris Steak House — the somewhat confusingly named restaurant chain that apparently both “Ruth” and “Chris” have something to do with — has managed to open nearly 150 locations across the globe with relatively few people questioning who “Ruth’s Chris” is.\n\n\n\nPerhaps not surprisingly, “Ruth’s Chris” is a real person. But he doesn’t belong to “Ruth,” and he has little to do with the chain’s success.\n\n\n\nThe story of Ruth’s Chris Steak House begins in 1927, when Chris Matulich opened up a restaurant called Chris Steak House on Broad Street in New Orleans. He ended up selling the business six times over the next several decades, buying it back after each new owner’s failed attempt to run the place, according to “Eat Dat,” a guide to New Orleans’ culinary history written by Michael Murphy.\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tThe architect who designed Pizza Hut’s 'red roof' made an unusual deal with the founders\t\n\n\n\n\nMatulich likely didn’t have high hopes for the next entrepreneur who expressed interest in the place: a young woman named Ruth Fertel (nee Udstad), who had no experience running a restaurant. So he sold it for the seventh — and perhaps unbeknownst to him — the final time.\n\n\n\nFertel, a 38-year-old single mom working as a lab technician at Tulane University, had been looking for a way to pay for her sons’ college tuition. Her friends, family, lawyer and even the bank reportedly advised her against buying the steakhouse, but she ignored their warnings and mortgaged her home to purchase the business for $18,000.\n\n\n\n“They told me I was absolutely crazy,” she said in a 1998 interview with Louisiana Public Broadcasting’s “Louisiana Legends” series.\n\n\n\nShe found success over the next 11 years, and even helped give back to the community by feeding relief workers and victims of Hurricane Betsy, and by hiring an all-female waitstaff made up of single moms like herself.\n\n\n\nFertel also went to work designing a special broiler to help cook the steaks to her specifications — a broiler which is still in use at Ruth’s Chris Steak House locations today, according to Ruth’s Hospitality Group.\n\n\n\nIn 1976, however, Chris Steak House burned down, forcing Fertel to find another space. But due to a clause in her purchase agreement with Matulich, she couldn’t use the name “Chris Steak House” unless she was running it out of the original building. Fearing that anything too different from “Chris Steak House” name would hurt her restaurant’s name recognition, she simply tacked “Ruth’s” to the front.\n\n\n\nAnd she regretted it almost immediately.\n\n\n\n\"I've always hated the name,\" Fertel told Fortune in the ‘90s. \"But we've always managed to work around it.\"\n\n\n\n\n\t\n\t\tTaco Bell’s first restaurants only offered 5 items, and most are no longer on the menu\t\n\n\n\n\nThe somewhat hard-to-enunciate name didn’t stop Ruth from enjoying her work, either. A few years before she died in 2002, Fertel told Louisiana Public Broadcasting that she believed she found her calling in the hospitality business, despite coming from a background in chemistry and physics. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I was so lucky that I fell into something that I really, really love,” she said. “And I think that if you ever go into business, you better find something you really love because you spend so many hours with it, it almost becomes your life.”",

And it’s my side. That just rips at my heart: that we would be the people who would surrender the constitution in order to win an election. That just blows my mind.”\n\n\n\nBowers also noted that he had to confront Trump supporters protesting in front of his home just days before the Capitol insurrection, referring to those individuals as “bullies.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I never had the thought of giving up,” Bowers added. “No way. I don’t like bullies. That’s one constant in my life: I. Do. Not. Like. Bullies.”\n\n\n\nBowers told the Jan. 6 panel in June that Giuliani never produced hard evidence of election fraud in Arizona, and he refuted Trump’s claims that he said the former president had won the state and the election was rigged.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe lost his primary bid for a state Senate seat earlier this month, falling to Arizona state Sen. David Farnsworth (R), who was publicly backed by Trump.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBowers also told The Guardian that the Republican Party in Arizona has lost its way, saying it is now “all emotional” and “all revenge.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They’ve invented a new way. It’s a party that doesn’t have any thought. It’s all emotional, it’s all revenge,” Bowers said. “It’s all anger. That’s all it is.”",

Seriously?”I was texting my best friend to complain after I finished reading yet another cocktail history book that seemed to forget women exist. Months earlier, she had introduced me to the world of craft drinks. After years of being too intimidated to ask a bartender for anything more interesting than a vodka soda, I became immediately fascinated. There was so much talent and alchemy in the making of a cocktail that, for the first time in my life, I began to think more deeply about alcohol. I wanted to try more drinks, visit more bars, and most importantly, I wanted to learn. Continue reading...",

Now that word of their cooking has spread, booking a seat means you must be quick on the draw but you will be rewarded with not only extraordinary and original food but the chance to watch Luke, Nat and Theo in action.One learns which influencers and restaurant critics to trust and which to ignore, but it is also good to have a recommendation from someone who spends time behind the stoves themselves. With this in mind we ask top chefs to tell us where they’ve been eating recently and, more specifically, places that are new on the map. Their suggestions run from oysters with buttermilk and elderberry in a bothy overlooking Loch Nell to red cabbage gazpacho above a jeweller’s shop in Lichfield. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The much-loved Quo Vadis chef reveals his long-awaited recipe book, packed with classic dishes that are as easy to make for one as for a family dinnerWhen Jeremy Lee received the very first copy of his new cookbook from his publishers, he immediately threw it in a drawer, then cycled from his home in east London to get on with his day at Soho’s Quo Vadis, where he is chef-patron. The book, Cooking: Simply And Well, For One or Many, was the result of many years of work, on and off, and he wasn’t quite ready to face its reality.Loved by the London food world since making his mark at Terence Conran’s Blueprint Cafe, it seems like an oversight that Lee has not published a cookbook until now. “I had shied away, I suppose, mostly because I thought it had all been done. God knows that this kind of thing is standing on the shoulders of the great and the many,” he says, gesturing to the shelves on all walls of his home. They’re filled with books about food, from nouvelle cuisine pioneer Michel Guérard to current London pastry sensation Ravneet Gill. And of course, the holy trinity of Elizabeth David, Julia Child and Jane Grigson. But Lee had long felt a volume of his own work may be simmering away, and when approached by Fourth Estate in about 2016 he knew it was time to make it real, eventually. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Workers at the U.K.’s largest port went on strike on Sunday in a move that is likely to exacerbate disruption to British trade, already battling industrial action across multiple sectors including transport, manufacturing and retail.\n\n\n\nA total of 1,900 port staff at Felixstowe have walked out on the first day of an eight-day strike. The port handles more than 4 million containers a year and can accommodate the largest cargo ships in operation. It provides services to and from over 700 ports around the world.\n\n\n\nStaff at the port want better pay, as the cost-of-living crisis squeezes their incomes.\n\n\n\nAn offer of a 7 percent pay rise and a lump sum of £500 (€589) has already been accepted by the port&#8217;s workers union, which represents about 500 staff in supervisory, engineering and clerical roles. But dock workers have rejected the offer from the port operator, Hutchison Ports.\n\n\n\nThey say it is significantly below the current inflation rate, which has now risen above 10 percent for the first time in 40 years.\n\n\n\n“Industrial action comes just as global supply chains are starting to run more smoothly,” Chris Rogers, principal supply chain economist at freight forwarding firm Flexport, told POLITICO last week.\n\n\n\nGiven the long lead times for goods arriving from Southeast Asia, the strikes beginning now are likely to impact products ordered for the Christmas market, he pointed out.\n\n\n\nThe British Ports Association has downplayed the potential impact on supply chains, pointing out that other ports have capacity to receive more ships.\n\n\n\nSome other ports, however, have said they will not accept Felixstowe-destined cargo in solidarity with the strikes, while others are also planning their own industrial, including the U.K.’s fourth-largest port, Liverpool’s Peel Port.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/3609342-the-stabbing-of-salman-rushdie-a-fellow-authors-personal-reflection/",
        "description": "The horrific,&nbsp;near-fatal stabbing of celebrated author Salman Rushdie&nbsp;on a lecture stage in Chautauqua, N.Y., provoked a small but not unrelated memory; I — someone who has also measured out a life putting one sentence after another — needed to find some clarity in all that had happened.\n\n\n\nA lifetime ago, as a restless, ambitious 20-year-old with a year of&nbsp;graduate school under my belt, I found myself dismayingly marooned at my parents’ Bronx home for a few weeks before my&nbsp;real&nbsp;summer could start.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd so it was that on a stifling hot June afternoon, hoping to ease the monotony of this brief interregnum between school and a looming adventure with friends, I sat down at the pale-green Hermes typewriter I had lugged back from Palo Alto. Something I had seen previously on an evening stroll with my younger sister had started me thinking.\n\n\n\nThe geographic anchor — at least that’s how it’d always seemed to me — of the north Bronx neighborhood of Riverdale, where I grew up, was a weathered stone bell tower. It had been erected long ago to commemorate the soldiers who fought in World War I. “The Monument,” everyone called it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut when I accompanied Missy (these days, under her more adult name of Marcy, she is arguably the nation’s most sought-after wedding planner) as she set out to rendezvous with her barely-teenage crew, the crowd of kids on the stone portico that surrounded The Monument was a revelation. They looked like they had assembled for a casting call for “Hair.” It was a defiant sea of wild locks, bell bottoms and love beads. And, of course, the pungent, mischievous smell of pot wafted through the still Bronx evening — a siren call, I imagined, to those high school kids still uncomfortably moored to their parents’ dinner tables.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI took it all in with some astonishment. This was, after all, starchy and sedate Riverdale, not the fountain in Washington Square Park. The times, as the poet had promised, were indeed a changin’. No doubt about it — the Riverdale&nbsp;burghers’&nbsp;sons and daughters were “beyond their command.”\n\n\n\nSo, with a particularly heavy and gleeful hand, I wrote up what I had seen, as well as all that I intuited was brewing. Consider, for malicious example, my apocalyptic description of the kids’ blatant use of psychedelics, and how “little girls who had never been kissed had their minds raped.” Then, after&nbsp;typing a professional “-30-”&nbsp;at the end of my account, as I had been taught to do on the college newspaper, I put the pages in a manila envelope and mailed it to “Editor, The Village Voice.”\n\n\n\nIt was a real kick (and certainly a surprise) when the piece ran in the Voice — heady stuff for a young man lugging around lots of adult dreams. But it was pretty much forgotten once the summer was in full swing and I was up on Martha’s Vineyard with a couple of friends, running a decidedly makeshift operation we’d christened “Martha’s Mid-Summer Film Festival.”\n\n\n\nThen came the call from my father. “Do you know what you have done?” he challenged ominously.\n\n\n\nI could only wonder; there were lots of possibilities. But this one I hadn’t expected: The Riverdale Press, the neighborhood’s weekly paper, had taken indignant aim at my Village Voice piece in a fuming editorial whose banner headline ran across an entire page. Rather than confront the myriad implications of the wild scene I had described, the editorial made nasty work of me, the Voice and, in a particularly apoplectic tirade, compared the green pastures of the north Bronx with the garbage-strewn streets of Greenwich Village. It was all-out generational warfare and to my reading, at least, I was portrayed as the ring-leader of some sort of hippie cabal that was poised to run wild through the neighborhood.\n\n\n\nIt was an awakening to me, a first-hand lesson in the high-voltage power of the written word. You sit quietly at your desk putting sentences together, but once they go off into the world, the words can shake people up and have unanticipated consequences. Take my father, as a besieged example. He was put on the defensive, the butt of some remarkably snide comments, as a result of his wayward son’s unrestrained pen. It shook him up; he wasn’t used to this sort of thing. And I felt tremendously guilty about the predicament into which I had shoved my unsuspecting, embarrassed dad.\n\n\n\nNow, I am not comparing my being the subject of a mean-spirited editorial to a&nbsp;vicious, steely fatwa decreeing a death sentence&nbsp;in 1989 on the author of&nbsp;“The Satanic Verses” and on “all involved in its publication.” Nor am I placing my scribblings on a plane with Rushdie’s magisterial, imaginative, and so very carefully wrought novel;&nbsp;his talent&nbsp;is remarkable and wondrous.\n\n\n\nMy point is about the freedom of the press, and about its power, too.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Riverdale Press, the neighborhood newspaper that came out swinging against 20-year-old me, also had its say about Salman Rushdie. After several national-chain bookstores cowered to the ayatollahs’ threats and refused to sell “The Satanic Verses,” the Press took them to task and, in addition, gave a shout-out to a courageous local bookstore that defiantly continued to sell the novel.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat was the reaction to this editorial? Days later, the paper’s offices&nbsp;went up in smoke; a firebomb&nbsp;had been hurled into it by some terrorist.&nbsp;But the gutsy local newspaper patched itself up, kept on publishing and, nine years later, a new editor — the son of the man who had torn into me — wrote&nbsp;an impassioned editorial&nbsp;decrying Penguin’s decision not to publish a paperback of Rushdie’s novel. “The need to defend our fragile civilization remains undiminished,” Bernard Stein wrote in the piece’s penultimate sentence. It was an editorial that was cited, among others, when Stein won the 1998 Pulitzer for Editorial Writing.\n\n\n\nThat’s what is brought so searingly home to me in the aftermath of the barbaric attack on Rushdie: the need to keep civilization and an open society flourishing with the sweet discord of a multitude of voices. Let the 20-year-old preening upstarts have their say. Let the visionary novelists spin their provocative tales. Let the storefront neighborhood newspapers continue to call them as they see them. It’s all part of the same gushing force of ideas that feeds and energizes the life of our times. It’s the cacophony that keeps civilization singing.\n\n\n\n- 30 -\n\n\n\nHoward Blum is a former reporter for The New York Times and a contributing editor at Vanity Fair.

I’m overwhelmed enough by the thought of all I desperately want, and need, to read - I was going to say before I die, but let us not be too melodramatic - without adding to the pile. But I do like to see Oliver Burkeman’s The Imperfectionist land in my inbox every month, a missive that has been known to work on me as a cool palm might work on a fevered brow. And it’s to him, the thinking person’s (non) self-help guru, that I owe the idea for this column, which has to do with perfection in the kitchen, and how we might best liberate ourselves from its tense-making grasp.Like most people, entertaining-wise, I’ve struggled to get back into the groove post-lockdowns. Having lost the habit of having friends over, even the idea of doing so is exhausting now: the planning, the shopping, the cooking. Sometimes, I get as far as drawing up a list of names, and looking in my diary for a date. But like icing that refuses to set, things never get … concrete. Thoughts whirl, as if in a food processor. Will everyone be disappointed if I serve pasta? Will they consider my tomato sauce infra dig? And what about the pudding? Are memories long enough that people will think: “Oh God, not pavlova again?” I picture the oven, and wonder whether it should be deep cleaned. I examine the kitchen light, and consider how fast it might be fixed. On and on it goes, and so another weekend flips by. Continue reading...",

        "description": "By Ann Cooper\nMaybe you already mailed in your absentee ballot and headed to the beach.\nOr maybe you’ve watched the first and second debates; studied the ads about  women&#8217;s rights, or Elizabeth Warren&#8217;s endorsement, or a connection to Barack Obama; and read the Rag’s Q and As with Carolyn Maloney, Jerry Nadler, and Suraj Patel, the three Democratic candidates in Tuesday’s primary for the 12th district congressional seat. And you feel ready to go to your Upper West Side polling place and cast your ballot. Good for you!\nBut let’s say you haven’t paid much attention to this unusual race, created by a redistricting plan that forced Maloney and Nadler, each in their 70s, each with three decades of congressional service, to run against each other for a single House seat. Throw in third candidate Patel, a lawyer/businessman in his 30s who has never held office but argues that it’s time for change. Now you’ve got a generational fight, and one with at least the possibility of a major upset, if Patel pulls enough votes away from each of the veterans. (A fourth candidate, Ashmi Sheth, did not meet fundraising requirements to participate in the televised debates and hasn’t had much visibility. Her campaign website is here. )\nYou won’t be surprised to learn that much of the media coverage has focused on personalities, political attacks, and the horse race: Maloney&#8217;s personal wealth and Donald Trump’s crackpot endorsement of her; Patel’s charges that Maloney is &#8220;commitedly anti-vaxxer&#8221;;  Nadler&#8217;s (and Maloney’s) hesitancy to say Joe Biden should run for re-election in 2024.\nFor more substance on a broad range of issues &#8212; from immigration, to gun violence, to Medicare for all &#8212; go to Patel’s platform and the issues pages on Nadler’s and Maloney’s campaign sites.\nHere’s a roundup of where to find out more on the candidates, including our endorsement – not of a candidate, but of some reading we suggest before making your choice (and even if you’ve already chosen, you’ll learn a lot about whomever ends up winning on Tuesday).\nWHO’S ENDORSING WHOM?\nSome people hate endorsements; some put a lot of stock in them, figuring if so-and-so is for Candidate A, then I should be, too. Here’s a sampling of who’s backing whom in the 12th district race:\nMaloney: Planned Parenthood, NOW, AIPAC (American Israel Public Affairs Committee), Human Rights Campaign, Gloria Steinem, and a slew of local politicians, Democratic clubs, and unions have endorsed her. The full list is here; it takes awhile to scroll through them all.\nNadler: A couple of groups appear to be hedging bets – Planned Parenthood, for example, endorsed both Maloney and Nadler; so did The Daily News. While Maloney has a bunch of lesser-known Democratic politicians backing her, high-profile Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Chuck Schumer, the Senate majority leader, have Nadler’s back, as does City Council member Gale Brewer, who represents the UWS.  When you open Nadler’s website, a message pops up: “Jerry has been endorsed by The New York Times!” Look here for a fuller list.\nPatel: Andrew Yang, who spiced up debates in his unsuccessful 2020 bid for the Democratic nomination for president (and also lost his race for New York mayor), endorsed Patel this summer. Patel’s campaign site lists no other endorsements.\nWHO ARE THESE CANDIDATES, ANYWAY?\nThough not strictly about issues, the three profiles published by the Times this summer offered more depth than most of the media coverage. Each focused in on a salient feature of the politician or the campaign.\nIn Nadler’s case, the paper noted that while Jewish lawmakers once held about half of the city’s congressional seats, today Nadler is New York’s last remaining Jewish congressman. Though he voted against the wishes of many Orthodox constituents when he supported former President Obama’s Iran nuclear deal (a reason why AIPAC endorses Maloney and not Nadler – she opposed the Iran deal), Nadler has a record of strong support of U.S.-Israeli relations and Israeli defense, according to the article.\nThe Times’s Maloney profile calls her “one of the most powerful women in Congress” (she chairs the House Committee on Oversight and Reform) and details her work on behalf of women’s rights. It’s what she’s stressed most in the campaign, particularly in the wake of the Supreme Court’s repeal of Roe v. Wade. Her pitchline: A Man Can’t Do My Job.\nThough he’s run twice before against Maloney, and lost, Patel is the new face in the race and has gotten considerable attention with his argument that 30 years is long enough in Congress – time for a change, and never mind that it would mean the city losing representatives with considerable seniority and power (in addition to Maloney’s chairmanship, Nadler chairs the House Judiciary Committee). Patel supports term limits (Nadler and Maloney do not), but says he would not put an age limit on those serving in Congress. The Times article called him a “frenetic Indian American lawyer” with “a less-than-meek approach” who’s betting that his pro-youth message will find resonance with young voters.\nWhat are voters thinking about the race? In person-on-the-street interviews, both the Rag and The City  found that, to the extent voters were paying attention, their focus was mainly on the merits (or demerits) of Maloney and Nadler. “I don’t know what [Patel] stands for,” one voter told The City. Another said: “Young blood and new blood is always a good thing, but I don’t know his policies at all.”  If you feel similarly in the dark, see above for the link to Patel’s issues page – and those of Maloney and Nadler.\nOUR ENDORSEMENT\nWe’re not picking a favorite candidate, but we do have some favorites among the many media stories chronicling this race. Our faves are the three in-depth interviews the Times editorial board did with Maloney, Nadler, and Patel. Each was asked roughly the same questions, including some lighting-round, yes-or-no quizzes  (you can find out their favorite restaurants in the district, which member of Congress each most admires, and whether they own or have ever fired a gun).\nOn a more substantive level, each responded to questions about inflation, protecting democracy, aid to Ukraine, gun violence, and more.\nAnd if you read all three interviews, you can find out whose answers needed the most fact-checking, who filibustered the most (talking at length without directly addressing the question at hand), who sounds the most self-promotional – and who you think would best represent New York’s 12th congressional district in Congress.",

        "description": "As she entered the federal courthouse in West Palm Beach on Thursday to bear witness to a hearing on the potential release of the FBI’s basis for searching Mar-a-Lago, Donald Trump’s attorney Christina Bobb paused to ask one of the law enforcement officers outside a question.\n\n\n\nWhere, exactly, did she need to go?\n\n\n\nSoon, Bobb found a front-row seat and sat quietly throughout, telling reporters she was just there to observe.\n\n\n\nRare is the case that a Trump emissary is an addendum to, and not the focus of, a high-profile proceeding. And Bobb’s decision to observe rather than partake ended up earning her a grilling from typically friendly Fox News host Laura Ingraham, who wondered whether she had forfeited Trump’s right to help shape the process behind the potential release of the FBI’s affidavit.\n\n\n\n“We really just chose to see how it would play out,” Bobb replied.\n\n\n\nThe moment underscored an increasingly apparent truth about Donald Trump’s legal strategy in the week since the FBI searched his Mar-a-Lago home: He and his team haven’t settled on a singular approach and appear in the dark about what may come next. Trump has often used litigation to delay but has been loath to go on offense, particularly when he’s likely to lose. His vow Friday to make a “major motion” appeared in keeping with that approach.\n\n\n\nWhile it’s unclear whether the former president or any of his top allies are at imminent risk of criminal charges, they have sketched out competing and sometimes conflicting positions that may come into play as the investigation — now in its “early stages” — accelerates.\n\n\n\nHere’s a look at the Trump team’s early, shifting strategies and how they may fare:\n\n\n\nCalls for transparency that don’t show up in court\n\n\n\nBobb’s quiet approach to Thursday’s hearing in Florida differed conspicuously from the tack taken by Trump, who has loudly insisted that DOJ release the unredacted affidavit underlying the search warrant executed at Mar-a-Lago. Several media organizations and conservative Judicial Watch filed motions with a federal magistrate judge to do just that.\n\n\n\nBut Trump never authorized his legal team to make that formal request.\n\n\n\nHis demand for the release of the affidavit was itself a shift. He and his team initially resisted public release of the search warrant itself, which they had access to on Aug. 8. Only after Attorney General Merrick Garland took the unusual step of moving to release the warrant did Trump start calling for transparency.\n\n\n\nThe public clamor that avoids an actual legal battle suggests Trump is treading cautiously — lest his legal team commit to a course of action he can’t take back later.\n\n\n\nWhen Trump got his publicly stated wish to release the search warrant, Americans learned about dozens of boxes containing classified material he had squirreled away at his estate, and that DOJ was probing potential felonies, including mishandling of classified material and obstruction of justice.\n\n\n\nPresidential vs. Personal\n\n\n\nTrump’s team, via media ally John Solomon — one of the former president’s authorized representatives to the National Archives — floated a new defense on Thursday: Trump told people he considered the materials he stashed at his house to be “personal” items that belonged to him.\n\n\n\nIt’s unclear whether and how Trump actually made such a designation, and his team has yet to produce evidence of it. But it’s not a trivial issue. A mishmash of past court rulings have suggested presidents wield enormous sway over their own materials, including the ability to designate some as “personal,” which removes them from the strict requirements of the Presidential Records Act.\n\n\n\nThough the laws governing these designations have made clear that documents deemed “personal” should also have no inherent value to the operations of government, there’s no mechanism to question a president’s decision on this score — unless the Archives chooses to challenge it.\n\n\n\nBut there’s one problem for Trump in this defense: The power to deem records “personal” ended the moment his presidency did. So, if he hadn’t designated the records taken to Mar-a-Lago by that point, then the determination was no longer his to make.\n\n\n\nGiven that several of Trump’s allies and aides have suggested he didn’t know what was packed in the boxes that were shipped to his estate, it would be hard to argue he had designated them as personal items.\n\n\n\nGoing after the judge\n\n\n\nSince the FBI went into Mar-a-Lago, Trump and his attorneys have argued that the search warrant itself was deficient — overly broad and approved by a biased magistrate judge.\n\n\n\nTheir evidence of Judge Bruce Reinhart’s bias? He donated to Barack Obama. Some Trump supporters have pointed as well to his work more than a decade ago for employees and associates of Jeffrey Epstein. But it’s unclear how that creates a conflict with issues related to Trump. And Reinhart also gave contributions to Jeb Bush.\n\n\n\nTrump’s team has also suggested that Reinhart’s recusal from a sprawling lawsuit by Trump against Hillary Clinton and dozens of current and former DOJ officials is proof of bias. But Reinhart, one of six magistrates to recuse from that case, never indicated the reason for his decision. In fact, it’s far likelier that he recused for a more mundane reason: a prior working relationship with one of the dozens of defendants in the case or their attorneys.\n\n\n\nBut the approach to Reinhart has also been mixed. After a week of pounding the judge as biased, Trump’s team embraced his resistance to keeping the affidavit fully sealed.\n\n\n\nAn important side note: While Trump asked that Reinhart recuse from “this case,” there really isn’t a case to step aside from at the moment, simply a search warrant that was requested and granted, followed by a dispute over how much of those records should be public. If Trump or someone else is charged criminally in connection with the missing records, a judge would be randomly assigned.\n\n\n\nClaiming the FBI overstepped\n\n\n\nEven if the search warrant passes legal muster, Trump’s allies say, the FBI blew past its constraints, seizing boxes at random and just hoarding as much as possible. While there’s significant evidence to the contrary, Trump hammered on this point days after the search, focusing on alleged passports that were taken from his estate.\n\n\n\nWhat Trump didn’t mention at the time was what the DOJ officials had told him: the passports were flagged by a team of investigators specifically appointed to screen out any improper or privileged information that might be scooped up in an FBI search. The involvement of a so-called filter team signals that DOJ had taken care to ensure investigators didn’t lay eyes on evidence they weren’t meant to see.\n\n\n\nEven so, Trump’s legal team indicated late Friday it was prepared to make a more concerted push on this front. Attorney Jim Trusty joined pro-Trump radio host Mark Levin to outline Trump’s intention to seek a “special master” to review the materials seized by the FBI and ensure any privileged information isn’t seen by the bureau.\n\n\n\nTrusty didn’t address why it took the legal team 11 days to settle on that strategy, following a year or more of dialogue with archivists and government lawyers. But he said a special master could review “large swaths” of material that Trump’s team believes is subject to privilege claims, arguing that a DOJ-led filter team couldn’t be trusted.\n\n\n\nTrump promised in a social media post Friday that a legal filing would be forthcoming on this point, but by Sunday morning it still hadn’t arrived.\n\n\n\nTrump took a similarly lax approach when his former attorney, John Eastman, was fending off efforts by the Jan. 6 select committee to obtain thousands of emails that Eastman had claimed were protected by attorney client privilege — with Trump being the client.\n\n\n\nFor months, a federal judge asked probing questions about Eastman’s legal relationship with Trump and demanded that the former law professor produce paperwork proving when he became Trump’s lawyer. But the ex-president never engaged in the suit, leaving Eastman wielding only an unsigned retainer agreement. The result? Eastman lost at nearly every turn and the judge issued a damaging ruling that he and Trump likely joined in a criminal conspiracy to overturn the 2020 election.\n\n\n\nArguing DOJ didn’t exhaust all other options\n\n\n\nTrump’s attorneys have also contended that the FBI resorted to its most aggressive tactic — an unannounced search and seizure of a former president’s home — before exhausting less intrusive means. Bobb and other Trump allies noted that DOJ officials made a cordial visit to Mar-a-Lago on June 3. A few days later, DOJ called up Trump’s attorneys and asked them to install a padlock on a basement storage room where some of the targeted records were being housed. Then there was radio silence for two months, Trump allies say, until the FBI executed the warrant.\n\n\n\nWhat’s missing from that timeline has seeped out in subsequent reporting: DOJ’s interactions with Trump’s team began only after the Archives had sought for more than a year to obtain the full slate of records held at Mar-a-Lago. The Archives asked DOJ to get involved after it discovered tranches of classified records on site.\n\n\n\nIn the spring, DOJ used a grand jury subpoena to try to obtain files housed at Mar-a-Lago. Then, soon after officials visited Trump’s estate in June, the department issued a new subpoena for surveillance footage that might show important files being moved. Bobb told Ingraham that she believed the Trump team was open to releasing some of that surveillance footage. But they have not released that, or the subpoenas.\n\n\n\nDelay is Trump’s friend\n\n\n\nThe best thing that Trump can probably hope for at the moment is that the search warrant was primarily a mechanism to recover records the government thought it was entitled to and isn’t much of an indication of whether he or anyone else will face criminal charges.\n\n\n\nSeveral former top DOJ officials have offered a similar take. But a lot remains unknown.\n\n\n\nDOJ counterintelligence official Jay Bratt told Reinhart during Thursday’s hearing that the investigation was “in its early stages,” suggesting that the matter isn’t settled but also that charging decisions are a long way off.\n\n\n\nMost cases about intentional or unintentional mishandling of classified information don’t end in criminal charges. The government’s primary goal is typically to end the so-called “spill” of material as quickly and completely as possible, with consequences for those responsible attended to later.\n\n\n\nThat means there’s a remote likelihood of imminent developments as dramatic as the Aug. 8 Mar-a-Lago search.\n\n\n\nBut Trump’s lawyers will stay busy. The other legal threats he faces include DOJ investigations into the attempted overturning of the 2020 presidential election; civil suits over the violence that unfolded at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021; a criminal election-fraud probe in Georgia; and a pair of New York investigations into the tax and accounting practices of his real estate empire and marketing of the Trump brand.\n\n\n\nMeridith McGraw contributed.",

        "description": "Jose Butto | Photo by Benjamin Rusnak/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Butto is starting for the Mets this afternoon in his major league debut. Born in Cumana, Venezuela, Jose Butto was officially signed by the Mets in early June 2017 for just $5,000, a 19-year-old who agreed to terms with a club just prior to the end of the 2016-2017 international free agent signing period and the beginning of the 2017-2018 period. He made his professional debut with the DSL Mets and posted a 1.44 ERA in 50.0 innings, allowing 48 hits, walking 9, and striking out 41. In 2018, he was assigned to the Kingsport Mets when their season began and appeared in six games for them in total, pitching 32.2 innings and posting a 1.93 ERA with 27 hits allowed, 11 walks, and 31 strikeouts. At the end of July, he was promoted to the Brooklyn Cyclones, where he remained for the rest of the season. In Coney Island, he posted a 6.11 ERA in 28.0 innings, allowing 31 hits, walking 11, and striking out 24. In total, the right-hander posted a 3.86 ERA in 60.2 innings, allowing 58 hits, walking 22, and striking out 55.\nIn 2019, the Mets promoted Butto to the Columbia Fireflies, their Low-A affiliate at the time, where he spent the entire season. He ended up posting a 3.62 ERA in 112.0 innings, allowing 100 hits, walking 31, and striking out 109. He would have likely been promoted to the St. Lucie Mets, then the Mets’ High-A affiliate had the 2020 season not been cancelled, but after a delay in April and May, Major League Baseball announced that it would not be providing its affiliate teams with players, officially ending the season. The coronavirus pandemic calmed a bit as the year went on, and by in February 2021, Major League Baseball announced that the 2021 Minor League Baseball season would proceed, with Triple-A teams beginning in April and Double-A, High-A, and Low-A teams beginning in May. \nButto, unlike many of his former teammates with the DSL Mets, Kingsport Mets, and Brooklyn Cyclones, was not released by the organization following MLB’s takeover and realignment of the minors, and the right-hander was assigned to Brooklyn to begin the season, the Cyclones now the Mets’ High-A affiliate. Making 12 starts, Butto posted a 4.32 ERA in 58.1 innings, allowing 51 hits, walking 15, and striking out 60. His work with the Cyclones was solid enough and earned him a promotion to Double-A Binghamton in late July. He benefitted from the move, posting a 3.12 ERA in 40.1 innings, allowing 33 hits, walking 9, and striking out 50. All in all, he posted a 3.83 ERA in 98.2 total innings in 2021, allowing 84 hits, walking 24, and striking out 110. Eligible to be selected in the Rule 5 Draft and on the cusp of possible major league utility, the Mets added Butto to the 40-man roster that winter. \nVoted the Mets’ 17th top prospect coming into the season by Amazin’ Avenue, right-hander somewhat surprisingly began the 2022 season in Binghamton instead of being promoted to Syracuse. Regardless, he more or less picked up where he left off, posting an even 4.00 ERA in 92.1 innings for the Rumble Ponies, allowing 86 hits, walking 35, and striking out 108. He was promoted to the Syracuse Mets in early August and made only one real start there, allowing three earned runs against the Buffalo Bisons in five innings. His next start, against the Charlotte Knights, was more or less a bullpen session, as Carlos Carrasco and Taijuan Walker had both already been injured and it was looking more and more like the Mets would need a starter on the 40-man roster to start.\nThe 6’1”, 200 lb. right-hander throws from a low three-quarters arm slot, dropping and driving off the mound. His mechanics are smooth and repeatable, allowing Butto to pound all four quadrants of the zone and hit his spots. For his career, he has a sterling 2.6 BB/9 rate and even if his foreign and now-defunct short-season experience is eliminated, he still has an exceptional 2.7 BB/9 rate in three seasons playing for full-season affiliates. His strikeout rate was always acceptable, but they spiked following his attendance in the 2020 Instructional League.\nHis fastball ranges from the high-80s-to-low-90s, topping out as high as 95 MPH. Generally on the lower side of that spectrum earlier in his career, the right-hander has added muscle mass to his frame since the end of the 2019 season and now sits on the higher end of that range. While not particularly overpowering, the pitch has an above-average spin rate for a fastball, and he began throwing a two-seam variant to give the pitch more movement.\nHis go-to secondary pitch is his changeup, one of the better ones currently in the Mets minor league system, if not the best. The pitch sits in the low-to-mid-80s, which gives it roughly 10 MPH of velocity differential between it and his fastball, and features late, tumbling action. The pitch tunnels well with his fastball, and Butto is able to command it, throwing it for strikes down in the zone and to elicit swings and misses under it. The pitch is a true weapon against left-handers, but as good as it is, has been only mildly effective against right-handers, which is why developing his curveball further has always be key for his future success important. To date, Butto really has not done that. The pitch currently sits in the high-70s-to-low-80s and features slight 12-6 break when he has a good feel for it or looser, slurvier break when he does not.\nTightening the pitch up and turning what is generally considered a below-average offering into at least a fringe-average pitch will determine whether or not Butto will progress from a minor league prospect who is able to spam a pitch that the majority of minor league hitters have trouble with into a legitimate major leaguer able to face an order multiple times. Butto has exhibited a steep fall off a cliff when facing batters more than once. In the 17.0 innings he has pitched into the fourth inning, batters are hitting .294 against him and he has allowed 8 earned runs (4.24 ERA). In the 12.2 innings he has pitched into the fifth inning, batters are hitting .356 against him and he has allowed 13 earned runs (9.24 ERA). In the 6.1 innings he has pitched into the sixth inning, batters are hitting .269 against him and he has allowed 4 earned runs (5.68 ERA).",

They refer to issues including equity, equality, diversity, inclusion and accessibility, concepts that take on different meanings depending on the cultural and historical context they exist in.  Historically, and still today, we know that some people are systemically disadvantaged and marginalised in society, so whatever the acronym, inclusion work should generally try to dismantle and help unlearn prevailing unjust structural and cultural settings. \nThe post Growing beyond acronyms appeared first on British Antarctic Survey.",

        "description": "Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm said Sunday that the Biden administration is hopeful gas prices will continue to fall but noted that some factors remain beyond its control.\n\"If China opens up significantly after Covid, there will be more pressure on demand,\" she said. \"More pressure on demand means upward pressure on prices. So, we're watching what happens globally. But we are doing everything possible to try to stabilize supply and demand to keep those prices coming down.\"\nSpeaking to host Trace Gallagher on \"Fox News Sunday,\" Granholm said President Joe Biden had taken significant steps to increase America's supply of gasoline. \n\"This president has moved in dramatic ways to increase supply,\" she said. \"By releasing 1 million barrels per day from our reserve, as well as calling on domestic producers, as well as international producers. We will be at record amounts of production next year.\"\nSpiking gas prices had driven inflation in the United States for months, but they have been in decline in recent weeks, with average prices falling back below $4 per gallon. Granholm said she expects prices to continue to drift down, but she noted that there is only so much the United States can do to actually control the situation.\n\"As you know, gasoline comes from oil. Oil is traded on a global market. So we are at the whim, if you will, of what happens globally,\" the former Michigan governor said.\nGranholm also discussed the potential benefits of the new Inflation Reduction Act, pushing back on suggestions that incentives in the bill only benefit those who don't need it. Biden signed the legislation last week.\nShe said that the newly designed incentives for electric vehicles will not only help people buy those cars but also, because of the way the law is written, encourage manufacturing in the United States.\n\"Additional restrictions will kick in starting in January, requiring domestic content. Meaning that the materials, the supplies for those vehicles, will also have to be built in America,\" she said.\n\"Why is this important? Because the president has said that we need to manufacture stuff in America — that we can't rely on countries that don't share our values.\"\nGranholm also pushed back on Gallagher's suggestion that clean energy in the form of solar and wind power is not reliable enough to depend on at this point.\n\"The technology is there. We just need to make sure it is implemented,\" she said.",

        "description": "(Island)The US singer-songwriter shifts tack from last year’s trauma-led Dancing With the Devil, tapping into the pop-punk of her youthful debut“Am I the only one looking for substance?” sings Demi Lovato on her new single – to which the answer is, obviously, no. But her search for “substance” takes on a sharply different tone given that Lovato recovered from a near-fatal overdose in 2018, preceded by addiction, an eating disorder and being raped as a teenager. The experiences were chronicled in 2021’s Dancing With the Devil album and documentary – although the music stuck to an oddly tasteful pop palette. Holy Fvck signals a genuine shift. In the past year, Lovato has come out as non-binary, launched a sex toy and gone UFO-hunting in the desert; in short, it sounds like she’s finally having fun. The album harks back to the pop-punk sounds of her 2008 debut, Don’t Forget, with Skin of My Teeth pitched somewhere between McFly and Foo Fighters. But there are some thrillingly dark moments too, as on Eat Me (ft Royal &amp; the Serpent), with its industrial grind, tempo shifts and raging yelps, and the pleasingly lusty Bones. Holy Fvck has its flaws – Lovato’s powerful voice is unnecessarily finessed and Auto-Tuned, and 16 tracks is too long. But its gutsy ambition is a thing of substance in and of itself.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3609361-whats-liz-cheney-thinking-about-2024/",
        "description": "Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) has said that her priority now will be “doing whatever it takes to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office.” Here’s one way she could do that: become the Ralph Nader of the 2024 presidential election. She could run for president as an independent, split the Republican vote in key swing states and throw the election to the Democrat.\n\n\n\nThat’s what Nader did in 2000 when Florida cast the deciding vote in the presidential election. The official vote count in Florida showed Republican George W. Bush ahead of Democrat Al Gore by 537 votes. Nader, the Green Party candidate, got 97,488 votes in Florida. Asked to choose between Bush and Gore, about half of Nader voters in Florida said they wouldn’t vote for either major party candidate. Most of the rest said they would have voted for Gore — enough to give Gore Florida’s 25 electoral votes and the presidency.\n\n\n\nBy voting for a third party or independent candidate who has no chance to win, you are actually taking away votes from your second-choice candidate and helping elect your least favorite contender (in 2000, that meant Nader voters electing Bush, which is exactly what they did).\n\n\n\nCheney, whose voting record is staunchly conservative, has become the leader of anti-Trump Republicans. She would presumably take more votes away from Trump than from the Democrat (likely President Joe Biden). She could do that by running only in a few large swing states like Florida and Wisconsin.\n\n\n\nBut she would have to give up any dream of actually winning the election by carrying enough states to get 270 electoral votes. Still, her avowed purpose, at least right now, is simply to keep Trump from winning.\n\n\n\nHers would be an unprecedented campaign: “Vote for me, even though I don’t have a real chance of winning, simply to make sure Trump doesn’t win.” That might work. Nearly 60 percent of voters say they don’t want Trump to run again.\n\n\n\nThe risk is that a Cheney-for-president campaign could take more votes from the Democrat than from Trump:  30 percent of Democrats say they don’t want Biden to run for re-election. The number one reason: his age (Biden will turn 82 in November 2024).\n\n\n\nIt is unlikely that Cheney could win either party’s nomination. Biden has disappointed a lot of progressives by failing to deliver on some of the things he promised in 2020 like immigration reform, child care, student loan debt and statutory protection for abortion rights. But that would not be likely to deliver many progressive votes to Cheney, who voted with President Trump more than 90 percent of the time during her congressional career.\n\n\n\nAn independent or third-party presidential campaign would cost a lot of money. It would be difficult just to get on the ballot in states where Republican officials would do everything possible to keep Cheney’s name off the ballot. Cheney raised a lot of money from Democrats in her Republican primary campaign this year, but there was no Democrat on the ballot to compete with her for contributions.\n\n\n\nIndependent candidates are highly dependent on polls.  Voters are usually reluctant to support a candidate who, according to the polls, has no real chance of winning. In the spring of 1992, independent Ross Perot was running ahead of both Republican George H.W. Bush and Democrat Bill Clinton. Perot dropped out of the race in July 1992, but then got back in — in time to participate in the presidential debates and getting 19 percent of the November vote, the highest vote for a third party candidate since Theodore Roosevelt, a former president, in 1912.\n\n\n\nOne big thing Cheney would have going for her: the weakness of popular support for the two most likely major party candidates. Right now, Trump is rated 55 to 41 percent unfavorable by the voters. President Biden’s job approval numbers? Exactly the same – 55 to 41 percent negative.\n\n\n\nIf we end up with a race between two unpopular contenders, anything could happen. That’s what Liz Cheney may be counting on.\n\n\n\nBill Schneider is an emeritus professor at the Schar School of Policy and Government at George Mason University and author of “Standoff: How America Became Ungovernable” (Simon &amp; Schuster).",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/3608609-state-ballot-measures-are-new-abortion-battleground/",
        "description": "State ballot measures are becoming the new battleground over abortion access in the wake of the Supreme Court's decision to overturn&nbsp;Roe v. Wade.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbortion rights advocates are energized after voters in Kansas earlier this month rejected an attempt to strip abortion protections from the state constitution, the first statewide vote on abortion since the court's decision in June.\n\n\n\nPolls show most Americans support some form of abortion access, and reproductive rights advocates are eager to take the issue directly to the voters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“When abortion rights are on the line, people stand up and vote to protect them,” said Elizabeth Nash, principal policy associate at the Guttmacher Institute, an abortion rights research group.\n\n\n\nAn Ipsos poll released Aug. 10 found seven in 10 Americans, regardless of party affiliation, would support their state using a ballot measure to decide abortion rights at the state level.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn such a hypothetical state-level ballot measure, 54 percent said they would vote in favor of abortion legality.\n\n\n\nIn Kansas, nearly 60 percent voted against the constitutional amendment, stunning anti-abortion activists who had been anticipating a win in the state former President Trump carried by nearly 20 percentage points over President Biden in the 2020 election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNext up in November are votes in Kentucky, Michigan, California, Vermont and Montana, the most abortion-related ballot initiatives ever to take place in a single year.\n\n\n\nKelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, a progressive group that helps organize ballot measures, said the increasing polarization of state and federal politics is leaving voters with no other options to get their voices heard.\n\n\n\n“Ballot measures are not just a tool in the toolbox. I think they will be an increasingly central pathway for moving these conversations forward in states and not just in the abstract ... but actually making policy,” Hall said.\n\n\n\nBallot measures are expensive and challenging undertakings, and Hall said they are normally a tool of last resort.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut now, she said there is a major disconnect between extreme politicians and the voters.\n\n\n\n“That opens up a space for ballot measures to be not just an option, but often the only option, where there's no way to get middle-ground common sense policies through the usual mechanisms of lawmaking,” Hall said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVoters in Kentucky will vote on a measure that’s the most similar to Kansas. Vermont, California and Michigan are moving to enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution, while Montana would mandate medical care for children “born alive” after an abortion.\n\n\n\nAccording to Nash, the anti-abortion movement had a string of successful ballot initiatives in recent years.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn 2020, Louisiana voted to amend the state constitution so there would be no guarantee of abortion protections. Alabama and West Virginia passed similar constitutional amendments in 2018, and Tennessee did so in 2014.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, this is the first time abortion rights groups have sponsored state ballot measures since 1992. According to data from Ballotpedia, 85 percent of the abortion related measures on state ballots have been proposed by anti-abortion groups.\n\n\n\nStill, groups on both sides of the issue pointed out that there’s only so much that can be gleaned from Kansas.\n\n\n\nIn a statement after the Kansas ballot measure failed, Kentucky Right to Life Executive Director Addia Wuchner made it clear “we're not in Kansas!”\n\n\n\nWuchner said the wording of the amendments is similar, but noted Kentucky's amendment is simpler. The state also already has a near-total abortion ban in place.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The wording of Kentucky’s Amendment 2 is very clear and concise. It is probably too soon to fully analyze the reason for the Kansas ballot outcome. The wording on the Kansas ballot was longer than our statement, and that may have been a factor,” Wuchner said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling in June to overturn&nbsp;Roe v. Wade&nbsp;is leading to a patchwork of state laws across the country, some of which are being litigated on a constantly changing basis.\n\n\n\n“The lack of legal clarity about abortion in Michigan has already caused far too much confusion for women who deserve certainty about their health care,” Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer (D) said in a statement Friday, after a judge issued a preliminary injunction blocking enforcement of the state's 1931 abortion ban.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Once, over the course of a single day, abortion was legal in the morning, illegal around lunch time, and legal in the evening. We cannot have this kind of whiplash about something as fundamental as a woman’s right to control her own body,” Whitmer said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMichigan is one of the next key battleground states, where residents will vote on a ballot measure that would amend the state constitution to protect the right to make choices on reproductive issues such as contraception and abortion.\n\n\n\nNicole Wells Stallworth, executive director of Planned Parenthood Advocates of Michigan, said the organization had been working on the ballot initiative since last fall, but the effort took on new urgency once a draft opinion leaked in May that showed the Court was going to overturn&nbsp;Roe.\n\n\n\n“When the draft leaked opinion came out, we saw a surge in people and individuals coming to our campaign wanting to participate and help in some way,” Stallworth said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe group saw a similar outpouring of support in June once&nbsp;Roe&nbsp;was officially overturned.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think that the overturning of&nbsp;Roe v. Wade&nbsp;has really sparked for people a desire to get involved in the process, and this opportunity in November gives them some form of hope that we can actually save access to abortion in Michigan,” Stallworth said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStallworth said politicians have been unable to repeal the abortion ban, so passing a ballot measure would ensure abortion protections won't be tampered with in the future.",

        "description": "Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm on Sunday said the U.S. will see \"record\" oil production starting next year.\n\n\n\nGranholm told \"Fox News Sunday\" host Trace Gallagher the U.S. will be producing around 12.7 million barrels per day by 2023, up from the current rate of less than 12 million barrels per day.\n\n\n\n\"This is all about supply and demand. When Russia invaded Ukraine, that pulled millions of barrels off of the global market,\" she said. \"Since oil is traded globally, we have to make up for that lost amount of fuel.\"\n\n\n\nThe Department of Energy previously predicted that oil production would rise to record levels in 2023, according to Fortune. The previous record for domestic oil production was 12.2 million barrels per day in 2019.\n\n\n\nAfter record highs earlier this year, gas prices fell more than a dollar to a national average of $3.90 per gallon.\n\n\n\nGranholm said on Sunday that President Biden's release of 1 million barrels of oil a day from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and his call for the oil sector to increase production were vital to lowering gas prices across the country.\n\n\n\n\"The release of a million barrels per day is the biggest tool at our disposal,\" Granholm said. \"That's why the president has called for this increase in releasing and increase in production.\"",

        "description": "New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu (R) slammed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) on Sunday, criticizing the federal agency for \"eroding trust\" with the American public with confused messaging about the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\nIn the wake of an external review that found issues at the CDC, Sununu told \"Fox News Sunday\" host Trace Gallagher that the agency has \"been constantly backtracking\" on guidance about the pandemic for the past two years.\n\n\n\n\"Did we really need a taxpayer-funded external review to determine that the CDC is all over the place?\" Sununu asked. \"The only good takeaway here is they're acknowledging it.\"\n\n\n\nLast week, CDC Director Rochelle Walensky announced a series of internal changes at the agency after the review from the Department of Health and Human Services, which noted that public health experts have taken too long publish data and have failed to be transparent.\n\n\n\nThe review came after the CDC faced criticism from both Democrats and Republicans for its public health guidance throughout the pandemic.\n\n\n\nSununu on Sunday said that he and other governors listened to the CDC's guidance during the height of the pandemic but ultimately decided what was best for their citizens.\n\n\n\nThe New Hampshire governor said the word \"science\" is commonly understood to imply that \"we know what's happening, and here's the response that we need.\"\n\n\n\n\"You cannot come back out and say something totally different down the road, because, most importantly, we don't want people to have no trust in the CDC,\" he said. \"We don't want that, but unfortunately that's where we are today.\"",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/3608153-scientists-are-considering-how-the-spacex-starship-can-accelerate-space-exploration/",
        "description": "As SpaceX continues ground tests of its Starship Superheavy rocket ship in preparation for its first orbital flight, the scientific community is starting to wake up to the possibilities that the company’s spaceship presents for science-oriented space exploration. The same rocket that will take humans back to the moon and, perhaps, to Mars will also revolutionize sending robotic space explorers to all corners of the solar system, according to&nbsp;a recent piece in Science.\n\n\n\nWhen it’s operational, if one can believe the claims of SpaceX CEO Elon Musk, the Starship will be able to put 100 tons of anything in low-Earth orbit. With refueling, that payload could go anywhere in the solar system. The cost will be $10 million per launch. Even with the need for refueling, Starship represents a quantum leap in spaceflight. No wonder some scientists who design and manage robotic space missions are starting to take a look at Musk’s monster rocket.\n\n\n\nOne mission being considered by Jennifer Heldman, a scientist at NASA Ames, is a sample return from the moon. A Starship would land on the moon, fill its hold with lunar ice that would be kept chilled, and then return it to Earth for scientists to study. Researchers could discover much about how the ice was deposited over billions of years and where it is abundant and available for a future lunar base.\n\n\n\nDaniel Baker, director of the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado Boulder, suggests that Starship could carry a probe to Mercury, a tough planet to reach because of the need for extra fuel and shielding against the sun. Starship could also send a massive probe into interstellar space, perhaps passing by some of the outer planets along the way like the Voyager probes did. The massive rocket could also launch space-based telescopes that would dwarf both the Hubble and the James Webb.\n\n\n\nThe Starship could also launch a series of landers directed toward some of the more interesting moons of the outer planets. For example, NASA has been studying&nbsp;a Europa Lander&nbsp;as a follow up to the Europa Clipper. Europa, a moon of Jupiter, is thought to have a subsurface ocean covered by a layer of ice that might be warm enough to contain extraterrestrial life. Saturn’s moons Titan and Enceladus are also possible targets for landers. Enceladus is an ice-covered world similar to Europa. Titan is a weird world with liquid methane seas. NASA is studying a mission that would put&nbsp;a submarine&nbsp;into one of those seas, the Kraken Mare.\n\n\n\nThe humans-versus-robots argument has been raging among space policy experts since the beginning of the space age.&nbsp;As Scientific American notes, robots can explore the moons and planets far more cheaply than astronauts, who need expensive life support systems to sustain them. However, astronauts are far more capable than robots in running experiments and doing field exploration using the “advantage of human flexibility, experience and judgment.”\n\n\n\nThe SpaceX Starship may provide a solution to the humans-versus-robots problem by enabling both, Humans will return to the lunar surface on a Human Landing System Starship. Musk dreams of using the Starship to build a colony on Mars. The Starship will also enable a number of planetary missions that have so far been too expansive and too big to fit into existing rockets. Everyone wins.\n\n\n\nThe advent of the SpaceX Starship proves an old truism that often the answer to a policy controversy resides in technology.\n\n\n\nSpaceX has already proven the virtues of reusable rockets with the Falcon 9 and Falcon Heavy, which have taken the lion’s share of the launch&nbsp;market. The Starship will follow the principle that reusability plus quick turnaround leads to cheap access to space and therefore more space missions, but on a much larger scale. If (or when) Starship becomes operational, it will help to fulfill the promise of the space age that has been over a century in the making.\n\n\n\nMark&nbsp;R.&nbsp;Whittington&nbsp;is the author&nbsp;of&nbsp;space exploration&nbsp;studies&nbsp;“Why is It So Hard to Go Back to the Moon?”&nbsp;as well as&nbsp;“The Moon, Mars and Beyond,”&nbsp;and&nbsp;“Why is America Going Back to the Moon?”&nbsp;He blogs at&nbsp;Curmudgeons Corner.",

        "description": "If you can catch your breath, the Maratona in Italy’s Dolomites is the world’s most beautiful bike raceDon’t forget to look up,” says Miguel “Big Mig” Indurain, the great Spanish cycling campeón, to the massed ranks of nervously fidgeting riders. We all laugh because how could anyone forget to notice the stunning sweep of the Dolomites unfurling above the forested valley behind him. But we know he’s right. Because for the next eight hours or so, most of us will be lost in a world of self-inflicted torment as we pedal agonisingly up vertiginous hills, only to plummet with our hearts in our mouths down the other side, before doing it again, and again… We are in Italy’s picturesque South Tyrol to take part in the glorious Maratona dles Dolomites – Enel. It’s one of the hardest – and almost certainly the most scenic – one-day bike races in the world.Mountains and bicycles aren’t natural bedfellows. Defying the thigh-burning power of gravity tends to spoil what could be a blissful union. But the annual Maratona manages to celebrate the jaw-dropping beauty of this brutal landscape by sending 8,000 Lycra-clad riders up and down seven of its most famous peaks. And, despite the fact that almost every single one of us will spend the day cursing the absurdity of cycling uphill, none of us would have it any other way. The spellbinding physical beauty of the Dolomites will take your breath away in more ways than you could imagine. Continue reading...",

        "description": "The White Sox announced they have selected the contract of catcher Carlos Pérez. Fellow backstop Yasmani Grandal has been placed on the 10-day injured list on the heels of last night&#8217;s injury, which created room for Pérez on the active roster. Grandal&#8217;s injury has been described as a left knee strain. To open a spot on the 40-man, right-hander Kyle Crick has been transferred to the 60-day injured list.\nPérez, not to be confused with the Carlos Pérez who is catching in the Rockies&#8217; system, is a 25-year-old who has been in the White Sox organization for his entire career so far. He made his professional debut in rookie ball back in 2014 and has been working his way up the minor league ladder since. He has never been a highly-touted prospect, though he has frequently been an honorable mention on FanGraphs&#8217; lists of top White Sox farmhands, with those reports noting his bat-to-ball skills and strong arm but lack of power.\nThis year, he&#8217;s played 91 games in Triple-A, trying his best to get rid of that lack-of-power reputation. He&#8217;s hit 17 home runs on the year after only hitting 20 total long balls in his seven previous minor league seasons. He&#8217;s also struck out in just 8.2% of his plate appearances, which is barely one third of the 22.3% MLB average. That&#8217;s led to a batting line of .257/.319/.446, wRC+ of 101, a hair above league average.\nPérez will make his MLB debut as soon as he gets into a game. It&#8217;s possible that he sticks around for a bit, joining Seby Zavala as the club&#8217;s catching tandem. Those two and Grandal are the only three catchers currently on the White Sox 40-man roster.\nAs for Crick, this won&#8217;t affect his timeline since he&#8217;s already been on the injured list for over 60 days. It was June 15 when he was first placed on the IL due to elbow inflammation, with no indications he&#8217;s close to returning.",

She&#39;s spunky and she convinces Bruce she&#39;s got hulking well under control, and she does, in part by hulking.I am curious what problem Banner was solving with that device - fitting in cars? Thought he was OK with being smart-large?\nAlso what&#39;s with Banner reminiscing so often about Stark in a show that would apparently have nothing to do with him? The Tony-Comes-Back-O-Meter quivered slightly off the 0 mark and didn&#39;t fall back.",

As soon as code and markup are in the client then they can be ripped off.@sil We used to have a conversation about obfuscation - that really didn’t work against anyone determined enough.\n@sil There was also the argument about “the guiding mind” i.e. the code alone would get someone started, but they couldn’t maintain it. I don’t know if that’s true anymore.\n@sil It is the nature of the Open Web. And for those of us old enough, it was how we learned to make things work. But inspired by rather than ripping off.",

And it locks renewables and fossil fuels together: If the Biden administration wants solar and wind on public lands, it must offer new oil and gas leases first.&#8221;\n&#8220;As a result, U.S. oil and gas production and emissions from burning fuels could keep growing, according to some industry analysts and climate experts. With domestic demand sliding, that means more fossil fuels exported to growing foreign markets, including from the Gulf where pollution from oil and gas activity plagues many poor and minority communities.&#8221;",

        "description": "Ronza Othman, a lawyer with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in Baltimore, hasn’t been able to order a sandwich without help in her office cafeteria for a decade.\nBefore the deli replaced workers with a touch screen in 2012, she would walk up to the counter and ask for a roast beef and cheddar sandwich with cucumbers, not pickles. But Ronza, who is blind, can’t work the touch screen as it doesn’t take voice commands.\n“I’m an attorney. I have a master’s degree in government and nonprofit management. I've raised children,” she said. “But I can’t get a damn sandwich by myself in my agency.”\n\n\n\nCongress made a portion of the 1973 Rehabilitation Act known as Section 508, which asks federal agencies to make technology accessible, mandatory in 1998. But nearly a quarter century later, they are still failing to do so. And it’s not just about ordering lunch. Roughly 30 percent of the most popular federal websites don’t meet accessibility standards, according to a 2021 report by the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation. Enforcement is virtually nonexistent, and agencies are spending little effort or money to comply.\n“Clients of my firm right now are dealing with trainings required by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services that don’t work with blind people screen readers and with intake kiosks at the Social Security Administration that are not accessible,” said Eve Hill, a lawyer with Brown, Goldstein &amp; Levy, who testified about the problems before the Senate Aging Committee last month.\nHill, along with Anil Lewis, executive director for blindness initiatives at the National Federation of the Blind, and Jule Ann Lieberman, assistive technology program coordinator at Temple University’s Institute on Disabilities, asked senators to ensure the federal government is complying with federal disability law.\nMost frustrating, the advocates said, is that making technology accessible isn’t difficult. It just requires forethought. And it’s important. More than a quarter of Americans have a disability.\nFor the past 10 years, the DOJ hasn’t made public any of the biennial reports that Congress mandated on compliance with Section 508. As of the DOJ’s last report in September 2012, less than half of federal agencies had established a compliance plan. Those that did had an average operating budget of $35,000 a year devoted to the task.\nIn June, Senate Aging Committee Chair Bob Casey (D-Pa.) and ranking member Tim Scott (R-S.C.), along with other lawmakers, wrote to Veterans Affairs Secretary Denis McDonough and Attorney General Merrick Garland.\nThey asked McDonough to provide detailed information about the accessibility of VA websites and plans to bring them into compliance, noting that only 8 percent of its public sites and even fewer of its intranet sites complied with the law. “The lack of fully accessible websites at VA is a potential barrier for the one-quarter of all veterans with a service-connected disability, and may well be a harbinger of similar shortfalls at other federal agencies and departments,\" the senators wrote.\nIn a letter responding to Casey, McDonough said that the VA’s most-used websites have accessibility ratings of 95 percent or higher. The department is now conducting daily accessibility scans, he said, to bring other sites into compliance.\nIn their letter to Garland, the lawmakers asked why the DOJ has not made public more of its reporting on agency compliance. The department said it is working with the White House Office of Management and Budget and the General Services Administration on relaying its data to Congress and the president.\nWidespread problems\nCarlos Montas, a former employee of the Veterans Benefits Administration in Nashville, Tenn., who is blind, can relate to Othman’s struggles.\nWhen he took a job with the agency in March 2020 that involved calling veterans to explain their benefits, his manager gave him digital audio workstation software and a Braille display, which allowed him to read text on the screen with his fingertips.\nBut neither technology was compatible with much of the software he needed to do his job. He found performing simple tasks, like attaching a document to an email, was impossible.\n\nHe said the VA instituted performance benchmarks and eventually fired him for not keeping up. He filed a discrimination complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and won his job back along with back pay. He quit a few months later for a job at the EEOC.\nPeople who are hard of hearing struggle with federal technology as well. Early in the Covid-19 pandemic, advocates with the National Association of the Deaf said that HHS videos did not have proper captioning and were unavailable in American Sign Language.\nIn their letter to McDonough, Casey and Scott highlighted the VA’s own data showing that hearing loss is “by far the most prevalent service-connected disability.” Hill said people who are deaf or hard of hearing struggle with training and educational videos that lack captions.\nThe VA, which serves about 9 million veterans a year, is at the center of the problem, according to Casey and Scott. In March, the senators said the department had acknowledged “hundreds of thousands of Section 508 compliance issues remain to be resolved.”\nBut problems with accessibility extend across much of the federal government.\nThe Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank that promotes the use of technology in policy solutions, audited federal websites in 2021. They found that 30 percent of them, including popular sites like weather.gov, energystar.gov and census.gov, did not pass an automated accessibility test and nearly half had webpages that failed the test.\nThe report recommended that the General Services Administration, which supports other federal agencies’ logistical needs, create an accessibility testing lab to ensure sites are compliant and expand its existing Digital Analytics Program to conduct real-time accessibility testing. It also suggested that Congress require the DOJ to make its 508 accessibility reports public.\nEric Egan, a policy fellow with the foundation, said he was unaware of any steps the GSA had taken to implement the reports’ recommendations. He said the foundation was encouraged by the Senate Aging Committee’s oversight.\nA spokesperson for GSA said the agency is collecting self-reported data from agencies about their compliance with Section 508, analyzing it, and making recommendations. GSA is also involved with an interagency effort to update guidance on Section 508 compliance.\n‘A flawed process’\nAdvocates for people with disabilities say fixing accessibility problems shouldn’t be expensive. In his testimony before the Senate Aging Committee, Lewis attempted to disabuse senators of the idea that accessible technology costs a lot. “Accessible coding is just good coding,” he said.\nHe offered an example. If the federal government were to create all its documents on typewriters and then hand them over to a contractor to be digitized, that would be expensive and inefficient. Instead of layering outdated technology onto a newer framework, the government should be using technology that designs around accessibility from the start, he said.\nSome vendors offer such tools, said Sommer Panage, who manages a team of engineers focused on accessibility at Slack, the instant-messaging service. She said Slack has long considered the needs of people with disabilities in its product design and recently changed its internal operations to make its software more consistently accessible.\nPanage manages a team of engineers focused on accessibility and said her team is now making sure people with disabilities can use any new feature before release, while also seeking to ensure it will work with outside accessibility tools.\n“There’s a really big matrix of the combinations of different operating systems, different screen readers, different screen readers within each operating system, and then Slack itself,” she told POLITICO. “What we’ve been really working on now is thinking about that matrix holistically.”\nBut advocates for people with disabilities say the federal government is behind the curve. Agencies don’t often test technology for accessibility before implementation, and consequences are rare when government contractors don’t ensure that people with disabilities can use their products, said Doug George Towne, chair and CEO of Access Ready, a disability rights advocacy organization. “It’s a flawed process,” he said.\nOthman said that a culture of penny-pinching makes life worse for people with disabilities in her workplace. For example, when her office updated the photocopiers, the agency was given an option to pay a small additional fee for a speech package, which would have made the machines accessible to employees who are vision-impaired. A lever attachment to help employees in wheelchairs raise the copier’s lid was also available. But the agency opted for neither.\nAfter employees, including Othman, complained, she said the office bought a few packages instead of deploying the technology officewide.\nInformation blackout\nPresident Joe Biden won plaudits early in his administration for prioritizing accessibility. An interpreter has regularly translated Biden’s speeches into sign language, and the White House has provided captions for those watching online. The White House press secretary is always accompanied by a sign language interpreter, and the administration has provided live audio descriptions of White House events for people with vision impairments.\nIn June 2021, Biden issued an executive order asking agencies “to improve accessibility, ensure accommodations can be requested, increase opportunities for advancement and hiring, and reduce physical accessibility barriers.”\nThe Office of Management and Budget already requires 24 agencies to file reports twice a year about the accessibility of their technological infrastructure.\n\n\n\nBut those reports aren’t public. It’s part of a broader information blackout that Casey and four other senators, Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Mike Braun (R-Ind.) and Richard Burr, (R-N.C.), called attention to in an Aug. 11 letter to Comptroller General Eugene Dodaro.\nThe senators asked Dodaro, who runs Congress’s watchdog arm, the Government Accountability Office, to investigate, writing that “the lack of public reporting and accountability leaves Congress and taxpayers without adequate information about the rate of compliance with disability access requirements.”",

        "description": "A federal appeals court gave Sen. Lindsey Graham a temporary win early Sunday, ruling that he doesn’t have to comply for now with a subpoena from an Atlanta grand jury demanding that he testify Tuesday about his role in an effort to pressure Georgia officials to change the results of the 2020 presidential election.\nThe 11th Circuit Court of Appeals blocked the subpoena at Graham’s request Sunday, after a federal district court judge in Atlanta turned down the South Carolina Republican’s bid to avoid testifying on the grounds that the local grand jury is intruding on legal protections he enjoys as a federal lawmaker.\nThe appeals court said in a two-page order that Graham’s attorneys and prosecutors for Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis needed to flesh out arguments about whether Graham is entitled to have the federal courts place legal guardrails on the questioning Graham could face. The 11th Circuit panel’s order said that those arguments should be presented first to U.S. District Court Judge Leigh Martin May, who issued a ruling last week rejecting the arguments Graham’s team raised under the Constitution’s speech or debate clause — which immunizes lawmakers from most legal consequences for actions relating to their lawmaking responsibilities. \nInvestigators have said they want to query Graham about two phone calls he had with Georgia election officials in late 2020, at the same time Trump was attempting to subvert his defeat. Graham has acknowledged discussing with the officials the state’s process for counting absentee ballots.\nHis attorneys have argued that those conversations pertained to his official duties as a senator, but May ruled there were indications that the exchanges went beyond “legislative fact-finding.”\n“Senator Graham has unique personal knowledge about the substance and circumstances of the phone calls with Georgia election officials, as well as the logistics of setting them up and his actions afterward,” May wrote in her decision last Monday.\n“And though other Georgia election officials were allegedly present on these calls and have made public statements about the substance of those conversations, Senator Graham has largely (and indeed publicly) disputed their characterizations of the nature of the calls and what was said and implied. Accordingly, Senator Graham’s potential testimony on these issues … are unique to Senator Graham.”\nThe appeals court called its Sunday morning action a “limited remand” and said the subpoena would essentially be put on hold while the possibility of constraints on the scope of questioning of Graham is hashed out at the district court.\nIt’s unclear whether the appeals court’s order will lead to further oral arguments in front of May or only to the filing of additional legal briefs, but the appeals court instructed her not to dawdle.\n“The district court shall expedite the parties’ briefing in a manner that it deems appropriate,” the 11th Circuit’s order said.\nGraham’s stay request was handled by a three-judge panel at the conservative-leaning, Atlanta-based appeals court: Judges Charles Wilson, Kevin Newsom and Britt Grant. Wilson is an appointee of former President Bill Clinton, while Newsom and Grant are both Trump appointees. It is likely they will hang on to the case when it returns to the appeals court, at least for any urgent proceedings.\nMay briefly considered the option of “partial quashal” of the subpoena during arguments held in her court Aug. 10, but said she would need more information to decide whether there were appropriate areas of questioning that wouldn’t be subject to speech or debate clause immunity. One example, she said, would be any coordination between Graham and the Trump campaign ahead of Graham’s phone calls with Georgia election officials.\nBut May said in her decision denying Graham relief that his lawyers’ written submissions to her had only sought a “total” rejection of the subpoena and that his bid for a partial win came belatedly in the process. She also agreed that speed was essential for the grand jury as it probes potential criminal conduct in the effort to subvert the 2020 election.\n“The Court finds that the District Attorney has shown extraordinary circumstances and a special need for Senator Graham’s testimony on issues relating to alleged attempts to influence or disrupt the lawful administration of Georgia’s 2022 elections,” May wrote last week in her order turning down Graham’s federal case.\nThe DA raised similar concerns, suggesting that additional rounds of briefing could require postponing Graham’s already delayed testimony for weeks or even months, significantly hampering the criminal probe. Willis’ prosecutors said they anticipate Graham’s testimony leading to new avenues of inquiry that are essential to the overall probe.\nMay’s ruling last week left open Graham’s ability to decline to answer specific questions in front of the grand jury and get rulings on those issues from a county judge, but Graham’s team insisted that as a U.S. senator he was entitled to protection from the federal courts.\nA spokesperson for Willis declined comment on the appeal court’s order; an attorney for Graham did not immediately respond to a request for comment.",

        "description": "House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy should not become speaker of the House, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\" \n\"He's been completely unfaithful to the Constitution, and demonstrated a total lack of understanding of the significance and the importance of the role of speaker,\" Cheney said of McCarthy in response to a question about whether the country would be better off if the California Republican were to become the next speaker. \n\"So I don't believe he should be speaker of the House,\" Cheney said. \nCheney lost her statewide primary Tuesday to a candidate backed by former President Donald Trump, a defeat she has since aimed to frame as a new beginning in her opposition to Trump. Cheney has been outspoken about her opposition to Republican Party leadership and widespread election denial within her party, resulting in an uphill battle to keep her seat. \nThe day before the Wyoming primary, McCarthy told Fox News he expected her to lose — but that he wouldn't. \"We’ll win the majority and I’ll be speaker,\" he said Monday.\nThe Wyoming representative also serves as a leader on the committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, appointed by current House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.",

Email Daniel or tweet @DanielHarrisAs with pretty much every team that has to play City, beating them is a nause because it’s got to be done with roughly 30% possession, most of which isn’t in dangerous areas. But every team that plays City also has the chance, if they can get enough decent ball, to have a word with a defence that lacks sturdiness and quality. Obviously the full-backs are excellent, but Joao Cancelo’s licence to attack means space behind, while the centre-backs are decent but not among the best, and both can be dominated physically. I’d expect Callum Wilson to try and pin them, but he’ll need decent service from out wide – I actually wonder if, for that reason, Fraser might’ve been picked ahead of Almiron, had he been fit. At full-time at Elland Road, they played I Predict A Riot. I’d have the points off them for that, quicksmart. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Colourful zones and retro furniture bring a convivial feel to a 1970s family house in CheshireName just about any colour and you will find it in Jo Glossop’s bright, bold family home in Kelsall, a small village outside Chester. Jo lives here with her husband, James, and their three children, Bella, Annie and Ronnie. The family moved into the 1970s detached property with their first newborn in 2007. “We were looking for a period house with beautiful original features,” Jo recalls, “but we soon realised that we’d get a lot more for our money if we went with this 70s box instead.”They inherited a disjointed interior that had been heavily influenced by the decorating TV shows of the early 1990s. “There were seahorse stencils everywhere and lots of floral borders – not our taste at all,” says Jo. A few cosmetic updates were made, but the real change came a decade later. “By then, we had three children and were thinking of moving again,” Jo explains. “We put in an offer on a lovely period property in the village, but it fell through. After that, we thought we might as well stay put and extend.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "See if this sounds about right: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and her husband’s stock picks routinely outperform those of smart investors such as Warren Buffett, which many suspect is because of inside information she possesses. Therefore, all of Congress makes insider trades, is corrupt through and through, and should be disbanded.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOr, San Diego Padres shortstop Fernando Tatis Jr. ingests banned substances. So, of course, the revered institution of Major League Baseball is juiced like a junkie and needs to be broken up and farmed out to several smaller leagues.\n\n\n\nOne more: U.S. Army Maj. Nidal Hasan shoots and kills 13 people at Ft. Hood. The only logical presumption is that the Army is hopelessly staffed by murderous psychotics and should be defunded.\n\n\n\nThe absurdity of such conclusions is plain and laughable. Except, it appears, when applied to the FBI. It’s been shown that individual FBI employees have done miserable and harmful things.  But the headline typically is something like “The FBI manufactured a Russia collusion investigation,” “The FBI defrauded the FISA court,” or “The FBI stole the election from Hillary Clinton.” No, fired FBI executives Peter Strzok, Andrew McCabe and James Comey were directly tied to those things.\n\n\n\nAnd now Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-Iowa) has labeled the FBI “corrupted at its core” because of indications that two employees in the FBI’s Washington field office may have hampered an investigation into Hunter Biden. Continuing the hyperbole, various commentators and politicians, after the Aug. 8 Mar-a-Lago search, have characterized the FBI as “America’s Gestapo” deserving abolition or defunding.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy the way, some thoroughly corrupted agents from America’s Gestapo just this past week led an investigation that freed over 200 people, including 84 children, from human traffickers who were selling them for sex.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo be precise, the decision to open an investigation into a former president for possessing presidential records and other documents that may have had classification markings was made by specific FBI employees at the urging of specific individuals within the National Archives and possibly the Department of Justice (DOJ).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe curious decision to escalate the investigation to an all-day search of a former president’s home by 30 armed agents was also made by specific individuals in the FBI and DOJ. All of these individuals are unknown except for Attorney General Merrick Garland, who publicly acknowledged approving at least the search warrant.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf it is ultimately revealed that these individuals in the FBI and DOJ initiated the document retention investigation as an effort to politically damage Donald Trump, then they should be held to account for corruption.\n\n\n\nAlternately, if it is ultimately revealed that these individuals launched an invasive search of Trump’s residence based simply on what looks like a document dispute without taking into consideration the massive political fallout and erosion of trust that it would trigger, then perhaps they are holding positions of responsibility beyond their native capabilities.\n\n\n\nIf, however, it is ultimately revealed that Trump was selling state secrets or taking bribes or some such serious equivalent, then no one will dispute the law enforcement actions that have been taken.\n\n\n\nBut the indicators so far don’t point in the latter direction. The DOJ has said the attorney general took “weeks” to deliberate whether a search should be authorized. A search for truly serious crimes or threats to the nation doesn’t have the luxury of weeks of deliberation — in fact, the opposite is true. Also, the search was conducted three days after being ordered by a magistrate, undercutting any argument of imminent danger to the country, evidence destruction concerns, or other perceived exigencies.\n\n\n\nWhat we do know to be true is that both political parties are using the FBI “brand” to stir passion among their base supporters. That is why many politicians and cable news barkers front load comments and headlines with “The FBI did … (fill in the blank).”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe acronym “FBI” evidently prompts online clicks that generate ad dollars or gets fundraising mailers opened by frightened senior citizens who then send in $25. If the outrage hucksters really cared about corruption in the FBI, those who have engaged in corrupt behaviors would not be walking around today collecting big bucks from book deals and lucrative “news contributor” contracts.    \n\n\n\nThe manipulation of the FBI brand is bipartisan, not just on the right. On the left, the FBI is now suddenly being portrayed as a hapless target of angry Trump supporters simply because agents did their job. Fundraising campaigns are being readied, urgently expressing concern that the Mar-a-Lago search is raising temperatures on the right and fomenting violence against law enforcement.\n\n\n\nHere’s the reality of life in the FBI: On a daily basis agents are under threat. I experienced direct threats against me and my family, as have many, if not most, other agents. Agents who receive no threats during their careers can count themselves fortunate.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAgents are given weapons and good training and are prudently reminded, as they were last week, to be aware of their environment. FBI agents are not victims; trying to paint them as such in order to advance political goals is absurd. The left’s hollow concern is not about agent safety — it’s about quieting opposition rhetoric. \n\n\n\nAll of that said, the leadership of the FBI has a problem. Following the Mar-a-Lago search, half the country may be convinced, if they weren’t before, that the entire FBI is in the bag for the Democratic Party because of a string of FBI investigative actions against figures on the right and the absence of comparable actions against some on the left. Fair or not, that is a reality that FBI leadership must confront and fix. It is a direct threat to our democracy and an existential threat to the credibility and trustworthiness of the FBI.\n\n\n\nSen. Grassley is correct in this regard: Anyone in the FBI who witnesses decisions or orders driven by political considerations over objective justice must come forward and speak up immediately. It’s the right thing to do.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis holds true, especially, for those at the FBI’s executive levels, to whom I say: If you are aware of political bias but concern about your career holds you back from exposing it, keep in mind that you will have no career left if you retire from the FBI as part of that generation in charge of the bureau that Americans believe closed ranks, rejected transparency, failed to confront specific wrongdoers, and persisted in the growing perception of partisanship. You can then expect that the FBI brand you list on your resume will net you nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKevin R.

        "description": "The author and playwright’s latest novel incisively captures the search for meaning in uncertain timesLike much of Barney Norris’s work (his 2018 novel Turning for Home and his latest play, We Started to Sing), Undercurrent deals with beginnings and endings, love and loss, and borrows from his own family’s experience. It opens at a wedding where Ed meets a young woman, Amy, who claims he rescued her from drowning when they were children. Ed feels the pull of something, as does Juliet, his girlfriend of six years. Shortly afterwards, they split up and he begins to see Amy.At first you think this is going to be a novel about thirtysomething relationships, lovers recognising the “secret currents which align our lives”, but then the focus shifts. Norris offers a profound meditation on dealing with loss and finding your moorings in destabilising times. Throughout, he compares the ebb and flow of life to the undercurrents of water.Undercurrent by Barney Norris is published by Doubleday (£16.99).

Seems super cheap.\nhttps://www.google.com/search?q=site:gu.com shows &quot;About 1,300,000 results&quot; so you&#39;d be paying about $2/link\nYeah I know it says &quot;above $2.5m&quot; so that&#39;s just the starting point, but still...

        "description": "Podcasting 2.0 ?a #Thread\n还记得 @PodcastindexOrg 吗？自 2020 下半年 https://podcastindex.org/ 开始为 #播客 的 RSS 协议增加新的字段。经过五轮讨论，目前已在播客 #RSS 规范中确定增加了 18 个新的 RSS Namespace Extension for Podcasting :\nhttps://t.co/ofez2YQtwI\n上述字段涉及社交、版权、募捐、多媒体支持、直播支持等多个方面，为 #播客 提供了更加丰富的定制化自由度。\n同时，其亦在应用层发力，推动更多客户端支持其推出的新字段：其在官网收录了各类播客相关服务，并支持根据应用类别、对新字段的支持情况和平台种类进行查询：\nhttps://podcastindex.org/apps\n其中一些新字段已衍生出了新的生态用法：比如基于 Live Item 字段，@PodcastsLive 能实时发推广播正在直播的播客。\nPodcastIndex 联合创始人 Adam Curry 和 Dave Jones 一直致力于开拓播客领域，筹划播客圈未来发展。自 PodcastIndex 进行播客数据库索引伊始，两位即开始宣讲其 Podcasting 2.0 理念。\n两位还有一个名为 Podcasting 2.0 的 #播客 ，现已有近百期内容。显然在 RSS / XML 协议层的字段扩展是 Podcasting 2.0 的重要一环，另外一环则是利用 #区块链 技术谋求 #创作者经济 的 #去中心化 实现。\n具体而言，为了剥离苹果或 Spotify 及信用卡组织等 #粉丝经济 中的中心化平台，让听众直接向创作者付费，其基于 #Bitcoin 2层网络 https://t.co/DDIpN3V0Ko 开发了 Value-for-Value （ #Value4Value ，意指对有价值内容的付费支持）技术：\nhttps://t.co/nmwL2tPACV\n用以让 #播客 听众 Play-to-Pay （传统付费模式是 Pay-to-Play），即收听的同时会以一定频率支付小额比特币（satoshi / 聪）\nhttps://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/satoshi.asp ，\n亦可在获得有趣或有价值内容时增加打赏幅度。\n在协议层，需要 #播客 在其 RSS 中声明 Value 相关字段：\nhttps://github.com/Podcastindex-org/podcast-namespace/blob/main/value/value.md\n在应用层，需要集成区块链网络节点。\n目前支持 #Value4Value 的 Podcasting 2.0 应用收录于这里：\nhttps://t.co/mbQPWnRWdx\n根据 #PodcastIndex，支持 Value4Value 的播客已有 8300 多个。\n最近， #播客 圈和币圈正在逐渐接纳 Podcasting 2.0：\n🔸 播客托管平台 https://rss.com/ 宣布支持 #Value4Value：\nhttps://t.co/t0F9pOAesb\n🔸 9TO5MAC 上出现介绍 Podcasting 2.0 的文章：\nhttps://t.co/yU6MKNCMX4\n🔸 Supernova #黑客松 #SocialFi 奖项第二名项目 Conshax 即为利用相关技术为播客盈利进行优化：\nhttps://t.co/O3riqSGR8G\n和 RSS3 兼容 RSS 输出一样，我乐见此类 #RSS 与其它技术的新颖集成。基于 RSS / XML 字段扩展、辅以区块链技术的 Podcasting 2.0 能否重塑 #播客 行业的未来，还请拭目以待。",

        "description": "Sometimes, a painting in words is worth a thousand pictures. I think about this more and more, in our compulsively visual culture, which increasingly reduces what we think and feel and see &#8212; who and what we are &#8212; to what can be photographed. I think of Susan Sontag, who called it &#8220;aesthetic consumerism&#8221; half a century before Instagram. In a small act of resistance, I offer The&nbsp;Unphotographable &#8212; every Saturday, a lovely image in words drawn from centuries of literature: passages transcendent and transportive, depicting landscapes and experiences radiant with beauty and feeling beyond what a visual image could convey.\n\n\nEvery once in a while, if we are lucky and attentive enough, we have an experience that touches the transcendent; that opens up a portal between the ordinary world we move through half-asleep and the wildly extra-ordinary fact that this world exists at all, and we &#8212; this fragile fractal of it &#8212; exist to move through it. Such experiences leaven the plane of mere existence with Life. \nIris Murdoch (July 15, 1919&ndash;February 8, 1999) invokes one such experience with ravishing fidelity to the rapture of reality on the final pages of her 1978 novel The Sea, the Sea (public library), which also gave us her subtle wisdom on the myth of closure and the limits of self-knowledge. She writes:\nAs I lay there, listening to the soft slap of the sea, and thinking these sad and strange thoughts, more and more and more stars had gathered, obliterating the separateness of the Milky Way and filling up the whole sky. And far far away in that ocean of gold, stars were silently shooting and falling and finding their fates, among these billions and billions of merging golden lights. And curtain after curtain of gauze was quietly removed, and I saw stars behind stars behind stars&#8230; And I saw into the vast soft interior of the universe which was slowly and gently turning itself inside out. I went to sleep, and in my sleep I seemed to hear a sound of singing.\nPreviously: The Unphotographable #3: Alaskan Paradise with Rockwell Kent.\ndonating = lovingFor a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

        "description": "More competitive pay — not lowering standards for educators — should be a key part of addressing a national teacher shortage, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona said Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation.\" \n“Unless we're serious about providing competitive salaries for our educators, better working conditions, so that they can continue to grow ... we're going to constantly deal with shortage issues, especially in our areas that are harder to teach or where there are less candidates,\" Cardona told host Margaret Brennan. \nTeachers should also have a voice in the \"process of reopening and reimagining our schools,\" Cardona said. \nThe secretary addressed states that have lowered standards for educators to recruit more staff, calling the measures \"unfortunate.\" \nArizona no longer requires teachers to have a bachelor's degree, and Florida is offering temporary teaching credentials to veterans without certifications.\n\"Our students need more now, not less … I do not support lowering any standards for qualifications with teachers,\" Cardona said. \nThe United States is facing a national shortage of 300,000 teachers and school staff, according to the National Education Association. \nNew Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu, a Republican, defended streamlining processes to certify teachers, saying he detested \"the rigmarole\" that slowed things down.\n\"Streamlining the regulatory and permitting and certification processes, whether it's teachers or manufacturers, that's an opportunity every state has,\" he said on \"Fox News Sunday.\" \"We're doing it here. We're streamlining our whole thing.\"",

We will be able to stabilize it.\"\nWater levels on the Colorado River are so low that a formal shortage was declared last week, and there is concern that Lake Powell, a key reservoir along the Arizona-Utah border, could reach disastrous levels in 2023.\nThe state of the drought is currently \"not existential,\" Kelly said, highlighting provisions in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act for water resiliency and storage, as well as funds to address the drought in the Inflation Reduction Act. \nHowever, he said the potential consequences of inaction could be seen across the country, because of farming in the region: \"It's also about food security for our entire nation,\" Kelly said. \nKelly said in June: \"Arizona's done everything that Arizona has been asked ... but we need partners and long-term commitments from the federal government.\"",

        "description": "There long has been a debate among social policy advocates and politicians over which makes better policy and is more politically sustainable: universal programs like Social Security and Medicare or targeted ones like Medicaid and food stamps.\n\n\n\nThe assumption is that universal programs fare better as, by definition, they have more beneficiaries. Conventional wisdom has it that during the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush presidencies, programs focused on the poor were shredded, while universal programs escaped unscathed.\n\n\n\nIn a major study for the Hamilton Project and Brookings Institution, Bob Greenstein, the Michelangelo of social programs to lift people out of poverty going back to the 1970s, reports this conventional wisdom is essentially wrong. Over 40 years, after adjusting for inflation and population, he found that programs targeted by income rose at an annual rate of 3.39 percent, while universal programs rose an average of 2.36 percent a year.\n\n\n\nThere's a reason, he concludes. “Policy makers effectively developed a new model for targeted programs aimed at poor families, extending them to families well above the poverty level even into middle class,” he told me.\n\n\n\nGreenstein takes issue with critics who say this is just universal “lite,” with programs like SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or food stamps, or the Earned Income Tax Credit or Medicaid. “Almost all the benefits go to people below the median income level in the country, and most of the benefits go to people in the bottom quintile.”\n\n\n\nThe Greenstein paper found that from 1979 to 2019, Medicare — which mainly serves the elderly — annually rose a robust 4.12 percent after adjusting for inflation and population. Medicaid, once seen as just for the poor, grew at an even faster 4.94 percent as eligibility expanded.\n\n\n\nThere are more than 82 million Americans enrolled in Medicaid, less than half living below the poverty level, and almost half of all births are covered by Medicaid.\n\n\n\nThat explains the Republicans’ political failure to cut Medicaid, which is funded mainly by the federal government with states kicking in a share. Obamacare offered extended benefits, but a number of Republican-led states rejected that. However, when proponents put it on the ballot as a referendum, it won in deeply red states like Oklahoma, Utah and Missouri. This summer, South Dakota voters resoundingly rejected a proposal by Republican legislators to make it more difficult to approve a Medicaid expansion initiative.\n\n\n\nIn his research, Greenstein cited overall qualities that make programs more sustainable, including: when tied to work; when also serving families significantly above the poverty line, even into middle class; when federally financed and administered; when providing in-kind assistance — not cash — either directly or through the tax code, and when they focus on children, the elderly or those with disabilities.\n\n\n\nWelfare — what used to be called AFDC and now TANF (temporary assistance for needy families) — fared poorly, being repeatedly cut. But supplemental nutrition assistance programs have flourished, either through stamps or electronic transfers, providing food assistance to families, in good and bad times.\n\n\n\nThe modern food stamp program was devised in the 1970s by a diverse set of influential legislators: Rep. Tom Foley, who later became Speaker, and Sens. Bob Dole, a conservative, and liberal George McGovern. They put the measure in the farm bill, winning support from rural lawmakers who wanted farm subsidies, and urban liberals then backed the agricultural programs.\n\n\n\nAssistance that goes through the tax code is easier to garner political support. The Earned Income Tax Credit for the working poor has been enormously successful and popular. So has the child tax credit, which provides a credit of up to $2,000 for children up to 17.\n\n\n\nThe credit was temporarily boosted during the pandemic — but wasn't extended in the big domestic bill Democrats just passed. Hopefully it might be next year — and made refundable, so it could help the really poor who pay little or no taxes while reducing the eligibility threshold. Now a couple making as much as $450,000 can get some of the credit. That's well beyond middle class.\n\n\n\nMost any new universal programs are doomed because of the cost. In the recent congressional legislation, House Democrats scrapped a plan to include dental and vision benefits under Medicare because of the price tag. The dream of some liberals for a universal basic income will remain a dream. So will any hope for a single-payer health care plan; advocates will have to focus on expanding Obamacare.\n\n\n\nThe tax increases needed to support universal programs are unattainable — even though, as Greenstein notes, the United States is a low-tax country. A couple years ago, according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), tax revenue in the U.S. equaled 25 percent of gross domestic product. In Western European countries that rate ranged between 33 percent and 47 percent.\n\n\n\nThere will be competing claims for any domestic initiatives. Both Social Security and Medicare need to be financially bolstered in this decade. Even after an expansive agenda enacted in this Congress, there are unmet needs, especially for children.\n\n\n\nOne possibly helpful step may be a little-noticed executive order that President Biden signed last December directing federal agencies to better coordinate in cutting through red tape and bureaucratic overlap in some of these initiatives.\n\n\n\n“This has the potential to be a big deal,” Greenstein says. “It can build on the progress that has been made in making it easier to apply and remain enrolled in these programs without impairing program integrity.”\n\n\n\nAl Hunt is the former executive editor of Bloomberg News.

        "description": "Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) said on Sunday that the FBI’s search of former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence was “automatically political.” \n\n\n\nOn CNN’s “State of the Union,” moderator Jake Tapper asked Crenshaw “if law enforcement is innocent until proven guilty,” referring to the skepticism that the agency has faced for executing a search warrant at the Florida estate. \n\n\n\n“People signing off on it doesn't mean ... that it has precedent,” Crenshaw replied. “It doesn't. This is a very unprecedented measure. And you know that when you're going after an ex-president who may run again that this is automatically political. You cannot separate the legal aspects from the political aspects. You can't.\"\n\n\n\nCrenshaw also said he does not believe Department of Justice (DOJ) officials \"acted responsibly.\"  \n\n\n\n“Why not just ask him?\" he said, referring to the documents seized by FBI agents at Trump's estate. \n\n\n\nCrenshaw’s remarks came after a federal judge said he is interested in unsealing parts of the affidavit used to justify the FBI’s search. The DOJ has argued that releasing the affidavit would jeopardize its ongoing investigation of Trump. \n\n\n\nThe legal maneuvering comes after federal authorities earlier this month executed a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago and removed classified documents. \n\n\n\n\"It's hard to justify what the Department of Justice did here, in my opinion,\" Crenshaw said on Sunday.\n\n\n\n\"I still haven't seen any evidence that Trump was even asked to give these documents back,\" he said. \"Why take it to this extreme extent?\"\n\n\n\n\"It does seem unjust, and there does seem to be a long history of loss of credibility at the Department of Justice at the hands of Democrats. And I think people are rightfully frustrated about that,\" he added.",

It's not yet known if the administration is set to extend a freeze on student loan payments and interest accrual or if the Education Department will also announce a more permanent solution, such as canceling some debt for each borrower.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration has faced pressure from some Democratic lawmakers to cancel up to $50,000 in debt per borrower. The president has championed forgiving up to $10,000 in debt, but no official announcement has been made on debt forgiveness. \n\n\n\nThe Education Department has already made strides to forgive student loan debt, which is estimated to be at $1.7 trillion spread across 45 million Americans.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration has cleared $32 billion in student loan relief for more than 1.6 million borrowers, mostly students who were defrauded or misled by schools or through the Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PLSF) program, which forgives debt for those who work in public service or other qualifying jobs.\n\n\n\nCardona on Sunday said the PSLF program has forgiven more than $10 billion for borrowers to date under the Biden administration.\n\n\n\n\"Public Service Loan Forgiveness was broken,\" he said. \"We fixed it so that our teachers, our nurses, can get loan forgiveness right away.\"",

        "description": "Politico: &#8220;He and his team haven’t settled on a singular approach and appear in the dark about what may come next. Trump has often used litigation to delay but has been loath to go on offense, particularly when he’s likely to lose. His vow Friday to make a &#8216;major motion&#8217; appeared in keeping with that approach.&#8221;\n&#8220;While it’s unclear whether the former president or any of his top allies are at imminent risk of criminal charges, they have sketched out competing and sometimes conflicting positions that may come into play as the investigation — now in its &#8216;early stages&#8217; — accelerates.&#8221;\nKey takeaway: “The best thing that Trump can probably hope for at the moment is that the search warrant was primarily a mechanism to recover records the government thought it was entitled to and isn’t much of an indication of whether he or anyone else will face criminal charges.”",

        "description": "The Phillies announced that they have selected the contract of right-hander Tyler Cyr. To make room on the active roster, right-hander Seranthony Dominguez is heading to the 15-day injured list due to triceps soreness. A spot on the 40-man was opened up by Corey Knebel getting transferred to the 60-day IL with a tear in his shoulder capsule. He will not return to the club this season.\nIt&#8217;s yet another unfortunate setback for Knebel, 30, who has frequently oscillated between promising mound work and injury absences. After an excellent run with Milwaukee over the 2015-2018 seasons, he was able to throw only 39 total innings over the next three seasons due to various injuries. The Phillies took a shot on him by giving him a one-year, $10MM contract for 2022. Knebel threw 44 2/3 innings with a 3.43 ERA, which will now go down as his final results for the year, since he won&#8217;t return. He&#8217;ll head to free agency in a few months, but his recovery from this injury will determine the level of interest.\nAs for Dominguez, 27, it&#8217;s unclear exactly how long the Phillies expect him to be out of action. Regardless, it&#8217;s a frustrating setback in what has been a very encouraging season. After Tommy John surgery caused him to miss 2020 and limited him to just one inning in 2021, he has thrown 44 innings this season with an incredible 1.64 ERA. He&#8217;s striking out 32% of batters faced, walking just 8.3% of them and getting grounders on 49% of balls in play. That&#8217;s primarily come in high leverage situations as well, with Dominguez racking up nine saves and 13 holds on the season. His departure will definitely impair the Phillies&#8217; bullpen for as long as he&#8217;s away.\nCyr, 29, was selected by the Giants in the 10th round of the 2015 draft. He showed enough promise in the lower levels of their system to crack Baseball America&#8217;s list of top San Francisco farmhands, coming in at #26 in 2018. However, he was met with some struggles when he got to the top of the minor league ladder.\nHe first reached Triple-A in 2019, getting a single appearance there as the season was winding down. Then the pandemic wiped out the minor leagues entirely in 2020. Cyr then returned to Triple-A in 2021 but registered a 4.91 ERA in 36 2/3 innings that year. He racked up strikeouts at an incredible 31.6% rate but also a 13.5% walk rate. His 52.5% ground ball rate was also quite strong, but he was knocked around by allowing four homers in that sample, a 17.4% HR/FB rate.\nAfter reaching free agency, he signed with the Phillies for 2022 and has had a better showing. He has a 2.50 ERA through 36 innings. His strikeout rate has dropped to 24.8% and he&#8217;s still walking 12.1% of batters faced, but he&#8217;s still getting grounders on 51.1% of balls in play and hasn&#8217;t allowed a home run. Based on that strong showing, he&#8217;s been selected to a major league roster for the first time and will make his big league debut as soon as he gets into a game.\nMatt Gelb of The Athletic tweeted out the news prior to the official announcement.",

        "description": "11:30am: Tim Britton of The Athletic relays the full slate of moves. Fisher has been selected while Jose Butto has been recalled. To make room on the active roster, Zastryzny was optioned, righty Stephen Nogosek was placed on the 15-day IL with a left oblique strain and lefty Sam Clay was designated for assignment.\n11:25am: The Mets are selecting the contract of left-hander Nate Fisher, reports Jeff Passan of ESPN. Fisher is not currently on the club&#8217;s 40-man roster, meaning a corresponding move of some kind will be required.\nTo say that Fisher is not a top prospect would be underselling his journey. As noted by Passan, he was out of baseball and working a finance job in Omaha last year. He joined the Mariners&#8217; organization in 2019 but was released in May of 2020. He signed another minor league contract with Seattle in June of 2021, eventually throwing 37 1/3 innings with a 2.89 ERA cross multiple levels of the minors.\nHe reached free agency in the offseason and was signed to a minors deal by the Mets. He&#8217;s split his time between Double-A and Triple-A this season, throwing 72 innings with a 3.37 ERA, 23.2% strikeout rate and 10.1% walk rate. Now 26 years old, Fisher has made the improbable jump to the big leagues after not even being in the sport just over a year ago.\nThough Fisher has made some starts this year, it seems the Mets likely try to utilize him for left-handed relief. Joely Rodriguez has been the only southpaw in the club&#8217;s bullpen for most of the year, with Rob Zastryzny just getting added yesterday.",

        "description": "Politico: &#8220;He and his team haven’t settled on a singular approach and appear in the dark about what may come next. Trump has often used litigation to delay but has been loath to go on offense, particularly when he’s likely to lose. His vow Friday to make a &#8216;major motion&#8217; appeared in keeping with that approach.&#8221;\n&#8220;While it’s unclear whether the former president or any of his top allies are at imminent risk of criminal charges, they have sketched out competing and sometimes conflicting positions that may come into play as the investigation — now in its &#8216;early stages&#8217; — accelerates.&#8221;\nKey takeaway: “The best thing that Trump can probably hope for at the moment is that the search warrant was primarily a mechanism to recover records the government thought it was entitled to and isn’t much of an indication of whether he or anyone else will face criminal charges.”",

As a doctor, I am desperate for the system to change, theguardian.com, 13 August). He is absolutely right to recommend a patient-led approach for doctors, but this is also necessary for all health and social care providers.The treatment for those with long Covid and other post-Covid issues presents a once- in-a-generation opportunity to use patient insight to shape how complex health conditions are treated. Two years into my own long Covid recovery, I was invited by Health Systems Innovation Lab at London South Bank University to take part in a series of workshops involving health and social care professionals (including clinicians). We worked to improve pathways of support. The success of this project has directly led to a new plan to embed patient input into their work. Continue reading...",

The fundamental materialism of the Thatcher philosophy rules. English literature is not in the top 10; neither is philosophy or religious studies. Psychology (ranked second) is a kind of science, hence a placeholder for the concerns of these subjects. Yet, in the end, our lives are stories and we hunger for beauty and meaning. Moral matters are complex and vital, and need thinking about. And we are spiritual as well as physical animals, who have to struggle to find out who we are and the meaning of things.

Organic, pasture-fed beef and lamb, 16 August) cites a meta-analysis showing that “when livestock are removed from the land, the abundance and diversity of almost all groups of wild animals increases”. But the same study also “observed grazing having a positive effect on plant diversity” and found that “in some environments, continued grazing is a required management technique to support native biodiversity”.Were I to stop grazing my 8-acre holding with Jersey cows, the pastures, meadows and hedgerows – which host well over 60 species of plants, a dozen kinds of butterfly, insects ranging from dung beetles to grasshoppers, and various birds, reptiles and mammals – would be overtaken by bracken and brambles. Over time, this would presumably succeed to woodland, but in west Dorset we are already blessed with abundant tree cover. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Kansas is facing the&nbsp;worst&nbsp;teacher shortage in the state’s history. In Florida, school districts must try to fill some 9,000 job&nbsp;openings, just as students are returning to classrooms. And in California, teacher&nbsp;retirements&nbsp;are way up, even as the supply of new teachers has dwindled.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s not hard to see why teachers are in short supply. The pandemic has battered the nation’s schools, leaving educators to contend with shifting health protocols, staff shortages and a wide range of student needs. Meanwhile, average earnings have been flat for&nbsp;several decades. Compared with other highly-educated professions, teachers&nbsp;earn far less.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut perhaps the most important factor driving teachers out of the classroom is a morale crisis. Job satisfaction has plummeted as right-wing extremists have depicted teachers as indoctrinators, or worse, “groomers” who prey on children. A growing number of states have adopted educator “gag orders,” limiting the discussion of race, racism and LGBTQ+ issues in the classroom. And parent&nbsp;anger&nbsp;at teachers who advocated for school closures and strict COVID mitigation measures has yet to subside.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor teachers, being painted as the enemy isn’t just demoralizing. Being publicly demonized also erodes what sociologist&nbsp;Dan Lortie&nbsp;called the “psychic rewards” of the profession, which have long been a significant part of teacher compensation. While educators have never been particularly well-paid, the job has long come with the sense that they were doing something meaningful in their classrooms and for the larger community. Historically, such rewards have appealed to people who care more about doing good in the world than they do about doing well for themselves. The attacks on educators diminish those rewards — the equivalent of a massive pay cut.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet as dire as the present moment may seem for the nation’s teachers, the decline in psychic pay actually predates both the pandemic and the current culture wars. Long before the GOP embarked on its modern-day witch hunt for “woke” teachers, scapegoating teachers for educational inequities was a bipartisan endeavor — one led by Democrats.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRhetoric about the nation’s schools began to turn negative several decades ago. In 1983, the Reagan administration released its “A Nation at Risk”&nbsp;report, bemoaning a “rising tide of mediocrity” in the schools and establishing a new narrative about public education in the U.S. Although polls indicated that Americans continued to view their own children’s schools&nbsp;quite positively, legislation like No Child Left Behind, signed into law in 2002, was the apotheosis of the&nbsp;“failing schools” narrative. But the war on teachers didn’t reach its apex until the Obama years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nArguing that “America’s future depends on its teachers,”&nbsp;Barack Obama and his administration&nbsp;became laser-focused&nbsp;on weeding out “ineffective” educators, using student standardized test scores as the key indicator of classroom success. Obama’s education chief, Arne Duncan,&nbsp;argued&nbsp;that “bad value-added teachers” were blunting the life prospects of their students and imperiling the nation’s ability to keep pace in a global economy. And that view quickly found its way into policy. Incentivized by the Obama administration’s&nbsp;Race to the Top fund, nearly every state adopted laws holding teachers accountable for how their students fared on standardized tests. A raft of new measures also weakened their unions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearch&nbsp;has since found that the drive to weed out “bad” teachers had no impact on student test scores or educational attainment. What it did, instead, was narrow the focus of public education, which became increasingly oriented toward federally-mandated standardized tests. Teacher morale cratered, while harsh anti-teacher rhetoric and the anti-union policies traditionally favored by the right acquired a sheen of bipartisan respectability.\n\n\n\nNow we’re reaping what was sown. A steady stream of surveys indicates that teachers are&nbsp;eyeing the door. And though&nbsp;research&nbsp;has shown that such threats to leave don’t always translate into actual departures, polls point to&nbsp;real dissatisfaction&nbsp;that will have equally real consequences for schools and students. When teachers are stressed out and demoralized, the quality of instruction suffers, as do their relationships with students.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe perception that teaching is an embattled profession is also discouraging prospective teachers. Enrollment in teacher preparation programs has&nbsp;declined significantly&nbsp;since 2010 — a trend that has only accelerated since the pandemic. Even Teach for America, which places graduates of elite colleges in public school classrooms, has seen a&nbsp;striking decline&nbsp;in applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublicans have responded to teacher shortages by loosening the rules governing who can work in classrooms. In&nbsp;Arizona, teachers no longer need a bachelor's degree, while in&nbsp;Florida, military veterans with high school diplomas are now eligible for a temporary teaching certificate. But such measures are likely to further undermine the teaching profession. Lower credentials, after all, translate into lower pay, while the message that “anyone can teach” further erodes the job’s psychic rewards.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConfronting current and looming teacher shortages will require reckoning with the profession’s loss of appeal. And there are growing signs that teachers, themselves, are doing just that. Last year saw a surge in collective action, as teachers in&nbsp;California, Minnesota, Illinois, and&nbsp;Massachusetts&nbsp;went on strike. Many more unions authorized walkouts — a trend that is likely to continue as schools reopen. Notably, these teachers cited the urgent need to restore the psychic rewards that had for so long been a core part of educator compensation. As the president of the Minneapolis Teachers Union&nbsp;put it: “You should feel joy at work, you should be proud to be an educator, you should not feel demonized.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever Americans feel about educators and their unions, the inescapable truth is that schools can’t function without professional teachers in the classroom. For the past two decades, policy elites have embraced a narrative that frames the interests of teachers as inherently at odds with what is good for young people and society at large. Educators have been scapegoated, villainized, and maligned. Ultimately, however, much of what is good for teachers is also good for students and communities; and abuse of educators, in turn, tends to bleed&nbsp;into schools and neighborhoods.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the pandemic enters its third year, students are struggling academically and emotionally like never before. And while policy leaders do seem genuinely concerned about meeting the needs of young people who have already lost so much, they are mostly overlooking a simple truth. Supporting students requires valuing the work of their teachers.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJack Schneider (@Edu_Historian) is an associate professor of education at the University of Massachusetts Lowell, and Jennifer Berkshire (@BisforBerkshire) is a freelance journalist.

Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) said on Sunday that members of his state’s Republican Party have “dangerous ideas.”\n\n\n\nOn CNN’s “State of the Union,” anchor Jake Tapper asked Kelly about his thoughts on the state’s GOP with regard to candidates running for office who have denied that President Biden was legitimately elected or suggested that their political opponents be jailed.\n\n\n\n“Well, unfortunately, I think right now that the folks you mentioned have some really dangerous ideas, and they're not consistent with most Arizonans, even most Republicans in Arizona,” Kelly told Tapper. \n\n\n\n“So I'm hoping we can move away from that. My Republican colleagues that I talk to in the United States Senate, I mean, these are good, good people, by and large, who are working really hard,” Kelly added. “And they don't need those dangerous ideas in the United States Senate.”\n\n\n\nKelly’s remarks come after a new Fox News poll showed that the lawmaker has an 8-point lead over his Trump-backed challenger in his state’s Senate race. Fifty percent of respondents said they support Kelly, while 42 percent said they back Masters. \n\n\n\nKelly also said that he’ll welcome Biden to campaign for him during this election cycle, notably not distancing himself from the president as some other Democrats have.\n\n\n\n“Hey, I will welcome anybody that come to Arizona, travel around the state at any time, as long as I'm here, if I'm not up in Washington in session, and talk about what Arizona needs,” Kelly said. \"This water situation is significant. And right now,we have some of the tools necessary to deal with it. I'm trying to get some answers from the Department of Interior on more, like, what authority do they have to make some decisions themselves on this?” \n\n\n\n“Because, as I said earlier, the other states are not stepping up to help Arizona deal with this. But if anybody wants to come to Arizona and talk about Arizona issues or issues that affect the country, I will be here,” Kelly said.",

        "description": "Rep. Sean Maloney (D-N.Y.) on Sunday pushed back against criticism over the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) funding GOP candidates backed by former President Trump in Republican primaries, arguing Democrats are doing their jobs to keep \"dangerous MAGA Republicans\" out of office.\n\n\n\n\"Absolutely not did we put party over country,\"  Maloney told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" moderator Chuck Todd. \"The moral imperative right now ... is to keep the dangerous MAGA Republicans who voted to overturn our election out of power.\"\n\n\n\nIn this year's GOP primaries, the DCCC has aired ads promoting candidates who have endorsed Trump's false claims the 2020 election was stolen, betting the far-right and more extremist nominees will lose in tough districts against Democrats.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Trump-endorsed candidate John Gibbs beat out Rep.&nbsp;Peter Meijer&nbsp;(R-Mich.) in his primary battle. Maloney and the DCCC were criticized for airing an ad supporting Gibbs.\n\n\n\nMeijer was one of 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\n\nMaloney said on Sunday Democrats are now far more likely to pick up that Michigan seat come November, calling House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) the \"big loser.\"\n\n\n\n\"My job is to win elections for the Democrats and I take that seriously because the moral imperative is keeping the gavel out of the hands of Kevin McCarthy, who would have overturned the results of the [2020] election,\" he told NBC. \"I understand that there are difficult moral questions, philosophical questions about tactics. That's always true in politics.\n\n\n\n\"John Gibbs is a weak opponent. He's an extremist with a vicious anti-choice record. He can't string a set of policies together that will make sense for Western Michigan,\" Maloney continued. \"We're going to win that seat. And we believe that by keeping those dangerous people out of power, we address the larger moral imperative. And that's our job.\"",

Colchicine, in the form of the autumn crocus, was used as early as 1500BC to treat joint swelling. The plant is highly toxic because of the colchicine, so my GP will only prescribe 12 tablets at a time. But they do work, without the side-effects of painkillers such as ibuprofen and paracetamol.Paddy MoindrotLlanfyllin, Powys• In contrast to the letters about tactless firms making grieving worse (14 August), I would like to pay tribute to the government’s Tell Us Once service, which I found when my wife died a few months ago. It offers a list of public services that can be selected if they seem likely to be relevant, and they will be informed following a single message with the details. It doesn’t solve all the problems, but is a rare example of consumer benefit from government automation.Alan BaileyLondon Continue reading...",

Organic, pasture-fed beef and lamb, 16 August) cites a meta-analysis showing that “when livestock are removed from the land, the abundance and diversity of almost all groups of wild animals increases”. But the same study also “observed grazing having a positive effect on plant diversity” and found that “in some environments, continued grazing is a required management technique to support native biodiversity”.Were I to stop grazing my 8-acre holding with Jersey cows, the pastures, meadows and hedgerows – which host well over 60 species of plants, a dozen kinds of butterfly, insects ranging from dung beetles to grasshoppers, and various birds, reptiles and mammals – would be overtaken by bracken and brambles. Over time, this would presumably succeed to woodland, but in west Dorset we are already blessed with abundant tree cover. Continue reading...",

They first called him up in June, letting him make five appearances. The first four went pretty well, with the southpaw only allowing a single earned run in that time. In his fifth outing, however, the Bucs sent him in to pitch the top of the eighth in a game they were losing to the Brewers 9-1. Despite Vieaux getting hit around badly, there was no help forthcoming to get out of the inning. The lefty ended up tossing 56 pitches in that one frame, allowing six hits, three walks and eight runs, seven of them earned. As a result, he has a 14.40 ERA through five innings this year.\nAs a reward for eating that inning, Vieaux was optioned to the minors and designated for assignment in the following days. He cleared waivers and was outrighted, sticking in the Pirates&#8217; system. In 42 Triple-A innings this year, he has an even 3.00 ERA, with a 23.3% strikeout rate, 8.8% walk rate and 43.1% ground ball rate.\nAs for Godoy, 27, he&#8217;s surely racked up his share of frequent flyer miles this year. He began 2022 in the Mariners organization but was claimed off waivers by the Giants in March, who promptly lost him to the Twins on another waiver claim. He stuck with Minnesota until August, at which point he went to Pittsburgh on yet another trip to the waiver wire. He&#8217;s spent most of his time in the minors this year, getting into 44 Triple-A games and hitting .201/.272/.299 in that time.\nSince the trade deadline has passed, the Pirates will have no choice but to put Godoy on outright waivers or release waivers in the coming days. If Godoy doesn&#8217;t get claimed for a fourth time this year, he can reject an outright assignment and elect free agency, by virtue of having been previously outrighted in his career. This leaves the Pirates with Jason Delay and Tyler Heineman as the only catchers on their 40-man roster.",

        "description": "The chances of Wander Franco returning this season have taken a hit, as Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times reports that the Rays&#8217; shortstop has been pulled off his rehab assignment due to continued soreness in his right hand.\nIt&#8217;s been a frustrating season for the 21-year-old, the first campaign of the huge 11-year, $182MM extension he signed with the Rays in November. After years of hype as one of the top prospects in baseball, often being considered the very best, Franco arrived with aplomb last year. He got into 70 games in his debut season, hitting .288/.347/.463 for a wRC+ of 127, or 27% better than league average. At the end of that successful season, the Rays gave him the largest contract in team history, hoping to have him serve as the face of the franchise for the next decade-plus.\nUnfortunately, it&#8217;s been a series of injury setbacks here in 2022. Franco missed most of June due to a quad strain, returning for about two weeks before landing on the IL again, this time due to discomfort in his hand and wrist area. The club later announced that Franco would undergo surgery to address damage to his hamate bone, providing a window of 5-8 weeks as his estimated recovery timeline. It was approximately five weeks later (on August 16) that Franco began his rehab assignment. However, it seems that the issue hasn&#8217;t quite cleared, with Franco now being shut down for a little bit longer.\nThis latest setback will put a dent in how much Franco can contribute for the club down the stretch. There are now just over six weeks remaining on the MLB schedule for the regular season. Though the club hasn&#8217;t provided any kind of updated timeline of what they expect for the next steps, Franco will first have to get beyond the soreness he&#8217;s experiencing and then resume his rehab assignment before the Rays can think about having him rejoin the big league club. Tampa currently holds the final Wild Card spot in the American League, though Minnesota is within a game and a half, with three other clubs with five games.\nUntil then, the Rays will likely continue slotting Taylor Walls into shortstop, as they have done for most of the games with Franco out of action. He&#8217;s hitting .179/.275/.297 on the year for a wRC+ of 73.",

Ahead of their series finale in Philadelphia this afternoon, the Mets have officially called up right-handed starting pitcher José Butto. On top of that, the team has called up left-handed relief pitcher Nate Fisher, placed right-handed reliever Stephen Nogosek on the injured list with an oblique strain, optioned lefty reliever Rob Zastryzny to Triple-A Syracuse, and designated lefty reliever Sam Clay for assignment. All of the relievers who have been removed from the roster made appearances during the Mets’ doubleheader split with the Phillies yesterday.\nButto has a 4.12 ERA between his time in Double-A Binghamton and Triple-A Syracuse this year, with the bulk of that work having taken place in Binghamton. You can read plenty more about him in Steve Sypa’s primer on the 24-year-old. He is starting today because Taijuan Walker is unable to start after having to leave his start against the Braves last week after just two innings because of back spasms.",

        "description": "“Reliable Sources” host Brian Stelter said he’ll be “rooting for” CNN for the rest of his life as he signed off his final broadcast Sunday, following the show’s cancellation this week.\n“So much of the media ecosystem in 2022 is garbage, but so much of it is spectacular,” he said in his closing remarks. “The hard part is sorting out the treasure from the trash.”\nThe network announced Thursday that “Reliable Sources” had been canceled after three decades, and that Stelter, who had hosted the show since 2013, will depart the network. The host thanked CNN’s current leadership “for letting us say goodbye,” and also thanked former CNN President Jeff Zucker by name.\n\"I’m going to be rooting for this place for the rest of my life,\" Stelter said at one point.\nStelter and his guests on the final broadcast both reflected on changes in media since the show premiered in 1992, and on how news media might look in the future.\n“It’s loony to say the media is the enemy of the people. The media is the people,” Stelter said, addressing developments in media in the last 30 years. “And people are flawed, and opinionated, and hopeful, and believing in accountability.”\nStelter hosted journalist Carl Bernstein on Sunday’s program, as well as media critics Eric Deggans, Jodie Ginsberg and David Zurawik. Journalist Brian Karem, who was the first guest on “Reliable Sources” in 1992, also made an appearance as the last guest.",

        "description": "Dennis Rodman, a former NBA player who has engaged in informal diplomacy with North Korea and Russia, said Sunday he plans to go to Russia to help imprisoned WNBA player Brittney Griner, according to NBC News.\n\"I got permission to go to Russia to help that girl,\" Rodman said to NBC. \"I'm trying to go this week.\"\nThe flamboyant Basketball Hall of Famer, a veteran of five NBA championship teams, called Russian President Vladimir Putin \"cool\" in 2014. He has also visited North Korea multiple times, including for leader Kim Jong Un's birthday. \n\"I know Putin too well,\" Rodman said of his relationship with the Russian president, according to NBC. \nGriner was sentenced to nine years in Russian prison earlier this month, after she was found guilty of possession and smuggling of cannabis oil. The Biden administration has put a proposal on the table to facilitate her release, according to Secretary of State Antony Blinken — reportedly a high-stakes prisoner swap involving convicted Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. \nThe State Department has a travel advisory discouraging Americans from visiting Russia. \nPresident Joe Biden has called Griner's imprisonment \"unacceptable.\"",

        "description": "Pleasance Courtyard, EdinburghHoult hangs up the dress and luvvie cadences of his fringe-staple alter ego Anna Mann in a camp, silly yet surprisingly emotional showWhen a character comic bids farewell to their character, is it a death – or a rebirth? Fringe veteran and sometime Ricky Gervais collaborator Colin Hoult has been performing as the indiscreet thespian Anna Mann (“I was in the same hand gestures class as Helen Mirren”) for years. But now Anna is taking her final bow. A terminal doctor’s diagnosis is hinted at, which is all the prompt she needs to re-tread for us her life’s journey: the escape from Nottingham, the whiff of the greasepaint, the many marriages. But the real story of Anna’s swan song starts leaking out, through the loose stitching that holds this lovable but vague character together.What emerges is a show with a surprising emotional underpinning, a show that – while on a superficial level is as silly as can be – treats Anna’s death, and that of her ever-so-humble sister Jane, with a degree more seriousness than you’d expect. That this doesn’t overbalance the comedy is testament to the levity elsewhere, as this gushing theatrical dame hymns her career peaks (Predator the Musical; the video nasty Cannibal Bagpipers), winces at her relationship troughs (finding her action-hero husband in bed with her best friend) and interacts camply with the crowd.Colin Hoult is at Pleasance Courtyard, Edinburgh, until 28 August.All our Edinburgh festival reviews.

        "description": "A federal appeals court on Sunday granted Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) a reprieve, blocking a subpoena ordering him to testify before a Georgia grand jury probing former President Trump's alleged interference into the 2020 election.\n\n\n\nA three-judge panel with the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily paused the subpoena, sending the case back to a district court to decide whether it should be partially quashed or modified, according to The Associated Press. \n\n\n\nThe panel agreed with Graham's argument that the Constitution’s Speech and Debate Clause —which shields congressional members from testifying about legislative matters related to their work — prevents him from appearing before a grand jury in Fulton County. \n\n\n\nThe circuit court asked a U.S. District Court judge to look at whether the subpoena needs to be modified based on the Speech and Debate Clause.\n\n\n\nGraham had been set to appear before the special grand jury on Tuesday following a decision from a U.S. District Court that rejected his request to quash the subpoena and forced the senator to testify in the interest of not delaying the investigation. The U.S. District Court judge also ruled that Graham does not have testimonial immunity based on the Speech and Debate Clause.\n\n\n\nGraham appealed to the circuit court and on Sunday won his first victory in the legal wrangling since being called to testify last month about phone calls he allegedly had with state election officials after the 2020 election.\n\n\n\nThe Fulton County probe centers around a January 2021 phone call during which Trump pressured Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (R) to \"find\" enough votes to secure his victory in the state.\n\n\n\nGraham reportedly called Raffensperger and his staff shortly after Election Day, inquiring about voter fraud and asking for a re-examination of absentee ballots to generate a more favorable outcome for Trump.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3605776-the-greatest-obstacle-to-returning-to-the-iran-deal-isnt-iran-its-congress/",
        "description": "Since assuming office, President Biden has been attempting to negotiate a return to compliance with the Iran nuclear deal known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), which President Trump walked away from in 2018. For months, press reports have signaled that a return to the deal was close at hand, and then not, and then close to happening again. \n\n\n\nThe opaqueness of the process, and uncertainty about what Tehran ultimately wants or can agree to, has fed skepticism about whether an agreement is forthcoming. Beyond the details of the deal being negotiated, it’s hard to imagine what lasting benefit there is for Iran in agreeing to return to a deal that has become so politicized in U.S. politics that any hypothetical Republican successor to Biden — who is currently polling around 40 percent approval — is likely to tear it up on day one of his or her presidency.\n\n\n\nBut if we suspend our disbelief that the negotiating teams can succeed in overcoming doubts and disagreements, what legally must follow in Washington further complicates a return to the deal: Congress gets a say. While the Obama administration was negotiating the original deal in 2015, Congress passed and the president signed into law the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (INARA). The law gave Congress oversight of the JCPOA. \n\n\n\nINARA included a host of periodic reporting requirements and certifications that the executive branch would have to provide on Iran’s compliance with the deal. Additionally — and of little consequence since the deal was originally inked — is a provision within INARA that requires the president to submit any agreement made with Iran that relates to its nuclear program to Congress for a 30-day period of review. During that period, were Congress to pass a Joint Resolution of Disapproval (JRD), it would nullify the president’s ability to lift any sanctions on Iran associated with the deal. INARA essentially gave Congress veto power over the JCPOA, or any new or amended deal with Iran.\n\n\n\nWhat remains legally uncertain is, what happens if the United States and Iran both return to compliance with the original JCPOA — would that constitute a “new deal,” requiring submission to Congress? Legally, it’s not clear. Politically, it’s hard to imagine the Biden administration dodging congressional oversight on a matter of such intense political dispute. In May, Biden’s lead negotiator, Rob Malley, testified to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee that any deal the administration reached would be submitted to Congress under INARA, initiating the 30-day review period and potentially enabling Congress to pass a JRD and kill the deal.\n\n\n\nProviding that a deal is reached, and is submitted to Congress for review, would it survive? The short answer — and an evergreen one when dealing with the legislative branch — is probably, but it’s going to be painful.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAny senator can introduce a JRD, though it would require 60 votes to pass. The “no” votes may not be there, but any vote certainly could be closer than the original vote against JCPOA in 2015, in which the Republican-led Senate could not muster the necessary 60 votes to approve the resolution. Sen. Bob Menendez (D-N.J.), chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, is a longtime skeptic of the deal and has been openly critical of the negotiations process to return to the deal. \n\n\n\nA growing public perception that Iran is stalling for time or is attempting to hide undeclared nuclear activity could drive anti-JCPOA sentiment. And if it passed the Senate, it would be privileged in the House, meaning the House would be compelled to vote on it too.\n\n\n\nSo, hypothetically, if it passes the Senate, what sayeth the House? In an election year, in which many centrist seats in the House are up for grabs, the House conceivably could pass a JRD against the deal. In April, 18 House Democrats signed a letter expressing concerns about returning to the JCPOA; five of them felt strongly enough to hold a press conference to talk about it. Eighteen Democrats voting with Republicans is more than enough to pass a resolution in the House, where only a simple majority is needed. \n\n\n\nYet, if a JRD passed in the House and Senate, the president could veto it. A veto override requires a two-thirds majority of both chambers of Congress: 67 senators and 290 representatives. It’s at this stage that Congress almost certainly does not have the votes to override a veto, enabling the United States to return to the deal. A similar situation occurred in 2015, when 25 Democrats voted against the deal but ultimately did not have the numbers to override a potential veto.\n\n\n\nAfter much legislative gnashing of teeth and continued politicization of our Iran policy (echoing 2015), the United States could re-enter the JCPOA. The political pain associated with the process would exact a cost, though. Good politics is corrosive to good policy. The continued polarization of Iran policy in U.S. domestic politics further constrains the U.S. foreign policy toolkit, limiting Washington’s ability to address the underlying problem: how to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon.\n\n\n\nThere can be little doubt now that we’ve arrived at this moment because of decisions made in the last administration — decisions that will reverberate well beyond domestic political considerations. Though a return to the deal is politically unpalatable, it still remains the best option for preventing Iran from building a nuclear weapon in the near term. The “maximum pressure campaign” policy instituted by President Trump following his 2018 withdrawal from the JCPOA failed to drive Iran into making more concessions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt had every opportunity to succeed and was even abetted by chance: the COVID-19 pandemic was a force multiplier that brought Iran economically to a fever-pitch crisis, and through it all, Tehran continued to advance its nuclear program, its ballistic missile and drone development, its support to terrorists and regional proxies, and threats to freedom of navigation in the maritime domain. \n\n\n\nLeaving the JCPOA may have cost us the most precious commodity: time. And now, out of time, out of options, it’s hard to see how we’re better off. Let Congress consider that.\n\n\n\nJonathan Lord is a senior fellow and director of the Middle East Security program at the Center for a New American Security (CNAS).

        "description": "Rep. Andy Barr (R-Ky.) on Sunday said Rep. Liz Cheney's defeat in her Wyoming Republican primary battle against a Trump-backed opponent last week reveals a \"massive disconnect\" between what Americans want and what politicians prioritize while in office.\n\n\n\nBarr told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" moderator Chuck Todd that Republicans are no longer concerned about the 2020 election or what happened on Jan. 6, 2021, which was evident in Cheney's primary results.\n\n\n\n\"These congressional seats do not belong to politicians in Washington,\" Barr said. \"These seats belong to the American people. And there is a massive, massive disconnect between the priorities of politicians in Washington and the concerns of the American people.\"\n\n\n\nCheney (R-Wyo.), who voted to impeach former President Trump and is one of only two Republicans serving on the House select committee probing the Jan. 6, 2021 rioting at the Capitol, was defeat by double-digit percentage points last Tuesday by Harriet Hageman, who has endorsed Trump's false claims that the 2020 election was stolen. \n\n\n\nDespite the loss, Cheney has remained spirited and adamant that her most important job as an elected official has been to highlight Trump's role in the attack on the Capitiol and his false claims the election was stolen. She remains committed to countering Trump's influence in the GOP and is even potentially considering a run for the White House.\n\n\n\nStill, Trump retains a tight grip on the Republican party, with many of his candidates winning primaries this year and a majority of his GOP opponents either retiring or losing key primary battles.\n\n\n\nRepublicans continue to hold a favorable view of Trump while sixty-nine percent of the nation has said the country should move on from the Capitol attack.\n\n\n\nBarr on Sunday said heading into the midterm elections, Republicans are going to pick up seats because they are \"laser focused on what the American people actually care about.\"\n\n\n\n\"They're talking about not being able to afford putting food on the table, putting gas in their trucks, \" he said. \"That's what the American people care about. And politicians who obsess about the past are not in touch with the American people.\"",

        "description": "Dr. Deborah Birx, who served as White House coronavirus response coordinator during the Trump administration, said on Sunday that the fact that early data on the COVID-19 pandemic came from Europe should be an “indictment of our system.”\n\n\n\nDuring an appearance on CBS’s “Face The Nation,” moderator Margaret Brennan noted earlier remarks from Birx that she did not trust the data she received from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) during her tenure, specifically pointing to delays in information regarding the race and ethnicity of COVID fatalities. \n\n\n\n“First and foremost, in March of 2020, all of our data that I used to warn Americans of who was at risk for severe disease, hospitalization, and deaths came from our European colleagues,” Birx replied. “That in itself should be an indictment of our system.”\n\n\n\nBirx also said that her requests to CDC to improve its system and develop partnerships with clinics, hospitals, and laboratories went unheeded. \n\n\n\n“The private sector is willing to help us, you know, they have people working in these communities. They want everyone to do well to thrive and survive,” Birx said. “And so I think we're just not tapping into the system that the United States utilizes for health care delivery and because of that, there's extraordinary delays, and critically, there's incomplete data.” \n\n\n\nBirx’s remarks come after  CDC Director Rochelle Walensky announced last week that the agency plans to overhaul its system, saying that “it didn’t meet expectations” following an internal review of the agency’s shortcomings in its COVID-19 response. \n\n\n\nWhen asked about  on Sunday the latest CDC changes, Birx said that transparency is key for the agency to rebuild its trust with the public. \n\n\n\n“Well, the way you rebuild public trust is be transparent. And I think that's in the report: better data, better accountability, better transparency. But they also have to believe, and this gets to the culture piece, people can understand complicated issues,” Birx said.&nbsp; “It's your job as a public health official.”",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/pixel-watch-google-fi-support",
        "description": "The Pixel Watch is slated to launch in October alongside the Google Pixel 7 series and is expected to be simultaneously met with enthusiasm and skepticism. The Pixel Watch will be the first smartwatch made by Google, sporting the latest and greatest from WearOS, but with a clean Pixel-esque UI and experience. However, it does have a lot to prove, as it has stiff competition with the likes of the Apple Watch and the Samsung Galaxy Watch 5, which have cemented their names in this space.\n\n\n\nSince the official announcement of the Pixel Watch at Google I/O earlier this year, rumors have trickled in regarding its capabilities. Still, there is one, in particular, that may give the Pixel Watch an edge over the competition &#x2014; Google Fi support. This possibility was discovered via an APK teardown of the Google Fi app (v69) completed by 9to5Google.\n\n\n\nIn this teardown, code was found several times referencing &#8220;Rohan,&#8221; which, as you may remember, is the codename Google uses internally for the Pixel Watch. This suggests that Google plans on adding Pixel Watch support to Google Fi, which at the time doesn&#8217;t have support for any smartwatches. Should this become a reality, Google Fi customers could potentially purchase the watch directly from Fi, which I would imagine will come with some perks.\n\n\n\nImage Source: Tony Webster via Flickr\n\n\nGoogle extending support to Google Fi also makes it more likely that the Pixel Watch will also be available from other carriers. For example, I can&#8217;t imagine it being available on Google Fi but not on T-Mobile or AT&amp;T. What remains unknown is whether this support will include the ability to make and receive phone calls without having the phone paired and with you at all times. Luckily, we won&#8217;t have to wait too long to find out, as October is just around the corner. \n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "A pretty calm week, and more or less regular. Next week will be the week where most people will be back after their summer vacationing. That means the pace of things will pick up and the quiet in my inbox will likely end. Next week school also starts and I look forward to the steady rhythm that will create.\nThis week I\n\nStarted using Hypothes.is more to bookmark and annotate things. It takes a bit of getting used to. Annotations automatically end up in my notes, where I can continue to work on them, but it also means I no longer keep a full version of a web article in my notes. Saving them to the Internet Archive and adding a link to it in my notes is therefore more important.\ntook a bit more time to read things, articles and Dan Allosso&#8217;s newly published book on note making. This resulted in several enjoyable sessions of making notes for myself.\nCaught up with latest developments concerning the European dataspaces\nDid some more work on the feedback received by the EC on the EU mandatory open data list, and sent my findings to the EC. Early September the final version should be decided.\nHad the weekly client meetings\nDiscussed the planning for the coming months as well as next year&#8217;s funding proposal with a client&#8217;s client.\nDiscussed forming a ethics committee by all the provinces, and created a plan to get there within the limited time available.\nDiscussed and prepared a training on digital transformation within a provincial organisation\nWent out for dinner with E and Y on Thursday to celebrate the end of school summer break. Monday the new year starts for Y.\nVisited Y&#8217;s new class and met her two new teachers.\nTook Y to her swimming lesson\nAs Y was staying over at her cousin&#8217;s this weekend, E and I had time to ourselves. We visited the wonderful Museum Voorlinden and surrounding grounds, on the edge of The Hague. There was an exhibition of the work of Antony Gormley, which we quite enjoyed. Saturday evening we cycled into town, hung out on a terrace in the late afternoon, had a great dinner in a restaurant we hadn&#8217;t visited before, and after a few drinks sitting at a bar we hadn&#8217;t been to either, cycled back home. This resulted in a slow and somewhat tired Sunday. We went out for coffee to get ourselves moving in the morning.\nmade plans with E to go away the full 6 weeks of school break next summer. By deciding that now, we have plenty time to plan ahead for it. This is reminiscent of how we did month long stays in other European cities in the years before Y was born. Now that Y is a bit older we think it would be fun to do something like that again.\n\nSummer&#8217;s over, time for me to get out of the pool. (Swimming pool is an installation by Argentinian artist Leandro Erlich, which we saw at Voorlinden this weekend. Here I&#8217;m reaching for the ladder.)\nThis is a RSS only posting for regular readers. Not secret, just unlisted. Comments / webmention / pingback all ok.Read more about RSS Club",

        "description": "With heightened tension and eroded trust between the United States and China, it may seem futile to seek new avenues for bilateral cooperation. In such times, it may be even more important to maintain open channels of communication and identify common goals.\n\n\n\nOne area where Washington and Beijing might make common cause is support for African public health systems, in particular the African Union (AU) project to develop an African Medicines Agency (AMA).\n\n\n\nThe African Union adopted a treaty in 2019 to launch the AMA to provide regulatory oversight to facilitate the local production of quality, safe, efficacious and affordable medicines for African citizens.\n\n\n\nDespite U.S.-China competition in Africa, U.S-China cooperation on the African Medicines Agency would not be the first time that great powers in conflict have helped achieve breakthroughs in global health.\n\n\n\nIn 1958, at the height of the Cold War, the Soviet Union called for a global effort to eradicate smallpox. In 1966, the U.S. took up the cause and the U.S. and the Soviet Union — with the support of 58 other member states — cosponsored a resolution at the World Health Organization’s 19th annual assembly, launching the world’s most successful campaign to eradicate a contagious disease.\n\n\n\nThe USSR and U.S. went further, as they successfully exchanged scientific information and constructive critiques in areas outside smallpox. The U.S. surgeon general pointed out flaws in a Soviet overseas vaccine production facility, resulting in Moscow’s robust reformation of its vaccination programs abroad.\n\n\n\nDespite current tensions, the United States and China have enjoyed constructive relations on public health in the past. The U.S. played an important role in helping China set up the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, including collocating specialists from the U.S. CDC within the fledgling Chinese agency.\n\n\n\nBoth countries have invested significantly to support African countries’ efforts to improve their own public health systems. The phenomenally successful U.S. President’s Emergency Program for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) stemmed the HIV pandemic in Africa, and Beijing increasingly refers to its own “Health Silk Road” programs which have mounted hospitals and, more recently, distributed vaccines and other COVID-related materials throughout Africa.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. played a leading role in the establishment of the African Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, now based in Ethiopia. China provided a headquarters building for the agency.\n\n\n\nThe AMA is the logical next step and an AU priority.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. could invite, or challenge, China to join U.S. efforts to support the AMA. The countries could approach the AU together to identify specific projects. Washington and Beijing could commit to help individual African states develop domestic vaccine production capacities so that, come the next pandemic, they are not once again excluded from global health solutions. The U.S. and China could also cosponsor a resolution at the next World Health Assembly session urging other countries to join the endeavor.\n\n\n\nWe should not underestimate the challenges. The U.S. and China have competed in Africa, including on public health. We should not assume China would accept the invitation or that terms of collaboration would easily be agreed. When one of the authors served as U.S. ambassador to Zambia and proposed to his Chinese counterpart collaboration on health projects there, the Chinese ambassador politely declined. And U.S.-China cooperation on Africa CDC has, at times, been problematic.\n\n\n\nMoreover, throughout the COVID-19 pandemic the U.S. and China have openly sparred on public health. China’s obstruction of coronavirus origin investigations eroded international trust of Beijing, while former President Trump’s aggressive name-calling further exacerbated tensions as both countries’ leaders engaged in an ugly publicity battle.\n\n\n\nBut COVID-19 is an urgent reminder of our shared interests in ensuring distant countries can conduct effective surveillance of disease outbreaks and respond with local resources when possible. It is in American and Chinese interests to fortify those capacities, including in Africa where opportunities for improvement abound.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. and China have different but potentially complementary strategies to support African health systems. The U.S. emphasizes technical support; China provides health infrastructure and commodities.\n\n\n\nIf both take a constructive approach, U.S.-China collaboration could improve public health capacity in Africa based on African Union priorities. Constructive U.S.-China collaboration could boost international trust in both countries and bolster U.S. standing on the continent, where it has recently flagged. China might benefit from working with the United States to help make its own public health aid in Africa more responsive to the needs of African countries themselves.\n\n\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken has said that the “United States' relationship with China will be competitive where it should be, collaborative where it can be, adversarial where it must be.”\n\n\n\nTensions between the world’s two largest powers will persist. But collaborative health projects in Africa could build bridges, advance shared goals and strengthen African countries' health systems, ultimately benefitting the safety and security of the entire international community.\n\n\n\nGeorgia Nichols has worked in Senegal to combat trafficking in persons, is a Department of Education African languages fellow, and a master’s degree candidate in international affairs&nbsp;at the&nbsp;Frederick S.&nbsp;Pardee School of&nbsp;Global Studies at Boston University.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMark C. Storella is professor of the practice of diplomacy and director of the African Studies Center at the Frederick S. Pardee School of Global Studies at Boston University. Storella is a former U.S. ambassador to Zambia, serving as a U.S. diplomat for three decades.",

Just two percent more, or 36 percent, said they think things will get better in that same time period, and 21 percent said they think things will stay the same.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s approval rating in this poll ticked up to 42 percent, and 48 percent of voters reported having “somewhat negative” or “very negative” feelings toward the president. \n\n\n\nThe approval rating is steady since a similar NBC News poll was conducted in May, though Biden’s disapproval rating has climbed one point, from 54 to 55 percent.\n\n\n\nLast week, the president signed a $740 billion healthcare and climate change bill into law, marking a key legislative win for his party ahead of this year’s midterms.\n\n\n\nThe Inflation Reduction Act was a scaled-down version of the Build Back Better bill that never came for a vote last year but the bill still aims to address climate change, lower healthcare costs for Americans and tamp down inflation.\n\n\n\nForty-two percent of voters in the NBC News poll said the legislation was a good idea, compared with 31 percent who said it was a bad idea. Just over a quarter reported they had no opinion.\n\n\n\nA plurality of voters, or 36 percent, reported thinking the legislation would not make a difference in their lives, while 35 reported thinking it would make things worse for them personally. Just 26 percent reported thinking the legislation would make things better for them personally.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConducted Aug. 12-16, the NBC News poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percent.",

        "description": "CNN's Brian Stelter championed media criticism during his closing remarks on the final episode of his program “Reliable Sources,” saying on Sunday “sorting out treasure from the trash” is crucial. \n\n\n\nDuring his final sign-off on the show, Stelter noted the importance of holding the media accountable, citing the need for more “criticism, debate, and discussion.”  \n\n\n\n“We need to have room for media criticism and debate and discussion and we will, so much of the media ecosystem in 2022 is garbage but so much of it is spectacular,” Stelter said. “The hard part's sorting out the treasure from the trash.” \n\n\n\nStelter also said that it “was a gift of a lifetime” to confront those issues within the media, adding that it is a “patriotic” duty. \n\n\n\n“Here's what I do know, I know it's not partisan, to stand up for decency, and democracy and dialogue. It's not partisan, to stand up to demagogues. It's required, it's patriotic, we must make sure that we don't give a platform to those who are lying to our faces,” Stelter said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“But we also must make sure we are representing the full spectrum of debate and representing what's going on in this country and in this world.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHis parting remarks came after the news of CNN’s cancelation of the 30-year-old news media program and Stelter's departure from the network. \n\n\n\nStelter, who served as chief media correspondent for The New York Times, was the host of \"Reliable Sources\" for the last eight years. He was one of the prominent network personalities to push back against the Trump administration and conservative news media. \n\n\n\nStelter on Sunday also called on viewers to continue to hold media outlets accountable. \n\n\n\n“But it's got to be on you to hold CNN accountable, not just CNN. You got to hold your local paper accountable. You got to hold your local digital outlet accountable. It's on all of us. We are all members of the media, all helping to make it better,” Stelter concluded. “That's what I believe.”",

Sixteen percent thought Trump was only somewhat to blame, and 33 percent thought he was “not really responsible” for the incident.\n\n\n\nOver half of voters reported having “somewhat negative” or “very negative” feelings toward the former president at 54 percent. Just under half of voters reported having negative feelings toward the Republican Party in general, or 49 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nForty-two percent of voters expressed they had “a great deal” or “a fair amount” of faith that the House select committee is conducting a fair and impartial probe. Thirteen percent reported “only some” confidence, 41 percent reported “very little” and 4 percent reported none.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConducted Aug. 12-16, shortly after the Mar-a-Lago search, the poll surveyed 1,000 registered voters. The margin of error is plus or minus 3.1 percent.",

Der Gedanke mag zwar verwegen sein, wirklich neu ist er nicht. Denn seit 2018 versucht Shiffman die Zeit zu finden, eine Neuinterpretation dieses Buches nach P5.js zu schreiben und inspiriert davon und parallel dazu habe ich mich auch schon an diversen Python-Ports versucht (zum Beispiel nach Processing.py, der Python Arcade-Bibliothek, Pygame Zero oder TigerJython).",

        "description": "The Giants have claimed catcher Patrick Mazeika off waivers from the Mets, tweets Maria I. Guardado of MLB.com. The Mets had designated him for assignment a few days ago. To open a spot for Mazeika on the 40-man roster, infielder Donovan Walton has been recalled from Triple-A Sacramento and placed on the 60-day injured list due to right shoulder inflammation.\nMazeika, 28, was drafted by the Mets and has spent his entire career with the organization until now. He made his MLB debut last year and has gotten into 61 games between 2021 and 2022. He&#8217;s hit just .190/.236/.279 in that time but has much better numbers in the minors. In Triple-A this year, he&#8217;s hit .261/.383/.333 for a wRC+ of 105.\nThe Giants thinned out their catching depth by trading Curt Casali to the Mariners at the deadline. Joey Bart and Austin Wynns are with the big league club, while Yermin Mercedes and Ford Proctor are in the minors, though those latter two also play other positions and are only part-time catchers. Mazeika is also capable of playing some first base, meaning the Giants now have a collection of versatile depth catching options jockeying for playing time.\nAs for Walton, he was acquired from the Mariners in a May trade, with the Giants optioning him to the minors and recalling him multiple times this year. He was in the minors when injured but has been called up in order to be transferred to the 60-day injured list. This means he will no longer occupy a spot on the 40-man roster, but he will earn major league pay and service time for as long as he&#8217;s there.",

        "description": "Today's links\n\nWorkplace surveillance is coming for you: Empricism-washing as a form of wage-theft.\n\nHey look at this: Delights to delectate.\n\nThis day in history: 2002, 2012\n\nColophon: Recent publications, upcoming/recent appearances, current writing projects, current reading\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWorkplace surveillance is coming for you (permalink)\nIf you want to do something terrible with technology, you can't just roll it out on people with money and social capital. They'll complain and your idea will tank. Successful shitty tech rollouts start with people you can abuse with impunity (prisoners, kids, migrants, etc) and then work their way up the privilege gradient. I call it the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve.\nThe point of the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve is to normalize technological oppression, one group at a time. 20 years ago, if you were eating your dinner under the unblinking eye of a video-camera, it was because you were in a supermax prison. Now, thanks to \"luxury surveillance,\" you can get the same experience in your middle-class home with your Google, Apple or Amazon \"smart\" camera. Those cameras climbed the curve, going from prisons to schools to workplaces to homes.\nThe pandemic was a great accellerant for late-stage capitalism, converting our homes to rent-free annexes of our employers' facilities, and turning \"work from home\" into \"live at work.\" Bossware, a fringe technological category, experienced a massive boom, rocketing up the privilege gradient.\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/02/24/gwb-rumsfeld-monsters/#bossware\nFor most of its history, bossware was used to police the most marginalized, oppressed workers, like the mostly Black, mostly female workforce at Arise, a company that charges workers for their own training and then fines them if they quit.\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/01/22/paperback-writer/#toothless\nBut when lockdown turned high-status white collar workers into home-workers, their bosses rolled out incredibly invasive spyware, including tools that watched them through their cameras, listened to their microphones, logged their keystrokes, scoured their hard-drives and read their text messages.\nThis was the second coming of Taylorism, AKA \"scientific management,\" an early 20th Century pseudoscience practiced by high-priced, unaccountable consultants who would fan out on factory floors in literal science cosplay, including lab-coats and clipboards, and loom over workers, watching their every movement, often going so far as to film them.\nThen the consultants would go back to their workplace, soup the negatives, and produce completely arbitrary workplace rules about how workers must stand, hold their limbs and heads, and move &#8211; it was a kind of corporate anti-yoga whose asanas were designed to make workers look productive to their bosses, who often had no idea how to perform or evaluate their jobs.\nThe pandemic's new Taylorists do not confine themselves to the factory floor. Thanks to digital tools, they can come right into your home, and they can take high-frequency measurements of unimportant things in great detail, and then produce scores that your boss can use to decide whether and how much to pay you.\nBossware is the subject of an excellent New York Times feature by Jodi Kantor, Arya Sundaram, Aliza Aufrichtig and Rumsey Taylor, which documents the ways that \"Worker Productivity Scores\" undermine the workers' ability to perform their jobs, while also allowing their bosses to steal their wages:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2022/08/14/business/worker-productivity-tracking.html\nTheir case-studies are a trip up the Shitty Tech Adoption Curve, and includes $200/hour finance exec Carol Kraemer, who discovered that her boss was tracking her time in 10-minute increments and docking her pay for stretches where she took her fingers off her keyboard &#8211; to think, say, or make notes with pen and paper.\nKraemer discovered that the only way to avoid wage-theft was to do \"mindless busywork\" that produced the clicks that her bossware demanded, even if it got in the way of her work. This is yet more proof that \"you treasure what you measure,\" or, more formally, \"any target becomes a measurement\" (AKA Goodhart's Law).\nThe decline of worker productivity in pursuit of metrics is an inescapable failure mode of bossware. In 2020, I reported on a reader's experience working in an engineering shop where her boss evaluated her performance based on the number of trouble-tickets she closed, turning her into \"a ticket-closing machine.\"\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2020/07/08/absolutely-remarkable-thing/#goodhartism\nBeing an engineer, this worker applied herself to the problem in a methodical fashion, and realized that she could juke her stats by closing tickets prematurely by marking them \"did not respond\" &#8211; and also that she could close and re-open the same tickets over and over, racking up points.\nShe closed by saying, \"Your execs should fucking well know this: how would THEY like to be evaluated based on, like, how many emails they send in a day? Do they believe that would be good for the business? Or would they object that they are tasked with the holistic success of the org, and that their roles are too complex to reduce to a set of metrics without context?\"\nThe irony, of course, is that bossware is now coming for execs, and, what's more, they lack the engineering skills to optimize their work so they can get a high score and do the job, so they have to settle for just getting the score &#8211; and hang the job itself.\nIn the NYT story, the authors profile a wide range of people who are deliberately doing a worse job in order to get higher scores, including a group of hospice chaplains who are given points based on their work with dying patients and their families, scored in a way that is utterly disconnected from providing compassionate care.\nActivities are scored based on their priority to management, without regard to the comfort they provide: 0.25 points for a phone call with a grieving relation; one point for a visit with a dying patient, 1.75 points for presiding over a funeral.\nChaplains' ability to accumulate points was undermined by patients &#8211; who would take longer than anticipated to draw their final breaths, or break down in tears, or cancel appointments as they made their peace with their impending deaths. To maintain their wages, chaplains resorted to \"spirtual care drive-bys\" &#8211; like sticking their head in a room where a patient was unconscious, exchanging a brief word with a nurse, and marking it down as a \"patient visit.\"\nHealthcare offers a fascinating window into the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve, as doctors' and nurses' work has been transformed by the electronic health record and its relationship to billing &#8211; so that now these high-paid, high-demand, high-skill professionals have to organize their work around data-entry on a system designed without their input and without regard to their priorities.\nThe Times reporters dig into the social workers, therapists and addiction counselors at Unitedhealth, a private-equity-backed healthcare monopoly. They get marked as \"idle\" if they stop typing to talk with their patients. If those conversations go on too long, they are marked as \"derelict\" and risk employment sanctions.\nSocial workers with masters' degrees are compensated based on the number of keystrokes they generate on the job. For Unitedhealth admin workers who work from home, glitches in the system can imperil their jobs, for example, if the system hangs when you log out for the day, it can mark you as \"idle\" all night, killing your average score. Workers facing these problems are advised by their managers to jiggle their mouses periodically to keep the division's score from falling.\nOne of the most interesting part of the Times feature is the work it does profiling the pseudoscientists who created and marketed this junk software. There's Federico Mazzoli, co-creator of Worksmart, who explained the benefits of his product: \"Once you see those metrics, those insights, something changes: You realize how much you waste doing nothing, or just multitasking and not accomplishing stuff.\"\nMazzoli seems to have either not used his product, or, if he did, did so under conditions where he was in charge of it &#8211; using it the way an athlete might use a stopwatch to time their own sprints, and not the way a boss might: to decide whether to dock your pay or fire you.\nThis inability to understand the difference between using a technology and having the same technology used against you is endemic to the industry. Take Crossover, which bills itself as \"the Fitbit of productivity,\" but whose customers rhapsodize about the producing giving them \"powers of near X-ray vision.\" The point of a Fitbit is to help you improve something that matters to you &#8211; but Crossover's customers want to use it to punish other people for failing to follow orders. It's the difference between a Fitbit and a prisoner-tracking cuff &#8211; which make crossover \"the ankle-braclet of productivity.\"\nIronically, the Times reports that Crossover's own employees so resented the company's intrusive monitoring of them (as they created and sold intrusive monitoring tools) that Crossover hemorrhaged employees and struggled to hire replacements. Eventually, Crossover had to turn off its most intrusive features so that it could keep the employees needed to make and sell its bossware product.\nOne major focus of \"productivity trackers\" is measuring bathroom breaks and punishing workers for pissing. Piss-tracking tools are another shitty technology that has been racing up the privilege gradient, making the leap to white-collar workers after being imposed on blue-collar workers, like the Amazon warehouse workers and drivers who have to piss in bottles to satisfy their bossware:\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/03/19/the-shakedown/#weird-flex\nThe next step on the gradient was students &#8211; children have slightly more privilege than nonunion blue-collar workers, it seems &#8211; with 1,000+ US handing public money to E-hallpass, a company that tracks children's urination:\nhttps://www.vice.com/en/article/dy73n7/ehallpass-1000-thousand-schools-monitor-bathroom\nAs the metaphor of corporate personhood has become more and more concrete (for example, through the Supreme Court's Citizen's United decision, which ruled that limits on corporate political spending violated their corporate persons' free speech rights) many have pondered the question, \"What sort of person is a corporation?\"\nThe 2003 documentary \"The Corporation\" investigated this, declaring the if corporations are people, they are psychopaths &#8211; remorseless and totally lacking in empathy. Science fiction writers have claimed that corporations are \"slow AIs\" (Charlie Stross), or Skynet (Ted Chiang) or immortal colony organisms that use humans as gut flora (me):\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2021/10/12/no-criminals-no-crimes/#get-out-of-jail-free-card\nBut the rise and rise of bossware implies another personality archetype for the corporation: the abusive alcoholic dad, whose own life is spinning out of control and who finds comfort by seeking to control the lives of others in humiliating ways that ultimately leads to his own destruction.\nBecause bossware doesn't just radically reduce productivity by shifting the point of work from getting the job done to getting the boxes ticked &#8211; it also exposes the businesses who use it to existential risks. Take Office 365, the cloud-based word processing/spreadsheet/email system from convicted monopolist Microsoft.\nOffice 365 went from being an online version of Microsoft Office to being a bossware delivery-system. The Office 365 sales-pitch focuses on fine-grained employee tracking and comparison, so bosses can rank their workers' performance against each other. But beyond this automated gladitorial keystroke combat, Offce 365's analytics will tell you how your company performs against other companies.\nThat's right &#8211; Microsoft will spy on your competitors and sell you access to their metrics. It's wild, but purchasing managers who hear this pitch seem completely oblivious to the implication of this: that Microsoft will also spy on you and deliver your metrics to your competitors.\nhttps://pluralistic.net/2020/11/25/the-peoples-amazon/#clippys-revenge\nEven wilder is the further implication: that Microsoft might use the data its product gathers on your business &#8211; every keystroke made by every worker in the entire company! &#8211; to compete with you.\nA century ago, \"scientific management experts\" tricked bosses out of fat consulting fees by promising to turn managers' preference for \"a smartly turned out workforce\" into a scientific best-practice. This is pure empiricism-washing, where an irrational bias is encoded in mathematics and declared to be scientific truth.\nBossware companies target employers' insecurity about their workers' power to actually undermine the employers' businesses, transforming productive workers into efficient metric-satisfiers, while raiding the company for valuable market-intelligence.\nThe bossware problem is a boss problem, in other words. It follows that fixing the bossware problem is the workers' job, and indeed, the Times feature notes that Amazon has been dismantling its bossware surveillance in a bid to reduce its workers' support for unionization, which promises to ban bossware from Amazon workplaces.\nBosses deride unions as reducing \"freedom\" &#8211; but just the threat of unions delivers more freedom to workers than any right-to-work law ever could. Bossware-infected jobsites are Stalinist dystopias, where workers are punished for looking in the wrong direction or failing to hit the keys fast enough, irrespective of whether they're getting the job done.\nBack in 2019, I wrote about this in \"Affordances,\" a short story for Slate Future Tense, which set out to explore how the Shitty Technology Adoption Curve may start with the most downtrodden and immiserated among us &#8211; but how, left unchecked, it will come for each and every one of us:\nhttps://slate.com/technology/2019/10/affordances-cory-doctorow-sf-story-algorithmic-bias-facial-recognition.html\n(Image: Cryteria, CC BY 3.0; Scottish Government, CC BY 2.0, modified)\n\n\nHey look at this (permalink)\n\n\nTurns Out, You Own Nothing https://www.wired.com/story/plaintext-turns-out-you-own-nothing/\n\n\nRŏ̽ta: Sticking some nixie tubes on a rotary phone dial https://hackaday.io/project/186093-rota (h/t Hackaday)\n\n\n\n\n\nThis day in history (permalink)\n#20yrsago Is connectivity a business or a calling? https://web.archive.org/web/20021012082847/http://werbach.com/blog/2002/08/21.html\n#10yrsago How to talk about technology in education without losing your mind to fear https://dangerouslyirrelevant.org/2012/08/26-internet-safety-talking-points.html\n#10yrsago Women in atheism: a tour through history https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BLcczzkfPow\n#10yrsago Password cracking goes into hyperdrive https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2012/08/passwords-under-assault/\n#5yrsago RIP, science fiction legend Brian W Aldiss https://web.archive.org/web/20170821121322/https://www.curtisbrown.co.uk/news/announcement-of-the-death-of-brian-aldiss-obe\n#1yrago Bubble: Fantastic graphic novel adaptation of the brilliant comedy/sf podcast https://pluralistic.net/2021/08/21/podcasting-as-a-visual-medium/#huntr\n\n\n\nColophon (permalink)\nToday's top sources: Naked Capitalism (https://www.nakedcapitalism.com/).\nCurrently writing:\n\nThe Bezzle, a Martin Hench noir thriller novel about the prison-tech industry.

        "description": "This week, Nvidia began to roll out its 1440p streaming option for its GeForce NOW cloud gaming service. This new streaming quality option is available directly through your web browser via Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge on Windows PCs.\n\n\n\nBeing advertised on its official blog as a back-to-school effort, Nvidia is encouraging students to play AAA games directly through the web on their study breaks. In addition to the 1440p resolution, you can also enable 120 fps by going to &#8220;Settings&#8221;, and then &#8220;Custom&#8221; on the streaming quality section.\n\n\n\nSource: Nvidia Blog\n\n\n\nIn order to benefit from both of these great updates, you&#8217;ll need to be subscribed to the premium tier of GeForce NOW which also has RTX 2080 enabled. Once you&#8217;ve done this, you can start playing with one click. The service has over 1,300 titles, including the ever-popular Genshin Impact, and instead of buying them directly from Nvidia, you simply connect your Epic Games and Steam libraries to &#8220;claim&#8221; games you&#8217;ve already paid for through those other services.\n\n\n\nSix new games have also launched on the platform, and you can find them below:\n\n\n\nThymesia&nbsp;(New release on&nbsp;Steam, Aug. 18)Century: Age of Ashes&nbsp;(Steam)Clanfolk&nbsp;(Steam)Coromon&nbsp;(Steam)HYPERCHARGE: Unboxed&nbsp;(Steam)Phoenix Point&nbsp;(Epic Games Store)\n\n\n\nThe only bad thing about these wonderful updates is that anyone attempting to play GeForce NOW on ChromeOS is out of luck. For some reason, Chromebooks are capped at a 1080p resolution, much like streaming apps remain to date on Google&#8217;s operating system. Do you subscribe to gain RTX support and higher resolutions and frame rates, or are you using the service at no cost to play around with cloud gaming?\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. — The prosecution spent three weeks telling jurors how Nikolas Cruz murdered 14 students and three staff members at a Florida high school four years ago. Now his attorneys will get their chance to present why they believe he did it, hoping to get him sentenced to life without parole instead of death.\nMelisa McNeill, Cruz’s lead public defender, is expected to give her opening statement Monday, having deferred its presentation from the start of the trial a month ago.\nShe and her team will then begin laying out their 23-year-old client’s life history: his birth mother’s abuse of alcohol and cocaine during her pregnancy, leading to possible fetal alcohol syndrome; his severe mental and emotional problems; his alleged sexual abuse by a “trusted peer;” the bullying he endured; and his adoptive father’s death when he was 5 and his adoptive mother’s four months before his Feb. 14, 2018, attack at Parkland’s Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School.\n \n\nMcNeill’s decision to delay her opening statement appeared part of a broader strategy to not deny or lessen anything prosecutors told jurors about Cruz’s massacre — he pleaded guilty in October to 17 counts of first-degree murder. This trial is only to decide his sentence; the seven-man, five woman jury will consider whether the prosecution’s aggravating circumstances “outweigh” the defense’s mitigating factors.\nThe defense is “going to say, ‘Look, you saw what happened — we are not going to argue that. It was horrible, that was awful, that was horrific, whatever adjectives you want to use,” said David S. Weinstein, a Miami defense attorney and former prosecutor. But then the defense will add: “He never had a chance and, because of that, his poor victims never had a chance.’”\nThis is the deadliest U.S. mass shooting to ever reach trial. Nine other gunmen who killed at least 17 people died during or immediately after their shootings, either by suicide or police gunfire. The suspect in the 2019 slaying of 23 people at a Walmart in El Paso, Texas, is awaiting trial.\nDuring the prosecution’s case, McNeill’s team never cross-examined any teacher or student who witnessed the slayings and only had brief, mild exchanges with a few other witnesses.\nThey asked one teacher from a classroom where no one was shot about the lack of a security monitor in the three-story building where the slayings happened. When the gun store owner who sold Cruz the AR-15-style semiautomatic rifle used in the killings testified, they asked what Florida’s minimum age was in 2017 to buy a rifle — 18 — and today — 21.\nNeither they nor the prosecutors then asked the store owner why the law was changed: Cruz was 19 when the shooting happened and the Republican-led Legislature raised the age limit as part of a larger package of gun laws enacted in response to the shootings.\nCruz’s youth will be part of his defense and while Circuit Judge Elizabeth Scherer has barred the defense from presenting testimony that directly casts blame on third parties like school administrators for not preventing the shooting, McNeill and her team will likely try to indirectly make such points.\nTo get Cruz a life sentence, the defense will only have to persuade one of the 12 jurors, but they will have to do it on all 17 counts, one for each victim. It is possible, for example, a reluctant juror might be pushed to vote for death on victims who surveillance video showed Cruz shot multiple times as they lay wounded and helpless.\nThe defense will be trying to overcome the horrendous evidence that was laid out by the prosecution, capped by the jurors’ Aug. 4 visit to the fenced-off building that Cruz stalked for seven minutes, firing about 150 shots down halls and into classrooms. The jurors saw dried blood on floors and walls, bullet holes in doors and windows and remnants of Valentine’s Day balloons, flowers and cards.\nProsecutors also presented graphic surveillance videos of the massacre; gruesome crime scene and autopsy photos from its aftermath; emotional testimony from teachers and students who witnessed others die; and four days of tearful and angry statements from parents, spouses and other family members about the victims and how their loved one’s death affected their lives. Jurors also watched video of Cruz calmly ordering a cherry and blue raspberry Icee minutes after the shooting and, nine months later, attacking a jail guard.\nIt is unknown how long the defense presentation will take, but they said in court recently that it will last past Labor Day in two weeks. The prosecution will then get to present a rebuttal case before it goes to the jury.",

        "description": "Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) on Sunday avoided a question about whether he would seek to become the next House Speaker if California Democrat Nancy Pelosi steps down from the post.\n\n\n\nInstead, Schiff said he was focused on ensuring Democrats win the midterm elections and retain control of the House.\n\n\n\n\"The Speaker has been truly the most impressive and credible and productive Speaker in our history. So I hope that she will stay,\" Schiff told host Jake Tapper on CNN's \"State of the Union.\"\n\n\n\n\"If she makes the decision not to stay, right now, all I'm focused on is making sure that we are successful in this midterm, that we have a majority to pick the next Speaker.\"\n\n\n\nSchiff, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, is one of several Democrats thought to be in the mix to replace Pelosi, who has promised that this current session would be her last with the Speaker's gavel. \n\n\n\nAccording to the research group OpenSecrets, Schiff has far outraised other potential contenders for Speaker, including Reps. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer (D-Md.) and House Majority Whip James Clyburn (D-S.C.). \n\n\n\nSchiff has raised more than $15 million this midterm cycle, while the closest Speaker hopeful, Jeffries, has raised around $4 million.\n\n\n\nHowever, Democrats are widely expected to lose control of the House in November's midterm elections, given economic anxiety and historical headwinds facing the president's party. \n\n\n\nPelosi, who was first chosen as Speaker in 2007, faced a revolt from first-term Democrats and progressives following the 2018 election. To secure their support, she vowed to serve a maximum of two more terms as Speaker before giving up the gavel.\n\n\n\nAs chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Schiff has shared a spot in the limelight amid Democratic efforts to take on former President Trump. \n\n\n\nHe led investigations into the Trump campaign's connections to Russia's interference in the 2016 election and into the former president's 2019 phone call to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, whom Trump asked to help dig up dirt on President Biden ahead of the 2020 election.\n\n\n\nSchiff also serves on the House committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, which held a series of high-profile hearings this summer.\n\n\n\nBut some Democrats told The Hill earlier this year that those vying for Speaker, including Clyburn and Hoyer, are not likely to give up without a fight. That could set the stage for some messy infighting if Democrats keep control of the lower chamber in November or retake control in 2024.",

        "description": "“A federal appeals court on Sunday temporarily paused a district court&#8217;s order requiring that Sen. Lindsey Graham appear before a grand jury probing plots to illegally influence the 2020 election results in Georgia,” CNN reports.\n\n\n\nThe Washington Post reports Graham had formally appealed a judge’s order requiring him to testify Tuesday, saying doing so would cause “irreparable harm” that would be “in contravention of his constitutional immunity.”\n\n\n\n“The legal maneuvering is the latest sign of tension between prosecutors and high-profile witnesses in the Fulton County district attorney’s expansive criminal probe of alleged election interference by former president Donald Trump and his allies. After seeking repeated delays, Rudy Giuliani, Trump’s former lawyer, testified for six hours last week.”",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/how-to-google-photos-camouflage",
        "description": "Google debuted &#8220;Camouflage,&#8221; a Google Photos companion feature to Magic Eraser which helps get rid of distracting objects by applying a muted color instead of completely erasing it, with the launch of the Pixel 6a. Luckily, the feature eventually made its way to the Pixel 6 and Pixel 6 Pro, completing its support of the Pixel 6 trifecta.\n\n\n\nThe effects of applying this feature can vary depending on what&#8217;s on the photo and can be very subtle. However, if you have photos in your library that could use a little spiffing up, and you own a Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, or a Pixel 6a, this is how you can give it a try:\n\n\n\nUsing &#8220;Camouflage&#8221; on your Pixel 6, Pixel 6 Pro, or Pixel 6a\n\n\n\nOnce you have identified in Google Photos the picture you want to edit, open it up to reveal the menu on the bottom. From the menu options, select &#8220;Edit,&#8221; then &#8220;Tools.&#8221; You should then see two options, &#8220;Blur&#8221; and &#8220;Magic eraser.&#8221; Choose Magic eraser, and you will again see two options in this sub-menu, &#8220;Erase&#8221; and &#8220;Camouflage.&#8221; Select Camouflage to continue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepending on your image, you may get an automatic suggestion on objects you can camouflage in your photo, but you can select the exact object you want instead. Use your finger to draw over the object you want. In the below example, I&#8217;m selecting the Baby Yoda on the blanket, and the system is suggesting that I camouflage the curtain in the back.\n\n\n\nGoogle Photos will camouflage anything you draw over automatically, without any further selections from you. However, if you want to also get rid of the objects the system is suggesting, you will need to tap on &#8220;Camouflage all.&#8221; Once you&#8217;ve done that, go ahead and tap on &#8220;Done,&#8221; then &#8220;Save copy.&#8221; In my example below, you can see that Baby Yoda was given a blueish color to blend better into the blanket, and the curtain has been changed into a gray color, so it&#8217;s not as noticeable in the background.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI just want the steps!\n&#x200B;\n   Open your desired photo in Google Photos.\n   From the bottom menu, select Edit &gt; Tools.\n   Select Magic Eraser.\n   Select Camouflage.\n   Use your finger to draw over the object you want or to add to any system suggestions.\n   Select Done, then Save copy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "J McNeil p129\n\n\n\nAn interesting paragraph in a book I am reading at the moment (Lurking, by Joanne McNeil). We are used to talking about learners as lurkers, but here&#8217;s another perspective. What images do we invoke when we think about the researcher as lurker?\n\n\n\nThe picture of researcher as outsider &#8211; as a profiteer swooping in to steal content and to cherry pick meaning to fit their own agenda &#8211; was one that gave me pause during my own PhD (I am sure some of you remember the story of the &#8216;researchers&#8217; who came across a Google Doc that some of us were using to start writing a journal article and used it in a conference presentation without asking or attributing &#8211; the affront we felt at that unethical behaviour has stayed with me). I chose participatory research as my methodology, and ultimately ended up writing an autoethnography because I wanted to try to allow my community to have a voice in what I was doing, and to make it clear that what I was saying was my own interpretation. \n\n\n\nOf course Twitter is public, and the ToS make it clear that researchers are permitted to use tweets without attribution, but imo that is not the full story &#8211; there are also ethical considerations (I say some things about this in my PhD thesis if anyone is interested). \n\n\n\nI&#8217;m not sure where I am going with this yet &#8211; as always I am writing to find out what I am thinking.",

        "description": "Summerhall, EdinburghDancer Jo Fong larks about with clown and circus director George Orange in a manic affront to middle age that swings from absurd to tender to life-affirming Bounding into the fringe’s 10.15am slot, Jo Fong brings the manic euphoria you need in place of a morning coffee. Fong is a dancer who performed with the likes of Rosas and DV8 in her youth, and is here partnered with clown and circus director George Orange. Fong is warm, sarky and no nonsense, like your favourite secondary school teacher; Orange is just adorably silly – a ridiculous skit on ballet star Sergei Polunin’s Take Me to Church video sets the tone.The Rest of Our Lives is an hour of the two fiftysomethings facing up to middle age with a string of observations, actions and questions: Will I be remembered? Will it hurt? “The struggle is real”, it says on the wall, as they wrestle with a pair of chairs. There’s a choice soundtrack, from Booker T and the MGs to Leonard Cohen, and they let the music do a lot of the work: the simple act of Orange passing his body through the frame of a chair is given pathos by a Purcell aria; the genius moment when Rage Against the Machine plays and, at the “Fuck you, I won’t do what you tell me” chorus, they silently eye each audience member in turn, in amused defiance.The Rest of Our Lives is at Summerhall, Edinburgh, until 28 August.All our Edinburgh festival reviews.

        "description": "Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) said on Sunday that he would welcome President Biden joining him on the campaign trail as he looks to retain his seat against Trump-backed challenger Blake Masters.\n\n\n\nDuring an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” moderator Jake Tapper asked Kelly if he would like Biden to campaign in Arizona for him. \n\n\n\n“Hey, I will welcome anybody to come to Arizona, travel around the state at any time — as long as I'm here, if I'm not up in Washington in session — and talk about what Arizona needs,” Kelly replied, noting the importance of issues going on in his state. \n\n\n\nKelly, a former NASA astronaut and husband to former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), is facing Masters, a close associate of tech investor and GOP mega donor Peter Thiel, in November's midterm election. \n\n\n\nTapper asked Kelly if there’s concern about Biden being the best candidate for Democrats in the 2024 presidential election, to which Kelly replied “Not at all, Jake.” \n\n\n\nA Fox News poll published last week showed that Kelly has an eight-point lead over Kelly in their Senate race, as 50 percent of respondents backed Kelly, compared to 42 percent for Masters. \n\n\n\nA number of vulnerable Democrats have kept an arms length from Biden, who continues to have low approval ratings amid soaring inflation and economic anxiety. \n\n\n\nKelly also told Tapper that members of his state’s GOP party have “dangerous ideas,” adding that Republican senators currently in office \"are good, good people, by and large, who are working really hard.\"",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/national-security/3609219-when-hell-freezes-over-russias-arctic-ambitions/",
        "description": "In 2008, Russian President Vladimir Putin honored a scientist who piloted a small submersible to the Arctic seabed in 2007, planted a titanium version of the Russian flag then claimed “The Arctic is Russian.”\n\n\n\nThe frozen Arctic Ocean, half the size of the United States, had been mostly ignored, but militarization by Putin ensued and, in combination with Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, convinced Sweden and Finland to join NATO. Now seven of the world’s eight Arctic nations are members of NATO, and Washington has increased surveillance and defense systems in Canada and Alaska to protect the northern perimeter of North America from encroachments and missiles. Putin wants the Arctic.\n\n\n\nThe contest underway at the top of the world is about hegemony over trade as well as resources. Russia’s “Arctic Silk Road,” called the Northern Sea Route, is designed to provide a shipping link between Europe and Asia, allowing ships to bypass the Suez and Panama Canals.\n\n\n\nAlready, portions of Russia’s Sea Route, which hugs the Siberian coastline, are ice-free in the summer. A Northwest Passage through Canada’s Arctic Archipelago and along Alaska’s coast is not viable or developed.\n\n\n\nCanada’s north is empty, and its government has blocked development of its massive Arctic oil and gas reserves discovered in the 1980s. By contrast, Russia’s Siberian coastline is populated with settlements, a floating nuclear reactor to power industries and navigational, search and rescue and icebreaking capability. The route could shave 20 days off the Europe-China journey and bypasses the Suez or Panama Canals. But only 86 transits occurred in 2021, and it’s years away from viability.\n\n\n\nBut Russia has militarized the region, building as many as 50 defensive outposts from the Barents Sea to territories near Alaska. The Kola Peninsula, for instance, Russian land abutting Finland and Norway, is the most “nuclearized” place on the planet. The headquarters for Russia’s Northern Fleet are there, with two-thirds of Russia’s second-strike maritime nuclear capabilities.\n\n\n\nAt the other end of its Arctic coastline are one-third of Russia’s nuclear-equipped warships and subs in Vladivostok, with a base near Alaska.\n\n\n\nIn 2019, then-Secretary of State Mike Pompeo put Russia on notice, and in 2021 the U.S. took over surveillance from Canada to monitor the northern region under NORAD, the North American Aerospace Defense Command. Canada’s navy is smaller than Norway’s and has no polar icebreakers operable in the Arctic.\n\n\n\nBy contrast, America now has 12,000 troops in its Arctic airborne division in Alaska and conducts Arctic maneuvers with Nordic nations, Great Britain and other Arctic Council members.\n\n\n\nThe Pentagon now has more advanced fighter jets in Alaska than in any other location in the world. Six new icebreaker ships are being built, and a proposed northern satellite and radar monitoring security system will stretch from Alaska to Europe.\n\n\n\nBut Russia’s costly war with NATO over Ukraine will impede its Arctic ambitions as capital, expertise and technology disappear as a result of Western sanctions. The Arctic Council was formed in 1991 as a high-level intergovernmental forum comprised of eight nations with frontage on the Arctic Ocean. These nations convene regularly to address issues faced by their governments and the indigenous people of the Arctic involving the environment, resource extraction, shipping and sovereignty claims. The eight are Canada, Denmark (Greenland), Finland, Iceland, Norway, Russia, Sweden and the United States.\n\n\n\nRussia is currently chair of the council, but on March 3, 2022, the other seven declared that they would not attend meetings inside Russia because of its invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\n\nOver the 20 years of the council’s existence, Moscow has made outrageous land claims and embarked on aggressive oil exploration in the region, encroaching regularly on territory owned by Canada and others. Moscow maintains that its undersea continental shelf extends beneath most of the Arctic Ocean. (Such submissions are made to a United Nations agency, which corroborates evidence, but settlements must be reached between disputing nation-states and rarely happens.)\n\n\n\nEqually absurd was a recent demand by a Russian politician that Russia should take Alaska in retaliation for American sanctions. That will happen when hell freezes over.\n\n\n\nDiane Francis is a non-resident senior fellow in the Eurasia Center at the Atlantic Council.

        "description": "The New York Department of Health reported its first pediatric monkeypox case as nationwide numbers continue to climb.\n\n\n\nAn updated weekly summary from the department notes one case for a person under age 18 as of Aug. 17, out of 192 total cases in New York State, excluding New York City. \n\n\n\nNew York City has not reported any pediatric monkeypox cases, per data updated Aug. 19.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe latest Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data show 14,115 total confirmed monkeypox cases nationwide. New York is reporting the highest case count of any state, with 2,744 confirmed cases, followed closely by California, with 2,663 cases.\n\n\n\nThe CDC underscores that the risk posed by monkeypox to children is low, but the new case in New York adds to a growing number of pediatric cases nationwide. \n\n\n\nThe first two pediatric monkeypox cases in the U.S. were reported in late July, and CDC officials said the infections were likely the result of household transmission.\n\n\n\nReports of confirmed and presumed pediatric cases have now surfaced in a number of states, including six in California and five in Texas, according to the latest data from the states’ health departments.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Oregon Health Authority confirmed the state’s first pediatric monkeypox case last week, noting that the infection had been linked to a confirmed adult case in Oregon. The next day, a monkeypox case was reported in a 17-year-old in neighboring Washington state, according to local media.\n\n\n\nChildren and teen infections have also been reported in Florida, Indiana and Maine.\n\n\n\nMonkeypox cases have been recorded in every state except Wyoming, according to the CDC.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInfections have been most commonly recorded among the community of men who have sex with men, but officials have cautioned that the outbreak can spread to other groups. The virus spreads through close contact with an infected person.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) declared monkeypox a public health emergency in July, and the Biden administration followed suit earlier this month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the CDC for more.",

        "description": "Newcastle and Manchester City entertained in a six-goal draw but the clubs’ owners and history will not be forgottenPep Guardiola was agitated. He stalked the touchline, hands on hips, brooding. He gestured at Bernardo Silva and, during a break for an injury, gave him lengthy instructions. Manchester City were 1-0 up and creating chances, but Guardiola often serves as his own canary in the mine, his agitation indicating long before it becomes apparent in concrete actions that something is amiss.When Ilkay Gündogan put City ahead in the fifth minute, the assumption was that Eddie Howe was on his way to an 11th defeat in 11 games against Guardiola. Everybody knows the drill: Guardiola praises Howe for the football his side plays, all that passing and so little of that nasty tackling, all that space and so little of that closing down, and then helps himself to a comfortable win: the cumulative goal-difference between the two before kick-off was 31-4 in Guardiola’s favour.

        "description": "Rep Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said on Sunday that some information from the affidavit for a warrant to search former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence should be shared with Congress, even if the document remains under seal. \n\n\n\nThe Justice Department (DOJ) has expressed concern that releasing the full document could jeopardize the ongoing investigation and witnesses. \n\n\n\nSchiff said on CNN’s “State of the Union\" that he did not want Congress or anyone else interfering with the DOJ's probe, but added he hoped information relating to national security would be shared with lawmakers. \n\n\n\n“Whatever information is in that affidavit that bears on a danger to the national security information contained in those documents, I would hope that that would be shared with Congress, even if the affidavit is not,\" he said. \n\n\n\nThe House intelligence chair added that the affidavit could explain a lot about what the DOJ knows and how it obtained that information. \n\n\n\n\"You could learn what witnesses may have seen in terms of the handling of those documents or people coming and going from where the documents were located. You could learn about whether representations were made that proved to be false, in terms of whether they had given up the classified information,\" Schiff said. \"You could learn a great deal. That's just the problem, though, for the Justice Department.\"\n\n\n\nThe search warrant and some related documents were unsealed last week, revealing that investigators were looking at possible criminal violations related to records kept at the former president’s residence after he left office. Eleven sets of classified documents were reportedly found at Mar-a-Lago during the search. \n\n\n\nA federal magistrate judge has indicated he may make public a redacted version of the affidavit and ordered the DOJ to submit a redacted draft proposal for his review by Thursday.\n\n\n\nTrump has urged the release of the unredacted document, but the DOJ has said that the affidavit should remain sealed, citing concerns that its release could compromise the integrity of its investigation.\n\n\n\n“I think the Justice Department makes a powerful case that, at the early stage of the investigation, when it could jeopardize the pursuit of justice, this is not the time to be giving, essentially, the Trump lawyers a road map into how to intimidate witnesses or how to derail a legitimate investigation,” Schiff said.\n\n\n\nReleasing the affidavit, which may include information about witnesses, could put sources at risk, the California lawmaker noted.\n\n\n\n“We have seen the [former] president retaliate against anyone he considers a whistle-blower, accuse them of treason. And, of course, we have seen the president's incendiary rhetoric already lead someone to go to an FBI building with an assault weapon who was shot to death by the FBI defending itself,” Schiff said, referring to an uptick in threats against the FBI following the Mar-a-Lago search.\n\n\n\n“I'd like to make sure that we do our oversight of that,” Schiff said of the investigation, “but that we do it in such a way as not to jeopardize the pursuit of justice.”",

        "description": "Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) said on Sunday that he was “encouraged” by the prospect of former Vice President Pence testifying before the House select committee investigating the Jan 6., 2021 attack at the Capitol.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDuring an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union,” moderator Jake Tapper asked Schiff about remarks Pence made at an event in New Hampshire in which he indicated that he would consider an invitation by the committee to testify about the Capitol riot. \n\n\n\n“I was encouraged to hear it. And I hope it meant what it sounded like it meant,” Schiff told Tapper, adding that the panel has been in discussion with Pence’s legal counsel “for some time” on the matter.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“So he knows of our interest in having him come before us,” Schiff added. “And I am confident that, if he is truly willing, that there is a way to work out any executive privilege or separation of powers issues.”\n\n\n\n“He could plainly share a lot of very firsthand information about what it was like to be the subject of those efforts to get him to violate his constitutional duty and arrogate to himself the power to decide who won or who lost an American presidential election,” Schiff said. \n\n\n\nLast week, Pence said he would consider testifying before the House panel on the Capitol insurrection, but noted it would be “unprecedented” for a vice president to testify before Congress.\n\n\n\nPence has become a prominent figure in the committee’s investigation of the insurrection where one hearing earlier this summer focused squarely on efforts to pressure him into overturning former President Trump's defeat.\n\n\n\n“My first obligation is to continue to hold my oath, continue to uphold the framework of government enshrined in the Constitution,” Pence told the New Hampshire crowd. ",

        "description": "Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas) on Sunday sought to distance himself from those in his party calling to defund the FBI following the agency’s search of former President Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate.\n\n\n\n“Oh yes, it's crazy,” Crenshaw responded when CNN’s Jake Tapper asked him about recent GOP rhetoric on “State of the Union.”\n\n\n\nMany in the GOP have portrayed the search, which was connected to an investigation into the former president’s handling of classified documents, as politically motivated. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.) filed impeachment articles against Attorney General Merrick Garland and called for the FBI to be defunded.\n\n\n\nThose demands have been met with condemnation from some in the GOP, drawing comparisons to the defund the police movement that has been promoted by progressive lawmakers including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.).\n\n\n\n“It makes us seem like extremist Democrats, right?” Crenshaw said on Sunday. “And so Marjorie and AOC can go join the defund the law enforcement club if they want. Ninety-nine percent of Republicans are not on that train.”\n\n\n\nDespite separating himself from those calls, Crenshaw on Sunday did call for accountability and transparency from the FBI and Department of Justice (DOJ) following the search, saying it was \"automatically political.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA federal judge last week signaled openness to releasing a redacted version of the affidavit to support the search warrant application, but the DOJ has opposed the move, citing concerns for witness safety.\n\n\n\n“The criticisms that we're leveling against the FBI and DOJ are fully warranted,” Crenshaw told Tapper. “It is not those criticisms that lead to a crazy person attacking an FBI.”\n\n\n\nAn armed man attempted to breach the FBI’s Cincinnati field office in the days following the Mar-a-Lago search, and the intelligence community cited the incident in a recent bulletin warning of increased threats to federal law enforcement.\n\n\n\nThe FBI arrested a Pennsylvania man following the search for allegedly threatening to kill the agency’s personnel.\n\n\n\n“That's completely wrong, but that's not where 99 percent of Republicans are at, of course,” Crenshaw said on CNN.",

        "description": "The Yankees placed right-hander Albert Abreu on the 15-day injured list today due to right elbow inflammation. The club didn&#8217;t provide any estimated timeline for Abreu&#8217;s absence, but an issue with a pitcher&#8217;s throwing elbow is always somewhat concerning.\nAbreu went from the Yankees to the Rangers in the offseason as part of the Jose Trevino trade. He lasted less than two months in Texas, getting designated for assignment and then traded to the Royals. About three weeks later, he was designated again and returned to the Yankees on waivers. Between the three teams, he has a 3.32 ERA on the year in 38 innings.\nOther injury notes from around the league&#8230;\n\nThough losing Abreu isn&#8217;t good news, the Yankees got much better news elsewhere on the roster. Manager Aaron Boone tells Joe Trezza of MLB.com that lefty Zack Britton recently threw a bullpen and is nearing a rehab assignment. Now 34, Britton was one of the best relievers in all of baseball from 2014 to 2016 while with the Orioles. His strikeout rate tapered off after that, though he still got grounders on over 70% of balls in play. 2021 was a down season, as he registered a 5.89 ERA before hitting the injured list in August. He eventually required surgery to repair his UCL, which wiped out what was left of that season and threatened his 2022 as well. In November, general manager Brian Cashman said it was &#8220;probable&#8221; that Britton would miss all of this season, though it seems he&#8217;s still got a shot of returning. There&#8217;s just over six weeks remaining in the regular season, but the Yanks are a virtual lock for the postseason, giving Britton a bit more time to make an impact. He&#8217;d no doubt love to get back on the hill and help the team, while also showcasing his health before reaching free agency this winter.\nThe Dodgers could potentially get Clayton Kershaw back sooner than expected. Just yesterday, it was reported that he could soon go out on a rehab assignment and return in the second week of September. Manager Dave Roberts now tells J.P. Hoornstra of the Southern California News Group that the plan is for the lefty to throw a bullpen on Monday, followed three or four innings in a simulated game later in the week before being activated without a rehab assignment. That would seem to open the door to Kershaw returning before the month of August is complete. Kershaw&#8217;s return would only further strengthen the rotation, which also welcomed Dustin May back yesterday. Kershaw&#8217;s been dealing with back issues this year, but has a tremendous 2.64 ERA in 85 1/3 innings when healthy.",

        "description": "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday cleared Novavax’s COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use in adolescents, paving the way to expand eligibility for the fourth shot available in the United States.\n\n\n\nThe two-dose regimen utilizes protein-based technology previously leveraged in vaccines to combat other viruses, offering an alternative for Americans skeptical of Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA technology.\n\n\n\nProviders can begin administering the vaccine to people aged 12 through 17 after a sign off from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), which has already authorized the vaccine’s use for adults. The two doses are given three weeks apart.\n\n\n\n\"Having more vaccine options for use in both adults and adolescents, like the Novavax COVID-19 Vaccine, Adjuvanted will hopefully help increase vaccination rates, particularly as we prepare for ongoing surges of COVID-19 with the start of fall and the back-to-school season,\" Novavax President Stanley Erck said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"We hope that our vaccine, developed using an innovative approach to recombinant protein vaccine technology, may have a special role in adolescent vaccination based on parents' and caregivers' familiarity with protein-based vaccines used in other disease areas,” he added.\n\n\n\nThe FDA granted emergency use for adolescents after the company said its trial of 2,247 adolescents showed a primary efficacy of 78 percent. \n\n\n\nBut Novavax conducted the trial last year, when the Delta variant was predominantly circulating in the United States. The White House has continued urging Americans to get vaccinated and boosted amid the spread of the BA.4 and BA.5 subvariants of omicron, but questions remain as to how the mutations could impact the vaccine’s efficacy.\n\n\n\nThe FDA authorized Novavax’s vaccine for adults last month, which was followed by the CDC’s blessing nearly a week later.\n\n\n\nWhite House coronavirus response coordinator Ashish Jha said on Wednesday that regulators are expected to approve updated COVID-19 vaccine doses in “a few short weeks” for everyone over the age of 12. The shots are designed to target the two omicron subvariants currently circulating.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNovavax’s COVID-19 shot helps prevent severe illness by injecting the human body with doses that contain the coronavirus spike protein.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe company inputs genetic code that creates the spike protein into an insect virus, which replicates after infecting moth cells. The manufacturer then purifies and extracts the replicated spike proteins and injects them into humans.\n\n\n\nThe process only requires regular refrigeration, compared to Pfizer and Moderna’s mRNA vaccines that require storage in colder temperatures. Those vaccines contain genetic instructions for human cells to create the spike protein and defend against future infections.",

Another documentary about Diana, Princess of Wales. Just what we need. Days after Sky Documentaries’ The Princess comes Channel 4’s new series Investigating Diana: Death in Paris. How else can the 25th anniversary of her death be marked and monetised? Her workout playlist downloadable from Spotify, perhaps? A volume of princess-related poetry edited by Gyles Brandreth in which John Cooper Clarke rhymes Diana with spanner? A doorstep clap at the hour of her death, because that sort of thing really worked for the NHS?Not that directors Will Jessop and Barnaby Peel aren’t geniuses. They’ve made a four-part series, microanalysing the circumstances of her death in the Alma tunnel on 31 August 1997, stretching and pulling historical material like cellophane over fading bouquets outside Kensington Palace. Only occasionally can you hear that tearing sound. Yet again, we hear Earl Spencer’s funeral oration; yet again, Diana looking faux-coyly over her shoulder in old snapshots; yet again, Tony Blair hitching his New Labour pony to the carriage of her celebrity with his oxymoronic invocation of the people’s princess.

        "description": "Albert Pujols&#8217; recent hot streak hasn&#8217;t changed the legendary slugger&#8217;s mind about retirement, as Pujols told USA Today&#8217;s Bob Nightengale that he is &#8220;still going to retire&#8221; at season&#8217;s end.  Despite a 1.428 OPS in 53 plate appearances since the All-Star break and his ever-nearing proximity to some notable milestones, Pujols confirmed that he hasn&#8217;t thought about playing in 2023.\n&#8220;I don’t get caught up in numbers.  If you were going to tell me 22 years ago that I would be this close, I would have told you that you’re freakin’ crazy,&#8221; Pujols said.  &#8220;My career has been amazing&#8230;I’ve had enough.  I’m glad I made the announcement this was it when I signed.  Really, I wouldn’t change a thing.&#8221;\nPujols now has 692 career homers, making it a realistic possibility that he can pass Alex Rodriguez (696 homers) on the all-time list and perhaps even become the fourth player in history to reach the 700-homer threshold.  After last night&#8217;s four-hit performance against the Diamondbacks, Pujols is also now second on the all-time total bases list, passing another Cardinals legend in Stan Musial.  Interestingly, Nightengale also notes that Pujols&#8217; desire to return to St. Louis led him to pass up on offers from three other teams this winter, even though those other clubs were offering either more playing time or more money than Pujols&#8217; $2.5MM salary for 2022.\nMore from around the NL Central&#8230;\n\nBrewers utilityman Jace Peterson told reporters (including Curt Hogg of the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel) that he&#8217;ll start a three-game minor league rehab assignment on Tuesday, with an eye towards returning to the majors when the Brewers open a series with the Cubs on Friday.  A left elbow sprain sent Peterson to the 10-day injured list on July 20, and since he had been bothered by a UCL injury prior to that IL placement, there was some concern that he would be sidelined deeper into September or even that his season could be threatened.  However, Peterson is now on pace to continue what has been a quietly valuable season, as he has contributed both versatility all around the diamond and above-average offense (111 wRC+) in 241 plate appearances, batting .252/.325/.439 with eight home runs.\nCubs manager David Ross provided updates on some injured players, telling MLB.com&#8217;s Jordan Bastian and other reporters that x-rays were negative on Patrick Wisdom&#8217;s left ring finger, and Wisdom is day to day.  Wisdom suffered the injury on a slide into home plate in yesterday&#8217;s game.  Wade Miley will also get back onto the mound and throw tomorrow, after experiencing some tightness in his left shoulder on Friday.  Between two shoulder-related IL stints and some elbow tightness at the end of Spring Training, Miley has tossed only 19 innings in his first season in Chicago.  Before this latest setback, Miley has pitched four rehab outings and seemed to be nearing a return, so it remains to be seen how much more time (if any) this recent bout of soreness could cost the veteran southpaw.\nSpeaking of setbacks, Reds right-hander Connor Overton had a hamstring tweak while working out at the Reds&#8217; Arizona training complex, manager David Bell told reporters (including The Cincinnati Enquirer&#8217;s Bobby Nightengale).  A stress fracture in Overton&#8217;s lower back sent him to the 60-day injured list on May 19, and he has already been sidelined for well beyond the initial 6-to-8 week recovery timeline.  A rehab assignment was still a ways away, as Overton had progressed only to long toss.  Depending on the severity of Overton&#8217;s hamstring issue, the rookie is running short on time to make it back to the field before the end of the season.",

        "link": "https://tidbits.com/2022/08/21/graphicconverter-11-rescues-ancient-quicktake-150-photos/",
        "description": "Apple is now known for the cameras in the iPhone, but the first Apple camera was the QuickTake 100, released in 1994. It wasn’t the first digital camera, but Time magazine called it “the first consumer digital camera.” A video about it and its successors, the QuickTake 150 and rather different QuickTake 200, recently made the rounds on a private mailing list I’m on.\n\nI used a QuickTake 150 for a few years starting in mid-1995, and it was an eye-opener (see “Digital Photographs as a Way of Life,” 2 October 1995). The photos were small—640 by 480 pixels—and of rather poor quality, but the freedom afforded by not worrying about wasting film or waiting to develop it was life-changing. I wouldn’t have bought the QuickTake 150 on my own—it cost $700 new—but I had written a white paper for Apple about the company’s Internet strategy, so I asked my contacts to pay me in hardware at internal prices. It was a serious score, and I ended up with quite a collection of gear, including the camera.\nPhoto by Christopher W. from Flickr; licensed under CC BY-SA 2.0\nI’ve long maintained my QuickTake 150 photos in iPhoto and later Photos, but since they’re out of sight at the very top of my library, I hadn’t thought about them in years. Prompted by the QuickTake video, I became curious about what was in those photos, so I scrolled all the way up and was concerned to see that none of the images had previews. Worse, Photos crashed when I tried to double-click an image to view it full-size or Control-click it to see what other options might be available. I couldn’t even select the images and choose File &gt; Export to see if I could get the originals out that way. Luckily, I could select them all and drag them to a folder in the Finder. I also verified that I could find them by searching for their .pict extension within the Photos Library package.\nAfter export, all the photos still sported blank white thumbnails and were equally blank when opened in Preview. As the discussion progressed on the mailing list (complete with shared QuickTake photos from others), I was reminded that accessing such photos required a QuickTake Image Access extension in an old version of the classic Mac OS. Putting together such a system using SheepShaver wasn’t out of the question, but I was hoping there might be a better alternative.\nMy thoughts immediately went to GraphicConverter, the venerable Swiss Army knife of graphics programs, and I dropped the folder on GraphicConverter 10, the latest version I had handy. No luck, and although the app alerted me that I could update to GraphicConverter 11, I couldn’t imagine that support for such an ancient image format would be in version 11 but not version 10.\nSo I wrote to Thorsten Lemke, the image conversion guru behind GraphicConverter, who had worked with me on “How to Create Mojave’s True Dynamic Desktops with GraphicConverter” (10 October 2018). It turned out that I should have done my homework more completely. Thorsten asked for a couple of sample images to check and then gently pointed out that GraphicConverter 11 could indeed open and convert those QuickTake 150 images, and he even made me a quick video tutorial showing me how. Color me embarrassed, but talk about great customer service!\nWhen I followed his steps using GraphicConverter 11, it had no problem converting my images to JPEG, and it was wonderful to see those images—and the much younger people in them—once again. Here you can see me and Tonya wearing fezzes in the Archie McPhee store in Seattle, plus one of my Mac-filled office in our first house in Renton, Washington, circa 1995.\n\nSo thanks to Thorsten and GraphicConverter, and if you still have any QuickTake 150 images lying around, I encourage you to convert them while you’re thinking about it.",

        "link": "https://fleadbeater.wordpress.com/2022/08/21/lets-stop-talking-about-target-grades/",
        "description": "Tomorrow marks the start of my second week back in school after summer with new pupils and a new timetable. It’s been great to see the energy and enthusiasm of my senior pupils this past week and I’m excited for how their learning will develop over the year ahead. But undoubtedly, over the next few weeks many of us in schools across the country will be asked to give pupils ‘target grades.’ There are many reasons why I’m not a fan of target grades and this blogpost aims to articulate why.\n\n\n\nBefore I go any further, I want to say that I understand the intention and thinking behind target grades, especially in terms of data and reporting. I realise that grades are very much part of our education system. Parents, and many pupils would find a shift away from reporting on target grades problematic and require a change of mindset. And yet, personally, I feel they cause so much confusion and angst.\n\n\n\nLearning is a long term change in knowledge and understanding. And my aim as a teacher is to get pupils excited and motivated to learn. To shape pupils who are passionate about my subject and who get a real buzz from their achievements long after the exam. Not just to get a grade, although I appreciate for many that is important. So why are we still fixated on marks? And do target grades actually help in the journey to pass exams?\n\n\n\nMy beef with target grades started a while back when I heard of a school where teachers were ‘not allowed’ to give pupils target grades of C as it was seen as not ‘aspirational’ enough. Imagine… teachers’ professional judgement being over-ruled because it might not look good for a pupil to have a C as a target grade. I understand why the school may have wanted to discourage low target grades and instead have high expectations for all learners, but it makes me worry about the part target grades play in the success of a pupil or indeed a school. If we are not giving teacher  autonomy to decide a realistic and achievable target grade for a pupil whom they know well, it may as well be a target picked from a hat, making a bit of a mockery of the system. And the more I thought about it, the more I concluded that target grades can be hugely problematic.\n\n\n\nIn the first instance, target grades are a way of labelling pupils and in many cases, limiting their potential from the start. I don’t believe for a minute that teachers do this intentionally, I’m sure it is often from a place of good intent, but let’s consider how this feels from the pupils point of view. Whilst it might make teachers feel they are differentiating more successfully, how can we ensure that this does not instead create a self-fulfilling prophecy?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirstly, let’s take the high flying pupil. The student doesn’t cause the teacher any bother, has been a model pupil all through school and did well last year according to her teacher. Her A target grade is well within her reach and the feedback from the first few assessments confirm this. So why should she push herself? She’s pretty confident she’ll get her grade and so she can sit back and coast. She’ll do what she needs to get her A, but that’s it. When assessments are returned, she’ll read the grade to check she made the mark but skip the feedback. Are we really encouraging her to be all she can be so that she experiences the joy and passion of learning?\n\n\n\nBut perhaps more damaging is the pupil who’s target is a C but despite her best efforts, just isn’t quite making the grade. How must it feel to always be falling short of a target grade? To constantly be told you aren’t quite there yet. This continued emphasis on the grade could be soul destroying for a pupil who already finds this particular subject difficult. As Dylan William suggests giving a grade does not help the student to improve. And when feedback is given along with a grade, the feedback is most often disregarded in favour of the grade. The grade encourages pupils to compare themselves and becomes ego-involving. For me, it seems far more productive to stick to the learning. Yet still we focus on target grades.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen we focus on the mark or grade, we are attaching extrinsic motivation to learning. We are rewarding performance. And the more we focus on this, the less likely we are to be able to harness the intrinsic motivation and passion which comes from deep learning and understanding. Yes, for certain senior classes we may be required to refer to grades or marks at times, but personally I’d prefer to see a move away from constantly referring to target grades and instead consider whether the pupil is achieving their potential. A simple + = &#8211; system seems sensible to me. The symbols represent whether a learner is  continuing to progress positively, stagnating or progress dipping. The high achieving learners have to keep working hard if they want to keep getting +’s because there’s no room for complacency. Anyone struggling to progress is highlighted by a -. The lower attaining pupils work hard and continue to be rewarded with +’s and any passive learners who are not pushing themselves are flagged up with =. This system focuses much more on incremental improvement and learning as opposed to performance.\n\n\n\nIf we place more focus on the feedback we are giving or how the learner needs to specifically improve, rather than referring to whether the student is meeting a target grade on a specific piece of work, we are hopefully guiding the learner to the actual ways in which the learner can get better. Dylan Wiliam suggests that feedback should ‘improve the student and not the work.’\n\n\n\nFinally I think target grades often cause confusion for pupils, staff and parents. A target grade set to be achieved at the end of the year, makes it very difficult to track progress throughout the year. How can we confidently say that pupil x is meeting their target grade of a B in November when, they still have 5 months of learning left before their assessment? In art and design, a pupil may have only completed half a folio, and whilst they are doing all they can and working to the best of their ability, the folio would not get the desired target grade if assessed in November. Parents find this difficult to fathom, ‘She was getting a B in November, so why is her work now a C?’ Might it be better to focus on the whether they are ‘on track’ to meet their potential and instead spend time giving appropriate feedback to help the learner improve?\n\n\n\nI would love to hear your thoughts on what is undoubtedly a highly contentious issue and perhaps how this works in your school. Target grades do serve a purpose, but I can’t help thinking there may be a better use of time, and as always it comes down to great learning and teaching.",

Since then, both Ukrainian and Russian troops have traded blame for skirmishes and shelling near the nuclear plant, which have alarmed wold leaders seeking to de-escalate the conflict around the site.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday's call, Biden, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz discussed the need to \"avoid military operations near the plant,\" according to the White House.\n\n\n\nThey also recommended the United Nations&nbsp;International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) visit the site in order to make a determination of the safety of the plant and its operations.\n\n\n\nMacron last week said Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to send IAEA agents to the plant, Reuters reported.\n\n\n\nUkrainian President Voldymyr Zelensky also agreed to allow IAEA agents to inspect the nuclear plant. He warned last week of \"catastrophic consequences\" if fighting continues near Zaporizhzhya.\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Biden also discussed with the European leaders ongoing negotiations with Iran over reviving a 2015 nuclear agreement that lifted sanctions on the Middle Eastern nation in return the country not develop nuclear grade material or weapons.\n\n\n\nWhile negotiations have been ongoing for months, the parties are reportedly getting closer to a deal.",

        "description": "Former senior White House adviser Cedric Richmond knocked Democrats reluctant to have President Biden campaign with them ahead of the midterms.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If they are reluctant, I think it’s political malpractice. If you don’t want Biden, it’s malpractice,” Richmond told The Washington Post.\n\n\n\nRichmond lauded Biden’s recent high-profile successes, such as the expansive health and climate bill signed into law last week, and said he expects Biden's numbers to climb, noting that \"if I’m a candidate, I’d tie myself to that.\"\n\n\n\n“A lot of these things, Democrats have been trying to accomplish them for a long time,” Richmond said. “Who wouldn’t want the person who was finally able to do that to come and campaign for them?”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA former Louisiana Democrat in Congress, Richmond served the Biden administration as director of the Office of Public Engagement. He is now an adviser to the Democratic National Committee. The Hill has reached out to Richmond for further comment. \n\n\n\nA number of Democrats have recently sidestepped questions about whether they’d back a Biden reelection bid in 2024, and some vulnerable candidates are keeping a notable distance from their party leader. \n\n\n\nAccording to a Washington Post survey, few vulnerable Democrats said they want the president campaigning for them.\n\n\n\nThe report cites Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo.) and Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) as two lawmakers, both facing difficult Senate races, as snubbing the idea of Biden campaigning in their states. The Hill has reached out to Ryan's and Bennet’s campaigns.\n\n\n\nIn a new campaign ad, Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio) distances herself from the president, saying she “doesn’t work for Joe Biden.” \n\n\n\nDespite low approval ratings and concerns about his age, the president has insisted he plans to run again\n\n\n\nOn Sunday, Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) said that he’d welcome Biden’s company on the campaign trail. \n\n\n\n“Hey, I will welcome anybody to come to Arizona, travel around the state at any time — as long as I’m here, if I’m not up in Washington in session — and talk about what Arizona needs,” Kelly said during an appearance on CNN’s “State of the Union.” \n\n\n\nBiden is expected to join Democrats in Maryland for a rally this Thursday. \n\n\n\nDemocratic gubernatorial nominee Wes Moore, who faces Trump-backed GOP nominee Dan Cox in the race to replace Gov. Larry Hogan (R), is expected to attend.",

        "description": "The Washington Post’s departing media columnist Margaret Sullivan wrote in her final column on Sunday that journalists need to deploy “fearless straight talk,” such as making clear the stakes of re-electing former President Donald Trump.\n\n\n\n“Journalists certainly shouldn’t shill for Trump’s 2024 rivals — whoever they may be — but they have to be willing to show their readers, viewers and listeners that electing him again would be dangerous,” Sullivan wrote. “That’s a tricky tightrope to walk.”\n\n\n\nSullivan, who announced earlier this month she was leaving the paper to become a professor at Duke University and write fiction, has served as the post’s media columnist since May 2016. She told Vanity Fair that her departure was a “self-imposed term limit” after roughly 500 published columns.\n\n\n\nShe previously worked as The New York Times’ public editor and an editor at The Buffalo News.\n\n\n\nIn her final column, Sullivan praised the media industry as coming a “long, long way” in covering Trump’s norm-shattering presidency. She had regularly used the now-retired column to criticize coverage of the former president and related threats to democracy.\n\n\n\n“It is now common to see headlines and stories that plainly refer to some politicians as ‘election deniers,’ and journalists are far less hesitant to use the blunt and clarifying word ‘lie’ to describe Trump’s false statements,” Sullivan wrote, referencing his unfounded claims of election fraud in 2020.\n\n\n\nShe also highlighted efforts by the Post and other news outlets to create beats dedicated to democracy-focused issues like voting access and the politicization of the election process.\n\n\n\n“And yet, I worry that it’s not nearly enough,” she wrote. “I don’t mean to suggest that journalists can address the threats to democracy all by themselves — but they must do more.”\n\n\n\nSullivan called on the industry to rely less on “knee-jerk” live coverage and instead do more to bring in meaningful context and thoughtful framing to better inform their audiences. She also encouraged outlets to explain why they are making certain coverage decisions, like if they aren’t airing a speech live to avoid airing lies.\n\n\n\n“The deeper question is whether news organizations can break free of their hidebound practices — the love of political conflict, the addiction to elections as a horse race — to address those concerns effectively,” Sullivan wrote. “For the sake of democracy, they must.\"",

        "description": "Former NBA star Dennis Rodman reportedly said he is traveling to Russia to help secure the release of WNBA player Brittney Griner, who was recently sentenced to nine years in a Russian prison for possessing cannabis oil cartridges.\n\n\n\nRodman, who previously inserted himself into US-North Korea diplomacy, told NBC News on Saturday he secured permission to travel to Russia and is \"trying to go this week.\"\n\n\n\nThe U.S. State Department has a do not travel advisory in effect for Russia, which also warns Americans in the country to leave immediately. \n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to the State Department for comment on Rodman's plans. \n\n\n\nThe Biden administration is currently negotiating the release of Griner and former U.S. Marine Paul Whelan, having reportedly proposed an exchange involving Russian arms dealer Viktor Bout. \n\n\n\nRodman, a hall-of-famer who played for several NBA teams, including with Michael Jordan on the Chicago Bulls, has visited Russia before and once called Russian President Vladimir Putin a \"cool guy.\"\n\n\n\nIn 2014, Rodman took credit for the release of Kenneth Bae from North Korea, a nation he visited multiple times despite high tensions with the U.S. Rodman once called North Korean leader Kim Jong Un a \"friend.\"\n\n\n\nThe former NBA player told NBC News on Saturday that he \"knows Putin well\" and was confident he could negotiate with the Russian leader.\n\n\n\nGriner was arrested by Russia in February as tensions between the the Russian government and the U.S. spiked over the pending invasion of Ukraine. The US has officially declared Griner as being wrongfully detained. \n\n\n\nThe WNBA star pled guilty to carrying the cannabis oil cartridges, but argued she packed them into her suitcase by mistake and had no criminal intent.\n\n\n\nGriner has appealed the nine-year sentence a judge handed down this month.",

        "description": "Aug. 22: Chris Cotillo of MassLive tweets that Eovaldi will likely be placed on the 15-day injured list in order to make room on the roster for Josh Winckowski, who is taking the ball in Eovaldi&#8217;s place for tomorrow&#8217;s game.\nAug. 21: The Red Sox skipped Nathan Eovaldi&#8217;s last turn through the rotation since the right-hander was dealing with soreness in his neck and shoulder.  The issue is still bothering Eovaldi, and manager Alex Cora told MLB.com&#8217;s Ian Browne (Twitter links) and other reporters that Eovaldi won&#8217;t make his next start, scheduled for Tuesday against the Blue Jays.  Another trip to the injured list hasn&#8217;t been ruled out, though Cora said the Sox haven&#8217;t yet decided how to proceed.\nFor Eovaldi, he said that staying off the IL is &#8220;the main goal,&#8221; since he is &#8220;feeling a lot better&#8221; than earlier in the week, even if the recovery process is &#8220;going a little slower than we anticipated.&#8221;  Needless to say, it has been a &#8220;frustrating&#8221; time for the righty, who said that &#8220;every day, it’s just how can we make sure that I’m 100 percent especially going down the road for this next stretch.&#8221;\n\nEovaldi already missed a little more than month of the season due to inflammation in his lower back, and injuries have hampered the right-hander for much of his career.  2021 was a rare healthy season for Eovaldi, and he responded with a 3.75 ERA over 182 1/3 innings and a fourth-place finish in AL Cy Young Award voting &#8212; indicative of just how high Eovaldi&#8217;s ceiling can be if he can just stay on the field.\nWith a 4.15 ERA over 99 2/3 innings this season, Eovaldi&#8217;s bottom-line numbers aren&#8217;t far off his 2021 totals, and he still has an elite walk rate.  However, Eovaldi has allowed more hard contact than almost any other pitcher in the league, and his strikeout has dropped to a middling 22.7%.  Despite this step backwards, Eovaldi is still arguably Boston&#8217;s best starting pitcher, and is critical to whatever chance the Red Sox might still have of sneaking back into the wild card hunt.\nIn the bigger picture, Eovaldi is also a free agent after the season, and would surely prefer to reach the open market without yet another IL stint on his resume.  Eovaldi already hasn&#8217;t appeared in a game since August 12, and even with up to three days of backdating available on an injured-list placement, putting Eovaldi on the IL would keep him out of action until September.  If Eovaldi is already feeling some improvement, the Sox could take the risk of leaving him off the IL, though another setback (which presumably would then make an IL stint a foregone conclusion) would delay his return even further.",

The Pittsburgh Pirates looked to end the weekend on a winning note, but thanks to a poor outing by reliever Manny Banuelos, the Cincinnati Reds walked out of PNC Park with a 9-5 win and the series.\nThe Bucs garnered the upper hand in the first as Ben Gamel evened the scoring on a single to center. Rodolfo Castro then continued his hot streak at the plate with double that gave Pittsburgh a temporary lead.\n\n\nCastro for the lead! pic.twitter.com/IEv8gL1AK8— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) August 21, 2022\n\n\n\nThat lead was short-lived as the Reds reclaimed the lead in the third thanks to a two-run home run by Mike Moustakas.\nThen came the nightmare inning.\nBanuelos, who was riding a wave of success coming into today, came in to relieve Zach Thompson in the sixth and coughed up four runs. He gave up back-to-back walks to start the frame, then allowed a single to Jake Fraley that scored two. Jonathan India followed him with a triple to left.\nLet’s also not forget ole’ Shelty leaving Colin Holderman in too long in the eighth!\nTucupita Marcano and Jason Delay closed the gap in the sixth after driving in three runs, but a stout Reds bullpen halted the scoring there.\nYet again, poor pitching plagues the Pirates and they are now closer to another 100-loss season.

He can’t catch a break,” said one Democratic donor, who likened the moment to the 2020 campaign when Biden was losing in the polls and being drowned out in the media by his rival.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden allies have quietly voiced frustration in recent days that his string of domestic victories has been eclipsed by the headlines on Mar-a-Lago. Each day, more news comes out about the FBI investigation into Trump, and it’s showing no signs of slowing down after a judge indicated on Thursday that he may unseal parts of an affidavit accompanying the search warrant the Justice Department used.\n\n\n\n“The reality is that there's so much news every single day and [Biden’s] accomplishments can sometimes get lost if you're not out there, talking about that every single day,” said Xochitl Hinojosa, a former communications director at the Democratic National Committee (DNC). “If you're looking at the totality of what he's accomplished, and especially the Inflation Reduction Act, you have to continue to really talk to voters and spend money to not only persuade voters, but to turn them out around our successes ahead of the midterm elections.”\n\n\n\nThe president is set to rally voters at a DNC event in Maryland next Thursday and host an event at the White House early next month for a victory lap of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).&nbsp;Then, the White House has said he will travel across the country to tout the IRA.\n\n\n\nCabinet members have&nbsp;already&nbsp;started heading out to states for a roadshow&nbsp;on&nbsp;the IRA and have 35 trips to 23 states planned through the end of August.\n\n\n\nThe president is set to rally voters at a DNC event in Maryland next Thursday and host an event at the White House early next month for a victory lap of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA).\n\n\n\nCabinet members started heading out to states for a roadshow to tout the IRA on Wednesday and have 35 trips to 23 states planned through the end of August.\n\n\n\nFor Biden, he’ll have to carefully “pick his spots,” said one Democratic strategist, who acknowledged that the coming months would prove to be challenging, particularly with woes about inflation lingering in the backdrop.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s a juggle for Biden,” the strategist said. “I think certainly the president has got the agenda accomplishments that he can point to, but in many ways he’s a bystander and it’s the bystander presidency.”\n\n\n\n“He wasn’t the primary driver on the IRA, he wasn’t the primary driver on chips or gun legislation,” they added of Biden’s recent legislative achievements. “But he has a lot he can run on.”\n\n\n\nAnd in some ways, the Trump headlines play in Biden’s favor, political observers say.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“He can do both at once,” said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University. “Promote his accomplishments, remind voters of the danger of Republican power.\"\n\n\n\n“The best hope for Democrats is to hit hard on both themes, without letting one dominate the other,” Zelizer said. “Making gains in a midterm year is tough to do. But the goal is marginal improvement with swing voters.”\n\n\n\nBut others argue that swing voters are too focused on the economy and high inflation — and not necessarily Trump — to be swayed by hearing about Democrats’ big legislative achievement.\n\n\n\n“While the IRA is a major policy win for the administration, politically it seems more likely to rally the Dem base than win over swing voters concerned by stressful macroeconomic trends,” said Bruce Mehlman, former assistant secretary at the Commerce Department under President George W. Bush.\n\n\n\nJeff Jones, senior editor at Gallup, expressed doubt that Biden could see a significant boost mainly because domestic policy achievements typically don’t move the needle too much.\n\n\n\n“A lot of it is determined by the approval rating … and his approval rating is low even if he did get some kind of bump from the recent news,” he said.\n\n\n\nBiden’s approval rating ticked up 3 percentage points this past week in a new poll in the wake of his signing the IRA, with 42 percent of registered voters saying they approve of the job he is doing as president. The same survey released last week showed his approval rating was at 39 percent.\n\n\n\nThe president, plagued by lingering poor scores, has been unable in multiple polls to break 40 percent approval in recent months.\n\n\n\n“Most presidents either have an anchor effect or a buoy effect, and right now it seems like this president is having a neutral effect,” said Democratic strategist Joel Payne, who added that that is “in part by design.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The president has gotten out of the way in some places, but it’s also because Republicans have not figured out how to tie up the loose ends from the Trump era. The story right now is still the 45th president, the one that Biden beat.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOther news from Trump World, like the tax fraud guilty plea of former Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg this week, is taking up oxygen while the White House has worked to turn the narrative to their wins.\n\n\n\nDespite all the noise, Democratic communications strategist Katie Grant Drew said the IRA, along with the CHIPs and Science Act and gun control legislation, gives Democrats plenty to talk to voters about in the next three months until the midterms.\n\n\n\n“This gives Democrats a real, positive record to run on, as opposed to making the much tougher argument of what Democrats would do if only they had larger majorities,” said Drew, a principal at Monument Advocacy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Democrats will need to keep the message direct and simple: this law is going to lower health care costs, seniors will pay less for their prescription drugs, and it’s the most significant step taken to tackle the climate crisis,” she added. “It shows that Democrats can get big things done.”\n\n\n\nMorgan Chalfant contributed to this report.",

They are seeking to sharpen their political brand and reach new audiences by helping like-minded candidates — who are also potential future endorsers — and visiting early primary states where advisers know their words will garner extra attention.&#8221;\n&#8220;Their presence on the trail — together with pitches to donors, expanding staffs and plans to release memoirs — underscores the widespread interest in the party running for president, or at least in keeping the option open. Even at a moment when many Republicans say Trump has secured his grip on the GOP and would begin as a heavy favorite for the nomination if he runs, the uncertainty surrounding his legal and political challenges, combined with the full slate of ambitious Republicans, has effectively set off a preliminary campaign for 2024.&#8221;",

        "description": "Brett Davis-USA TODAY Sports\n    \n\n  Mark Canha doubles up to give the Mets a series win in Philly.  In a game that featured three different Mets deficits, a rain-delay, three major league debuts from inauspicious prospects, a four-plus hour game time, and a nail-biter of a ninth inning, the Mets clawed back not once, not twice, but thrice, to win the game 10-9. \nThis game was a slog, almost from the first pitch. Jose Buttó made his MLB debut, and struggled mightily out of the gate. The first five batters reached against him, including a three-run home run by Alec Bohm, and when the Mets finally got up to bat, they were down 4-0.\nHowever, Buttó settled in for a spell, not allowing a run in the second or third inning, and allowed the Mets to chip away at the four-run deficit against Phillies’ starter Kyle Gibson. In the second inning, Michael Perez contributed to his brief Mets’ CV by driving in two on a single which saw J.T. Realmuto drop a seemingly clean throw to the plate, allowing Brett Baty to score. In the third, Daniel Vogelbach doubled to right, scoring Starling Marte, and bringing the Mets within one run.\nIn the fourth, Marte singled in Nimmo to tie the game and erase the deficit that Buttó put the team in in his first big league inning.\nHowever, in the bottom of the fourth, Bohm struck again with his second three-run homer of the day, just barely glancing the netting on the foul pole to put the Phillies up by three. \nButtó was relieved by yet another first-time Major Leaguer, Nate Fisher. Fisher was on the mound when a 46-minute rain delay hit, but it didn’t effect the 26-year old rookie who, during the early days of the pandemic, was out of baseball and working in financial services. Fisher pitched three scoreless innings, walking two, allowing one hit, and striking out one. \nThe Mets continued their comeback ways in the seventh, when Mark Canha tied the game with a three-run shot to left-field. Unfortunately, Trevor May was more Buttó than Fisher, and gave up a go-ahead home run to pinch hitter and constant thorn in the Mets’ side, Jean Segura. \nDavid Robertson worked two innings in last night’s Phillies win, and was back out for the ninth today. After giving up a lead-off double to Jeff McNeil - who is on quite the tear right now - Canha played hero yet again, driving another home run to left and putting the Mets up by one. \nJean Segura’s leaping fist bump that knocked his helmet off between first and second was outdone by a massive, almost Céspedes or Cabrera-esque bat flip and a raised arm circling of the bases from Canha. Wow. \nBrandon Nimmo then greeted Phillies reliever, and third MLB debut of the day, Tyler Cyr, with a towering home run on his second ever pitch in the big leagues, putting the Mets up by 2. \nEdwin Díaz entered, and instantly looked less sharp than you’d hope for your closer to look in a game like this. He gave up two hits in two pitches to Realmuto and Nick Castellanos, putting the tying runs on base in no time. A long fly ball off the bat of Bryson Stott to Marte was caught, but not until bumping into Nimmo, but held onto the ball. \nNick Maton hit a second deep fly ball, this time to Nimmo, that brought in the ninth run, but brought the Phillies down to their final out. That brought back up Segura, who walked to put the winning run on base for yesterday’s one-time position player reliever, Darick Hall.\nHall watched a called third strike to end the game with a dramatic flourish. \nThat win gave the Mets a series victory, taking three of four from the Phillies, as they also win the season series 14-5. In addition, the Braves lost to the Astros this afternoon, and so the Mets are now four up on Atlanta after a 4-4 road trip against their division rivals. \nThe Mets start the second half of the Subway Series starting tomorrow in the Bronx, with Max Scherzer going for the Mets and Domingo German going for the Yankees. \nHot damn this team is special. \nSB Nation GameThreads\nAmazin’ Avenue\nThe Good Phight\nBox scores\nESPN\nMLB.com\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs.com\n      Mets vs Phillies WPA Chart 8/21/22\n  \nWhat’s WPA?\nBig winner: Mark Canha, 78.4% WPA\nBig loser: Jose Buttó, -49.4% WPA\nTotal pitcher WPA: -50.4% WPA\nTotal batter WPA: 100.4% WPA (don’t ask me how the math works)\nTeh aw3s0mest play: Mark Canha’s second home run of the game, +47.5% WPA\nTeh sux0rest play: Jean Segura’s home run, -26.0% WPA",

        "description": "Terrorism experts, law enforcement officials, U.S. military officials and dog breeders will gather next week in a Durham, N.C., hotel ballroom to try and reverse a dangerous national security deficit: the shortage of high-quality U.S.-bred detection dogs.\n\n\n\nOn the agenda are sessions like, “Federal Procurement of Detection Dogs,” “National Standards &amp; Certification for Explosives Detection Dogs” and “Career Options for Detection Dogs: Options &amp; Specialties within Detection Work.”\n\n\n\nBut the annual gathering since 2017 this year has an added sense of urgency. Terrorism is on the rise and creating much greater demand for detection dogs — while a shortage of U.S.-bred dogs available to detect explosives remains stubbornly persistent.&nbsp;All told, the U.S. government purchases approximately 90 percent of its detection dogs from Europe and other locales. The best dogs tend to be retained for use in Europe, where the U.S. finds itself competing against military competitors Russia and China for the same dogs.\n\n\n\nThe government’s first in-depth examination in 15 years of domestically bred working dogs warned last year that the U.S. remains dangerously short of this key frontline defense against terror attacks and for critical security duties such as bomb sniffing and narcotics interdiction.\n\n\n\nThe federal government “has faced a chronic shortage of domestically bred working dogs qualified for use by both the Department of Defense and other federal agencies. As adversaries, both peer and near-peer, become more adept in circumventing detection systems, the need for working dogs has steadily increased to address security vulnerabilities.”\n\n\n\n“The lack of a robust domestic supply of working dogs creates increased supply chain risk and may threaten the ability of departments and agencies that utilize working dogs to maintain readiness if the supply from foreign markets is contested or interrupted for an extended period,” the 157-page&nbsp;report&nbsp;concluded.\n\n\n\nThe federal government&nbsp;currently maintains&nbsp;approximately 5,000 working dogs across four departments — the departments of Defense, Homeland Security, Justice and State. But only 7 percent are bred domestically, and the rest are imported.\n\n\n\nThe American Kennel Club established its Detection Dog Task Force in 2016 to help address the problem. The task force has interviewed key participants involved in explosives detection, including experts from academia, government, military, policing, training and breeding. Subsequently, the AKC and others launched initiatives focused on developing a domestic program for detection dog breeding.\n\n\n\nThese include the Patriotic Puppy Program,&nbsp;which provides one-on-one assistance to breeders&nbsp; of Labrador Retrievers, German Shorthaired Pointers and other sporting dogs, interested in learning how to raise a puppy suitable for advanced training as a detection dog. Auburn University, Johns Hopkins University and the University of Pennsylvania&nbsp;are also developing their own programs to improve domestic breeding. The Department of Defense maintains a modest breeding program at its kennels at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio. And in late 2021 Congress authorized a pilot program to improve acquisition&nbsp;of U.S.-bred working dogs that has yet to get off the ground.\n\n\n\nBut these combined efforts are far from sufficient to&nbsp;reverse a problem in which the government’s opaque procurement process and uncertain requirements play a starring role.\n\n\n\nMany domestic canine breeders have the capability to produce exceptional working dogs, the government report found, but the “onerous procurement process of the government discourages vendors from supplying canines to the government sector of the market. The nonstandard requirements, evaluation system, and— most importantly—the uncertainty of the government’s future demand for working dogs makes it difficult for vendors to continue doing business with the government.”\n\n\n\nThe conference on detection dogs is taking place after a string of reports has warned of a dangerous uptick in domestic terrorism. One of the most pointed was authored by the non-partisan Center for Strategic and International Security.\n\n\n\n“There has been a significant rise in the number of domestic terrorist attacks and plots at demonstrations in the United States, according to new CSIS data,”&nbsp;the organization said, adding that “the most frequent targets of attacks were government, military and law enforcement agencies, who are increasingly at the center of domestic terrorism by extremists of all ideologies.”\n\n\n\nWith American lives in the balance, there has never been a more critical moment for coming together and addressing this national security deficit.\n\n\n\nSheila Goffe is vice president of government relations for the American Kennel Club.",

        "description": "Pennsylvania Democrats are holding onto slim leads in the state’s closely watched gubernatorial and Senate races, according to new polling. \n\n\n\nA Trafalgar Group poll found that Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who is running against celebrity doctor Mehmet Oz for Senate, and Attorney General Josh Shapiro, who is facing Doug Mastiano in the race for governor, were leading in their midterm matchups.\n\n\n\nFetterman was up by nearly five points in the Senate race, earning 48.4 percent to Oz’s 43.5 percent, while Shapiro garnered 48.6 percent in the state’s gubernatorial race, about four points higher than  Mastriano 44.7 percent.\n\n\n\nBoth Republican candidates won their primaries after being backed by former President Trump, who is set to rally for the pair in Pennsylvania this September. \n\n\n\nThe former president lost the swing state to then-candidate Biden in the 2020 presidential election — after winning it in 2016 over then-Democrat nominee Hillary Clinton.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSeeking to replace retiring Sen. Pat Toomey (R), Fetterman and Oz have waged social media war against one another. \n\n\n\nLast week, the Democrat fundraised half a million dollars after a campaign video of Oz mispronouncing the name of a grocery store went viral.\n\n\n\nTV's \"Dr. Oz,\" in turn, has knocked Fetterman’s liberal policies and pitched himself as \"a Conservative Republican to cure what’s wrong with Washington\" and \"cure our country’s ills.\"\n\n\n\nIn the gubernatorial race, a group of former Pennsylvania Republican officials, including former Rep. Charlie Dent, endorsed Democrat Shapiro over their own party’s nominee in July. Dent called Mastriano “an extremist who is a threat to the rule of law and the constitutional order.”\n\n\n\nBut eight of nine Pennsylvania GOP congressmen jointly endorsed Mastriano earlier this month, calling the Republican “a better option and alternative” to Shapiro.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConducted Aug. 15-18, the Trafalgar Group survey polled 1,096 likely 2022 general election voters. The margin of error was 2.9 percent.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto (D) leads her challenger by 7 points in the closely watched Nevada Senate race, according to a new Suffolk University-Reno Gazette-Journal poll.\n\n\n\nForty-five percent of respondents indicated support for Cortez Masto, compared to 38 percent support for former state Attorney General Adam Laxalt (R). Twelve percent said they were undecided, while 3 percent said they would support none of the polled candidates.\n\n\n\nThe nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the Nevada contest as one of four toss-up races that could determine which party will control the Senate beginning next year.\n\n\n\nDemocrats are facing historical and political headwinds going into this year’s midterm elections. But many in the party are hoping a series of recent victories can counter voter frustration about issues such as inflation and avoid a shellacking in November that leads to unified GOP control of Congress.\n\n\n\nInflation and the economy polled as the top issue for voters, according to the poll, at 34 percent, followed by 13 percent who said abortion was their top concern. \n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has been managing midterm expectations, saying last week that Republicans had a better chance of flipping the House than the Senate. That view aligns with analysts such as FiveThirtyEight, which as of Sunday gave Republicans a 78 percent chance of winning House control and a 37 percent chance of flipping the upper chamber.\n\n\n\n“Senate races are just different — they’re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” McConnell said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe remark was an apparent snide to candidates such as Laxalt, who was backed by former President Trump in the primary. Many Republican nominees in battleground Senate races — such as Pennsylvania, Ohio and Georgia — received Trump’s backing in their primaries. \n\n\n\nThe poll also found that incumbent Nevada Gov. Steve Sisolak (D) edged out his Trump-backed opponent, Joe Lombardo, by 3 percentage points. Forty-three percent of respondents indicated support for Sisolak’s reelection, compared to 40 percent for Lombardo.\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report similarly rates the gubernatorial race as a toss-up.\n\n\n\nThe former president, who himself is weighing a third bid for the White House, has endorsed candidates across the country, largely focusing on those who support his unfounded claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election. Election fraud clocked in as the third most important issue in the poll, with 11 percent of respondents saying it was their top concern this year.\n\n\n\n“Laxalt and Lombardo are up big in Nevada!” Trump posted on Truth Social on Sunday, without pointing to data supporting his claim. \n\n\n\nThe Suffolk University-Reno Gazette-Journal poll was conducted between Aug. 14 and Aug. 17 with 500 likely Nevada voters.",

        "description": "Mark Gurman, reporting for Bloomberg:\n\n\n  As I reported last week, the company is planning to announce the iPhone 14 at an event on Sept. 7. It would be the earliest iPhone launch since 2016 and be followed by the new device going on sale Sept. 16 — about a week ahead of last year’s schedule.\n\nThe event will be on the Wednesday after Labor Day, an atypical day for Apple product launches. It signals that the company wanted to leave that Tuesday free. Why? Perhaps because press and other guests will need a travel day after the Monday holiday.\n\n\nWhile Apple generally prefers Tuesdays for product introduction events, I don’t think Apple has ever held an event on the Tuesday after Labor Day.\n\n\n&nbsp;★&nbsp;",

        "description": "Kyle Hendricks hasn&#8217;t pitched since early July due to a strain in his right shoulder, and it appears as though his 2022 season is over.  The Cubs right-hander told reporters (including MLB.com&#8217;s Jordan Bastian) that he is trying to get healthy in order to have a normal offseason and ramp-up period for the 2023 season, and to that end, Hendricks plans to restart a throwing program at the Cubs&#8217; training complex in Arizona this week.\nHendricks underwent an MRI earlier this month that didn&#8217;t reveal any structural damage, according to Chicago manager David Ross.  However, it seemed even at the time that Hendricks&#8217; 2022 campaign was probably over, as Ross said that getting Hendricks back this season wasn&#8217;t &#8220;a top priority&#8221; compared to the bigger-picture desire to make sure the veteran is healthy.\nAs such, it looks like Hendricks will wrap up his ninth MLB season with a 4.80 ERA over 84 1/3 innings.  This marks two underwhelming seasons in a row for Hendricks, who has a 4.78 ERA/4.62 SIERA in 265 1/3 frames since the start of the 2021 campaign.  His once-elite walk rate fell to a still-decent 6.7% this year, but combined with a big increase in hard-hit ball rate, Hendricks&#8217; low-velocity, contact-heavy arsenal wasn&#8217;t fooling many batters.\nWhile the 2020 season was only 60 games long, Hendricks was still a capable front-of-the-rotation starter as recently as two years ago, when he finished ninth in NL Cy Young Award voting.  Sometimes underrated as a key piece of the Cubs&#8217; success over the last decade, Hendricks was a very solid member of the rotation from 2014-20, with a 3.12 ERA over 1047 1/3 innings of an old-school approach that relied more on command and soft contact rather than missed bats.  The 2016 season was a peak for Hendricks, both due to his league-best 2.13 ERA and his big role in the Cubs&#8217; World Series triumph.\nWith the Cubs now in a rebuild, it&#8217;s safe to guess that if Hendricks hadn&#8217;t been struggling with both performance and injury over the last two seasons, he might very well have joined the long list of veterans traded away.  Hendricks&#8217; salary was also a big factor &#8212; 2023 is the final season of the four-year, $55.5MM extension he signed in March 2019, and he is owed $14MM for the 2023 season.\nThe Cubs also have a $16MM club option on the right-hander&#8217;s services for 2024, but at this point, it would seem like Chicago will buy that option out for $1.5MM unless Hendricks can turn things around next year.  Or, if a bounce-back year is in the cards, that option decision could be in the hands of another team, if the Cubs looked to finally trade Hendricks after all.  Since it doesn&#8217;t seem like Hendricks has much trade value at the present, he&#8217;ll need to return healthy and pitch well in the first half of 2023 before we get more clarity on his future either in Chicago or as a potential trade chip.",

        "description": "With the school year starting and a new slew of books to be purchased and read, I&#8217;ve been looking for books, particularly popular &#8220;classics&#8221; or &#8220;great books&#8221; that are published either with larger margins or even interleaved copies (books in which every other page is blank and meant for writing extensive notes).\nWithin the bible publishing space (and especially for study bibles), these features seem a lot more common as people want to write more significant marginalia or even full pages of text against or opposite of what they&#8217;re reading within the book itself. Given the encouragement many teachers give for students to actively annotate their books for class discussions as well as people commonly doing this, why isn&#8217;t it more common for them to recommend or require texts with ample margins?\nAlmost all of the published mass market paperbacks I see of series like Penguin Classics or Signet classics have the smallest possible margins and no interlinear space for writing notes directly in books. Often hard covers will have slightly larger margins, but generally most publishers are putting 1/2 inch or 3/4&#8243; margins on their classics series (Penguin Classics, Everyman Library, Signet (a paltry 1/4 inch usually), Library of America, Norton Classics, Wordsworth Classics, Dover, etc.)\nFor those wanting ample margins for active &#8220;reading with a pen in hand&#8221; are there any publishers that do a great job of wider margins on classics? Which publishers or editions do others like or recommend for this sort of reading?\nAre there any book sales platforms that actually list the size of margins of their books? (I never seen one myself.)\nWhat can consumers do to encourage publishers to change these practices?\nI&#8217;ve seen only a few select titles from very few publishers that do things like this. Examples include:\n\nGladius Books&#8217; Huckleberry Finn\nAnnotate Books&#8217; Marcus Aurelius, which has 1.8&#8243; lined margins\nThe Folio Society has slightly better margins on their texts, but they&#8217;re generally larger hardcover collectors&#8217; editions that are dramatically more expensive than is practicable for students on a budget. ($80+ versus $5-10)\n\nIf I can&#8217;t find anything useful, I&#8217;m tempted to self-publish custom versions of wide margin or interleaved books otherwise. Something in the inch to inch and a half margin size for commonly used texts in literature classes should be much more commonplace.",

        "description": "Riverside\n\nThe Rhone at Arles on a lovely Summer evening.\n\nQuote of the Day\n\n&#8220;Men are the only animals who devote themselves assiduously to making one another unhappy. It is, I suppose, one of their godlike qualities.&#8221;\n\n\nH.L. Mencken \n\n\nMusical alternative to the morning’s radio news\nLiam Clancy | And the Band Played Waltzing Matilda\nLink\nFirst time I’ve heard this. Explains why my Aussie and NZ friends take Anzac Day so seriously.\n\nLong Read of the Day\nThe Evolutionary Mystery of Menopause\nFascinating essay in Nautilus by David Barash, an evolutionary biologist who has specialised in animal behaviour and is now emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Washington.\n\nAround age 50, women stop ovulating, a biological mystery because reproduction is the sine qua non of evolutionary success, and yet menopause occurs at an age when women often have a few decades of healthy life ahead of them. Men keep producing sperm (albeit fewer and less viable) into their eighth and even ninth decades. For women, it’s not about becoming unable to make eggs, since every girl is born with all that she will ever have, which await maturation and release. The “how” of menopause is well understood; it is brought on by a dramatic reduction in endocrine hormones, notably estrogen.\nBut why has selection favored this rapid and consequential decline, causing women’s endocrine machinery to poop out when it does? What are the ultimate, evolutionary reasons? If you like mystery stories, you’re in for a treat. Mark Twain noted that it was easy to stop smoking; he’d done it hundreds of times. It’s easy to explain menopause; there are many hypotheses, albeit fewer than a hundred. There is now a leading candidate, the grandmother hypothesis, which I first described in Nautilus in 2016, and which has been reinforced by two new studies…\n\nNot my field at all. But I found it interesting. Hope you do too.\n\nAI-generated art illustrates another problem with technology\nYesterday’s Observer column…\n\nIt all started with the headline over an entry in Charlie Warzel’s Galaxy Brain newsletter in the Atlantic: “Where Does Alex Jones Go From Here?” This is an interesting question because Jones is an internet troll so extreme that he makes Donald Trump look like Spinoza. For many years, he has parlayed a radio talkshow and a website into a comfortable multimillion-dollar business peddling nonsense, conspiracy theories, falsehoods and weird merchandise to a huge tribe of adherents. And until 4 August he had got away with it. On that day, though, he lost an epic defamation case brought against him by parents of children who died in the 2012 Sandy Hook massacre – a tragedy that he had consistently ridiculed as a staged hoax; a Texas jury decided that he should pay nearly $50m in damages for publishing this sadistic nonsense.\nWarzel’s newsletter consisted of an interview with someone who had worked for the Jones media empire in its heyday and, as such, was interesting. But what really caught my eye was the striking illustration that headed the piece. It showed a cartoonish image of a dishevelled Jones in some kind of cavern surrounded by papers, banknotes, prescriptions and other kinds of documents. Rather good, I thought, and then inspected the caption to see who the artist was. The answer: “AI art by Midjourney”.\nAh! Midjourney is a research lab and also the name of its program that creates images from textual descriptions using a machine-learning system similar to OpenAI’s Dall-E system…\n\nRead on\n\nMarina Hyde on Britain’s next Prime Minister, Ms Truss\nGloriously acerbic Guardian column:\n\nFor now, Truss maintains the remorselessly upbeat demeanour of a holiday rep who regards herself as the life and soul of the booze cruise, and whose lower back is tattooed with the Chinese symbols for “Only depressing people get depressed”. The overwhelming vibe you get from her campaign appearances is that she is going to make destitution fun for people. The logic puts me in mind of the Depression-era dancehall marathons epitomised in They Shoot Horses, Don’t They?, where desperate competitors are given the opportunity to twirl, then lurch, then stagger their way out of poverty. Or to death – whichever comes sooner.\nThe fact that Liz will take over a country whose own sewage is literally lapping at its shores feels too on the nose – an image so hammily overdone it could have been crafted by recidivist newspaper columnist Boris Johnson. Which, in a more literal way, I suppose it was. We’re both the sick man of Europe and the dirty protest of Europe. Johnson – who wouldn’t dream of swimming in his own excrement, either literally or metaphorically – is currently on his second foreign holiday in a fortnight, displacing whole hogsheads of the Aegean in the cause of not giving a toss about what happens to the country he let down in the way he has always let everyone down in the end…\n\n\nMy commonplace booklet\n\nFrom Saturday’s Financial Times.\nGuess the weekly rent. Answer tomorrow.\n\nThis Blog is also available as a daily email. If you think that might suit you better, why not subscribe? One email a day, Monday through Friday, delivered to your inbox.

        "description": "Sure, it&#8217;s just one game out of 162, but this one stings a little bit more.\nThe Rockies were knocked down and nearly out — twice — but ultimately lost a 9-8, 11-inning thriller to San Francisco on Sunday afternoon at Coors Field.\nThe loss denied the Rockies a three-game sweep and the end came on an abrupt double play. Colorado&#8217;s Sam Hilliard, tagging up from second on Wynton Bernard&#8217;s flyball to right fielder LaMonte Wade Jr., was thrown out at third base on a swipe tag by Evan Longoria that caught Hilliard&#8217;s foot. McMahon was originally ruled safe on the play, but the call was overturned on replay review.\n&#8220;(Longoria) has been doing that for a lot of years,&#8221; said Rockies third baseman Ryan McMahon. &#8220;That move, going out and getting that ball, and knowing that that was the only way he was going to have a chance &#8212; quick catch, quick tag on the foot &#8212; is amazing.&#8221;\nManager Bud Black said: &#8220;Bang, bang play. It didn&#8217;t go our way.&#8221;\nSan Francisco scored the winning run on Wilmer Flores&#8217; sacrifice fly in the top of the 11th that drove home Mike Yastrzemski, who started the inning at second and advanced to third on Wade&#8217;s sacrifice bunt.\nThe Giants took an 8-6 lead in the 10th on an RBI single by Thairo Estrada and a run-scoring double by Austin Wynns off Robert Stephenson.\nBut the Rockies tied the game in the bottom of the frame with RBIs singles by McMahon and Charlie Blackmon. They had a chance to win the game but Dominic Leone got Hilliard to pop out to third with the bases loaded.\nColorado, which tied a season-high with three home runs, rallied for three runs in the eighth to tie the game, 6-6. McMahon ripped a one-out double into the right-field corner off Tyler Rogers and Blackmon drove in McMahon with a single to right off Jarlin Garcia. Up stepped Randal Grichuk, who unloaded on Garcia&#8217;s 1-1 changeup, driving it 462 feet to left-center to tie the game.\nThe Giants looked to have the game well in hand in the seventh inning. With the score tied 2-2 and the bases loaded, Rockies left-hander Kyle Freeland was against the ropes, having just walked J.D. Davis. Manager Bud Black visited the mound to converse with Freeland about how to pitch to Longoria, who was coming to the plate.\n&#8220;We talked strategy,&#8221; said Black, who had no intention of taking Freeland out of the game. &#8220;We talked about the sequence of pitches we&#8217;re going to use to get (Longoria). Kyle felt good about the plan and I trusted Kyle in the situation. I trust Kyle Freeland to make pitches.&#8221;\nBut on Freeland&#8217;s first pitch &#8212; a 92.6 mph fastball, low and inside &#8212; Longoria launched a grand slam into the left-field bleachers. Longoria&#8217;s first grand slam since May 6, 2013, put San Francisco ahead, 6-2.\n&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how he hit that pitch,&#8221; Freeland said. &#8220;It was one of those pitches that we determined we were going to throw hard and in, with a fastball. I had no intention of throwing a strike, and I didn&#8217;t throw a strike.\n&#8220;He ended up barrelling it and all I can do is tip my cap to him for a swing like that on a pitch like that.&#8221;\nFreeland&#8217;s Jekyll-and-Hyde season continues &#8212; good one start, bad the next. He&#8217;s now 7-8 with a 4.93 ERA after giving up six runs (five earned) on seven hits. He walked three and struck out five.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Ryan McMahon endures sad glove story on bizarre second-inning play\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMoneyball: MLB&#8217;s big-spending losers and frugal winners of 2022\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBaseball edges closer to implementing automatic strike zone in major leagues\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Ryan Feltner passes test, Wynton Bernard delivers in win over Giants\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Jose Iglesias, who defected from Cuba, reaches 10 years in majors\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\nBefore Longoria&#8217;s blast in the seventh, Freeland weathered a tough, and unlucky second. Longoria, who finished a triple short of the cycle, lined a 107.4 mph double off the screen in extreme left field to lead off the inning. Then Thairo Estrada hit a hard grounder to McMahon at third, who set up to make a routine play only to see the ball go through the webbing of his glove.\nWith no outs and runners on first and second, Brandon Crawford hit an RBI single through the left side.

        "description": "CNN anchor Jim Acosta clashed with former acting Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Chad Wolf on Sunday over his claims of election fraud. \n\n\n\nThe exchange quickly became heated as Acosta pushed Wolf, who served under former President Trump, to say whether President Biden justly won the last election.\n\n\n\n\"Who won the 2020 election?\" Acosta asked after Wolf expressed concern over voter fraud and irregularities.\n\n\n\n\"Obviously Joe Biden is president,\" the former HHS secretary responded.\n\n\n\n\"No, no, no,\" Acosta retorted. \"Do you believe that he won that election fair and square?\"\n\n\n\nWolf again answered the question indirectly.\n\n\n\n\"Joe Biden is president,\" Wolf said, adding that he didn't have all of the evidence needed to conclude that Biden's victory was legitimate.\n\n\n\nWolf cited Wisconsin's use of drop boxes to back up his claims of fraud, noting that polling consistently shows a lack of confidence in election security among Americans.\n\n\n\n\"There are a number of irregularities, illegalities and fraud,\" Wolf said before Acosta interrupted.\n\n\n\n\"Not enough to alter the outcome of the election,\" the CNN anchor shot back.\n\n\n\nAcota slammed Wolf, accusing him of undermining democracy and leading Americans down a \"path of lies.\"\n\n\n\n\"It sounds like you've watched one too many conspiracy theories on the 2020 election,\" Acosta said as the segment came to a close.\n\n\n\nTrump and his political allies have repeatedly pushed baseless claims that the previous presidential election was stolen. \n\n\n\nMany Republicans have embraced the narrative as part of their campaigns during the ongoing midterm elections, including GOP nominees for secretary of state in states including Wyoming and Arizona.",

        "description": "Former President Trump on Saturday called his former Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao “crazy” and accused her and her family of working to “get rich on China.” \n\n\n\nTrump’s attack came in a TruthSocial post knocking Chao’s husband, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), for saying the GOP might face a tight race to flip the Senate, in part due to \"candidate quality.\"\n\n\n\n“Why do Republicans Senators allow a broken down hack politician, Mitch McConnell, to openly disparage hard working Republican candidates for the United States Senate,\" Trump wrote. \n\n\n\n\"This is such an affront to honor and to leadership. He should spend more time (and money!) helping them get elected, and less time helping his crazy wife and family get rich on China!” \n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Chao and McConnell for comment. \n\n\n\nChao’s father founded the Chinese shipping company Foremost Group, and her sister is the CEO. \n\n\n\nThough Chao had no formal ties to the business, she and McConnell both faced criticism over her potential conflicts of interest during her time in the White House, and whether she used government resources to support her family’s business.\n\n\n\nAppointed by Trump in 2017, Chao reportedly didn’t disclose her family’s affiliation with Foremost Group during her confirmation hearing. \n\n\n\nA key point of concern was Chao’s continued media appearances with her father even after assuming office, which her team reportedly countered were opportunities to share her story as the first Chinese-American and Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position.\n\n\n\nChao split her support when her husband and boss began feuding during Trump’s time in office, reportedly saying, “I stand by my man — both of them.”\n\n\n\nChao resigned after the Jan. 6, 2021 attacks on the U.S. Capitol. After her resignation, the Justice Department declined to pursue an ethics probe into how she used her position. \n\n\n\nTrump has lambasted McConnell as “disloyal,” though the minority leader has said he’d back a 2024 reelection bid if the former president wins the GOP nomination. \n\n\n\nMcConnell has been managing midterm expectations in recent weeks, saying on Thursday that Republicans have a better chance of flipping the House than the Senate. \n\n\n\n“I think there’s probably a greater likelihood the House flips than the Senate. Senate races are just different — they’re statewide, candidate quality has a lot to do with the outcome,” he said. \n\n\n\nHis comments come after a number of Trump-backed candidates won the GOP nomination in key battleground states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Georgia. \n\n\n\n&nbsp;",

        "description": "OLATHE, Kan.— A decisive statewide vote in favor of abortion rights in traditionally conservative Kansas was confirmed with a partial hand recount, with fewer than 100 votes changing after the last county reported results Sunday.\nNine of the state’s 105 counties recounted their votes at the request of Melissa Leavitt, who has pushed for tighter election laws. A longtime anti-abortion activist, Mark Gietzen, is covering most of the costs. Gietzen acknowledged in an interview that it was unlikely to change the outcome.\nA no vote in the referendum signaled a desire to keep existing abortion protections and a yes vote was for allowing the Legislature to tighten restrictions or ban abortion. After the recounts, “no” votes lost 87 votes and “yes” gained 6 votes.\nEight of the counties reported their results by the state’s Saturday deadline, but Sedgwick County delayed releasing its final count until Sunday because spokeswoman Nicole Gibbs said some of the ballots weren’t separated into the correct precincts during the initial recount and had to be resorted Saturday. She said the number of votes cast overall didn’t change.\nA larger than expected turnout of voters on Aug. 2 rejected a ballot measure that would have removed protections for abortion rights from the Kansas Constitution and given to the Legislature the right to further restrict or ban abortion. It failed by 18 percentage points, or 165,000 votes statewide.\nThe vote drew broad attention because it was the first state referendum on abortion since the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June.\nGietzen, of Wichita, and Leavitt, of Colby, in far northwestern Kansas, have both suggested there might have been problems without pointing to many examples.\nRecounts increasingly are tools to encourage supporters of a candidate or cause to believe an election was stolen rather than lost. A wave of candidates who have echoed former President Donald Trump’s lie that the 2020 election was rigged have called for recounts after losing their own Republican primaries.\n \n\nKansas law requires a recount if those who ask for it prove they can cover the counties’ costs. The counties pay only if the outcome changes.\nLeavitt and Gietzen provided credit cards to pay for the nearly $120,000 cost, according to the secretary of state’s office. Leavitt has an online fundraising page. Gietzen also said he is getting donations from a network built over three decades in the anti-abortion movement.\nGietzen said Sunday he doesn’t accept the results of the Sedgwick County recount because of the discrepancy about the way the ballots were sorted and because some of the recount happened Saturday without outside observers present to watch.\n“We still don’t know what happened in Sedgwick County. I won’t pay for Sedgwick County,” he said.\nHe said he’s also concerned about the results statewide because of a report out of Cherokee county in southeast Kansas about the results of one county election being transposed between two candidates when the results were transferred on a thumb drive from one voting machine to a tabulating machine.\nGietzen said he plans to file a lawsuit Monday seeking a full statewide recall.\nGietzen said he won’t publicly report the names of private donors helping him finance the recount, even though a state ethics official says it’s required. Gietzen, who leads a small GOP group, the Kansas Republican Assembly, argues that he’s not campaigning for the anti-abortion measure but is instead promoting election integrity.\nVotes were recounted in Douglas County, home to the University of Kansas’ main campus; Johnson County, in suburban Kansas City; Sedgwick County, home to Wichita, Shawnee County, home to Topeka; and Crawford, Harvey, Jefferson, Lyon and Thomas counties. Abortion opponents lost all of those counties except Thomas.\nIn Jefferson County, the margin remained the same, with the pro- and anti-amendment totals declining by four votes each. Linda Buttron, the county clerk, blamed the change on things like ovals not being darkened and “the challenges of hand counting ballots.”\nIn Lyon County, the anti-amendment group lost a vote. County Clerk and Election Officer Tammy Vopat said she wasn’t sure the reason. But she noted: “You have to factor in human error.”\nJohnson County, the most populous in Kansas, faced the biggest recounting challenge because it had the most ballots. It pulled in workers from different departments to help. The sorting process took so long that the actual counting didn’t begin until Thursday afternoon.\n“This is almost like doing an Ironman triathlon and having to add on another marathon at the end,” said Fred Sherman, the county’s Election Commissioner. “So it is quite a gargantuan process.”",

        "description": "A car bomb exploded in Moscow on Saturday night killing Russian commentator Daria Dugina, the daughter of nationalist philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, according to Russian authorities. \n\n\n\nInvestigations are reportedly ongoing, according to a Telegram post from the Russian Investigative Committee, and the committee suspects the incident was premeditated. \n\n\n\nThe father-daughter pair had reportedly attended a festival outside Moscow just before the incident, and an device beneath Dugina’s Toyota Land Cruiser exploded as she was driving away.\n\n\n\nAccording to the BBC, the 29-year-old and her father were initially set to leave the festival in the same car, leading some to suspect Dugin was the intended target of any attack.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDugina was designated for sanctions by both the United States and the United Kingdom earlier this year for propagating online disinformation about the Russian invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. noted Dugina was chief editor of United World International, which reportedly shared disinformation and suggested Ukraine would “perish” if it became part of NATO. Her father was associated with the website Geopolitica, which allegedly published false accusations that the U.S. and NATO provoked war with Russia. \n\n\n\nThe U.K. sanctioned Dugina as “a frequent and high-profile contributor of disinformation in relation to Ukraine and the Russian invasion of Ukraine on various online platforms.”\n\n\n\nDugina was outspoken in her support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to the Washington Post, and a proponent of her father's geopolitical theories.\n\n\n\n“This is liberal totalitarianism, this is liberal fascism, this is Western totalitarianism,” Dugina said of what she thinks Russia is fighting in an interview shortly before her death, per the New York Times. \n\n\n\nDubbed “Putin’s Brain” in a 2014 Foreign Affairs profile, Dugin touts Eurasianism and nationalist ideas of Russian expansion to quash U.S. power. The exact relationship between Dugin and Putin is not clear.\n\n\n\nNo party immediately claimed responsibility for Saturday's bombing and Russian President Vladimir Putin hasn’t yet issued comment, but some Russians have moved to blame Ukraine, per the New York Times. \n\n\n\nAn advisor to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Sunday that “Ukraine certainly had nothing to do with yesterday’s explosion. We are not a criminal state like the Russian Federation, much less a terrorist one.”\n\n\n\nIn the wake of Dugina’s death and ahead of Ukraine’s Independence Day, Zelensky has warned of Russian escalation.\n\n\n\n“We should be aware that this week Russia may try to do something particularly nasty, something particularly cruel,” Zelensky said in an address to Ukrainians.",

At one point, one of the officers appears to slam the individual’s head into the ground.\n\n\n\nArkansas State Police on Sunday evening said they had opened an investigation into the officers’ use of force during the incident, which occurred outside a convenience store.\n\n\n\nThe agency identified the individual in the video as Randall Worcester, 27, of Goose Creek, S.C. State police said he was charged with second-degree battery, resisting arrest, refusal to submit, possessing an instrument of crime, criminal trespass, criminal mischief, terroristic threatening and second-degree assault. \n\n\n\nWorcester was transported to a local hospital for treatment and was later jailed following his release, the agency said.“The state police investigation will be limited to the use of physical force by the deputies and police officer,” the statement reads. “Upon completion of the investigation, the case file will be submitted to the Crawford County prosecuting attorney who will determine whether the use of force by the law enforcement officers was consistent with Arkansas laws.”\n\n\n\nThe Crawford County Sheriff’s Office said it had requested state police open the investigation.\n\n\n\n“In reference to the video circulating social media involving two Crawford County deputies, we have requested that Arkansas State Police conduct the investigation, and the deputies have been suspended pending the outcome of the investigation,” the Crawford County Sheriff's Office said in a statement.\n\n\n\n“I hold all my employees accountable for their actions and will take appropriate measures in this matter,” the statement continued.\n\n\n\nThe Mulberry Police Department issued a similar statement, saying one of its employees was the third officer involved and had been placed on leave.\n\n\n\n“The Arkansas State Police have been asked to investigate the incident,” the statement read.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The officer is on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation,” it continued. “The City of Mulberry and the Mulberry Police Department takes these investigations very seriously and holds all their officers accountable for their actions.&nbsp; We will take the appropriate actions at the conclusion of the investigation.”\n\n\n\nMulberry is located roughly 20 miles northeast of Fort Smith, Ark.\n\n\n\nUpdated: 10:16 p.m.",

        "description": "Liam Hoare is the Europe editor for Moment Magazine and author of “The Vienna Briefing” newsletter on Austrian politics and culture.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nVIENNA — Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer has been in office for less than a year and is already fighting for his political life. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn August 1, a pair of stories simultaneously appeared in Austria’s two widely circulated freesheets, Heute and Österreich, quoting senior sources from his People’s Party (ÖVP) and outlining their “secret plan” to defenestrate the former interior minister.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMere weeks after becoming chancellor, Nehammer had been faced with the invasion of Ukraine and its effects on his country, which is heavily dependent on Russian fossil fuels. His handling of the subsequent energy and cost-of-living crises has been directionless and ineffectual, with the rate of inflation hitting its highest levels since March 1975. And he hasn’t helped himself either, joking at a recent party conference that unless the ÖVP got a grip on inflation, it would be left with only two choices: “alcohol or psychotropic drugs.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the national level, the party’s polling figures are plummeting, and Nehammer is now the least popular head of government in the world. Were an election held tomorrow, his party would likely finish third, behind both the Social Democrats (SPÖ) and the far-right Freedom Party (FPÖ). This is all bad enough on its own, of course, but what’s really unnerving senior party sources is the trickle-down effect at the state and local levels, as the ÖVP has found itself in the midst of a larger internal crisis. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis September, the party faces a key electoral test in Tyrol, an ÖVP heartland where, under normal circumstances, the party would expect to win at least 40 percent of the vote. This time around, however, polling indicates it will be lucky to reach 30 percent. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd if Nehammer were to be dethroned after this Tyrolian vote, but before similar critical electoral tests take place in the states of Lower Austria and Salzburg in early 2023 — though his camp has dismissed this idea as silly speculation — his replacement would then become Austria’s fourth chancellor in just 12 months. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nFormer Chancellor Sebastian Kurz had resigned in October 2021, amid a corruption scandal that saw state prosecutors raid the federal chancellery. His replacement, Alexander Schallenberg, then lasted less than two months, having failed to secure the support of the party’s state governors. Nehammer was their choice — and now they’re experiencing buyer’s remorse.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn one level, the ÖVP’s internal crisis is simply symptomatic of a party that’s been in government, either as the senior or junior coalition partner, since 1986.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe contemporary ÖVP is like a ghost ship, drifting listlessly in the night. In lieu of an overarching political vision, a raison d&#8217;être, its politics are mere clientelism — tax and spending policies catering to key electoral groups like farmers, small business owners and middle-class families. Meanwhile, its corruption scandals — in particular, the “advertising affair” where government funds were used to pay for sexed-up opinion polling favorable to Kurz, investigators believe — arose out of departments like the finance ministry, which have long been in the ÖVP’s grip.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYet, the party’s present predicament appears to run even deeper. The ÖVP is in the throes of an existential crisis, one with roots that are decades deep and reflect tectonic shifts in Austrian electoral politics.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the decades following World War II, the country was politically and economically cleaved in twain between the SPÖ and ÖVP. The two ruled in a grand coalition for two decades, regularly winning between 85 and 90 percent of the vote between them. Then things began to change.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFirst, the ÖVP won an absolute majority in 1966. Then, the SPÖ governed alone from 1971 until 1983 — a period of low unemployment and social liberalization during which, under Bruno Kreisky’s leadership, Austria punched above its weight on the international stage. However, this did not last.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe SPÖ’s loss of that absolute majority gave the ÖVP a taste of things to come. The Social Democrats’ share of the vote declined from 51.03 percent in 1979 to 21.18 percent 40 years later, their broad electoral coalition pulled apart by two emergent political forces: the Green movement in the 1980s and the far-right in the 1990s. Over those years, the ties that bound the urban liberal bourgeoisie to Austria’s diminished working-class grew increasingly loose. And today, their interest in issues, from immigration and human rights to the environment, seem largely irreconcilable.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEven though the ÖVP experienced a similar decline over the same period, winning only 23.99 percent of the vote in the 2013 general election, when Sebastian Kurz finally took over the party in 2017, it led to two knockout election victories. It almost seemed as if he had found a formula for success, using immigration as a wedge issue to draw in far-right voters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn hindsight, however, those victories were a kind of false hope. On one end of the spectrum, that hard line on immigration is among the factors that pushed the ÖVP’s liberal wing into the arms of the New Austria and Liberal Forum (NEOS) party. And on the other end, with Kurz now gone, the party’s far-right voters have slowly drifted back toward their natural home in the FPÖ.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn many ways, Austria has been a forerunner, a preview of the fragmentation and reorganization of electoral politics witnessed in France and Germany in recent years. It signaled the death of two-party politics and rote party allegiance based on class, age and profession, and hailed the emergence of new political forces on the left, center and far-right. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nOver the course of the past 40 years, Austria has evolved from a two-party system to a five-party system, while governing formations like the Ampel left-liberal-green coalition, which once seemed unthinkable and unwieldly, now seem both plausible and desirable to voters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd at the center of the ÖVP’s existential crisis is the crucial realization that the era of the Volkspartei — of the political party as a broad church — is now well and truly over,",

        "description": "It’s the EU institution that keeps on taking hits —&nbsp;years of accusations of staff harassment, overspending, “mafia-style” ruthlessness and, frankly, irrelevance —&nbsp;but won’t fall over.\n\n\n\nThe institution, formally called the European Economic and Social Committee, or EESC, is one of the EU’s oldest, formed in 1958 as a forum for trade unions, employers and civil society groups to offer advice to the bureaucrats crafting Europe’s nascent single market.\n\n\n\nBut over half a century later, the EESC is limping along amid nearly a decade of upbraiding from seemingly all sides. Staffers have complained of harassment going unaddressed, the European Parliament is questioning the institution’s spending and many are wondering whether its advice even offers value to EU institutions that now talk separately with EESC members.\n\n\n\nNow, the EESC is primed for further embarrassment. On September 26, Parliament’s Committee on Budgetary Control is expected to vote on whether to approve the institution’s budget, which was €150 million in 2021, before sending the issue to the full Parliament. MEPs previously withheld EESC budget approval in 2020 and did so again earlier this year — and they are indicating they may do so once again next month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Parliament can’t necessarily stop the EESC from getting its money, it can deal the institution yet another public rebuke while it pushes for further investigations and changes. But the mere fact that Parliament can’t fully extinguish the EESC is part of the problem, critical MEPs said.\n\n\n\n“Something is wrong,” said MEP Tomáš Zdechovský, the committee’s vice chair and a member of the center-right European People’s Party group, when a “zombie committee” costs the EU tens of millions. “I see no reason why we should keep alive ossified committees whose importance is marginal.”\n\n\n\nBuried under years of calls for it to be axed, the EESC is vigorously making the case it should keep breathing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEESC President Christa Schweng told POLITICO the organization was “vital,” arguing that its “influence is more often of a strategic nature” and tough to quantify, given the organization is essentially “a network of networks.”\n\n\n\nThe institution, Schweng said, has strengthened its code of conduct and adopted a “zero tolerance” policy on harassment — a key concern for Parliament. And, Schweng stressed, any delays in addressing harassment complaints were only to better help staff.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It is true that the process took time, but there is a reason for this, namely the search for the best solutions for the victims even beyond pure legal obligations,” she added.\n\n\n\nDisaffected staffers\n\n\n\nOver the years, the EESC has offered thoughts on everything from saving bees, to “space traffic management,” to the “geopolitical impact of energy transition.” Its reports are produced with input from several hundred unpaid EESC “members,” who represent civil society, trade unions and employer groups from across Europe.\n\n\n\nThe EESC itself is also home to 700 permanent staff members that support the EESC members and their process.\n\n\n\nBut since at least 2014, it’s been the EESC’s workplace conduct and spending,&nbsp;not its actual work, that has grabbed attention.\n\n\n\n“It has no added value,” said one former EESC staff member who left after settling a harassment case.\n\n\n\n“Both the [European] Commission and the Parliament today liaise directly with civil society and have consultations,” the former staffer noted. “The opinions of the EESC are costly, rarely timely and with their consensus methodology have nothing to add.”\n\n\n\nThe committee issued 131 non-binding “opinions” in 2020, a year in which its budget was €142.5 million —&nbsp;a ratio its detractors say it out of whack.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother former staff member told POLITICO the EESC was considered a joke by other institutions and had become a “mafia-style” organization rewarding loyalty with promotions and punishing staff who raised basic complaints.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nToxic workplace allegations\n\n\n\nIn Parliament’s decision not to release the EESC budget earlier this year, MEPs called for an external probe into EESC’s handling of several harassment complaints that prompted investigations in 2018 and 2019 from the EU’s anti-fraud office, known as OLAF.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne of the four women who complained of their treatment at the EESC told POLITICO the matter still remains unresolved despite requesting “non-financial compensation,” including an investigation into the root causes of the EESC’s systemic mismanagement.\n\n\n\nParliament also stated that two of the people involved in the complaints are still unsatisfied with their compensation.\n\n\n\nOne point of contention is that Jacek Krawczyk, a target of an EESC workplace bullying investigation, is still an EESC member. Schweng, EESC’s president, said she could not remove him because members are political appointees controlled by EU members.\n\n\n\nKrawczyk was once the leading candidate to be the next EESC president, but the institution’s leadership requested he withdraw his application after a probe into his behavior uncovered reports of him shouting at, belittling and maliciously criticizing staffers, causing mental health problems.\n\n\n\nKrawczyk, who has denied any wrongdoing, claimed he was the target of an orchestrated campaign to undermine his EESC presidential bid. Belgian prosecutors eventually opened a criminal probe into his behavior.\n\n\n\nYet Krawczyk remains one of the EESC’s official members. Krawczyk did not respond to numerous efforts to reach him via Lewiatan, a Polish business and employers’ organization that he represents as vice-president.\n\n\n\nEESC Secretary-General Gianluca Brunetti, who was the institution’s human resources director at the time of the bullying complaints, told POLITICO the organization had responded “promptly” and in accordance with EU regulations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, Brunetti’s promotion to secretary-general rankled EESC critics. Zdechovský, the Parliament budget committee’s vice chair, called the promotion “questionable,” considering the compensation costs and reputational damage caused by the EESC’s handling of the complaints.\n\n\n\n&#8220;I would have expected a proper investigation into the whole matter, not a sweeping under the carpet,&#8221; he said.\n\n\n\nBrunetti pushed back at the claim, describing the secretary-general hiring as “open to internal and external candidates alike,” noting it was published in the Official Journal of the EU.\n\n\n\nA multi-million pandemic per diem\n\n\n\nParliament also raised concerns about EESC spending during the pandemic when it previously refused to release the institution’s budget.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe EESC has historically given its members a per diem allowance for the days they are attending EESC meetings. The funds can be used for food, lodging and local transport (inter-city travel is reimbursed separately). Controversially, the EESC decided to still offer a reduced per diem to its 329 members during the pandemic, even though meetings moved online. The institution ultimately spent €2.3 million on pandemic per diems in 2020.\n\n\n\nMEPs also flagged nearly €1.5 million that the EESC spent in allowances for its most active members to make IT upgrades during the pandemic —&nbsp;and they expressed concern that the larger-than-average allowances were doled out as a flat rate and not based on actual expenses.\n\n\n\nSchweng, the EESC president, noted the members&#8217; allowances were in line with EU standards.\n\n\n\n“I also vigorously reject the unspecified and inaccurate allegation that there are ‘perks’ offered to staff,” she said.\n\n\n\nIsabel García Muñoz, a socialist MEP from Spain, is preparing to deliver to the Parliament’s budget committee a report on September 5 detailing whether the EESC has made enough improvements to justify receiving a sign-off on its budget.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe MEP said “concrete progress” has been made at the institution but it has work that remains.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The committee needs to increase and streamline the cooperation with the Parliament, as well as making its important role, and thus its opinions, even more visible,” she said.  \n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover the Brussels Playbook newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOLITICO’s must-read briefing on what&#8217;s driving the day in Brussels, by Suzanne Lynch and Jakob Hanke Vela.",

        "description": "Mujtaba Rahman is the head of Eurasia Group’s Europe practice and the author of POLITICO’s Beyond the Bubble column. He tweets at @Mij_Europe.\n\n\n\nRussia’s invasion of Ukraine is about to enter its seventh month, with the conflict looking like it&#8217;s heading toward a messy, unstable stalemate. And one key question that remains is how the European Union will respond as the war prolongs.\n\n\n\nSenior EU officials concede there will likely be a “crunch point” in the fall or early winter, when EU countries start to feel acute domestic economic pain from the crisis, while also being asked to dig even deeper into their pockets and offer more military resources to sustain the Ukrainian economy and war effort.\n\n\n\nTo prepare public opinion for the challenges ahead, many leaders, such as French President Emmanuel Macron, have begun warning their populations that the Ukraine conflict will last for many months, and that the domestic consequences being experienced now are just the start. Macron, for example, has said that France will continue to support Ukraine with military, financial and humanitarian aid until “victory” has been achieved on terms acceptable to Kyiv.\n\n\n\nYet, behind these public statements of support for Ukraine lies a quiet tug-of-war between&nbsp;Germany, France and — before Prime Minister Mario Draghi’s downfall — Italy on the one hand, and Poland, the Baltics and Nordics on the other.\n\n\n\nFrance and Germany continue to have serious misgivings about what a Ukrainian win could entail, and whether the war can be won without an escalation that possibly involves NATO more directly, or Russia’s use of non-conventional weapons. A distinction, therefore, needs to be drawn between what is being said in public, and the private views of Macron, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, and the most senior people around them.\n\n\n\nBut as long as the United States&#8217; support for the Ukraine war effort remains intact, and in the interest of intra-EU unity, Berlin and Paris are unlikely to publicly contradict the position of the bloc’s more hawkish Central and Eastern European member countries.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis means, they’ll be unlikely and unable to push for a diplomatic solution this year, or possibly even next. But the differences of opinion will affect how far and how fast they, and by extension the EU, will go.\n\n\n\nThis will be felt most explicitly in the debate over Russian sanctions, which will become more incremental in the next phase of war, despite Poland, the Baltics, and the Nordic EU states pushing the big-three for faster and tougher energy sanctions against Moscow.\n\n\n\nThe EU will certainly continue to discuss harder-hitting measures, but it’s unlikely to take as quick action as it did on SWIFT, the coal ban and the partial oil embargo that will begin in December.\n\n\n\nThis doesn’t mean more sanctions are unlikely — the EU is still likely to climb to the top of its sanctions ladder by the end of next year, which will involve expanding the oil embargo, as well as targeting Russian nuclear-energy and gas exports. However, additional measures will now take longer and be harder to agree on.\n\n\n\nGiven this political reality, Brussels and EU capitals will instead emphasize other forms of assistance to Ukraine for the remainder of this year and next, including financial aid that will deliver on the EU’s pledge to make €9 billion available to Ukraine this year.\n\n\n\nThis is important, as the Ukrainian state is teetering on the brink of default and is struggling with a €5 billion per month financing gap, which Kyiv believes could undermine the government’s ability to sustain the war. No new EU common borrowing is expected to either support Ukraine or deal with the consequences of war in the EU, but more support in the form of grants and loans for Kyiv is on the cards.\n\n\n\nMilitary assistance will also continue. As will discussions on Ukraine’s integration into EU structures, following the European Council’s decision in June to grant Kyiv “candidate” status — something that could help unlock more financing for Ukraine, anchor the country in the EU and help build momentum for reforms in Kyiv.\n\n\n\nEven though membership negotiations are likely to take a long time, keeping Ukraine’s EU prospects alive will send a clear signal to Russia on the bloc’s commitment to Ukraine, and help sponsor intra-EU cohesion and unity.\n\n\n\nMacron’s aspirations for a broader “European Political Community” are also likely to filter into these discussions, as well as those regarding other countries in the EU’s neighborhood, although that debate is in its early stages.\n\n\n\nThe great unknown, of course, is the trajectory of public opinion on the war.\n\n\n\nBut despite concerns, Macron — more than Scholz — is determined to face down domestic fatigue, especially from the far right and hard left, which have both been traditionally pro-Russian President Vladimir Putin and anti-NATO.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis task will be complicated by his loss of absolute parliamentary majority last month — although the French constitution gives primacy, and substantial independent powers, to the presidency on matters of foreign and defense affairs.\n\n\n\nYet, it is important. Solidarity with Ukraine and solidarity within Europe is likely to be one of the great tests of Macron’s legacy. His European strategy and worldview — the need for the EU to grow a strategic brain and military muscle to match its global importance — will either receive a boost or fail on Europe’s response to the Ukraine war.\n\n\n\nAnd Paris’ position is even more important given early elections in Italy, which will likely produce a far-right government comprised of parties historically more sympathetic to Russia, and the lack of desire to lead from Berlin.\n\n\n\nBut even if there’s a risk of some tapering in the second half of the year – for example, on sanctions and arms — and the approach becomes more understated, it’s hard to see the EU stepping back from its commitment to Ukraine.",

        "description": "KOSTYANTYNIVKA, Ukraine — Ludmila Bohomolova and her husband Mykola know what it means to stay behind after the Russian tanks roll in. The two teachers endured what they describe as five months of hell following the occupation of their village, Pavlivka in eastern Ukraine, earlier this year.\n\n\n\nFor the first three months under Russia, the villagers hid in their cellars, tried to survive on whatever food they had and buried their dead in yards and playgrounds.&nbsp;The only way out was through Russian-controlled territory.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe couple also remained after Pavlivka was recaptured by Ukraine, staying on for another two months with no gas, electricity or running water, under constant bombardment by Russian artillery. It was only after Mykola was injured by shrapnel on July 24 that circumstances forced them to evacuate. “I just didn’t want to leave our home,” Ludmila said. “I was born there, so were our children, and my parents. It was so very difficult to leave everything.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s more stories like these that the Ukrainian government is trying prevent as it begins to carry out what it calls a “mandatory evacuation” of the most contested parts of the country. Under criticism from humanitarian organizations for not having done enough to protect civilians in combat zones, Kyiv is undertaking what Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk has described as “the biggest movement of people in the history of the independent Ukrainian state.” Unable to provide security or essential services for nearly 750,000 people in areas where the fighting is fiercest, the government now insists they should move. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore than 12 million Ukrainians have been displaced by the war, most of them within the country. The government says it expects another 220,000 to evacuate from Donetsk region in east Ukraine before winter. Vereshchuk, who is also the minister for reintegration of temporarily occupied territories, says the evacuation order will be extended to another 500,000 people in areas occupied by Russia or at risk of being so in the regions of Kherson, Zaporizhzhia and Kharkiv.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe mandatory evacuation order marks a departure for Kyiv. Since Russia first invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014, residents of occupied or threatened regions were given little instructions or support to leave, or support for the delivery of essential services like water and transport. “People were left alone with their problems,” said Volodymyr Yavorskyy from the Centre for Civil Liberties, a human rights watchdog.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the shift in policy&nbsp;is controversial,&nbsp;particularly in light of forced deportations&nbsp;of Ukrainians&nbsp;by Russia. Under&nbsp;international law, governments are obliged to do their best to provide essential services during war time; inform citizens of potential dangers; and only move populations if forced by security or military reasons.\n\n\n\nOver 12 million have been displaced by the war since Russia invaded Ukraine | Omar Marques/Getty Images\n\n\n\n“I don’t think [mandatory evacuation is] a very good solution,” said Yavorskyy. “But we have to be clear that actually it’s not forced — people have a choice.” Earlier this month, the international human rights watchdog Amnesty International issued a controversial report, accusing the Ukrainian government of not doing enough to move people away from urban areas and civilian buildings where the armed forces base themselves.\n\n\n\nVereshchuk has framed the evacuation order not as a requirement that people leave their homes, but as the right of citizens to be provided with transport out of danger, financial aid and accommodation in safer areas. Evacuees are given 2,000-3,000 Ukrainian hryvnia (about €50-€80) on arrival, and registered as internally displaced persons to be eligible for continued monthly payments. Under the new rules, those who refuse to leave will be required to sign a paper saying they understand the risks and take responsibility for themselves and their dependents.\n\n\n\nThe deputy prime minister has also called on organizations providing assistance near the front line to ask themselves if the help they’re providing encourages people to remain in danger. “I want people to leave and get help here, instead of there,” Vereshchuk told POLITICO. “If they are brought blankets and water and filters, that won’t save them in the winter. No blanket or warm pillow will help them.”\n\n\n\nVitaly Barabash, the mayor of Avdiivka, a front-line city since 2014, believes the government could go further. Though he has tried to persuade people to leave since late February, some 2,500 residents — about 10 percent of the municipality’s population — including up to 80 children, are still hiding from shelling in basements with no ventilation, lighting or heating.\n\n\n\n“I’d even do forced evacuations for communities like ours,” Barabash said. “A state of war implies limits on rights — it’s war. It shouldn’t go to crazy limits, but to a certain extent you have to take decisions for people. Especially where children are concerned.”\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the state workers, soldiers and volunteers bringing aid to people who have an option to go elsewhere, are risking their lives. “It’s not right,” said Barabash, who says he has got into arguments with his constituents about this. “I also have to go and persuade people, and I have three children too, and if something happens to me, what will my children do?”\n\n\n\nThe longer people spend cut off from the world in bomb shelters, the harder it is for them to decide to leave, said Barabash. “Some say, they have nowhere to go, or no financial means, or they say that they survived 2014-15 and they will survive now,” he said. “Some say, they already left and came back because they ran out of money. And I can’t deny that some are waiting for Russia to come.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;The government has to recognize the scale of difficulty for people to evacuate, said Oleh Tkachenko, a pastor who helped Ludmila Bohomolova, the teacher, leave Pavlivka at the end of July. “There is still a mass of questions: What about property? What about looting? What about compensation? People are losing everything. I’ve suffered this myself,” said Tkachenko, who has been displaced twice, once in 2014 and again after the more recent invasion. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nUkraine has no mechanism of assessing the value of lost or looted property and businesses, never mind for providing compensation. Vereshchuk promises that free accommodation will be provided at least through this winter, and that pensions and other payments will still be made available. But it’s not clear where funding will come from. The minister is hoping international partners will help. “We mean to keep up with payments,” she said. “But we need support so that we can maintain budget liquidity, so that people there know we’re not abandoning them.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the nearly deserted ghost towns of Donetsk region, where many buildings are war-damaged and more are boarded up, many do feel abandoned, and resent what they see as an effort to push them out. Some towns have not been heavily shelled yet, but nonetheless have no water or gas; locals suspect the utilities have been turned off to encourage people to leave. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They can’t force us to go, can they?” said Svitlana, 62, from Kostyantynivka, a city about 20 kilometers from the front line. Her daughter already lost a flat when she was forced to move back home from Donetsk in 2015 — now she is in Lithuania, but Svitlana does not plan to join her to be a “millstone round the children’s necks.” Instead, she’s hoping the war will largely pass the town by, as it did in 2014.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBohomolova, the teacher from Pavlivka, estimates there are still up to 300 people left in her&nbsp;village, including families with children. They are aware of the government’s offers to help them leave. “They know it all. But they’re tied to the home that they built and their things,” she said. “They don’t understand that it can all be destroyed in one moment. I was the same: How can I go? How can I leave it all behind? But now it’s terrifying to think about going back.”\n\n\n\nShe plans to move to the city of Dnipro with her husband, where they’ll share a flat with other family members — seven people altogether. “We’ll manage somehow,” she said. “The most important thing is that we’re still alive.”\n\n\n\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscover the Brussels Playbook newsletter\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPOLITICO’s must-read briefing on what&#8217;s driving the day in Brussels, by Suzanne Lynch and Jakob Hanke Vela.",

        "description": "Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) on Sunday said it would be “very difficult” for her to support Sens. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.) or Ted Cruz (R-Texas) after they objected to Electoral College votes on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\n\n\nCheney told ABC “This Week” co-anchor Jonathan Karl that both Ivy League-educated senators \"know better.\"\n\n\n\n“Both of whom know exactly what the role of Congress is in terms of our constitutional obligations with respect to presidential elections, and yet, both of whom took steps that fundamentally threatened the constitutional order and structure in the aftermath of the last election,” she said. “So in my view, they both have made themselves unfit for future office.”\n\n\n\nCheney on Tuesday lost her primary to Harriet Hageman, a former ally who was backed by former President Trump and has supported unfounded claims of election fraud in the 2020 presidential election. \n\n\n\nThe Wyoming congresswoman has been an unapologetic critic of Trump, voting to impeach him and serving as the vice chairwoman of the House select committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol.\n\n\n\nShe has repeatedly criticized the former president and his allies who back his election fraud claims.\n\n\n\n“It would be very difficult,” Cheney said when asked if she could support Cruz, Hawley and others who have closely tied themselves to Trump.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think that a fundamental question for me in terms of whether or not someone is fit to be president is whether they've abided by their constitutional obligations in the past,” she said.\n\n\n\nCruz and Hawley are both seen as considering future White House bids, while Cheney is planning to launch a political group to keep Trump allies out of office. \n\n\n\nCheney also took aim at Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R), who has recently campaigned in battleground states for candidates backed by Trump and is speculated to be weighing a 2024 presidential bid himself.\n\n\n\n“I think that DeSantis is somebody who is, right now, campaigning for election deniers,” Cheney said on ABC.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“And I think that is something that I think people have got to have real pause about,” she continued. “Either you fundamentally believe in and will support our constitutional structure, or you don't.”Cheney after her loss told NBC's Savannah Guthrie that she was also thinking about running for president.\"Look, you run for president because you believe you would be the best candidate, because you believe you'd be the best president of the United States,\" Cheney said on ABC. \"And so, any decision that I make about doing something that significant and that serious would be with the intention of winning and because I think I would be the best candidate.\"",

        "description": "Former Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan was charged under Pakistan’s antiterrorism law on Sunday, after delivering a speech on Saturday threatening senior police officers and a judge, according to multiple reports.\n\n\n\nThe New York Times reported Khan, who was ousted in April through a no-confidence vote, railed during  a rally in Islamabad against officials involved in the arrest of one of his top aides. \n\n\n\n“We will not spare you,” Khan said, per the Times.\n\n\n\nThe Islamabad Capital Police chairman said in a statement posted to Twitter that the department would take “legal action” against “all false allegations.”\n\n\n\n“Islamabad Police will continue its duties diligently,” the statement read.\n\n\n\n“Anyone making threats or allegations will be dealt with according to law,” it continued. “Islamabad Police takes its work seriously for the people and the country.”\n\n\n\nFawad Chaudhry, who served in Khan’s cabinet, tweeted multiple videos showing crowds of people gathering outside the former prime minister’s residence Sunday. Khan has reportedly not yet been arrested.\n\n\n\nEarlier on Sunday, Khan on Twitter accused the Pakistani government of blocking YouTube in the country and banning live coverage of his speeches on television.\n\n\n\n“This is not only a gross violation of freedom of speech but also negatively affects the digital media industry and the livelihoods of many,” he tweeted.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKhan was ousted as prime minister in April, and Shehbaz Sharif, a member of the Pakistani Muslim League party, succeeded him. Khan has charged his opponents with colluding with the United States.",

        "description": "This glove story did not have a happy ending.\nIn the second inning of Sunday&#8217;s game at Coors Field, Rockies third baseman Ryan McMahon fielded a hot grounder from the Giants&#8217; Thairo Estrada. McMahon figured it would be a routine play. Instead, the baseball went right through the index and middle fingers of McMahon&#8217;s glove.\n&#8220;That&#8217;s my old baby glove and I have been using that since high-A,&#8221; McMahon said. &#8220;I&#8217;m just going to put it in retirement now.&#8221;\nMcMahon was charged with an error and the cartoonish play contributed to the Giants&#8217; two-run inning. San Francisco went on to win the game, 9-8, in 11 innings.\n&#8220;I couldn&#8217;t tell what happened,&#8221; McMahon said. &#8220;When I looked down, I had a huge rip in my glove. It&#8217;s tough man. They get two runs right there. It would have been an easy out. It&#8217;s a tough pill to swallow, but it&#8217;s out of my control.&#8221;\nGrichuk&#8217;s run. Outfielder Randal Grichuk tied the game, 6-6, with a two-run homer in the eighth inning, his 13th of the season, the third-most on the team behind C.J. Cron (23) and Charlie Blackmon (16).\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies rally twice but lose 11-inning heartbreaker to Giants\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tMoneyball: MLB&#8217;s big-spending losers and frugal winners of 2022\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tBaseball edges closer to implementing automatic strike zone in major leagues\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Ryan Feltner passes test, Wynton Bernard delivers in win over Giants\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; Jose Iglesias, who defected from Cuba, reaches 10 years in majors\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\nIt was Grichuk&#8217;s ninth career home run in the eighth inning or later that either tied the game or put his team ahead, his first since May 23, 2021, for the Blue Jays against Tampa Bay.\nSince the All-Star Break, he&#8217;s hitting .320 (32-for-100) in 27 games.\n&#8220;He&#8217;s been swinging the bat well, especially against lefties,&#8221; manager Bud Black said. &#8220;He&#8217;s doing his part. Over the last month, month-and-a-half, we&#8217;ve seen his average climb.&#8221;\nFootnotes. Slumping first baseman C.J. Cron sat out for the second straight game but Black said Cron will be back in the lineup Tuesday night against Texas. Cron is hitting just .171 since the All-Star break. &#8230; Blackmon went 2-for-5 with two RBIs, recording his 700th career RBI on a game-tying, 10th-inning single. Blackmon became the 27th active player to reach the milestone and the seventh Rockie all-time to get to 700.",

        "description": "Indiana Gov. Eric Holcomb (R) arrived in Taiwan on Sunday, leading the latest U.S. delegation to the self-governing island amid heightened tensions with China following Speaker Nancy Pelosi's (D-Calif.) visit earlier this month. \n\n\n\nHolcomb's office said the delegation, which includes state and Purdue University officials, would meet with Taiwanese officials during a two-day trip to strengthen economic and academic ties. The group will then travel to Seoul, South Korea for two days.\n\n\n\n“I couldn’t be more energized to spend this week building new relationships, reinforcing long time ones and strengthening key sector partnerships with Taiwan and South Korea,” Holcomb said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This week marks my second trip to South Korea as governor, and I am also proud to be the first U.S. governor to visit Taiwan since before the COVID-19 pandemic,” he continued. “I’m committed to building an economy of the future with these global partners who are helping propel Indiana forward by creating tomorrow’s businesses, today.”\n\n\n\nThe trip comes after Taiwanese semiconductor giant MediaTek in June announced a partnership with Purdue University to create a new semiconductor design center.\n\n\n\n“The unprecedented economic progress Indiana has secured this year doesn’t happen without like-minded partners here and around the world,” Indiana Secretary of Commerce Brad Chambers said in a statement. \"A shared commitment to innovation and collaboration is key to continuing our success, and I’m thrilled to spend the week strengthening that collaboration with our friends in Taiwan and South Korea.”\n\n\n\nThe U.S. semiconductor industry has been a recent focus for lawmakers. President Biden signed a bill earlier this month that will invest billions to incentivize domestic semiconductor production, legislation aimed at making the U.S. more competitive with China and addressing supply chain challenges.\n\n\n\nHolcomb’s trip is the latest U.S. delegation to visit Taiwan in recent weeks. A five-member delegation of lawmakers visited the island earlier this month, just days after Pelosi became the highest-ranking U.S. official to land on Taiwan in 25 years.\n\n\n\nPelosi’s visit greatly angered Beijing, which views Taiwan as part of its territory and wants to reunify the mainland with the self-governing, democratic island.\n\n\n\nUnder the longstanding “One China” policy, the United States acknowledges Beijing’s claim to the island while it also vows to honor the Taiwan Relations Act, which commits the U.S. to help the island defend itself if China invades.China responded to Pelosi’s visit by conducting military drills for multiple days near the island after she left Taiwan. China also launched additional drills following the subsequent visit by lawmakers.",

        "description": "Aug. 22: Harper will begin a rehab assignment at Triple-A tomorrow, tweets Matt Gelb of The Athletic. Harper will play everyday from Tuesday to Saturday, take Sunday off and potentially join the big league club on Monday.\nAug. 21: As the Phillies continue to vie for a wild card berth, their biggest possible reinforcement is taking a step closer to a return, as Bryce Harper is slated to begin a Triple-A rehab assignment on Tuesday or Wednesday.  Harper underwent surgery to repair a fractured left thumb in late June, and told reporters (including MLB.com&#8217;s Todd Zolecki) that his thumb has now regained full strength and is at roughly &#8220;85-90 percent&#8221; in terms of mobility.\nWhile his thumb seems to be making good progress, Harper did caution that &#8220;I’m not really sure how it’s going to feel after I make contact, things like that.  [Batting practice], machine, it all feels good, but you just never know until you get in the game.&#8221;  That said, Harper has set September 1 as a loose target date for a return, so it seems like he&#8217;ll be in line for a week of Triple-A games.\nIt is possible Harper&#8217;s rehab assignment could be on the longer side because he wants to &#8220;come back at full strength playing,&#8221; rather than something like a limited schedule of playing two of every three games.  Harper has already been limited to some extent this season, as a UCL tear in his throwing elbow kept him limited to being a designated hitter since April.\nThat elbow problem didn&#8217;t keep Harper from hitting .318/.385/.599 with 15 home runs over his first 275 plate appearances.  If Harper can get anywhere close to that production upon his return, the Phillies will get a major boost in their hopes of ending their postseason drought.  Philadelphia has continued to play well with Harper sidelined, posting a 28-20 record in the 48 games since he fractured his thumb.",
