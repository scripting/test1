        "description": "The judge presiding over former President Donald Trump’s effort to limit the Justice Department’s review of the records seized from his Mar-a-Lago estate wants more details from Trump’s legal team about what, precisely, he’s asking her to do. In a brief order on Tuesday afternoon, U.S. District Court Judge Aileen Cannon signaled some confusion about the motion Trump’s attorneys filed on Monday asking for an outsider to sift through materials the FBI seized from Trump’s home and resort in Palm Beach, Fla., earlier this month pursuant to a search warrant. Cannon, a Trump appointee who sits in Fort Pierce, Fla., asked Trump’s attorneys to clarify five aspects of their legal effort — filed in what Trump described as a “major” Fourth Amendment action but was primarily a request to appoint a so-called special master to screen records for privileged materials. Cannon didn’t explicitly criticize the 27-page motion Trump’s lawyers filed on Monday, but her requests for clarification seemed to dovetail with criticism from some legal observers who called the submission convoluted, confusing and loaded with heaping servings of political rhetoric unrelated to the legal questions at issue. She wants answers to her queries by Friday, but did not set a hearing or further proceedings on the former president’s request. Among the issues the judge asked Trump’s attorneys to clarify were such basic points as “the precise relief sought,” why the court has jurisdiction over the dispute, what legal standards apply and whether the former president is seeking an immediate injunction against the government while the legal dispute plays out. The series of questions were Cannon’s first substantive step since Trump filed the action, underscoring the challenge Trump has faced in articulating a legal strategy to combat the criminal inquiry into his handling of presidential records housed at his Florida home since leaving office. Though Trump’s lawyers were notified in April that the FBI was seeking to review materials that had been kept at Mar-a-Lago and had significant concerns about classified information being held there, Trump opted against taking any legal steps until Monday, two weeks after the FBI executed a search warrant at his estate. Trump did not explicitly seek any sort of emergency intervention by the court to halt the Justice Department’s ongoing review of the material — currently being conducted by a “filter team” intended to screen out potentially privileged information — a notable absence in a filing he publicly described as an urgent step. The former president’s motion did ask to “enjoin further review of seized materials by The Government until a Special Master is appointed,” but was not clear on whether Trump was seeking that step right away or only after a judge concluded a special master should be named. Cannon also said she wanted to understand Trump’s view on the effect of ongoing proceedings before Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart, who is preparing to consider releasing a redacted version of the affidavit justifying the FBI search but whom Trump has publicly criticized. An attorney for Trump and spokespeople for the former president did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Cannon’s order.",

        "description": "Yesterday&#8217;s elections suggest that American voters are concerned about the past year&#8217;s radicalization of the Republican Party. In a special election for a seat in the House of Representatives in a New York state swing district, the 19th congressional district, Democrat Pat Ryan beat his Republican opponent. Pundits looked at the race as a bellwether (named for the wether, or castrated sheep, fitted with a bell to indicate where the flock was going), and most thought the Republican would win, as he was a strong candidate and the midterm election in a president&#8217;s first term usually goes to the opposite party. Ryan&#8217;s opponent emphasized inflation and crime, but Ryan told Greg Sargent of the Washington Post: &#8220;We centered the concept of freedom&#8230;. When rights and freedoms are being taken away from people,&#8221; Ryan told Sargent, they &#8220;stand up and fight.&#8221; The Supreme Court&#8217;s Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#8217;s Health decision of two months ago overturning the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision that protected abortion rights was a key sign of the erosion of freedom. Ryan told Sargent that &#8220;ripping away reproductive rights from tens of millions of people&#8221; was &#8220;visceral.&#8221; So, too, are gun safety and threats to democracy. &#8220;There&#8217;s sort of this power grab of the far, far right,&#8221; Ryan told Sargent. &#8220;It&#8217;s just wildly out of step with where the vast majority of Americans are.&#8221;This is the fourth special election since the Dobbs decision that has shown at least a two-point movement toward the Democrats. A referendum on preserving abortion rights in Kansas also went to those in favor of them. Tom Bonier, who runs the political data firm TargetSmart, noted that women have outregistered men to vote since the Dobbs decision by large margins: 11 points in Ohio, for example. And a Pew poll released yesterday shows that 56% of voters say that the right to abortion is very important to them for their midterm votes, up from 46% before the Dobbs decision. The trend is clear, but so is the reality that a number of states are operating under extreme Republican gerrymanders&#8212;some, like those in Alabama, Georgia, Louisiana, and Ohio, still in force although the state judges have said they are illegal&#8212;that will give Republicans a structural advantage.Biden administration officials are currently touring the country to call attention to how the administration is &#8220;Building a Better America.&#8221; In 35 trips to 23 states, they will &#8220;make clear that the President and Congressional Democrats beat the special interests and delivered what was best for the American people.&#8221; They are emphasizing the bipartisan infrastructure bill, the CHIPS and Science Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the gun safety law, and so on. They are urging Americans to unite not by party, but against the extremism on display in the leadership of the current Republican Party. &#8220;Every step of the way, Congressional Republicans sided with the special interests&#8212;pushing an extreme MAGA agenda that costs families.&#8221; Since the 1980s, Republicans have argued for cutting public programs because they cost too much money, while also arguing that tax cuts for the wealthy would pay for themselves by expanding the economy, thus increasing tax revenues. It has never worked&#8212;when government computers showed that President Ronald Reagan&#8217;s first tax cut would explode the deficit, the budget director simply reprogrammed them&#8212;but that has not stopped the Republicans from passing repeated tax cuts for the wealthy, one as recently as December 2017.Republicans have warned that the massive investment the Democrats have made in the country during Biden&#8217;s term would rack up enormous deficits. But, in fact, today the Office of Management and Budget forecast that this year&#8217;s budget deficit will decline by $1.7 trillion, the single largest drop in the deficit in U.S. history. (The record deficit was $3.13 trillion in 2020, during the worst of the coronavirus pandemic.) This number is simply a benchmark, and the deficit remains at $1.03 trillion, but it suggests that numbers are currently moving downward. Today, Biden announced another key change in American policy, this time in education. The Department of Education will cancel up to $20,000 of student debt for Pell Grant recipients with loans held by the federal government and up to $10,000 for other borrowers. Pell Grants are targeted at low-income students. Individuals who make less than $125,000 a year or couples who make less than $250,000 a year are eligible. The current pause on federal student loan repayment will be extended once more, through the end of 2022, and the Education Department will try to negotiate a cap on repayments of 5% of a borrower&#8217;s discretionary income, down from the current 10%. The Department of Education estimates that almost 90% of the relief in the measure will go to those earning less than $75,000 a year, and about 43 million borrowers will benefit from the plan. Opponents of the plan worry that it will be inflationary and that it will not address the skyrocketing cost of four-year colleges. But its supporters worry that the education debt crisis locks people into poverty. They also note that there was very little objection to the forgiveness of 10.2 million Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loans issued as of July 2022, with $72,500 being the average dollar amount forgiven. The administration&#8217;s plan is a significant pushback to what has happened to education funding since the 1980s. After World War II, the U.S. funded higher education through a series of measures that increased college attendance while also keeping prices low. Beginning in the 1980s, that funding began to dry up and tuition prices rose to make up the difference. A college education became crucial for a high-paying job, but wages didn&#8217;t rise along with the cost of tuition, so families turned to borrowing. Many of them choose the lowest monthly repayment amounts, and some put their loans on hold, meaning their debt balances grow far beyond what they originally borrowed. The shift to &#8220;high-tuition, high-aid&#8221; caused a &#8220;massive total volume of debt,&#8221; Assistant Professor of Economics Emily Cook of Tulane University told Jessica Dickler and Annie Nova of CNBC in May. Today, around 44 million Americans owe about $1.7 trillion of educational debt.Because of the wealth gap between white and Black Americans&#8212;the average white family has ten times the wealth of the average Black family&#8212;more Black students borrow to finance their education.Canceling a portion of student debt is a resumption of the older system, ended in the 1980s, under which the government funded cheaper education in the belief it was a social good. In his explanation of the plan, White House National Economic Council Director Bharat Ramamurti told reporters today that &#8220;87% of the dollars&#8230;are going to people making under $75,000 a year, and 0 dollars, 0%, are going to anybody making over $125,000 in individual income.&#8221; He told them it was &#8220;instructive&#8221; to compare this plan &#8220;to what the Republican tax bill did in 2017. It&#8217;s basically the reverse. Fifteen percent of the benefits went to people making under $75,000 a year, and 85% went to people making over $75,000 a year. And if you zoom in even more on that, people making over $250,000 a year got nearly half of the benefits of the GOP tax bill and are getting 0 dollars under our [plan].&#8221;&#8212;https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/kornacki-ny-house-election-evidence-dem-voters-motivated-after-roe-decision-146871877640https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2022/08/24/pat-ryan-new-york-special-election-2022-democrats/https://www.pewresearch.org/politics/2022/08/23/abortion-rises-in-importance-as-a-voting-issue-driven-by-democrats/Tom Bonier @tbonierWow.

Those operations were years in the planning, according to military documents uncovered by the Commission for International Justice and Accountability and sent to the international criminal court.

Across Australia children as young as 10 can be put in handcuffs, thrown into police cars and locked in prison cells. As First Nations people, we know these experiences only too well, as we’ve been dealing with this kind of treatment since invasion. First Nations children make up at least 60% of those locked up in the 10 to 14 age group. Over the last month we have seen headlines from Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Tasmania about the dire conditions in which these children are being held. Children as young as 14 were transferred to a maximum-security adult prison in WA, one of those children was hospitalised after self-harming. There were soaring rates of children harming themselves or attempting suicide in the NT’s Don Dale youth detention centre, and children in Tasmania were being locked in cells for most of the day due to staff shortages.Now is the time for commonwealth, state and territory governments to take urgent action and raise the age of criminal responsibility to at least 14 to get young children out from behind bars.

The most popular access route, from the village of Barley, barely skims its north-western edge, hitting the summit by means of a staircase. Another classic route, the zigzagging climb from Downham, doesn’t reveal the full scale and shape of the hill.Then there are the time-worn witchcraft associations to be steered around. Far more than Bideford in Devon or Manningtree in Essex, or nearby Samlesbury, Pendle Hill is lodged in the national psyche as the backdrop to the unjust trials of 11 women in 1612 – a story that has been if not quite romanticised then spooked-up and broom-sticked into a dubious fiction over four centuries.

Hundreds of millennia of human activity stretch back behind us – the stone age and the bronze age and the iron age, the ancient world, the middle ages and onwards, culminating in today – whereas our mental image of our species’ future tends either to be hazy or, in the event of an extinction-level catastrophe, terrifyingly short.But there is another way to see things. Even if the world population were to fall by 90%, and if humans survive no longer than the average mammalian species, a million years in total, then 99.5% of all human experience has yet to be lived. If we can dodge the aforementioned catastrophe – a big “if”, obviously – then a staggeringly huge proportion of humanity’s time on Earth is almost certainly yet to come. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Published today by White Rabbit Books, David Keenan&#8217;s &#8216;Industry of Magic &amp; Light&#8217; — the prequel to his cult classic debut &#8216;This is Memorial Device&#8217; — is simultaneously a forensics of the 1960s, a detective novel, an occult thriller, a vision quest, and the hallucinatory exposition of a moment where it felt like anything was possible.  The power of art radiates throughout, writes Darran Anderson; to make life liveable, to make the dead-ends interesting, to make the ordinary epic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the summer of 1873, Paul Verlaine was walking home from the market in Camden. He was carrying a fish and a bottle of oil to feed himself and his partner, fellow poet and émigré, Arthur Rimbaud. Almost at the door, he looked up and noticed Rimbaud was gazing down from their window, laughing at him. Climbing the stairs to their flat, Verlaine was greeted with words to the effect of, “If you only knew how much of a jerk you look carrying that fish.” It was the final straw in what had been a tempestuous affair. Verlaine left on the next ship to Belgium. When they met again in Brussels, Verlaine was drunk and manic and brandishing a revolver. After threatening suicide, he shot Rimbaud in the wrist. Verlaine would leave for jail, while Rimbaud, barely out of his teens, would leave Europe and poetry entirely, though not before completing an epic he’d been working on that whole wretched year. As with all Rimbaud’s writing, A Season in Hell still astonishes. It is an openhearted yet mysterious exploration of the self and a searing bonfire of the vanities. It was an evolution of his earlier claim that would cast a spell over many people in many artforms and disciplines in the years that followed, ‘Je est un autre.’ I is an other. \n\n\n\nWe live in very different times of course to Victorian cursed poets, but certain qualities have only grown wider and deeper since then. One is a phenomenon the novelist Gabriel García Márquez called the ‘three lives’. There is the public self, exhibited to others, the private self, exhibited to ourselves, and the secret self, which we dare not display or examine, or may not even consciously be aware of. Each one unlocks potential wonders and horrors. The theatre of the public self can lead to inspiration and stature in art, fashion, politics yet equally it can lead to delusion and deception. The private self can be a refuge, hermitage or prison. The secret self is where the greatest perils and treasures lie. When the nexus between these lives begins to warp, when they drift apart or one comes to dominate at the expense of the others, dysfunction arises. For all the creativity that the performance of self-invention brings, it is mirrored in the fear of the doppelgänger, those strange doubles who wander the streets wearing our clothes, who inhabit other people’s perspectives of us, who hide in our attics and basements. Where the true self exists is questionable. Perhaps it lies in the things we never intend anyone to find, not the public memoir or the private diary but the discarded junk.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSomewhere in the North Lanarkshire village of Greengairs, there is an abandoned caravan that contains a universe, or at least its wreckage. The first half of Industry of Magic &amp; Light rifles through the contents, an archive of a lost countercultural scene in 1960s and ‘70s Airdrie. A prequel to This is Memorial Device’s post-punk labyrinth, the book blurs the lines between fact and fiction, knowing that the border is always a peculiar, contested and unstable territory. Just as the Surrealists cultivated the transitional hypnagogic state between sleep and waking for inspiration, the earthy realism of Industry of Magic &amp; Light lends weight to David Keenan’s wild inventiveness. Equally the imaginative passages add a curious ‘parallel world seeping into ours’ feel to the text. Keenan has managed to successfully summon an imaginary yet completely credible and immersive cultural scene from his head and into the streets of his youth, achieving for a second time what I’d long thought impossible.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If you remember the Sixties, you weren’t there” goes the cliche. And sure enough, Keenan, born in 1971, remembers them vividly. Industry of Magic &amp; Light are the recollections of one who was not there through the discarded relics of those who were, and it is nothing less than a triumph, building up a complex portrait of Central Belt psychedelia. As the author puts it, &#8216;Back then there was basically an annexe of Woodstock down behind the garages.&#8217; The Flammarion engraving re-enacted twelve miles east of Glasgow. Weird scenes inside the Monklands.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt is told, at first, through bricolage; fragments of found texts, esoterica, objects, like an epistolary or decadent novel of old but one electrically and lysergically charged. It must be said that it’s not an accumulation in the pointillist sense, to reveal a broader singular vision; the purpose and power of Industry of Magic &amp; Light is that it retains its enigmas regardless of its streetwise honesty, which is regularly hilarious and occasionally disturbing (the recurring radio snippet of a boxing match gone wrong for instance). As his earlier books show, Keenan writes beyond the contrivance of resolution. Life doesn’t work that way, nor should fiction always be compelled to. He does many mercurial things you would be taught not to do on most creative writing courses. He disrupts as well as balances. The results are thrilling, mostly due to the mesmerism of the voice and pacing, his eye for compelling details and dramas that steal upon the reader, and his egalitarian capacity for introducing us to real and imagined oddities.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThroughout Industry of Magic &amp; Light, from Alice Coltrane to Rainer Maria Rilke, the power of art radiates; to make life liveable, to make the dead-ends interesting, to make the ordinary epic, or as epic as it actually is (we’re on a rock spinning through space after all). It is a testament not just to art but boredom, and the lengths to which it can drive its sufferers. “Freedom’s just another word for nothing left to lose” Kris Kristofferson once sang, but it’s often forgotten that’s only the beginning. It gets bleak or it gets strange, by necessity, after that. There are &#8216;Happenings in the fields and quarries that surround Airdrie… broadcast through a handmade PA stolen from a bingo hall in Coatdyke&#8217; and illuminated by hallucinatory effects produced by an overhead projector marked ‘Property of Airdrie Academy’. Though fiction, Keenan writes of a deeper truth here, for in the forgotten corners of countless towns, uncanonised by commerce or celebrity, people had read the likes of Yukio Mishima and listened to songs like Hendrix’s ‘1983… (A Merman I Should Turn to Be)’ and strange happenings had actually begun to occur.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAbsurdity is never far away in Industry of Magic &amp; Light. The human propensity for derangement and disaster, heartbreak and decay is constant. Yet life is stranger than it seems, and other possibilities inevitably exist, if not in this world than another. From Bazooka Joe wrappers to empty bird cages, Silver Surfer comics to a lost detective novel, the discoveries that make up the chapters are not meticulously studied and contextualised in the History of [insert place] in 100 Objects sense. Instead, they are either deadpan asides or cascades of freewheeling prose, or both at the same time such as the cave guru vignette. Even though it is set in the past, Industry of Magic &amp; Light has nothing static about it, other than the caravan of its setting. It is a book in motion, with each find setting off a movie reel, until all these odd yet familiar films are playing simultaneously which, for all Keenan’s satyr experimentalism, is closer to life than the lie of the straight narrative. It is lifelike in the way you don’t get to choose what stays with you after reading. People come and go, entering and leaving, until life seems less like a series of happenings and more like a series of vanishings. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe second half of Industry of Magic &amp; Light is drawn from a deck of tarot cards, harking back to Keenan’s splendid collaboration To Run Wild In It with the artist Sophy Hollington. Tarot has a number of fascinating qualities in its application here; how it relates to the voices and accounts; questions of irony, determinism and hidden intentions; how retrospective stories are told via a predictive medium; Tarot as a tool of lateral thinking; the possibility of uncovering or concealing what is already there; the role of the esoteric not in revealing a hidden world but the secret self. The pace quickens and, with it, paranoia, violence, collapses and erasures. A line from another song comes right back around to haunt the era, ‘Something is happening and you don’t know what it is…&#8217; &nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the heart of tarot is interpretation. Perhaps a portrait can be constructed not just from things left behind but by examining the value someone places in them. In his exploration of the values of the discarded, whether objects, place or people, David Keenan reveals himself to be one of the most generous and ingenious writers of our times. This is a book that looks inwards as an intimately local collection of stories but also bursts outwards as an ever-expanding map, a sun collapsing under its own gravity. Industry of Magic and Light is the latest in Keenan’s line of substance-restoring and gravity-defying books. They are visionary not just in their weirdness and propulsion but because of their view of the ordinary, as something anything but, and their belief in possibility. &#8216;Can you imagine an equivalent moment of cultural trust and gravity today?&#8217; he asks, and through the existence and sheer exuberance of this book, in the face of fashionable pessimism and cultural inertia, the answer might just be yes. Reading Industry of Magic &amp; Light, you are reminded extraordinary ground-breaking works of art can come from the unlikeliest places, they nearly always do, because you are holding one of them in your hands. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n*\n\n\n\n&#8216;Industry of Magic &amp; Light&#8217; is out now.

Kylian Mbappé scored inside nine seconds against Lille after applying the finishing touch at the end of the slick four-pass move seemingly first trialled by Bournemouth last year and since copied by Real Madrid, Rayo Vallecano and Sparta Rotterdam with mixed success. Or maybe Mbappé was inspired by Cliftonville of Northern Ireland’s top division, who mastered the same sequence when Ronan Hale opened the scoring 7.92 seconds into their victory over Carrick last Saturday.Cliftonville did not devote days on the training ground; rather, an hour before the game their analyst, Damian McAuley, showed the squad a TikTok video that has gone viral since being shared by Bournemouth, comprising a compilation of efforts, starting with Dominic Solanke’s trendsetting goal seven seconds into the second half at Craven Cottage last December. “Dee [McAuley] had his iPad and just said: ‘Have you seen this? It’s all over TikTok, it’s been blowing up recently.’ We all watched it while we were sitting in the changing room and we thought: ‘Why not give it a try, something a bit different?’ And thankfully it worked right away.” Continue reading...",

        "link": "https://blog.mahabali.me/educational-technology-2/the-joys-and-gaps-between-practice-writing-and-publishing/",
        "description": "Yesterday, an article I co-authored just got published. The article is in Inside Higher Ed, it&#8217;s called Online Does Mean Isolated, and I co-authored it with Mia Zamora and George Station in response to a previous article in Inside Higher Ed that talked about how online conferences (and classes) isolated us from each other. We used MYFest22 (which we&#8217;ve been offering for the last 3 months to educators around the world as a fully online energizing/nourishing choose-your-own-learning-journey experience) as our model for how to design online PD that is the opposite of isolating!\n\n\n\nI remember a long time ago, I used to write for myself. A lot of it was poetry or short stories, occasionally reflections. I did not fee compelled to share too widely, perhaps with my mom or husband, maybe a friend or two. Then, at some point along the way, I felt, as an academic about to finish my PhD, that I had stuff to say that I wanted the world to listen to. I wrote some stuff for my department&#8217;s newsletter, but that was really local. I started writing for trade journals and I remember the joy of having that kind of thing published every time, and seeing social media shares and comments on it. And then I realized sometimes I was in more of a hurry than even a trade journal editor&#8217;s turnaround time, and also I wanted freedom not to stick to someone else&#8217;s themes and deadlines, and I started this blog. I could publish whatever I wanted whenever&#8230; eventually there were actually people who read it, though of course not many at first. I remember wondering way back when I started publishing, whether that &#8220;joy&#8221; of publishing would ever disappear or fade. I remember publishing my first peer-reviewed article, and then my first two single-authored peer-reviewed articles, and the joy from that is so different because of how much revision often goes into it, and its meaning in terms of academic recognition of the value of your writing and research. \n\n\n\nI&#8217;m sad to say that all those &#8220;joys&#8221; of publishing have faded since then. I write a lot, here, and sometimes I am really proud of a piece that resonates with people a lot, especially during the pandemic period where my work on pedagogy of care (and the About that webcam obsession you&#8217;re having piece) got shared widely and became a thing people invite me to keynote about. I also take joy in some of my peer-reviewed work more than others. A particular one that brings me immense joy is the Equity-Care Matrix piece I co-authored with Mia Zamora.\n\n\n\nThese particular pieces matter to me and bring me joy because they&#8217;re things I&#8217;ve been thinking about and influence my practice, and by writing about them, I was able to help others think about them and (hopefully) apply some of the ideas and values in their own practice. Or at the very least, make them feel &#8220;not crazy&#8221; for having similar thoughts or doing similar practices, that, a lot of time in academia, are frowned upon or at least considered dissenting or marginal.\n\n\n\nThis piece, in Inside Higher Ed, and the Equity-Care Matrix are especially important because they are so strongly based in my own practice and disseminating it so others can benefit. I was actually thinking this morning that one of the best things about the Inside Higher Ed piece, and the dissemination of this practice, is that it builds on other work I&#8217;d worked on with others, and brings aspirational work into practice, or brings it into practice in different ways that hopefully make it easier for others to benefit from them. My joy is that we, the 14 organizers of MYFest, managed to create a learning experience that matches many of the aspirations of the article Autumm Caines and I wrote in 2018, our aspiration for educational development that promotes agency, equity and ownerships. It applies Intentionally Equitable Hospitality in contexts outside of its original context of Virtually Connecting (more articles that do that coming out soon!). It strives to apply what Mia and I learned from the Equity-Care Matrix. It is an article based in our complex practice, and finding a way to share it in ways that are legible to others, even though so much of its beauty is intangible.\n\n\n\nAnd of course no article captures the joy of three months of human connection, just like no single photo or video clip captures the joy of a two-week vacation. But they help remind us of the feeling, and maybe they help others recognize something there that they might want for themselves, too. Some day.\n\n\n\nSo yeah. The joy of writing is different from the joy of publishing. The &#8220;publishing&#8221; involes, often, the approval of others. And sometimes, we don&#8217;t need that. We just need to write for ourselves. Like a blogpost. Regardless of who reads or shares it. And sometimes, we write to dissemiante with a goal towards benefiting others, and we do need someone to agree with us that this is worth sharing, an editor, and a venue, and readers on social media letting us know that this has helped them in some way. And that&#8217;s a different goal and a different kind of joy.",

        "description": "Today’s tell-all has lost the final piece of the jigsawWesley Fofana may be sulking in the stands and missing the odd training session at Leicester as he holds out for a move but Chelsea are currently still no closer to reaching an agreement to sign him, which has prompted the west London club to cast around elsewhere. And one potential central defensive alternative is scapegoating’s Harry Maguire. According to the Evening Standard, Maguire is no longer seen as indispensable by the Manchester United manager, Erik ten Hag, and could be tempted by a move before the transfer window closes on Wednesday.The decades-long Frenkie de Jong saga has been a study in who might be the most ineptly-run megaclub in Europe, out of potential buyers Manchester United and putative sellers Barcelona, but what’s this? Liverpool are now thinking of stealing in with a cheeky bid of their own for the Dutch midfielder. Futbol Total reports that Liverpool have slapped in a bid of £53m plus £7m in add-ons for De Jong. This, in turn, would free up Barcelona to pursue Manchester City’s Bernardo Silva before deadline day, though City’s chief executive, Ferran Soriano, says such a move is not a goer.

        "description": "A professor wanders around the German capital, enabling dreamlike meditations on history, identity and belongingAmit Chaudhuri’s eighth novel reminded me of 1993’s Afternoon Raag, featuring an alienated English literature student at Oxford, or 2014’s Odysseus Abroad, about Ananda, a poet adrift in London. Sojourn has the same impressionistic tone – everything feels dreamlike, illusory and yet attentively described. There’s a similar meandering and languid style that likes to survey minor day-to-day details, mingling and suffusing them with the wider significances of history. This time we are in Berlin, though, and our unnamed protagonist is no longer a student but a visiting professor at the university.Sojourn is an even slimmer book than those earlier works – more compact and stripped down, as if seeking to do more with less. Chaudhuri is now 60. He was born in Calcutta (now Kolkata), grew up in Bombay (Mumbai), and studied in London and Oxford. I should say upfront that you don’t read his work for plot or purposefulness. He eschews conflict or confected drama; his literary preoccupation is best characterised as “belonging and not belonging”. And in this book – as in those others – he meditates on identity; identity as conjured or dispelled in a setting. Continue reading...",

        "description": "French Transport Minister Clément Beaune on Thursday called for an investigation on whether gas exploited by oil giant TotalEnergies has been used to fuel fighter jets used by the Russian army in Ukraine. \n\n\n\nBeaune&#8217;s call follows a report from Le Monde with the NGO Global Witness which links the French firm&#8217;s remaining activities in Russia with refueling operations in military bases in southwestern Russia.\n\n\n\nTerneftegaz, a joint venture between TotalEnergies and Russian firm Novatek — which owns 51 percent of it — exploits the Siberian gas field of Termokarstovoye. TotalEnergies also owns 19.4 percent of Novatek itself.\n\n\n\nAccording to Le Monde, some of the gas condensate extracted from the field has been transformed into kerosene sent to two military bases close to the Ukrainian border. Fighter jets at these bases have likely been involved in bombings in Ukraine, although it is hard to pinpoint exactly which strikes.\n\n\n\n&#8220;This is an extremely serious matter,&#8221; Beaune told France 2, &#8220;so there needs to be a check on whether, willingly or not, there&#8217;s been a bypass on sanctions or a diversion of the energy that a company, French or not, would produce.&#8221; He did not specify who would be in charge of such an investigation. Beaune added he has no information on the issue at this stage.\n\n\n\n&#8220;TotalEnergies does not operate Terneftegaz&#8217;s plants, which are managed by Novatek staff,&#8221; a statement from the firm to Le Monde reads. The company added it &#8220;is not part of Novatek&#8217;s decision on how to monetize gas condensates.&#8221;",

        "description": "As the rest of Minnesota prepares for two weeks in the sun at the State Fair, Gerry Kulzer is preparing his parka, gloves and carving tools. He’ll be spending the fair in a 40-degree cooler, carving a new larger-than-life sculpture every day — in butter. And he couldn’t be more excited. “This is the best job in the world,” Kulzer said. It’s his first year as the State Fair’s lead butter carver, and Kulzer is carrying on an extensive legacy. Former carver Linda Christensen sculpted some 500 faces in butter over the past 50 years, before putting down her knife last August. Butter carving is a long-running tradition at the State Fair. It’s part of the Princess Kay of the Milky Way competition, which brings 10 finalists from around the state to compete for the crown. Princess Kay serves as an ambassador for Midwest Dairy for the year, and she and the other nine finalists all sit for a sculpting session. Kulzer, of Litchfield, Minn., isn’t a newcomer to the tradition. “Long ago I would visit the State Fair and watch Linda, because that was really the only place that you could see a sculptor work without knocking on their door,” he said. Kulzer was so captivated watching her carve that, many years ago, he reached out to Midwest Dairy, offering himself up as the next sculptor in case they ever needed one. Butter carver Gerry Kulzer (right) carves a likeness of Princess Kay of the Milky Way in a 90-pound block of butter. Courtesy Becky Church | Midwest DairyHe didn’t hear back for several years — until 2018, when the dairy group gave him a call. Christensen was getting ready to retire, and it was time to select the next carver-in-chief. The audition was the first time Kulzer had done a full sculpture in butter. He sculpted one face from a photo, and then tag-teamed a sculpture with Christiansen. “She did one side, showing me how she does an eye or whatever, and then I would do the other side,” Kulzer said. “And when it was finished, it looked awesome. They liked what they saw.” Kulzer has been shadowing Christiansen for the last few fairs to learn the craft. This year, for the first time, he’ll be doing all 10 sculptures by himself.He’s excited for the task — and a little nervous to be going in alone.“She was the master, and if something went wrong, she was there, things could be corrected,” Kulzer said. “This year that’s not the case. I gotta make sure I do everything right.” It&#x27;s not an easy job. The hours are long, the air is cold, and the chilly butter and constant work leave his hands stiff by the end of the day. “You’re in this environment, this 40-degree cooler, for eleven days,” Kulzer said. “I’ve found that the cold kind of seeps into you as the day progresses, I get colder and colder, and those 15-minute breaks that we take don’t really warm me up.”  But Kulzer loves it all the same. It’s a unique way to do what he truly loves: teaching.When he’s not sculpting head after head in 90-pound blocks of butter, Kulzer is a school art teacher. “The thing that was appealing is the education factor,” Kulzer said. “You’re demonstrating a craft, you’re showing people how this is done, and, being a teacher, that’s what I’ve always been about.” And it’s a chance to teach something else: the ins and outs of dairy farming.Kulzer has a first-hand appreciation of the industry. He grew up on a farm. “Growing up, picking rocks, baling hay, always the hottest days of the year when we’re doing this stuff — it was not fun,” Kulzer said. “Being cold for a little while? That’s nothing compared to what the farmers and dairy producers are doing day in and day out.” He learns a lot, too. Princess Kay and the runners-up do interviews throughout the day while they sit for the sculptures, giving visitors the chance to ask them questions. One of Kulzer’s favorite parts of the job is listening to their stories of life on the farm.Sculpting is a very different career path, but he’s grateful for his job’s unique connection to the farming business. “I hope the visitors realize that, yes, this is a fascinating thing to watch, but it’s all because of the effort that the farmers put into their livelihood and their final product,” Kulzer said. Fairgoers can watch Kulzer sculpt in the dairy building starting the first day of the fair. At the end of the fair, the sculptures will be on display for a day. Once the gates close and the crowds head home, candidates get to keep their larger-than-life likenesses. And Kulzer gets to warm up and put down his knife – until next year.",

        "description": "Nancy XiáoRong Valentine is a visual artist in Underwood, and she was deeply moved by the exhibit, &quot;Return to Normal? COVID Diaries from Local Youth&quot; at the Otter Tail County Historical Society in Fergus Falls, Minn.The exhibition by five high school students and one college student uses a range of artistic styles to tell the story of how COVID-19 affected their lives and education — and what it means to return to normal.Valentine was struck by how thoughtful and vulnerable each of the artists were in considering the complexities of the pandemic. She says she was moved to tears by the work of Sylvia Pesch, who wrote an original piano piece that pairs with poetry and visuals.The show runs through Sept. 30.Retired arts educator Le Ann Gehring-Ryan of North Mankato recommends a show at the Owatonna Arts Center, the solo exhibit by landscape painter Andrew Judkins.Judkins, also of North Mankato, is an avid hiker, and many of his landscape paintings feature water — from the waterfalls in the Mankato area to scenes on the North Shore.Gehring-Ryan appreciates Judkins’ eye for color and his carefully layered paint that makes images “jump right off the canvas.”Aurora: Landscapes by Andrew Judkins runs through Sunday.Bill Childs of St. Paul runs a weekly radio music show for kids called “Spare the Rock, Spoil the Child,” and he loves the new album, “The Greats,” by Louis and Dan and the Invisible Band. The Northfield-based group is the brainchild of Louis Epstein, who teaches musicology at St. Olaf College, and Dan Groll, who teaches philosophy at Carleton College. Childs calls the album “goofy and funny and very smart.”“It’s kind of like a standards album, except that none of the songs are covers.” Childs added that Louis and Dan are masters at each genre they tackle.The album includes several guest artists, including Tesfa Wondemagegnehu, Chapel Choir director at St. Olaf, who joins in on a jazzy tune about the joy of singing and a blues number about barbeque.The band will be performing on Sept. 4 as part of the 10th annual Fest du Nord at Camp du Nord in Ely. The festival runs Sept. 2 - Sept. 4.",

        "description": "As it currently stands, a considerable surplus will be at the disposal of DFL Gov. Tim Walz or his Republican challenger Scott Jensen as the winner of their race crafts a two-year budget proposal for the Legislature to consider next year.Tax revenue continues to outpace projections and much of a surplus that had topped $9 billion could be available as the budget-setting session convenes in January, because lawmakers failed to agree on how to use most of it.And while the state’s finances haven’t gotten as much attention as candidate skirmishes over crime and abortion, the governor plays an instrumental role in tax and spending decisions at the Capitol.During his term, Walz has enacted a mix of targeted tax cuts with more spending on schools, health programs and other key priorities. Jensen, a former state senator, says Minnesota’s government spends too much, and the time is now to scrap the tax code as we know it.“We&#x27;re going to look hard at getting rid of the personal income tax,” Jensen told the Republican Party convention before nailing down the endorsement this May. “We have got to quit nibbling at the edges. We&#x27;ve got to be bold.”Scott Jensen speaks at the Republican state convention in Rochester on May 14, 2022.Brian Bakst | MPR NewsIt’s an idea he’s floated repeatedly without issuing a concrete plan for ditching the tax. In June, he put some more-restrained tax measures in writing, saying he would seek tax cuts of at least $5,000 for every family of four in Minnesota and fully repeal the state’s tax on Social Security benefits. At a press conference where he repeated his desire to go further, Jensen challenged a reporter who asked if dumping the income tax was realistic.“Is it realistic to talk about eliminating Minnesota personal income tax? I think it’s as realistic as inventing a light bulb or a computer in my phone that used to take up a room this size with mainframes,” he said.Walz counters that the approach would “decimate” the state’s finances.“It&#x27;s insane. It’s like offering your kids ice cream for three meals,” he said. “Of course, they may say yes. Minnesotans know better than that.”Main source of state revenueAbout half of the tax dollars flowing into the state treasury come from the individual income tax. It produces more than $15 billion per year and will exceed $16 billion before long. The next closest revenue source is the sales tax.The national average for states is about 39 percent of their revenue coming from income taxes, U.S. Census Bureau statistics show.In Minnesota, the income tax almost sustains the two biggest budget items by itself — education and health and social service costs.Walz has pushed for both higher and lower taxes during four years in the governor’s office.In his first year, he tried to bump up the gas tax and a metro sales tax as part of a transportation proposal. But his plan didn&#x27;t get through the Legislature.In 2021, he proposed higher income taxes for the state&#x27;s top earners — those with incomes above $1 million. That didn&#x27;t make it either.But over the years, he&#x27;s also backed expanded tax credits and signed legislation that modestly cut income taxes.Tim Walz arrives at Urban Growler Brewing in St. Paul, Minn. for an election results party for Betty McCollum on Tuesday, Aug. 9, 2022.Ben Hovland | MPR News During the most recent session, Walz proposed one-time rebate checks. That stalled. He later made a deal with House DFLers and Senate Republicans to cut income taxes and eliminate the tax on Social Security, a plan that also got sidetracked.He told a FarmFest debate audience this month that his administration “cut taxes more than any time in the last 25 years” and that he agreed to “the largest tax cut in state history.” That last part was a reference to the $4 billion in a proposed tax bill that didn’t ultimately cross the finish line.Walz said he will continue pushing for a special session agreement to ratify the tax-and-spending framework that was on the table when the Legislature adjourned in May.He said he’s tried to strike a middle ground on taxes as governor.“I’ve proposed middle-class tax cuts. I&#x27;m not going to propose tax cuts for the wealthiest Minnesotans,” Walz said. “What you see is I&#x27;m not an ideologue.”Changes to Minnesota’s tax code in recent times have been gradual rather than monumental shifts. Reshaping the underpinnings creates winners and losers and can require substantial money to ease the transition.Jensen said Minnesota hasn’t lowered taxes fast enough and argued its place in the highest top 10 of many national tax rankings makes it unattractive to relocating businesses and squeezes families.“Is it devastating to Tim Walz?” Jensen asked rhetorically before pivoting to Walz’s use of the governor’s residence and amenities after selling his Mankato home. “I&#x27;d say this: If you don&#x27;t pay for automobile registrations or auto tabs or gas or your driver or your food or your chef or your property taxes or your utilities, I think it&#x27;s pretty easy to be out of touch. And I think that&#x27;s what&#x27;s frustrating.”Not all states have income taxOther states have found it tough to make grand changes as well. A decade ago, Republicans in Kansas moved to upend that state’s income tax. At the urging of the state’s governor, lawmakers collapsed tax brackets, slashed rates and also lowered business taxes in a move that got national attention. Sam Brownback, then the Kansas governor, said it would offer a “boost of adrenaline” for the economy. But it didn’t produce a boom that naturally lifted up other kinds of tax revenue. In fact, Kansas struggled with repeated budget shortfalls and endured credit rating downgrades.“They drew down spending. They also did things like cutting aid to local governments, kind of forcing local governments to bear more of the cost of funding state and local government within Kansas,” said Kenneth Kriz, who back then kept close watch on the conversion as a professor of public finance and tax policy at Wichita State. “Deferred maintenance on the roads, a lot of things like that are what we saw.”About five years later, Kansas lawmakers retreated from the tax experiment and moved back toward some prior policies.When Jensen talks about moving away from the income tax, he notes Minnesota wouldn’t be alone. Nine states are in that category.Most of them rely more heavily than Minnesota on sales taxes as a share of their budgets.Several states without an income tax have natural resources to fall back on — coal, oil and natural gas in places like Alaska, Wyoming and Texas.“What do we know about those states? Huge extraction royalties. That&#x27;s the way they&#x27;re paying for it, so families don&#x27;t bear the direct burden of the tax system there,” said Kriz, who currently teaches at the University of Illinois in Springfield. “But it&#x27;s not something you could do in Minnesota unless you&#x27;re gonna strike oil. You know, it&#x27;s just not realistic.”Florida and Nevada count on tourism — people on beach getaways or casino trips — to generate a fair amount of their tax revenue.New Hampshire and Washington state are also commonly found on lists without income taxes. They still take in some tax money from investment earnings such as dividends or capital gains, although New Hampshire is starting to phase that out too.What About Wisconsin?Short of an all-out elimination of the income taxes, Jensen draws tax-policy comparisons to neighboring states such as Wisconsin.“We&#x27;re spending at a rate that&#x27;s greater than most comparable states,” he said. “We collect 150 percent of personal income tax that Wisconsin does, even though we have less people.” He’s right that Minnesota takes in considerably more through its individual income tax. Wisconsin’s annual income tax collections are approaching $10 billion, compared with the more than $15 billion and rising in Minnesota. Steve Warren, a certified public accountant who does tax work for clients in both Minnesota and Wisconsin, said there are many nuances between the two states to consider.Wisconsin doesn’t tax Social Security benefits while Minnesota still does for many retirees despite efforts to repeal that tax.Wisconsin’s gas tax at 30.9 cents per gallon is slightly higher than Minnesota’s 28.5 cents.Wisconsin residents pay higher property taxes per capita than people in Minnesota.And while Wisconsin&#x27;s sales taxes are lower, Minnesota shoppers have an advantage Wisconsin shoppers don’t.A tired shopper naps on a couch at the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minn., on December 20, 2010.MPR Photo/Nikki Tundel“In Minnesota, we don&#x27;t tax clothing. They do in Wisconsin,” Warren said. “So we actually get people from Wisconsin and other places coming to the Mall of America and over the border to Minnesota to different places here to shop and buy clothes.”Some of the extra income tax revenue in Minnesota is reflected in higher spending in areas like education. The latest comparative figures from the U.S. Census Bureau show that Minnesota’s government delivers a couple of billion dollars more each year to public schools and picks up roughly two-thirds of the education tab. Wisconsin pays about 55 percent of public school costs and about 40 percent is derived from local taxes. The rest is federally supported.Warren, of the firm Schechter Dokken Kanter, ran a tax analysis on similarly situated families who live in Stillwater, Minn., and Hudson, Wis. He found that a family with a combined $150,000 income living in Stillwater was positioned to pay less overall in taxes. But Hudson families did better once income hit $250,000, and the gap widened as earnings rose.In modern times, Minnesota governors and lawmakers have tried to make the system fair and spread the load. But a lot depends on politics.As the campaign goes on, each side is going to try to paint the best picture they can to support their tax view. The changes they propose are going to have a different impact on people depending on how much they make and what government services they use.“There&#x27;s no ethical problem with cutting your income taxes to zero or cutting your sales taxes to zero,” Kenneth Kriz said. “But the thing you have to think about is how are you going to pay for it? Are you going to have to cut things? What are you gonna cut? That should be laid out.”What questions do you have about the 2022 elections?",

        "description": "As he finds himself, once more, in legal jeopardy—standing at the epicenter of a media storm of his own making, his political future changing course in real time—Donald Trump has done what Donald Trump likes to do. He’s played golf, engaged in a bit of politicking, and mingled with friends and guests at his Bedminster golf club. The stakes may be high for the ex-president, but Trump is carrying on with his usual summer calendar. In the weeks since the FBI’s search of his Palm Beach estate, Trump has mostly worked out of his office at Bedminster where he has held meetings with aides and lawyers. He appeared at political fundraisers for Republican congressman Jeff Van Drew (R-N.J.) and Michigan secretary of state candidate Kristina Karamo — which featured a performance by country singer Coffey Anderson, aka “Mr. Red White and Blue”— hosted a dinner of Republican lawmakers, given a pep talk at his club’s caddie-member golf tournament, played rounds of golf with a rotating circle of friends, and celebrated his defeat of Rep. Liz Cheney in the Wyoming GOP primary with club guests. He begrudgingly made a trip into New York City for AG Leticia James’ investigation and he memorialized former Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe in a video message for a gathering of the Unification Church in South Korea, the church started by Rev. Sun Myung Moon, the Korean religious leader who bankrolled conservative causes in the U.S. And every day he has dialed up allies and members of Congress, fired off a steady stream of angry posts and shared friendly articles from his social media account on Truth Social, and dined on the patio of Bedminster.  GOP officials, aides and media personalities who have spoken to him say Trump is frustrated but “cheerful.” He has looked for help to bolster his legal team but found no takers. At the same time, he has reveled in seeing parades of MAGA supporters in front of his properties, as well as Fox News pundits and Republican members of Congress largely rushing to his defense. He also has been buoyed by the belief that the FBI’s search of his home will benefit him politically. His political action committee has raised prodigiously off of the matter — dashing off at least 22 fundraising emails with the word “raided” in them since the search happened on Aug. 8. One thing Trump hasn't done much of since the FBI search is appear in public. While aides and family members have hit the television circuit, Trump has not. He gave one brief interview to Fox News digital and his first public appearance since the search isn’t until early September, when he holds a Save America rally in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Trump’s response to the FBI search is, to a degree, a reflection of his current station in politics. He has been in political vise grips before. And even though his own circle of advisers and allies recognize that the man famous for getting himself ensnared in nasty legal entanglements is suddenly in uncharted waters, there is a sense that this, too, can be navigated. “I don’t think anyone truly believes he’s in legal jeopardy,” said one person close to Trump’s operation. “They see this as just another headache to deal with and it’s an unnecessary issue when they could be focused on other things like preparing for a potential run.” Trump has not been entirely nonchalant about the legal dramas engulfing him. His group of lawyers have filed suits demanding that a special master be appointed to go through the materials seized by the FBI to ensure that nothing privileged is taken. Trump himself has angrily accused the feds of confiscating his passports during their search (correspondence later showed they did take the passports but returned them).   But people who have spoken to the ex-president say his mind is also more firmly on tending to his political movement and his own electoral future. In private, he has bragged about updates to his private plane and he has discussed his own plans for 2024. And, according to multiple people familiar with Trump’s political plans, there has even been discussion of creating a new super PAC. “He was upbeat, not downbeat. He wasn’t deterred by it, he expressed more disdain for what they did to his family more than what they did to him, searching Melania’s closet and going after his kids,” said a person who was at the Republican Study Committee member dinner with Trump the day after the FBI search. “[The search] was a major discussion at the beginning of the dinner but he definitely wasn’t obsessed.” Though he is under investigation for alleged crimes under the Espionage Act, Trump has leaned into the search of Mar-a-Lago as a political boost. Privately, there is a belief that the events will rally conservatives to his side and serve as an effective frame for a future run: placing him directly as a target of a Biden-overseen Department of Justice. He has been warned by advisers that it is still unclear where the FBI’s investigation may lead, but has nevertheless leaned into the now-traditional role he plays, that of Deep State victim. “All polls STRONGLY indicate that I am the candidate that Democrats LEAST want to run against, by far, hence the politically motivated Raid on Mar-a- Lago - Which has backfired, big time!” Trump posted to Truth Social. The results, at least politically, have encouraged Trump. He has seen a boost in polls with regards to a potential 2024 primary. A recent poll by St. Anselm College in New Hampshire showed him with a 20 point lead over potential rivals, including Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. And an NBC News poll released on Sunday showed that while overall, a majority of American voters think investigations into Trump should continue, Trump’s support within the Republican Party has jumped by 7 percentage points since the search. But while Trump’s enjoyed a boost in his standing within the party, he’s not reveled in it publicly; at least not yet. Trump has hosted tele-rallies in support of candidates and does plan to hold a Save America rally in Scranton, Pa., in support of two of his endorsed candidates: Senate nominee Mehmet Oz for Senate and gubernatorial hopeful Doug Mastriano, both of whom are lagging in their races. Trump is expected to hold more rallies leading up to the midterm elections. The question awaiting everyone is whether — or when — he will hold a rally for his own run. People around Trump believe a 2024 bid is a certainty at this juncture. But while the FBI drama hasn’t changed everything in Trump world, it appears to have had one major impact: complicating the decision about when to announce. There are just as many people now telling Trump to wait to unveil a run as there are those urging him to jump in as a sign of political defiance. “One big takeaway is that he is fully aware that if he gets in before midterms he’ll get blamed for losing the Senate — he made that case [to us] and understands it,” said the RSC member.",

        "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/25/powell-wyoming-fed-inflation-00053508",
        "description": "Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who last year reassured Americans that high inflation would likely be temporary, is expected to offer a darker message this week in the most closely watched speech of his tenure: The fight against spiking prices is far from over. Powell’s optimistic words at the annual Jackson Hole conference in 2021 were followed by the biggest sustained surge in prices that the U.S. has seen in four decades. Since then, he has shifted gears and sharply stressed the Fed’s commitment to kill high inflation by jacking up interest rates. But many investors think the Fed might blink before then and are already expecting the central bank to begin lowering borrowing costs later next year as a possible recession looms. That has led market rates to fall and stock prices to rise from their June depths — the exact opposite of what the central bank wants to see as it aims to slow spending and investment. Now, as he returns to Jackson Hole in Wyoming, Powell needs to convince markets he means business when he addresses the landmark conference of economists on Friday. If he can’t, it could undermine the Fed’s effort to curb the price spikes, which have rocked the economy, dragged consumer sentiment to record lows, and damaged President Joe Biden’s approval ratings. “There are no easy answers,” said Torsten Slok, chief economist at private equity firm Apollo Global Management. “The Fed is very worried about sending the right signal.” Stocks have been mixed in recent days in anticipation of Powell’s tough talk, but if his tone is softer than they expect, the upward trend is likely to return. Investors always pay attention to the Fed chief’s remarks at the conference, which has served as the venue for crucial policy changes in the past. But Powell’s comments hold special weight this year as the Fed considers how high to push interest rates to bring inflation down. The Fed’s quest to communicate with investors has been fraught over the past year. Central bank officials first had to grasp that inflation would last longer than they initially thought before launching the most aggressive rate hikes in 30 years. And the pandemic-era economy has proved especially unpredictable, leading Powell to back away almost entirely from his practice of providing long-term guidance on what the central bank might do.   Both high inflation and confusion have opened the institution up to criticism. Mohamed El-Erian, chief economic adviser at Allianz, faulted the central bank for failing to anticipate how persistent inflation would be, not acting sooner to raise rates and providing rosy forecasts on where the economy might be headed. “Chair Powell needs to reset market rates expectations, avoid the mishaps of last year, and start to repair the damaged credibility of the institution,” he said. To be certain, even the signals being sent by investors aren't completely clear: Market expectations for rate cuts next year could reflect either pessimism or optimism. Investors might be expecting the Fed to overdo it and cause a full-blown recession, leading it to reverse course on rates. Or they could be anticipating that the central bank will succeed in cooling prices while avoiding a recession altogether. Either way, markets pricing in an about-face by the Fed could cause the opposite to happen: The central bank might have to raise rates even higher to counteract their exuberance, making the path to lower inflation that much more painful for the economy.  “I would like to hear him double down on their commitment to bring inflation under control because that obviously is the centerpiece of everything they’re doing,” said Omair Sharif, founder of the independent research firm Inflation Insights. Still, some Democratic policymakers in Washington want to hear at least a kernel of a plan to begin easing off rate hikes. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) argues that the Fed can't do much about many of the key drivers of high inflation anyway — including supply chain disruptions and higher oil prices — so it should avoid squeezing the economy.  At the time of the Fed’s latest rate increase in July, central bank policymakers agreed that more tightening would probably be necessary to cool rising prices but expected at some point to slow down and take stock of how much their moves have eased inflation, according to the minutes from that meeting. Many of them also cited the risk that the central bank could go too far.   That was at the height of fears that the economy might already be entering a recession. Since then, a raft of data has shown strength in both consumer spending and the job market, which are the main sources of economic health.  “I do think we will hear [Powell] walk back a bit on the pessimism in the minutes about the risk of a recession,” said Adam Ozimek, chief economist at the public policy research firm Economic Innovation Group. “The data is not suggesting anything like a recession.” Ozimek argued for a more optimistic take on the path of the economy, saying jobs are being added at a rapid clip and that is helping output — the supply of goods and services — better match up with demand, which should dampen the need for continually higher prices.  But, he said, the more the central bank succeeds in its quest to slow the economy, the harder it will be to tell whether the Fed has already gone too far. Apollo’s Slok said the biggest long-term question on how quickly the Fed will be able to tame inflation is what’s driving it in the first place. “We and they don’t really know very well why inflation went up, and therefore how quick it will come down,” he said. He also noted that the Fed doesn’t know exactly how high rates need to go before they really start to bite into growth. Joseph Wang, a former senior trader at the New York Fed who now runs a blog, said this is what makes the Fed’s messaging so murky. “I can understand why the market is confused,” he said.",

        "description": "Another government shutdown deadline. Retiring senators determined to cement their legacies. A looming November election likely to reshape Congress. And Republicans ready to retaliate over Democrats’ huge spending bill. It’s not exactly a formula for a smooth ride, as the House and Senate have just weeks after their August break to pass a short-term funding patch that keeps the government open after Sept. 30. While a shutdown isn’t likely, Republicans and even some progressives have suggested that approving a bipartisan stopgap won’t be easy if it includes certain energy permitting provisions meant to button up the climate portions of Democrats’ signature party-line domestic policy bill. The chances of reaching an agreement could all hinge on the fast-approaching midterms. Republicans are expected to regain House control, and while conservative demands to return to Trump-era spending levels are implausible, the party might decide it’s worth waiting until it has more leverage to negotiate federal funding — while Democrats are looking for a deal while they know they still have majorities in both chambers, however slim. Plus, they’re wary of hamstringing federal agencies with flat budgets. Even if a short-term funding bill can pass, in other words, it’s easy to see Congress mired in a second fall funding clash during its post-election “lame-duck” session.  “A long-term continuing resolution that extends last year’s funding levels, coupled with record inflation, would inflict harmful cuts on vital programs that hard working Americans struggling with rising costs of living rely on and our national security,” House Appropriations Chair Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.) said in a statement, adding she looks forward to enacting “bipartisan, full-year spending bills as soon as possible.” It’s unclear whether any stopgap spending bill can carry Congress all the way to the end of the year — when two veteran spending leaders, Senate Appropriations Chair Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Vice Chair Richard Shelby (R-Ala.), are set to retire. Leahy wants to finish a short-term package with new spending levels before the current Congress ends, ramping up the pressure for one last funding deal with Shelby, his longtime partner in federal purse strings control. Before those broader spending talks can begin in earnest, lawmakers must grapple with the imminent Sept. 30 expiration of current funding. The likeliest and most major point of contention is provisions governing energy project permitting that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has promised to attach to the upcoming funding patch to keep the government open. Schumer’s plans would fulfill a condition that Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) sought as he gave long-awaited approval to the climate and tax portions of Democrats’ party-line bill. Manchin, and other more centrist Democrats, are concerned about new climate and infrastructure projects getting held up by red tape.    But some GOP senators, like top Budget Committee Republican Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have said they aren’t about to swallow those reforms to help Democrats along. And on the other side of the aisle, some progressives are protesting the Manchin-driven provisions, which they see as a boon for the fossil-fuel industry. While those objections could delay passage of a stopgap spending bill, they’re unlikely to derail it. Neither party wants to shoulder the blame for a government shutdown, and Republicans may be hard-pressed to vote against reforms that ultimately serve as a boon for fossil-fuel companies. So far, however, bipartisan negotiations on fiscal 2023 spending bills haven’t even begun. A spokesperson for Shelby said they can’t start until Democrats agree to a framework for the talks that would preserve a number of long-running policy provisions attached to the bills, known as “riders,” among other things.  Among the policy restrictions that Republicans want to preserve is the Hyde Amendment, which prohibits federal funding for abortions. Of the 12 appropriations bills for the fiscal year that begins on Oct. 1, House Democrats have passed six. The remaining half-dozen haven’t received a floor vote thanks to a variety of problems tripping up the caucus, like immigration and defense funding concerns. Senate Democrats, meanwhile, have released their own appropriations bills but haven’t held any markups or passed any out of committee. They also aren’t in sync with their House counterparts on a number of major issues, like how much money to give the Pentagon. House Democrats largely stuck with President Joe Biden’s budget request, proposing $762 billion in defense funding for the coming fiscal year. Their Senate colleagues came in much higher, drafting a $793 billion bill. Both proposals don’t include GOP input, meaning any eventual deal will likely include more Pentagon cash than the White House is comfortable with.",

        "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/25/abortion-access-restrictions-00053622",
        "description": "The erosion of abortion access in the United States accelerated this week with four more state trigger laws taking effect — in Idaho, North Dakota, Tennessee and Texas. While three of those states had significant restrictions on the procedure already in place, the new laws carry narrower exemptions and harsher criminal penalties, all but eliminating abortion in broad swaths of the U.S. As of Thursday, abortion is prohibited starting at conception, with limited exceptions, in a dozen states, and two more states forbid the procedure after the detection of fetal cardiac activity, around six weeks of pregnancy. The newly effective laws make good on conservative promises to swiftly prohibit abortion in as many states as possible following the Supreme Court’s decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in June and will leave much of the South and Plains states with virtually no access to the procedure. The laws could also make it harder for people to access non-abortion care, including for a miscarriage and family planning. In Texas, which has banned all abortions after roughly six weeks of pregnancy for nearly a year, abortion providers now risk a life sentence for performing an abortion at any time during pregnancy, unless the pregnant person’s life is in danger. Traveling outside of Texas for an abortion “was hard enough as it is, but now we have large blocks of the country that are abortion deserts with no provider at all,” said Abigail Aiken, an associate professor and researcher focusing on abortion at the University of Texas at Austin. “All these trigger bans going into effect at once are changing the picture.” While many people do not know they are pregnant six weeks after conception, Aiken cited her own research and data from the Texas Health Department to argue that a total ban — even with exemptions — is an order of magnitude more restrictive than a law barring abortion after fetal cardiac activity is detected. In the first month after Texas’ law took effect, for example, abortions in the state declined by about half compared to the previous year. “What we saw in Texas was online requests for abortion pills tripled and more people traveled out of state,” Aiken said. “But there were still abortions being provided below that six-week gestational limit. We saw that people became more aware that they had to recognize and address a pregnancy quickly because of the new time pressure.”    The same thing could happen in Tennessee, where abortion is now prohibited except if necessary to save the pregnant person’s life — taking the state’s law prohibiting abortions after the detection of fetal cardiac activity one step further. Gov. Bill Lee, earlier this week, suggested to local media that the new law provides adequate protection for physicians who perform an emergency abortion, even though the statute does not specify exactly what would fall under the exemption for protecting the life of the mother. Some Republican lawmakers have suggested they’d like to fine-tune the bill, though Lee told reporters he thinks the law already “provides for treatment of dangerous maternal health issues.” In Idaho, the state is banning all abortions with exemptions for rape, incest and threats to the life of the mother — and is currently fighting the Biden administration in federal court over whether patients who are at risk for serious but not life-threatening impairments have the right to the procedure. And in North Dakota, the state’s only abortion clinic has already moved across the border to Minnesota, though it is still in court challenging the state’s abortion law — which takes effect Friday. Abortion access will likely diminish further in the coming months in other GOP-controlled states. In Indiana, a new law that will prohibit abortion except in cases of rape, incest, fatal fetal anomaly and life endangerment is scheduled to take effect on Sept. 15. South Carolina lawmakers, who are set to meet next week, are debating a bill that would ban abortion starting at conception with no exceptions for rape and incest. The state ban on abortions taking place after cardiac activity is detected has been blocked by the state Supreme Court. And in West Virginia, legislators are at an impasse on a bill to clarify the state’s pre-Roe abortion law. Even if those bills pass, red state lawmakers say they may put forward other abortion-related proposals in the future — especially to counteract measures to strengthen abortion access in blue states. “This won’t be the end of it,” said West Virginia Senate Majority Leader Tom Takubo. “One adverse thing happens in California, it’ll be a heated discussion here in West Virginia.” And courts are temporarily blocking enforcement of sweeping restrictions in five other states — Arizona, Iowa, Michigan, Utah and Wyoming — as litigation against them proceeds. Court battles currently playing out in both Idaho and Texas that could reach the Supreme Court will also determine what rights both pregnant patients and abortion providers have in emergency situations. “Who is going to decide what care patients receive when they experience a dire medical emergency while pregnant?” said Jeff Dubner, an attorney with Democracy Forward, representing medical groups in both cases. “Is it going to be the physician in the room with them, making calls based on their decades of study, or is it going to be legislators with no medical expertise?” Explore the map below for more information about the status of abortion in each state as of Thursday evening.",

        "title": "What is Black Business Month?",
        "link": "https://www.franchisewire.com/what-is-black-business-month/",
        "description": "The Contributions of Black Entrepreneurs are at the Forefront of Black Business Month 2022\n\n\n\nAcross the U.S. economy and countless communities, Black entrepreneurs have made significant contributions through their businesses. Based on figures from the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA), there are more than 3.2 million Black-owned businesses that employ over 1.18 million workers in the U.S., according to the 2018 Annual Business Survey and Non-employer Statistics by Demographics. Despite these successes, Black entrepreneurs have faced discrimination and have struggled to get funding for their businesses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile the contributions of the African American community are honored during Black History Month every February, August is Black Business Month, which celebrates incredible business owners and the obstacles they’ve overcome. But who started Black Business Month, and what’s its significance?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWho Started Black Business Month? \n\n\n\nThe history of Black Business Month goes back two decades. Black Business Month was established in 2004 by entrepreneurs Frederick Jordan and John William Templeton. The purpose of establishing a month for Black business owners was to drive the policy agenda for Black entrepreneurs through the participation of community leaders, local politicians, and venture capitalists.\n\n\n\nAs an entrepreneur himself, Jordan related to the plight that many minority business owners have historically faced; in 1969, he struggled to gain financial backing and funding when he began his own firm in San Francisco, Calif. This struggle is unfortunately too common and continues today, but Black Business Month celebrates beating the odds, which increases its significance.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Importance of Black Business Month&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSupporting Black-owned businesses as a customer or a franchisor shows a commitment to diversity and inclusion, which increases Black entrepreneurship and minority business ownership. Simply educating the public about the obstacles that minority businesses still face is also important. For example, Blacks have historically seen higher unemployment rates in comparison to whites. Additionally, the median wealth held by White to Black families is 10:1, according to a study by the Joint Economic Committee. \n\n\n\nA way for entrepreneurs of all backgrounds to increase generational wealth is through franchising. By investing in a franchise, business owners benefit from a proven system and don’t have to start from scratch. But how do franchising institutions specifically reach minority entrepreneurs, and what does “support Black business” mean?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBlack Entrepreneurship and Franchising\n\n\n\nThe International Franchise Association (IFA) works to increase diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives with its DiversityFran program. Through this program, IFA members are assisted with reaching emerging markets and recognizing the importance of educating underserved communities in business ownership to increase generational wealth and job opportunities. The IFA has also established the Black Franchise Leadership Council, which is part of its Diversity Institute, to create a network for African American business owners. Through this network, Black business owners are empowered to understand the meaning of what it means to be supported.\n\n\n\nWhat Does ‘Support Black Business’ Mean?\n\n\n\nSupporting Black businesses doesn’t only mean frequenting a brand for the sake of economic exchanges of goods and services; when you support Black businesses, you’re supporting the community’s self-sufficiency, unity, and pride. As many entrepreneurs can attest, owning a business is more than just making a profit; it’s about giving back to the community through job opportunities and great service. This is especially true for franchisors, who have several ways to support Black entrepreneurship.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow Franchisors can Support Black Entrepreneurship\n\n\n\nHold Vendor Partners Accountable\n\n\n\nFranchisors have a lot of power regarding who they do business with. A great way to advance DEI initiatives is to work with vendors with the same values.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFollow the Hashtags on Social Media\n\n\n\nBusiness owners understand the importance of social media to grow their brands. To increase awareness of Black-owned businesses, hashtags to follow include: #ShopBlackOwned, #Blackmakers, #Blackowned, #SupportBlackBusiness, and #NationalBlackBusinessMonth.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShop Locally\n\n\n\nMany Black-owned enterprises are smaller, local businesses and not big-box stores. When franchisors buy supplies or go out to lunch with staff, they can consider going to locally&nbsp;Black-owned restaurants or stores.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nProvide Financing Options\n\n\n\nSince many franchise owners put much of their life savings into the business, funding can help them achieve their dreams. Franchisors can provide in-house financing options or have partnerships with third-party lenders. Although less than 10% of franchises are Black-owned and minority business owners have historically struggled to access capital, Black entrepreneurship is becoming more and more prevalent. Many celebrities have been leading the way for hopeful Black business owners, including Michael Jordan and Shaquille O&#8217;Neal. Institutions like the SBA have embraced DEI initiatives to ensure anybody with the will and ability to start a business has access to capital and educational resources. \n\n\n\nTakeaways of Black Business Month 2022\n\n\n\nBlack Business Month comes along every August to honor the entrepreneurs who’ve overcome obstacles to achieve great success. Franchising has proven to be a great path for these business owners. Franchisors can support these businesses by following them on social media, shopping locally instead of going to the box-big stores, and holding business partners accountable.",

        "description": "Pleasance Dome, EdinburghWhether tap dancing, singing Abba’s Money, Money, Money or lamenting the limitations of bargain-shop ‘pound pants’, the Welsh cast are cheeky and defiantEmilie Parry-Williams is remembering an unhappy year at a fancy London conservatoire. One of her tutors, she says, mercilessly ridiculed her. But it was nothing to do with her singing skills. It was, she claims, because she was a working-class woman from Pontypridd. “This is how privilege protects itself,” she says before launching into a showstopping rendition of Je Veux Vivre (I Want to Live) from Charles Gounod’s opera Roméo et Juliette. “Never letting you forget your place.”The actors in Darren Pritchard’s production for Common Wealth are all too aware of their place. Payday Party is a joyful true-life cabaret that takes inspiration from the Depression-era get-togethers among Harlem’s African Americans who needed to raise money to pay the rent. In this version, created with one eye to the cost-of-living crisis, a group of Welsh artists share their stories in the hope of getting a cut of the vouchers entrusted to the front-row audience.Payday Party is at Pleasance Dome, Edinburgh, until 27 August.All our Edinburgh festival reviews.

Flamenco should be participatory, and foreign audiences watch too politely and silently. Vimaambi is an artists’ association on the edge of the Sacromonte district. The cellar-like venue hosts weekend flamenco shows featuring young talent. The walls have local art, and the bar sells homemade empanadas. Vimaambi attracts tourists, but also members of the association, performers and local residents. You are surrounded by flamenco: audience members will join in with the palmas (clapping), or get on stage. It is an experience, not a show.Sarah Collings Continue reading...",

        "description": "An magical exploration of the weather literature left behind by the poets, scientists and historians of Anglo-Saxon BritainIf the airless, sultry, stuck summer left you longing for autumn or, indeed, for anything other than never-ending broil, you could do no better than plunge into the Anglo-Saxon year. Here, the seasons are properly seasonal, with wispy autumn smoke, blustery spring mornings and a summer that is lush, green and gently generative. Pride of place, though, goes to winter, a hoary-frosted, iron-earthed season of unyielding chill. Frankly, it is glorious.Eleanor Parker conjures up this evocative magic from her careful reading of the wealth of weather literature left behind by the poets, sermonisers, scientists and historians of Anglo-Saxon Britain, a period that stretched from 410 to 1066. This means roughly 600 summers and winters to think and write about. Combing the texts of everyone from the anonymous author of Beowulf to the Christian chronicler Bede, Parker paints a glowing picture of an age when the revolving year not only filled up the senses, but intricately marked out time and meaning. Braces of scholars were engaged in computus, the science of deciding just when the new year should begin, and what happened to the solstice in a leap year. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Opera Holland Park theatre, LondonThe twee Vaughan Williams piece is a strange choice for a youth company – but BYO create an endlessly spirited performanceSir John in Love is an odd choice for a youth opera company in 2022. Yes, it’s Ralph Vaughan Williams’s 150th anniversary year and yes, BYO has long made a point of staging less known repertory. But if this opera was ever hilarious rather than twee (emerging from the “cowpat school”, as Elisabeth Lutyens branded the musical pastoralism of RVW and co), its comedy has aged badly. There aren’t just endless fat jokes – it’s a Falstaff plot, after all – but French jokes, Welsh jokes, class jokes and jokes about men marrying men.More seriously for a production whose unequivocally talented personnel are all at the start of operatic careers, Sir John in Love is a piece dominated by older characters, including its title role, and with multiple generation gaps at its core. And don’t get me started on the vocal ensembles, whose auto-muddiness is beyond the reach of any surtitling.Until 27 August Continue reading...",

        "description": "President Biden on Wednesday unveiled a student loan forgiveness plan to appeal to tens of millions of borrowers, many of them young, with a simple refrain: Under Democrats, the government works to help those who need it the most.\n\n\n\nThe Americans he has in mind, the president said, are “working and middle-class people hit especially hard during the pandemic.”\n\n\n\nPerhaps. But the president has agonized since his campaign about how to fulfill the aims of liberals, who sought substantial, near-total student loan debt forgiveness, and those in both parties who chafe at changes they see as an unfair giveaway, or, worse, a wasted, inflationary federal exercise in currying political favor and one that is unlikely to constrain sky-high college tuitions and costs.\n\n\n\nThe Associated Press reported that if Biden’s plan survives legal challenges that are almost guaranteed, it could offer a windfall to many ahead of this fall’s midterm elections.\n\n\n\nMore than 43 million people have federal student debt, with an average balance of $37,667, according to federal data. Nearly a third of borrowers owe less than $10,000, and about half owe less than $20,000. The White House estimates that the president’s plan would eliminate the federal student debt of about 20 million people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“That’s 20 million people who can start getting on with their lives,” Biden said at the White House. “All this means, people can start to finally crawl out from under that mountain of debt. To get on top of their rent and utilities. To finally think about buying a home or starting a family or starting a business.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outline of the administration’s plan calls for erasing up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 annually. For those in lower income brackets who received Pell Grants, the forgiveness will be $20,000. In addition, the current moratorium on repaying student loan debts, which expires next week, will be extended for the seventh time until January (The Hill).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House added an additional ingredient: Borrowers with undergraduate loans can cap their repayment at 5 percent of their monthly income. Current students with loans are also eligible for this debt relief, and dependent students will be eligible for relief based on their parents’ income.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor details about elements of the policy, borrowers can check studentaid.gov.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden, joined by Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, drew a sharp contrast between the aims of Democrats, who he said are trying to lift the burden of debt from lower-income, higher education borrowers whose opportunities are constrained by steep economic obligations, and those wealthy enough to lessen their obligations with tax breaks.\n\n\n\nWhen a reporter asked the president whether his plan was unfair to those who have repaid student loans or chose not to borrow in the first place, Biden replied, “Is it fair to people who, in fact, do not own multi-billion-dollar businesses if they see one of these guys getting all the tax breaks? Is that fair? What do you think?” (The Hill).\n\n\n\nSome progressives, who have long pushed for $50,000 in debt forgiveness, were disappointed (The Hill). Others on the left praised the plan. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), who made the issue part of her own run for the White House and met with Biden to discuss his options, tweeted, “Today is a great day. 20 million Americans will never have to make another student loan payment. Another 23 million Americans will have significant relief on their student loans. This is about helping America's middle class and providing relief to those who need it most.”&nbsp; Moderates, on the other hand, now have to respond to questions about whether Biden’s plan worsens inflation (The Hill).\n\n\n\nAnd Republicans, who are assailing the administration over inflation and rising prices, pounced. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) said Biden’s plan amounted to a “wildly unfair redistribution” of wealth (The Hill).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome economists who served previous Democratic presidents were unimpressed.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Pouring roughly half trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless,” tweeted Jason Furman, former adviser to former Presidents Clinton and Obama. “Doing it while going well beyond one campaign promise ($10K of student loan relief) and breaking another (all proposals paid for) is even worse.”\n\n\n\nRep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio), who is running for a Senate seat in a red state won decisively by former President Trump two years ago, distanced himself from Biden’s plan. “Instead of forgiving student loans for six-figure earners, we should be working to level the playing field for all Americans,” he said in a statement.\n\n\n\nBeth Akers, an economist and senior fellow writing for the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute, on Tuesday said the net result of the president’s loan forgiveness plan is political more than economically cohesive, and she noted that Biden acted with his own say-so and opted to sidestep the legislative branch in a tough election year (Bloomberg News).\n\n\n\n“If Biden were in it to help struggling borrowers, he’d be working with Congress to enact systemic reform that would make things better for future students,” she added, “shoring up existing safety nets, streamlining repayment to minimize the hassle for borrowers, and avoiding driving up future borrowing and prices.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelated Articles\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Here’s what’s inside Biden’s historic student debt forgiveness plan.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: How will Biden’s student loan debt plan impact inflation?\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: Student loans received prior to a cutoff date of June 30 are eligible for the president’s debt forgiveness plan.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ The New York Times: What you need to know about Biden’s loan forgiveness plan.\n\n\n\n▪ CNBC: Explainer: Biden’s plan for borrowers: Who is eligible, how it works, when to apply.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ USA Today: For public workers, the administration also canceled about $10 billion in student loan debts, benefiting 175,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLEADING THE DAY\n\n\n\n➤ POLITICS\n\n\n\nTuesday night’s elections, headlined by a massive special election result in New York, gave national Democrats a major boost and hope that the November elections might not be nearly the walloping prognosticators and political watchers have been expecting for much of the past year.\n\n\n\nPat Ryan, a Democratic county executive, narrowly defeated Republican Marc Molinaro in the race for a House seat, previously occupied by New York Lt. Gov. Antonio Delgado (D), in New York’s Hudson Valley that has been a swing district in recent years. The results were the latest in a series of surprises for the party in power, which struggled for months to find an effective messaging strategy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRyan campaigned in large part on abortion access after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade in late June, with his win coming only weeks after Kansans voted against an state constitution amendment that would have said there’s no right to an abortion in the state. The two contests show the party that it has a potent talking point that is driving voters out even during a time with high inflation and economic uncertainty.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s a friendly reminder that, every time the narrative counts us out, we know how to change it,” Antjuan Seawright, a Democratic strategist and senior adviser to the House Democratic campaign arm, said. “You can’t always predict what defines an election six or seven months out.”\n\n\n\nThe road to keeping the majority is still a tough one for Democrats. After the results Tuesday night, the party holds a 221-212 advantage, with two vacancies, meaning Republicans need to pick up only a small number of seats. National Republican Congressional Committee Chairman Tom Emmer (R-Minn.) on Wednesday dismissed the result as a “quirk” (Axios).\n\n\n\n▪ Niall Stanage: The Memo: New York provides latest example of abortion’s impact.\n\n\n\n▪ FiveThirtyEight: Yes, special elections really are signaling a better-than-expected midterm For Democrats.\n\n\n\n▪ James Hohmann, The Washington Post: In New York, Democrats chart a new, centrist course.\n\n\n\n▪ Nate Cohn, The New York Times: Growing evidence against a Republican wave.\n\n\n\nHowever, there are still issues for Democrats on the ballot in November. As The Hill’s Brett Samuels details, some remain reluctant to tether themselves to Biden, even amid a stretch of legislative victories in recent weeks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBuoyed by those results, including the passage of the reconciliation bill, Biden has seen his approval ratings tick upward. However, that has not translated to the campaign trail as Democrats have yet to embrace him with open arms in their own races.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: LGBTQ+ candidates win in Florida in aftermath of “Don't Say Gay.”\n\n\n\n▪ The Washington Post: Ex-Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke lied to investigators in casino case, watchdog finds.\n\n\n\n▪ ABC News: Foreign politicians, an indicted election clerk and Vanilla Ice: Inside the revolving door of Trump's Mar-a-Lago.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIN FOCUS/SHARP TAKES\n\n\n\n➤ CONGRESS\n\n\n\nA fight is brewing on Capitol Hill as top Democrats scrap and claw to fill the top spot on the House Oversight and Reform Committee following the ouster of Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney (D-N.Y.) on Tuesday night.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt least three House Democrats have their sights set on nabbing the post, which was held for nearly a decade by the late Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.) before Maloney took over in 2019. Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.) was first out of the gates on Wednesday, saying in a statement that he has made the panel his “top priority” during his 14 years on it.\n\n\n\n“We need a tested leader who will not be timid in the face of Republican insurrectionists. One who has a deep understanding of the issues facing our Committee and our country. A collaborator who can be a bridge to our talented and diverse caucus,” he said in a statement. “I believe I can be that leader, and look forward to earning the support of my colleagues.”\n\n\n\nRep. Stephen Lynch (D-Mass.), the chairman of the National Security Subcommittee, also made it clear his intentions to win the top spot. In a letter to House Democrats, he noted he is “the most senior member of the Oversight Committee seeking this position.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHowever, one figure of interest is Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.). Despite having been in office since only 2017, he served as the lead impeachment manager of Trump’s Senate trial last year, giving him a national profile unlike either of the other two candidates.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRaskin, who chairs the Civil Rights and Civil Liberties Subcommittee, said on Wednesday that he is “strongly considering” a run. He was also handed a boost as Rep. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.), a progressive who was also initially considered a possible candidate for the post, tweeted that he “would like to see” Raskin run for the post and called on progressives to rally behind him.\n\n\n\n“He has done a masterful job standing up for democratic principles and norms and embodies the highest ideals of patriotism,” Khanna said. “He is meant to lead in this moment.”\n\n\n\nIf Democrats lose the majority, the top member on the panel will be tasked with combating GOP investigations of the president, including into his son Hunter Biden (The Hill).&nbsp;\n\n\n\n▪ Politico: Maloney loss prompts Dem pileup for top spot on investigative panel.\n\n\n\n▪ Government Executive: The race has begun to be the next House Democrat overseeing federal agencies.\n\n\n\n▪ The Hill: A House panel detailed the pressure on the Food and Drug Administration by the former Trump White House behind discredited COVID-19 treatments and vaccines in 2020, according to a report released on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee announced it will hold a Sept. 13 hearing to dive into whistleblower allegations about security problems at Twitter.

The Department of Health and Human Services said it was reviewing the decision.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn Idaho a federal judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked the state’s near-total ban on abortion, saying it violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, a federal law commonly referred to as EMTALA (The Hill).

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/3614573-how-will-bidens-student-loan-plan-impact-inflation/",
        "description": "President Biden announced on Wednesday an executive order to cancel at least $10,000 in federal student debt per borrower and extend a payment freeze through the end of the year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe plan has come under fire from some high-profile economists, including former Obama economic advisers Jason Furman and Larry Summers, who said that it will fan the flames of the nation’s 40-year high inflation. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts are divided over the inflationary effects Biden’s plan. Most agree, however, that even if student loan relief does lead to higher prices, the change will be marginal.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Biden’s order will likely give student borrowers a total of at least $300 billion in relief over a decade, most experts don’t believe it will ignite a surge of consumer spending akin to previous rounds of stimulus checks doled out during the height of the pandemic.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBillions of the forgiven debt may never have been repaid anyway thanks to delinquencies and expanded relief programs, experts say, and the spending unlocked by the relief will likely start with other debts and recurring expenses.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That impact will be spread out over time, so I don't think it's going to be a massive sudden infusion in the economy,” said Kevin Miller, associate director of higher education at the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonpartisan think tank, in a Wednesday interview.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It's possible that when millions of borrowers look at their balance sheets and see their balance drop, that we might get sort of an exuberant moment of spending and people celebrate, but I think it'd be really hard to predict how big of an impact that would be.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat does student debt relief have to do with inflation?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCritics of the plan say that lifting student debt will enable borrowers to spend far more over a short period of time, driving up demand, and thus, prices. The Federal Reserve has been hiking interest rates in an effort to reduce consumer spending that fueled inflation higher than seen in decades.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Pouring roughly half [a] trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning is reckless,” Jason Furman, a Harvard professor and former top economic adviser to President Obama,&nbsp;tweeted&nbsp;on Wednesday. However, he added that price hikes resulting from increased demand would be “relatively small.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, which advocates for deficit reduction, estimated that $10,000 in debt cancellation per borrower could add just 15 basis points to the inflation rate in the near term through a combination of higher demand and additional federal government borrowing.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s plan goes further than that by doubling the debt cancellation to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients and proposing a new rule that would cut the monthly student loan payment in half for certain low-income borrowers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This plan is much more expensive than we were thinking, so its inflationary effects are going to be higher than we've been thinking. It's going to more than wipe away all of the gains of the Inflation Reduction Act, which was going to push in the right direction in terms of inflation,” said Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMacGuineas added that Wednesday’s plan&nbsp;might spell bad news for future borrowers, arguing that it could prompt institutions to hike prices in anticipation of future debt cancellations, making higher education more expensive for&nbsp;younger generations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Ironically, this policy could be bad for the debt, bad for inflation and bad for the affordability of college,” she said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n‘Drop in the bucket’: Experts predict minimal inflationary impact&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearchers at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business estimated Biden’s initial proposal to eliminate up to $10,000 per borrower making less than $125,000 per year would add roughly $300 billion to the federal debt over the next 10 years. They plan to update their projections to include the additional $10,000 provided to Pell Grant recipients.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Kent Smetters, faculty director of the Penn Wharton Budget Model, said the inflationary impact of that additional spending would be minimal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“In terms of money in people's pockets, [it’s] actually not that big relative to the size of the economy,” Smetters said in a Wednesday interview. He estimated the plan would add 0.1 percentage points to overall inflation — a negligible difference between the current annual inflation rate of 8.5 percent and the Federal Reserve’s annual goal of 2 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Over time, a very small amount of that gap would be impacted by this.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlí Bustamante, deputy director of worker power and economic security at the liberal Roosevelt Institute, said that the new spending freed up by Biden’s plan amounts to a small fraction of the trillions of dollars Americans spend every year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It really is just a drop in the bucket when you consider the broader economy,” he said. “And that's assuming that everybody is just going to spend the money that they’re saving from navigating payments … we see that wealth and income constrained borrowers will ultimately use debt forgiveness to service other loans as well as increase their savings.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn addition, Biden’s plan aims to lift the freeze on student loan payments at the start of next year, a pandemic-era program that some economists blamed for helping fuel red-hot demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Ending the moratorium will weigh on growth and inflation, while debt forgiveness will support them. The net is largely a wash,” Moody’s Analytics chief economist Mark Zandi&nbsp;tweeted&nbsp;on Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepayment restart will sap momentum&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile millions of Americans will have their student debt balanced wiped out by Biden’s action, those with debt remaining must begin paying it back in January unless they are able to enroll in a different federal forgiveness program. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts say the resumption of loan payments for the first time since March 2020 will likely cause a pullback in spending that would sap momentum from rising prices.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That leaves 30 million people who will see their household budgets change in January, so the end of the repayment is actually a much bigger deal than the forgiveness itself,” Miller said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdvocates for student debt relief also argue that the growing threat of a recession — driven in part by the Fed’s attempts to fight inflation — make it essential to give borrowers a head start with payments resuming next year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If it is in fact the case that there is going to be a recession or that household budgets are now being weighed down more by inflation, the reasoning for the administration to improve people's household, financial standing is only more sure,” said Ben Kaufman, research and investigations director at the nonprofit Student Borrower Protection Center.&nbsp;",

        "description": "The embattled Israeli spyware firm NSO Group is replacing its CEO and cutting 13 percent of its workforce as it tries to recover from being blacklisted by the U.S. government.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts say the longtime industry leader has become a \"cautionary tale,\" after allowing its flagship Pegasus spyware to become a high-profile threat to global security and human rights, with media outlets worldwide detailing how governments were abusing its tools.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe company’s restructuring is likely tied to the Department of Commerce’s decision last fall to add the company to its entities list and the recent failure of its acquisition deal with U.S. defense contractor L3Harris, experts added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Being put on the entities list was killing the company,” said James Lewis, a senior vice president and director with the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.\n\n\n\nNSO Group suffered another blow in July, when L3Harris ended its bid to buy NSO’s spyware technology following concerns raised by the Biden administration that the acquisition would “pose a serious counterintelligence and security risk to U.S. personnel and systems.”\n\n\n\nApple also sued NSO Group last fall over the use of spyware on iPhones. The tech giant sought to ban the Israeli firm from using Pegasus on Apple’s hardware.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the lawsuit, Apple accuses NSO Group of being “amoral 21st century mercenaries who have created highly sophisticated cyber-surveillance machinery that invites routine and flagrant abuse,” The Associated Press reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts said these events taken together are sinking the company.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think NSO’s rumored acquisition by L3Harris was the best lifeboat the company had, and what we’re witnessing now is a disintegrating ship,” said Mike Sexton, a senior policy adviser for cyber at Third Way’s national security program.\n\n\n\nDespite the restructuring and the recent scandals NSO Group has faced, there will still be a high demand for these highly sophisticated spyware tools, experts said.\n\n\n\n“[The restructuring] won’t have much of an impact on how clients use spyware — there will always be countries that want to acquire and use spyware for malicious political ends,” said Jason Blessing, a research fellow at the American Enterprise Institute.\n\n\n\nHowever, the changes could potentially impact the supply side of the market as the company seeks to downsize and be more selective about its clients, Blessing said.\n\n\n\n“To date, NSO Group has largely dominated the spyware market, and laying off roughly 13 percent of their employees will certainly affect the firm’s ability to maintain its market share,” Blessing added.\n\n\n\nNSO Group came under global scrutiny in July 2021, when a number of news organizations collaborated on the Pegasus Project, revealing how the company had been selling its spyware to governments who use the tool to spy on political rivals, dissidents, journalists and human right activists.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. Congress took note, and last month took steps to address the threat from foreign spyware.\n\n\n\nHouse lawmakers included a provision in the Intelligence Authorization Act authorizing the director of national intelligence to prohibit the U.S. intelligence community from buying and using foreign spyware.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe bill would also allow the president to impose sanctions on foreign government officials and firms that target U.S. officials with spyware.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This spyware could be used against every member of this committee, every employee of the executive branch, every journalist or political activist,” said Rep. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, at a July hearing.\n\n\n\nU.S. officials, including diplomats, have reportedly been the victim of the spyware.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLate last year, Reuters reported that at least nine State Department officials based in Uganda were hacked by an unknown attacker using Pegasus. Sources told Reuters at the time that the hacks took place for several months.\n\n\n\nNSO Group also said it will now focus its business on NATO countries, a decision experts said is related to allegations of human rights abuses by governments who had purchased its spyware tool.\n\n\n\n“Pursuing NATO countries as the primary customer base is an attempt by the firm to survive and to salvage its reputation by prioritizing business with rich democratic countries,” Blessing said.\n\n\n\nThe experts added that if NSO Group is able to rebuild its brand and increase its revenue, it will probably start working again with non-NATO countries.\n\n\n\n“It looks like this will serve as a cautionary tale of a spyware merchant that flew too close to the sun,” Sexton said.\n\n\n\n“NSO overextended its client list and turned a blind eye to malpractice to the point that it became politically untenable both for the Biden administration and Israel’s post-Netanyahu coalition government,” he added.",

        "description": "Expect a Trumpier U.S. House of Representatives next year.\n\n\n\nHouse Republicans are not only forecast to win control of the lower chamber in November's midterm elections, they're also poised to bring with them a roster of new arrivals who have embraced the former president and his false claims of fraud surrounding his 2020 defeat.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA number of Trump loyalists have bumped off more moderate Republicans in the summer primaries — a list that grew longer on Tuesday with conservative victories in Florida and New York — while a number of other centrists are stepping into retirement.\n\n\n\nThe combination foreshadows a power shift in the House GOP that has the potential to complicate any bipartisan compromise with President Biden, while creating headaches for Republican leaders who will face pressure to demonstrate their governing chops in a new majority.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I believe that [House Minority Leader] Kevin McCarthy [Calif.] would have a rough time of it,” said David Mayhew, a political scientist at Yale University.Joe Kent, a former Green Beret, defeated pro-impeachment Rep. Jaime Herrera Beutler in a Washington GOP primary earlier this month with the help of an endorsement from Trump. Running as an “America First” Republican, he railed against the “establishment” and publicly said&nbsp;that McCarthy, the House GOP leader, should not be Speaker.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd he’s hardly alone.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the most recent round of primaries, winners in safe Republican House seats include former Trump appointee to the Pentagon Cory Mills, who has said that the 2020 election was “rigged.” Mills would replace outgoing Rep. Stephanie Murphy (D-Fla.).\n\n\n\nNew York State GOP Chairman Nick Langworthy, who&nbsp;heavily touted&nbsp;his previous support from Trump in the primary despite not getting a formal endorsement for the race, also won a primary in a safe GOP district on Tuesday. Rep. Chris Jacobs (R-N.Y.) ended his reelection bid for that seat due to blowback to his support for an assault weapons ban.\n\n\n\nOne of the starkest signs that incoming House Republicans will be friendlier to the former president is that Mills and Langworthy were considered the less extreme candidates in their races.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLangworthy defeated&nbsp;Carl Paladino, a gaffe-prone Trump supporter who was endorsed by Trump allies Reps. Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Marjorie Taylor Greene (Ga.), and Elise Stefanik (N.Y.). And Mills faced Florida state Rep. Anthony Sabatini, who was also supported by Gaetz and Greene and accused Mills of being a “RINO,” an acronym for \"Republican in name only.\"\n\n\n\nSarah Chamberlain, president and CEO of the Republican Main Street Partnership that supports “governing Republicans” who are willing to work across the aisle, pointed to the defeats of Paladino and Sabatini to argue that loyalty to Trump may not be a defining feature of incoming Republicans.\n\n\n\n“When the members sit around a table, Donald Trump is not what they discuss. They discuss Joe Biden and getting things done to help the American people,”&nbsp;Chamberlain said of the candidates supported by her group. “They're not against them by any means. They voted for him. But he is not a topic of conversation.”\n\n\n\nStill, several of the candidates highlighted as “Young Guns” by the National Republican Congressional Committee have also&nbsp;expressed skepticism&nbsp;about the 2020 election, even if they did not make loyalty to Trump a key part of their candidate pitch this year.\n\n\n\nDerrick Van Orden, a retired Navy SEAL seeking to replace retiring Rep. Ron Kind (D-Wis.), attended the “Stop the Steal” rally at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, but has said he never entered the Capitol and has since distanced himself from the events of that day.\n\n\n\nContributing to the likely power shift, many House Republicans who were critical of Trump or did not overtly embrace him will not be returning in 2022.\n\n\n\nEight of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump after the Jan. 6 Capitol attack either declined to run for reelection or lost their primaries. Others, like Rep. Rodney Davis (R-Ill.) and Rep. David McKinley (R-W.Va.), lost in primaries against other Trump-backed members after being put up against each other due to redistricting.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Trump allies like Gaetz and Greene sailed through their primaries.\n\n\n\nThe House Freedom Caucus, the group of hard-line conservatives, is likely to grow. A PAC affiliated with the group, the House Freedom Fund, is supporting Trump-endorsed newcomers Anna Paulina Luna in Florida, Bo Hines in North Carolina, and Jim Bognet in Pennsylvania.\n\n\n\nIf history is any guide, Republican leaders will have a delicate line to walk if they win back House control with a more conservative majority.\n\n\n\nGOP leaders embraced the Tea Party movement in the late aughts, which provided the burst of energy leading directly to their House takeover in 2010. But it was those same conservative majority-makers — and eventual Freedom Caucus founders — who fought their own leadership over everything from government spending to the proposed impeachment of President Obama.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe far-right pressure pushed former Speaker John Boehner (R-Ohio) into retirement, prevented McCarthy from rising to the Speakership in 2015 and was a thorn in the side of Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) during his short stint with the gavel.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome congressional experts predict the new wave of Trump loyalists will create similar headaches for GOP leaders next year — unless leadership jumps on board.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Donald Trump was the first Republican candidate for president who truly understood what the Tea Party was all about. The Paul Ryans of this world thought it was about small government. Wrong! It was a populist uprising,” said Bill Galston, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. “Trump got it right; everybody else got it wrong. And so he has now elevated that big Trump party, which is socially conservative but economically inclined to big government that serves their interests.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“These are not libertarians; they're anti-libertarians in all sorts of ways,” Galston added. “And that's the Republican Party now.\"\n\n\n\nThe influence of aggressive, Trump-loving House members and the number of headaches they create for GOP leadership next year may depend on how successful Republicans are in House races overall in this year’s midterms. Many of the newcomer GOP candidates in competitive races trying to unseat Democrats are more centrist, and largely do not talk about the former president.\n\n\n\nThe Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF), a super PAC aligned with McCarthy, has also swooped in to support incumbent members who fought off more extreme challengers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe CLF deployed a last-minute $50,000 in phone calls to support Rep. Daniel Webster (R-Fla.) on Tuesday as he fended off a surprisingly strong challenge from far-right, anti-Muslim activist Laura Loomer, who has been banned from multiple social media platforms.\n\n\n\nIt also helped centrist Republican Rep. David Valadao (Calif.), who voted to impeach Trump, and Rep. Young Kim (Calif.) advance to the general election as they faced more conservative challengers.",

        "description": "Two months after the Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, it’s increasingly clear that abortion is having a bigger political impact than many pundits predicted.\n\n\n\nThe latest proof came in a House special election on Tuesday, as Democrat Pat Ryan beat Republican Marc Molinaro in New York’s 19th District.\n\n\n\nThe contest was significant for two reasons.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFirst, Ryan placed abortion rights at the heart of his campaign. Second, the district is a classic bellwether, having been carried by former President Obama in 2012, former President Trump in 2016 and President Biden in 2020.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf Democrats can hold off the GOP there, it shows that they still have some hope of staving off Republican advances in November.\n\n\n\nRyan’s win came on the heels of a striking result in Kansas earlier this month. There, abortion rights campaigners prevailed by almost 20 points on a ballot measure revolving around whether the state constitution ought to protect a right to abortion.\n\n\n\nThe outcome was more striking because Kansas hasn’t backed a Democrat for president since 1964. Trump carried the state by almost 15 points in 2020.\n\n\n\nThen there is the general tightening of nationwide polls to consider.\n\n\n\nOn June 24, the day of the Supreme Court decision, Republicans led Democrats by 3.4 percentage points in the RealClearPolitics polling average on the so-called generic ballot — a polling question that asks respondents which party they favor in congressional elections.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA week later, the GOP’s advantage had declined to 2.2 points. Today, the Republican edge has been all but extinguished, standing at one-fifth of a percentage point.\n\n\n\nFor abortion rights advocates, it’s evidence that what they predicated is coming true: The Supreme Court’s decision has transformed the landscape for the midterms.\n\n\n\n“I feel like no one believed us for so long,” said Sam Lau, a spokesperson for Planned Parenthood Votes. “The majority of people support access to safe, legal abortion and they do not want the government to control these personal decisions that they want to be making themselves. That is absolutely a message that will resonate across all demographics.”\n\n\n\nWhile activists such as Lau have a political interest in making those claims, there is data to back them up.\n\n\n\nA series of polls has shown widespread disapproval of the court’s decision to strike down Roe, the 1973 decision that enshrined a constitutional right to abortion.\n\n\n\nA Fox News poll earlier this month indicated 60 percent of registered voters disapprove of the court’s move while only 38 percent approve. A Monmouth University poll in the immediate aftermath of the decision produced an almost identical result — 60 percent disapproval and 37 percent approval.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn Economist-YouGov poll conducted in late July and early August found the overall margin somewhat closer, with 49 percent disapproving and 38 percent approving.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the Economist survey also pointed to the issue’s potency with key groups.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSelf-described independents disapproved of Roe being struck down by 51 percent to 30 percent. Among all women, those who disapproved outnumbered those who approved by 25 points. Even 23 percent of Republicans — almost 1 in 4 — disapproved.\n\n\n\nRepublicans would much prefer to fight the midterms on completely different issues: inflation, immigration and crime as well as the general performance of Biden, who continues to suffer from very low approval ratings.\n\n\n\nBut the New York special election looks like the canary in the coal mine in that regard.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublican candidate Molinaro was far from an anti-abortion hard-liner — prior to the Supreme Court decision he had accepted Roe as settled law. He also sought to keep the spotlight on the economy and local issues.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClearly, his efforts were not successful.\n\n\n\nSome liberal strategists argue that voters are not buying the media framing of the issues in the midterms, in which topics such as inflation are “kitchen table issues,” whereas abortion is a more abstract matter of “values.\"\n\n\n\n“Abortion rights are everyday issues facing millions of Americans,” said Democratic operative Abigail Collazo. “Republicans are hoping people don’t know that. But people do know that. They know what issues impact them.”\n\n\n\nCollazo also took issue with the idea that the salience of abortion varies depending upon the state and the extent to which abortion access is directly threatened.\n\n\n\n“Americans do not view their rights and freedoms as being unique to their state,” she argued. “People move. They have families and friends and communities that cross state lines. Those sorts of boundaries do not make people less concerned about their access to health care — think of parents sending their kids to schools out of state.”\n\n\n\nTo be sure, the abortion issue is not a panacea to the problems Democrats are facing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublicans are still favored to take the House in November, though by a more modest margin than was thought likely a few months ago. GOP strategists continue to believe that the economy will have greater prominence in voters’ minds than any other issue.\n\n\n\nThere are, too, other issues that have helped Democrats’ fortunes edge up. Gas prices have declined from their peak, and earlier crises such as the infant formula shortage have faded.\n\n\n\nStill, the signs are plain that abortion is reverberating.\n\n\n\nA new analysis this week by a Democratic data firm found that several states are seeing a surge in female voter registration. The firm, TargetSmart Insights, found that woman had outregistered men by significant margins in states including Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, all of which will see competitive statewide races in November.\n\n\n\nRepublicans might dismiss such statistics coming from a Democratic firm.\n\n\n\nBut the results at the polls in Kansas and New York are harder to dispute.\n\n\n\n“The stakes are no longer hypothetical,” said Lau. “The issue of abortion, and reproductive rights and reproductive freedom, is being put at the forefront of campaigns across the country.”\n\n\n\nThe Memo is a reported column by Niall Stanage.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/3614519-democrats-show-reluctance-to-campaigning-with-biden/",
        "description": "Some Democrats running in competitive reelection races in November are still reluctant to attach themselves to President Biden, even as he and the White House have been buoyed by a few weeks of good news.\n\n\n\nBiden has in recent weeks racked up a series of major legislative victories, and he’s seen his poll numbers rebound slightly from all-time lows earlier in the summer. But that has yet to translate to enthusiasm among Democrats to embrace him on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\nThere have been some signs of that changing as primary season comes to a close, and a few experts believe Democrats are better off embracing Biden in the wake of his recent hot streak.\n\n\n\n“Democrats can’t possibly think that Republicans won’t put them in ads with Biden even if he physically doesn’t appear with him. They’re going to be linked to Biden, so they might as well make the most of it,” said Michael Cornfield, a political scientist and associate professor at George Washington University.\n\n\n\n“The benefits I think clearly outweigh the costs,” he added.\n\n\n\nDuring a recent trip to Ohio, Democratic Senate candidate Tim Ryan and Democratic gubernatorial candidate Nan Whaley both skipped Biden’s event. Neither has appeared alongside Biden on the campaign trail in recent weeks.\n\n\n\nRep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), who did appear alongside Biden at an event earlier this year, recently sought to distance herself from the president in a campaign ad that states, “She doesn’t work for Joe Biden. She works for you.”\n\n\n\nBiden has had limited travel in recent weeks, as he was sidelined by COVID-19 and more recently spent two weeks on vacation. But the president has not appeared alongside Senate candidates this summer in key races in North Carolina, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire and Arizona.\n\n\n\nA Democratic strategist argued that incumbents and candidates will appear with Biden when it makes the most sense for their campaign strategy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I think every candidate is going to look at it from his or her perspective in a very different manner and, particularly, if my demographic to win the race, for example, is white college-educated women and I’m playing on a Roe v. Wade-related issue, it may make sense to bring the president in as a rallying cry,” the strategist said.\n\n\n\nThe president has been something of a political drag in recent months, as rising costs of gas, housing, food and other goods helped sink his approval rating to a low average of 37 percent as recently as July 21, according to an average of polls from RealClearPolitics.\n\n\n\nBut momentum has started to shift, as Biden saw a flurry of congressional action in late July and early August, paired with declining gas prices and a successful counterterrorism mission that killed a top al Qaeda leader.\n\n\n\nBiden’s poll numbers have started to rebound: A Yahoo News-YouGov poll released Wednesday found the president’s approval rating at its highest level since May, though it still sits at 40 percent.\n\n\n\nXochitl Hinojosa, former communications director at the Democratic National Committee (DNC), argued that Democrats should be using Biden on the campaign trail, considering the wins he has delivered.\n\n\n\n“Because of the leadership of President Biden and Democrats in Congress, Democratic candidates have a long list of accomplishments to run on, whether it’s a strong economy, policies that lower costs, infrastructure investments and historic climate investments,” she said. “Democrats should be doing everything to tout and embrace that agenda, including utilizing President Biden and his Cabinet on the campaign trail.”\n\n\n\nWith the president’s brand starting to bounce back, a few Democrats have begun to signal they are willing to embrace Biden as campaign season heats up.\n\n\n\n“He’s a great man. He’s a great president. I can’t wait for him to get down here. I need his help. I want his help. He’s the best I’ve ever met,” Rep. Charlie Crist told CNN on Wednesday after clinching the state’s Democratic gubernatorial nomination.\n\n\n\nMaryland Democratic gubernatorial nominee Wes Moore is set to join Biden on Thursday at a DNC event in Montgomery County, Md.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), who is in one of the most closely watched Senate races, gave a lukewarm endorsement of the president coming to visit him on the campaign trail.\n\n\n\n“I will welcome anybody that comes to Arizona, travel around the state at any time, as long as I'm here, if I'm not up in Washington in session, and talk about what Arizona needs,” Kelly said Sunday on CNN.\n\n\n\nA Democratic operative described Biden’s lack of appearances with lawmakers as systematic and part of a strategy ahead of November.\n\n\n\n“Joe Biden is old school. He knows the value of campaigning for you or against you, whatever helps you win. The goal is to win, not to massage egos,” the operative said.\n\n\n\nSome administration officials have appeared with lawmakers to promote the Inflation Reduction Act at events around the country, which tend to draw very little attention compared to events with the president.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAgriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack participated in a roundtable discussion with Sen. Michael Bennet (D-Colo)— who is facing a tough reelection race— in Grand Junction, Colo., last week. Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, a 2020 rival of Biden’s, has also appeared in recent days with officials in Florida, New Mexico and Oklahoma.\n\n\n\nBiden is expected to ramp up his travel after Labor Day to tout the benefits of the Inflation Reduction Act, though the White House has yet to preview where he is going or who he might appear with.\n\n\n\nBut strategists expect the White House to carefully calibrate where Biden can be most useful in announcing new funding and how he can benefit the party with just two months until the midterms.\n\n\n\n“I think Joe Biden at the end of the day is going to be all about, how do I keep a Democratic House and a Democratic Senate?” one Democratic strategist said. “If I can help, I’ll be there. If I can’t help, I won’t be there.”",

Thirty-four percent of respondents in a new&nbsp;CNBC poll&nbsp;said only those in need should have debt forgiven, while 32 percent say all of those with student loan debt should have it forgiven. Thirty percent say no debt should be forgiven.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublicans have already used the issue to hit moderate Democrats, seeking to tie them to their progressive colleagues in districts with decidedly centrist tilts.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFollowing Biden’s announcement on Wednesday, Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel referred to the move as “Biden’s bailout for the wealthy.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As hardworking Americans struggle with soaring costs and a recession, Biden is giving a handout to the rich,” McDaniel said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, as reports of the upcoming announcement began to emerge, the National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee (NRCC) sought to tie Democratic Virginia Reps. Abigail Spanberger, Elaine Luria and Jennifer Wexton to the administration’s move.\n\n\n\n“Will Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton condemn this irresponsible plan that will make inflation even worse?” an NRCC press release asked.\n\n\n\nSpanberger and Luria are facing particularly contentious reelection bids, with the Cook Political Report rating their races as “toss-ups.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen asked about Biden’s announcement in an interview with The Hill on Tuesday, Spanberger said she still needed to dig into the details of the proposal, pivoting to discussing higher education costs more broadly.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“One of the things I think we need to be talking about is the overall expense related to higher education,” Spanberger said. “While there’s many opinions about loan forgiveness, how much it should be, how much it shouldn’t be, minimums, maximums, all of the rest, the bottom line is that we continue to see education prices go up year by year at really exorbitant rates.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“What I want to make sure is never absent from this conversation is are we actually getting at the heart of the problem, which is Americans are graduating or in some cases not graduating with exorbitant amounts of debt and not coming anywhere close to earnings that all them to pay that off,” she added&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLanae Erickson, senior vice president for social policy, education, and politics at the center left think tank Third Way, echoed Spanberger’s message about the cost of higher education in the U.S. and urged other Democratic candidates to adopt a similar message.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The Biden administration is taking this action, it’s not being voted on by the front-liners who have to win in these districts,” she said. “But they can talk about the fact that this has to be the beginning, not the end, and that we need to reform our higher education system so we’re not back here again in five years because this cannot be an every five years problem.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, he warned Republican attacks against loan forgiveness attacks could have traction with less affluent voters who have moved away from the party in recent years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Obviously for folks who have never gone to college, which is a group that Democrats have been eroding supporting among, this does send a message that Democrats are more concerned about issues that affect more elite voters than themselves,” Erickson said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSupporters of Biden’s move concede that it will not be universally praised, but also call it progress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This shows that the Biden administration is pursuing common sense debt relief,” said Jon Reinish, a Democratic strategist. “And good for them, they are not caving to far left, wacky socialists on the fringe of the party who want to do another big spending, write a blank check giveaway.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats have praised how Biden’s approach is targeted at specific income brackets, rather than a blanketed approach. Additionally, they point to how the action helps groups like women and people of color in particular.&nbsp;According to the National Center for Education Statistics,&nbsp;Black college graduates owe $25,000 on average more than white college graduates.\n\n\n\n“This president and this administration has been very effective and efficient on doing everything they can in particular for African American students and [Historically Black Colleges and Universities] and others,” Seawright said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUltimately, strategists said, the move may not move the needle with the sort of independent voters vulnerable Democrats need to win over, but it will help galvanize their base.\n\n\n\n“I don’t think that a modest $10,000 debt program to people making under $125,000 a year changes one swing voters or makes a right-leaning voter head with more gusto to the polls,” Reinish said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“What it does do is it could give Democrats more energy because this is something the White House campaigned on,” he continued. “Congressional Democrats and the White House can say here’s yet another thing we’ve delivered on this summer. That’s not a bad thing. That’s good.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "The Minnesota State Fair is upon us, and all of that food can be daunting. So we called on Minneapolis St. Paul Magazine food writer Dara Moskowitz Grumdahl to get us prepped for what to eat — and also what to avoid.Click play on the audio player above or read the transcript below for Moskowitz Grumdahl’s predictions on the best and worst new fair foods. And join us at the MPR booth 10:00 a.m. Tuesday or tune in next Wednesday to hear if she was right.For you, what makes an ideal state fair food? For me — and I&#x27;m very passionate about this — fair food should give you a feeling that you can only get at the fair. The sweet corn roast is the perfect example. Sweet corn is only in season one time a year. It&#x27;s specifically grown for us at the fair, so it’s ripe every single day. And you get that char roast that you can really only do at the fair. That&#x27;s a perfect, perfect fair food. Another perfect fair food is mini donuts. And they’re so perfect, I also feel a little bit like we should not have them the rest of the year — that&#x27;s how passionate I feel about the mini donuts. And then, of course, the last one: cheese curds. That&#x27;s where I was introduced to cheese curds. They have spread through the food environment since then; I&#x27;ve had fancy ones at restaurants resting on a bed of spinach. But the best ones are still at the state fair. Just smokin’ hot, gooey. Love it.What do you get excited about for this year? So the thing that I am just like, “I can&#x27;t believe how lucky we are,” is Union Hmong Kitchen, which has made James Beard Award nomination news this year. And what&#x27;s happened right now is that Chef Yia Vang has this food stand at Graze food hall in downtown Minneapolis. Well, he is recreating it at the food building at the state fair. It&#x27;s going to have a signature Hmong purple rice with different meats and sauces. Dej Qab Zib (Sweet Refreshment) from the new vendor Union Hmong Kitchen is among the new foods to be offered at the 2022 Minnesota State Fair. Courtesy Minnesota State FairThe Minnesota Farmers Union brought in a hard-hitting chef this year, Pat Weber, and they&#x27;re gonna do a big pork schnitzel sandwich from local farms. Really excited to try that. Gerard Klass is a wonderful chef and he runs Soul Bowl, also in Graze food hall in the North Loop in downtown Minneapolis. He&#x27;s basically bringing something that I&#x27;ve been wanting my whole life, which is fried chicken on a stick, but soul food style. And then did you hear Al’s Breakfast is doing a collaboration with Hamline Dining Hall? So they&#x27;re doing a collaboration where they&#x27;re putting together the Al&#x27;s Breakfast pancakes at Hamline. Very excited about this. What on the list do you think might be a misfire right off the bat? I know you haven&#x27;t tasted them yet, but what are you skeptical about? I&#x27;m grumpy and terrible, and everybody should hate me. I got to look at this new stand called Nautical Bowls. They seem very nice, but I don&#x27;t really want a granola acai bowl at the fair. Like, if I&#x27;m having January wellness or whatever, then maybe I want a granola acai bowl, but I don’t want to walk around with a bowl at the fair. The fair just needs to be that one time where you would cast that stuff aside, right?

        "description": "President Joe Biden speaks about student loan debt forgiveness at the White House on Wednesday, with U.S. Education Secretary Miguel Cardona by his side.Evan Vucci/APPresident Joe Biden&#x27;s announcement of a sweeping effort to forgive federal student loan debt –  up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients, and up to $10,000 for others who qualify – leaves  millions of borrowers with unanswered questions, and some of the details won&#x27;t be clear for weeks or months. Here are three big questions borrowers may have: 1) Who will get loan forgiveness? Americans currently owe about $1.62 trillion in federal student loans. Biden&#x27;s plan will provide relief to most of them — 43 million borrowers — and will completely erase the student debt of about 20 million. But who qualifies? Individuals with federal student loans who make under $125,000 per year, or couples earning less than $250,000, qualify for up to $10,000 in forgiveness. That includes current students: Borrowers who are dependent students will be eligible for relief based on their parents&#x27; income. Parent PLUS loans, which are federal loans for parents of undergraduate students, are also eligible under the president&#x27;s plan. (Loans taken out after June 30, 2022, will not qualify.)Qualified borrowers who received Pell Grants are eligible for additional relief – up to $20,000. Roughly 60% of federal student loan borrowers received Pell Grants, according to the White House. These grants are designed to help low-income students pay for higher education, and about a third of undergraduates with federal student loans receive Pell Grants every year. 2) Do I have to apply? Many borrowers, while excited about the news, want to know what comes next. The White House said that, in order to benefit, most borrowers will have to submit an application to verify their income. The Education Department said nearly 8 million borrowers already have income information on file, and should qualify to have their debts canceled automatically. For those 8 million borrowers, that relief may come very soon. And the timetable for those remaining borrowers — some 35 million of them?   &quot;That&#x27;s the million dollar question,&quot; Education Secretary Miguel Cardona told NPR&#x27;s Mary Louise Kelly. &quot;We&#x27;re improving a system that was broken and antiquated,&quot; he said, adding that it will take time to make the process run smoothly. Cardona urged borrowers to go to https://studentaid.gov/debt-relief-announcement/ for more information and to sign up for automated emails that will provide updates.3) Will my monthly payments go down? An unexpected part of Biden&#x27;s announcement is a revised plan for what is known as income-driven repayment (IDR), which are designed to help people who cannot afford to make large monthly payments.Biden&#x27;s IDR plan will cut the amount borrowers have to contribute each month — from 10 percent of their discretionary income to 5 percent. It will also raise the amount of income that is considered non-discretionary, thus providing more assistance.  While Biden&#x27;s loan forgiveness announcement brings immediate relief for many borrowers, Dominique Baker, an associate professor of education policy at Southern Methodist University, says these changes to IDR could bring benefits for years. &quot;When we talk about needing large-scale reform of the student loan system, this would be one of those things,&quot; she said. &quot;This is a good first step.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR.

The pitching wasn’t entirely to blame as a Gosuke Katoh error made two of those runs unearned. In terms of major league relevant performances, Mark Vientos had a pair of hits, while Travis Jankowski had one hit and a steal. In slightly less relevant performances, Dominic Smith had two singles while Travis Blankenhorn had one of the aforementioned first inning home runs.\n\nCF Travis Jankowski: 1-5, SB (4)\nDH Dominic Smith: 2-4, R, 2B, K\n3B Mark Vientos: 2-4, R, RBI\n1B Daniel Palka: 1-4, R, HR (24), 2 RBI, K\nRF Travis Blankenhorn: 1-4, R, HR (15), RBI, K\nLF Nick Plummer: 0-3, BB, 2 K\n2B Gosuke Katoh: 1-3, 2B, BB, K, E (4)\nSS JT Riddle: 0-4, K\nC Nick Dini: 0-4, 2 K\nLHP Mike Montgomery: 4.0 IP, 6 H, 4 R, 2 ER, 4 BB, 4 K\nLHP Locke St. John: 2.0 IP, 3 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 0 BB, 3 K, L (2-4)\nRHP Trey Cobb: 3.0 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 4 BB, 2 K\n\n\nDouble-A: Binghamton Rumble Ponies (16-29/44-71)\n\nREADING 4, BINGHAMTON 3 (BOX)\nBinghamton had this one in the bag but blew it in the ninth. Nick Meyer had what should have been the game winning RBI in the sixth with an RBI bunt single that put the Rumble Ponies up 3-2. Justin Courtney preserved that lead for two innings, but a Luke Ritter error lead to two unearned runs and a walkoff loss.\n\n2B Wyatt Young: 0-5, K\nRF Rowdey Jordan: 1-5, R, K\nSS Ronny Mauricio: 1-3, 2 R, BB, K, 2 E (24)\nCF Jake Mangum: 2-4\nLF Carlos Cortes: 2-3, 2B, RBI, BB\n1B Luke Ritter: 1-3, RBI, BB, E (13)\nC Nick Meyer: 1-4, RBI, K\nDH Hayden Senger: 0-4, 2 K (1)\n3B Nic Gaddis: 0-3, BB, 2 K, SB\nRHP Jose Chacin: 6.0 IP, 5 H, 2 R, 2 ER, 1 BB, 7 K\nRHP Justin Courtney: 2.0 IP, 3 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 3 K, H (1)\nRHP Grant Hartwig: 0.2 IP, 1 H, 2 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 1 K, L (0-1), BS (1)\n\n\nHigh-A: Brooklyn Cyclones (27-22/58-58)\n\nBROOKLYN 5, JERSEY SHORE 4 / 10 (BOX)\nThis was an exciting contest in the late innings. Brooklyn took the lead in the ninth on a solo homer from Stanley Consuegra, but Daison Acosta blew the save in the bottom half. Matt Rudick then drove in a run in the top of the tenth before Acosta again took a crack at securing the win. After a strikeout, he walked the bases loaded with one out only to secure another strikeout and induce a ground out to end the game. Shervyen Newton also went deep in the win, while Alex Ramirez had one hit and a pair of strikeouts.\n\nLF Matt Rudick: 0-4, RBI, 2 K\nCF Alex Ramirez: 1-5, 2 K, CS (6)\n1B JT Schwartz: 1-4, R, BB\n2B Jose Peroza: 2-5, 2 K\nRF Stanley Consuegra: 2-4, R, HR (4), 2 RBI, K\n3B William Lugo: 0-4, 3 K\nDH Jaylen Palmer: 0-4, 2 K\nC Matt O’Neill: 0-2, 2 R, 2 BB, K, E (4)\nSS Shervyen Newton: 2-4, R, HR (6), 2 RBI, K\nRHP Junior Santos: 5.2 IP, 3 H, 3 R, 2 ER, 2 BB, 8 K\nRHP Dylan Hall: 2.1 IP, 0 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K\nRHP Daison Acosta: 2.0 IP, 1 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 5 BB, 2 K, W (5-6), BS (2)\n\n\nSingle-A: St. Lucie Mets (26-23/67-48)\n\nST. LUCIE METS 5, PALM BEACH 4 (BOX)\nSt. Lucie out hit the Cardinals and built a four run lead in the middle innings, but Jordan Geber was left in one inning too long and Joshua Cornielly couldn’t hold the lead after that stumble. Recent draftee D’Andre Smith had the best offensive day, tripling as part of two performance with a walk. Geber, meanwhile, didn’t allow a run for the first six innings, then coughed up three without recording an out in the seventh.\n\nLF Omar De Los Santos: 0-4, 2 K\n3B Chase Estep: 1-4\nRF Carlos Dominguez: 2-4, K\nCF Tanner Murphy: 2-4, R, K\n1B Raul Beracierta: 1-4, R, K\n2B D’Andre Smith: 2-3, 2 R, 3B, RBI, BB, CS (1)\nDH Justin Guerrera: 1-3, R, K\nSS Brad Malm: 1-3, 2B, 2 RBI\nC Fernando Villalobos: 0-3, 2 K\nRHP Jordan Geber: 6.0 IP, 7 H, 4 R, 3 ER, 1 BB, 5 K\nRHP Joshua Cornielly: 3.0 IP, 5 H, 0 R, 0 ER, 0 BB, 2 K, W (3-3)\n\n\nComplex: FCL Mets (33-22)\n\nNO GAME (SCHEDULE)\nStar of the Night\nStanley Consuegra\nGoat of the Night\nLuke Ritter",

        "description": "Wall Street Journal: “The announcement brings to a close a fierce debate within the administration over how to approach student loans. The president had long been skeptical of using his executive authority to forgive debt. He raised concerns in internal meetings that the measure could benefit wealthy people and instructed his staff to impose an income cap so the benefits didn’t flow to individuals making lucrative salaries, according to administration officials and others familiar with the discussions.”\n\n\n\n“The president started warming to the prospect of using his authority to forgive some debt in recent months as senior aides, including White House chief of staff Ron Klain, made the case that it would be popular with young voters. Other Biden advisers argued that the move would help minority and low-income borrowers and be a legacy-defining moment for the president.”\n\n\n\nDavid Leonhardt: “It resembles a tax cut that flows mostly to the affluent: Americans who attend and graduate college tend to come from the top half of the income distribution and tend to remain there later in life. College graduates are also disproportionately white and Asian.”\n\n\n\nA Washington Post editorial: Biden’s student loan announcement is a regressive, expensive mistake.",

Doing it while going well beyond one campaign promise ($10K of student loan relief) and breaking another (all proposals paid for) is even worse.”",

        "description": "Wall Street Journal: “Mr. Biden’s plan will test the legal limits of the federal government’s authority to cancel student debt. Its success could depend on how courts would interpret the education secretary’s powers under the 1965 Higher Education Act, which allows the secretary to ‘consent to modification’ of loans, and ‘compromise, waive, or release’ unspecified amounts of student debt.”\n\n\n\n“Advocates for broad cancellation say the lack of explicit constraints in the law is deliberate, giving the executive branch flexibility with its ‘compromise authority’ to manage its relationship with borrowers. They note that presidents of both parties have used the law to forgive debt on a more-limited scale.”\n\n\n\nNew York Times: “Because Mr. Biden used executive action, rather than legislation, to forgive the loans, legal challenges are expected. It is unclear, however, who would have the standing to press their case in court. A recent Virginia Law Review article argued that the answer might be no one: States, for example, have little say in the operation of a federal loan system.”",

        "description": "Uvalde School Police Chief Pete Arredondo stands during a news conference outside of the Robb Elementary school on May 26 in Uvalde, Texas.Dario Lopez-Mills/APUpdated August 24, 2022 at 9:11 PM ETPete Arredondo, the police chief in charge of the law enforcement response to the May 24 shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, has been fired.After a nearly 90-minute termination hearing held behind closed doors Wednesday evening, the Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District&#x27;s board voted unanimously to terminate Arredondo&#x27;s contract effective immediately. They also found there was good cause for him not to receive pay for the time he was on unpaid administrative leave since July 19.Arredondo&#x27;s termination hearing was originally scheduled to take place a month ago, but that hearing was canceled at the request of Arredondo&#x27;s attorney, who told the district the police chief was entitled to due process.Arredondo was not present for Wednesday&#x27;s meeting, saying he was concerned over his safety, but his attorney released a 17-page statement in response to the termination hearing.&quot;Chief Arredondo will not participate in his own illegal and unconstitutional public lynching and respectfully requests the Board immediately reinstate him, with all backpay and benefits and close the complaint as unfounded,&quot; read the statement.The families of the 21 victims of the mass shooting at Robb Elementary have been demanding Arredondo be fired since news first broke in late May that the police chief was in charge of the law enforcement response during the shooting.Hundreds of officers waited more than an hour to confront the gunman while children in the 4th grade classroom where he was holed up called 911.A Texas House report found there were 376 law enforcement officers on the scene, including 150 U.S. Border Patrol Agents, 91 Texas Department of Public Safety troopers, 25 Uvalde police officers, 16 sheriff&#x27;s deputies, and five Uvalde Consolidated Independent School District officers.State lawmakers investigating the shooting found law enforcement failures at all levels. But the school district&#x27;s active shooter plan — co-written by Arredondo — called for Arredondo to take command of all of the officers who responded that day. Yet, Arredondo maintains he did not know he was the incident commander.Arredondo, a Uvalde native, was hired as the school district&#x27;s police chief in 2020. Prior to that, he worked at the Webb County Sheriff&#x27;s office in South Texas. The San Antonio Express News reported that Arredondo was demoted from a high-ranking position in 2014 because he had difficulty getting along with others in the department.Despite growing calls for action following the shooting, Uvalde Superintendent Hal Harrell waited almost two months to recommend Arredondo&#x27;s termination.At a heated school board forum in July, Brett Cross, the uncle and guardian of Uziyah Garcia, even gave the board a deadline. Uziyah is one of the 19 children killed in the shooting.&quot;I&#x27;ll tell you this. If he&#x27;s not fired by noon tomorrow, then I want your resignation and every single one of you board members because y&#x27;all do not give a damn about our children or us,&quot; Cross said at the time. &quot;Stand with us or against us, because we ain&#x27;t going nowhere.&quot;Cross said he doesn&#x27;t buy Arredondo not showing up to his termination hearings out of fear for his safety, saying during Wednesday&#x27;s public comments that Arredondo was not present &quot;to face the consequences to his actions.&quot; Copyright 2022 Texas Public Radio.

        "description": "Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko speaks in March in front of an apartment building that was shelled by Russian forces. Klitschko, a former world heavyweight boxing champion, has been mayor of Kyiv since 2014.Sergei Supinsky/AFP via Getty ImagesKYIV, Ukraine — If you want to challenge that old expression &quot;you can&#x27;t fight city hall,&quot; you should probably pick someplace besides Ukraine&#x27;s capital. That&#x27;s because the mayor&#x27;s previous job title was heavyweight champion of the world.Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko held that title on and off from 1999 to 2013.  Now, he&#x27;s fighting the Russians. Klitschko is quick to the scene when Russian airstrikes slam into the capital.&quot;They killed children, women, civilians, for what reason?&quot; Klitschko said as he arrived at an apartment building that was attacked in March. &quot;Where&#x27;s the military target? Is this building a military target?&quot;The Russian invasion in February has transformed Ukraine&#x27;s President Volodymyr Zelenskyy from a leader with sagging popularity into one of the world&#x27;s most famous political figures. Yet before the war, Klitschko was better known globally, at least to boxing fans.The Russians reached the outskirts of the capital early in the war and had just retreated when Klitschko spoke to NPR in April.&quot;Kyiv is the largest city in Eastern Europe. Right now, we guess half of the population (of 3.5 million) has already left,&quot; Klitschko said. &quot;The city&#x27;s changed totally. In the springtime, this city has energy. And right now, the city is almost dead.&quot;Now the capital is more relaxedThe war is still raging in eastern and southern Ukraine. But in the capital, many residents who initially fled have come back and the city has in many ways regained a sense of normalcy. There are still soldiers in the streets, checkpoints on the edge of the city, and frequent air raid sirens. But the streets are full of cars and pedestrians, shops and restaurants are open, and the day-to-day atmosphere is generally relaxed.Even when the Russians were nearby, Klitschko never stopped working out of City Hall, a massive stone building in the center of Kyiv, surrounded by sandbags. He said in a recent interview with The Sunday Times that he&#x27;s left the city just twice since the war began.World heavyweight champion Vitali Klitschko (right) celebrates his victory over Poland&#x27;s Tomasz Adamek in Poland in 2011. Klitschko&#x27;s brother, Wladimir Klitschko (left), was also a world champion as the two brothers dominated the heavyweight ranks for more than a decade. However, they kept a promise to their mother and never fought each other.Adam Nurkiewicz/AFP via Getty ImagesAt age 51, Klitschko stands 6-foot-7 and still looks to be around his fighting weight of 250. When he retired nearly a decade ago, he&#x27;d won 45 professional bouts — 41 by knockout — and lost only twice. His nickname? Dr. Ironfist. In politics, he did lose his first bid for mayor. But he won the post in 2014 and was easily reelected in 2020. He generally gets good marks from citizens.&quot;He&#x27;s done a pretty good job and I&#x27;m very thankful for what he&#x27;s done so far,&quot; said Dmytro Belov.  Belov gives toy car rides to children at a park that Klitschko upgraded. The park — one of several renovated by the mayor — now has an elevated walkway with a commanding view overlooking the Dnipro River , which bisects the city.  &quot;These are beautiful parks. I think they&#x27;re the new calling card of the city,&quot; Belov said. &quot;These are historical places and they&#x27;ve been modernized.&quot;Still, not everyone is a fan of the mayor.  &quot;I think that he is essentially a sportsman and he should stick to sports,&quot; said Anya Hovenko, who was pushing her child in a stroller through the park.&quot;He is definitely not someone who is adept at governing. I&#x27;m not very sure that he&#x27;s very good at his job.&quot;Kyiv Mayor Vitali Klitschko speaks to journalists in April at the demolition of a Soviet-era monument dedicated to Russian-Ukrainian friendship.Genya Savilov/AFP via Getty ImagesUkraine is poor compared to most of Europe. But there were signs of growing wealth in Kyiv — with Klitschko presiding over substantial development — until Russia invaded in February.  The city is now a mix of sleek glass towers that have risen in recent years, as well as stodgy apartment blocks from the Soviet era, and grand, ornate architectural gems that date back to czarist-era Russia.  Before the war, Klitschko did face critics who said he favored wealthy developers over ordinary residents.  &quot;His reputation is someone who has greatly developed the city, but mostly private development,&quot; said Liubomyr Mysiv of the group Rating, a private polling organization. Klitschko, he said, is seen as a mayor who has supported &quot;building condominiums and shopping malls, as opposed to the public services that employ people.&quot; Also, Klitschko supported President Volodymyr Zelenskyy&#x27;s opponent in the presidential election in 2019. But the war has unified Ukrainians and pushed most internal political differences to the side, at least for now.Brothers made a promise to their motherOne of Klitschko&#x27;s strongest supporters is his younger brother, Wladimir, who also held multiple world heavyweight titles, from 2006 to 2015. At times, both Klitschko brothers held title belts from rival boxing associations, an unprecedented domination of the heavyweight ranks by a pair of brothers.Yet they never settled it in the ring, keeping a promise to their mother that they would never pummel each other the way they hammered most everyone else.Their mother is Russian and their father is Ukrainian. Such marriages were quite common in the Soviet era. In addition, their father was a general in the Soviet air force. The brothers grew up on Soviet military bases in the 1970s and &#x27;80s.In a recent interview with Britain&#x27;s Sunday Times, Klitschko said his family was deeply loyal to the Soviet Union and viewed the U.S. as an enemy. But as his boxing career was taking off, he traveled to the U.S. in the late 1980s.&quot;I came back and told my father, &#x27;I&#x27;ve been to Florida. I visited Disney World, so many places.&#x27; I told him, &#x27;Sorry, everything you&#x27;ve heard about the United States is (nonsense). It&#x27;s a great country. They are great people,&#x27;&quot; he told the paper.The Klitschko brothers say that given mixed Russian-Ukrainian heritage, they have nothing against the Russian people. But they&#x27;re full-throated opponents of President Vladimir Putin&#x27;s war against Ukraine.Mayor Klitschko made that point, as he has done repeatedly, at a deadly missile strike in June.&quot;This senseless war. We have to do everything to stop this war. Because thousands and thousands of civilians die,&quot; he said.Greg Myre is a NPR national security correspondent. Follow him @gregmyre1.

        "description": "The FBI and local law enforcement are looking for a suspect who has robbed at least three banks in the Denver Metro Area. He has been nicknamed the &quot;Empty Promises Bandit.&quot;FBIThe FBI Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force and local law enforcement are looking for a suspect who&#x27;s robbed at least three banks in Colorado&#x27;s Denver metropolitan area. They&#x27;re calling him the &quot;Empty Promise Bandit.&quot;The FBI Rocky Mountain Safe Streets Task Force said the suspect is a 5-foot-9 white male in his 30s, with a slender build and close-cut, light-colored hair. Photos of the suspect show him wearing a hat and a pair of sunglasses.At least one of the robberies took place in August, FBI Public Affairs Specialist Vikki Migoya told NPR. Citing the sensitive nature of the ongoing investigation, the FBI declined to comment on specific dates and locations of the robberies.Migoya said the bandit&#x27;s nickname comes from his actions inside the bank.&quot;The robber presents demand notes, and in the demand notes he makes assertions that he will never be able to follow up on,&quot; she said. (The FBI would not specify what exactly those assertions were.) Anyone who has details about the robbery or could possibly identify the suspect should contact Metro Denver Crime Stoppers at 720-913-7867. Callers can remain anonymous and could earn up to $2,000 for their assistance. The Empty Promise Bandit has robbed multiple banks in the Denver area, including one attempted robbery. And though a weapon hasn&#x27;t been spotted in any of his crimes, according to the FBI, the suspect has threated the use of a weapon on at least one occasion.Using or brandishing a weapon during a bank robbery increases the stakes for perpetrators, according to Gannon University Associate Professor and former FBI special agent Jerry Clark. He said bringing a firearm or weapon into the mix tacks years onto a perpetrator&#x27;s sentence.Clark said bank robberies overall have been on the decline across the country, in part because cyber criminals have found ways to steal people&#x27;s money without setting foot in a bank. Advances in surveillance technology are another deterrent of would-be-robbers.Most of the heists that happen now are crimes of desperation, Clark said, carried out by individuals to fund drug and alcohol addictions, as well as people in financially dire straits. A small fraction of robbers hope to achieve a level of notoriety — or even do it for thrills, he said.  &quot;There are these adrenaline junkies that are doing it for the intense rush you get from going into the bank and doing that. They&#x27;re far less than the other people, but they exist,&quot; Clark said.But robbing banks comes at a steep price, punishable by up to 20 years in prison for each federal offense, the FBI said.&quot;It&#x27;s very challenging for someone to go into a bank and have the confidence that they won&#x27;t get caught,&quot; Clark said. &quot;... It&#x27;s always going to be a bad outcome.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "Henry Speelman, a former U.S. Marine and member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Council, has been renting a house on the reservation.Quil Lawrence/NPRThe GI bill has near-mythic significance in American history — generations of veterans got an education and an easy home loan, the sort of thing that pulls families up into the middle class.  That benefit has never really been available, though, to one group of Americans who serve in the military in very high numbers — Native Americans living on tribal land. Which was the subject of a small gathering this summer at the Mennonite Church in Lame Deer, Mont.Jeannie Beartusk, the veterans coordinator for the Northern Cheyenne Tribal government, set up snacks and refreshments for the vets in attendance, but that did nothing to change the fact that no bank will finance a GI bill home loan on tribal land.&quot;I tried to explain it as best as I could,&quot; she said, &quot;You know, I can&#x27;t bend the rules.&quot;That&#x27;s because the banks can&#x27;t take back tribal land if the loan defaults. This isn&#x27;t new — Congress tried to fix this problem 30 years ago. In 1992, the Native American Direct Loan (NADL) was created so the Department of Veterans Affairs can work directly with the tribes to finance a home loan.&quot;But the numbers are tiny,&quot; says Bill Shear with the federal Government Accountability Office. Shear authored a recent report that found that in the continental United States, the VA has used this Direct Loan just 89 times in the past decade.  Outreach by the VA gets to less than 1% of eligible Native vets, Shear says.&quot;This would be an example of ... how badly can a government program run,&quot; he says.The GAO report found that the VA doesn&#x27;t collect good data about the NADL&#x27;s results, and uses manuals that are out of date and reference offices that don&#x27;t exist anymore.Another issue that hinders is that the VA can&#x27;t legally make a loan until it has a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with each tribe. That takes action from from the tribes, but also outreach from the VA.Bryant Lacey, who oversees the Native American Direct Loan program at  the VA, says there are MOUs with only a fraction of the nearly 600 tribes in the United States.&quot;Right now we&#x27;re only capable of hitting nearly 20% of these federally recognized tribes with the VA program. So we are really focused on ... engaging with tribes that do not have these memorandums of understanding with us,&quot; he said.Lacey has read the critical GAO report, and he says the VA is already working on solutions including a new NADL team created in October, 2021. Lacey also confirmed that the Northern Cheyenne Tribe that Jeannie Beartusk works for is one of the few that already has an MOU to use the Direct Loan program. That was news to the veterans who gathered at the Menonite Church in Lame Deer.&quot;Never did hear of a direct loan,&quot; said Henry Speelman, a former U.S. Marine and member of the Northern Cheyenne Tribal Council.Speelman has a particular interest – he&#x27;s been renting a house on the reservation, and he says the owner is willing to sell. The house overlooks horses and cows grazing in a pasture and is framed by low hills and those other-worldly sandstone formations of Eastern Montana.  Speelman could probably get a regular VA home loan — but only to buy a house off the reservation.  He wants to stay here. &quot;It&#x27;s our stronghold,&quot; he says. &quot;We&#x27;ve been born and raised here, so it&#x27;s just ...  a sense of you feel safe here.&quot; Deer visit the back yard almost every night, and occasionally a black bear. A few grandkids live with him, and one of them rides the quarter horses grazing out front.&quot;And as chaotic as it is, it&#x27;s still home,&quot; he says.  &quot;It&#x27;s just where I wanna be.&quot;But he needs a loan. \nDespite several government programs designed to make that happen, he can&#x27;t seem to get one.\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

        "description": "Students eat lunch at Albert D. Lawton Intermediate School in Essex Junction, Vt., on June 9, 2022. The pandemic-era federal aid that made school meals available for free to all public school students — regardless of family income levels — is ending, raising fears about the effects in the upcoming school year for families already struggling with rising food and fuel costs.Lisa Rathke/APLunchtime on the first day of school at Mountain View Elementary earlier this month brought the familiar bustle of students scurrying to find their assigned table in the cafeteria while administrators checked trays and lunch bags to make sure everyone had something to eat.Many brought their own sack lunches this school year, because unlike the last two, not every child is eligible for free meals provided by the school. During the pandemic, schools were able to provide meals for free to kids regardless of income as a part of COVID-19 assistance passed by Congress to reduce food insecurity. This meant that nationally, an estimated 10 million kids who would have previously paid for school meals were able to get them free. But Congress did not agree to provide universal free lunches for a third school year.About 30 percent of the student population here qualifies for free or reduced lunch, mirroring data from the whole Boise School District system. But the other 70 percent are now responsible for paying their own way for breakfast and lunch.&quot;The biggest challenge is going to be on the children,&quot; said Christy Smith, supervisor of the Food and Nutrition Services at the Boise School District. &quot;Regardless of income, there are children who are hungry because children face obstacles to accessing nourishing food at home and those are the kids that are going to suffer the most.&quot;Nationwide, families across all income levels are feeling the strain of high food, gas, housing and utility costs. And Congress&#x27; decision to not extend a pandemic benefit that provided free meals to all students regardless of need will soon hit the pocketbooks of parents and provide new challenges for schools still grappling to return to normal. &quot;We are not on the edge, but our grocery budget could not afford $7.50 a day [for her kids&#x27; school lunches] five days a week,&quot; said Vanessa Gamma, a mother of three attending Mountain View. &quot;It would just be not something that even not on the edge we could afford.&quot;School meal prices challenge parents and educatorsThe Boise School District, like others across the country, is preparing to raise the prices of meals in its elementary schools by 10 cents this academic year in order to combat rising food and labor costs.  &quot;Our families in Boise can&#x27;t afford even a modest price increase,&quot; Smith said. &quot;Boise&#x27;s become a very expensive place to live and even 10 cents sounds modest, but that&#x27;s a lot of money to families who can&#x27;t pay their bills right now and don&#x27;t qualify for free or reduced-price meals.&quot;Across the country, school meals can cost parents upwards of $5 per meal. In nearby West Ada – Idaho&#x27;s largest school district, where only 14% of the student population fully qualifies for free and reduced-price meals – prices will increase by 30 cents. Shannon McCarthy Beasley, West Ada&#x27;s school nutrition supervisor, is on a mission to get as many kids as possible to buy the schools&#x27; hot, fresh and, most importantly she says, nutritious, meals. &quot;I have this challenge of convincing families my meals are better. My meals are better than what you can pack,&quot; said McCarthy Beasley. &quot;And I am up for that challenge.&quot;Advocates like McCarthy Beasley say school meals are often some of the healthiest that many students have access to because of the nutrition requirements behind every dish served. In order to streamline the process, West Ada has created a QR code families can scan and use to fill out the applications to see if they qualify for free or reduced-price meals. But that final bill is still a challenge.&quot;A mom and dad making $15 an hour with a family of three — they don&#x27;t qualify,&quot; McCarthy Beasley said. The challenges to pivot back to a pre-pandemic system are felt across the country as schools work to reach all parents, hire additional staff members to collect meal money in lunch lines and prepare to return to tracking the finances of each child.&quot;As much as we all would like to go back to normal into a pre-COVID world, we&#x27;re just not there,&quot; said Lisa Davis, senior vice president of Share Our Strength&#x27;s No Kid Hungry campaign. &quot;Staffing shortages are impacting school nutrition departments across the country and the supply chain continues to be a mess. Food price inflation is increasing significantly, and so school meal programs continue to have to continue to face a lot of challenges and juggle a lot of different dynamics.&quot;Apples and orange slices rest in trays for student lunch at Albert D. Lawton Intermediate School in Essex Junction, Vt., on June 9, 2022.Lisa Rathke/APFederal rules add to the challengesWhen Congress created the ability for schools to give universal free meals, it did so by allowing the Agriculture Department, the federal agency that governs what and how is served at school, to waive certain federal requirements. Lawmakers waived requirements for schools to provide free lunch based on need, nutrition requirements for the food served and requirements that meals needed to be served in congregate settings, like cafeterias.All of those waivers were set to expire on June 30.Two of them were recently extended. But Senate Republicans balked at the cost of providing universal free meals for another year, and as part of the final compromise, Democrats agreed to drop it from the package. This means all schools will go back to requiring that families pay the full price for each meal if they do not qualify for free or reduced-price meals.In order to qualify, families must meet income requirements that are the same across the country. For the 2022-2023 school year a family of four must make less than $51,338 to qualify for reduced-price meals and $36,075 to qualify for free meals.But each school district sets its own school meal prices, and those can significantly vary, as can the cost of living – not just within states but from state to state, which the income requirements don&#x27;t account for.&quot;I&#x27;ve already received an unprecedented number of requests from families to reconsider their denial for meal benefits after they submitted an application,&quot; said Smith of the Boise School District. &quot;And of course, that&#x27;s not something that we have control over. It is heart-wrenching.&quot;In Colorado, some schools are raising their meal prices by 50 cents. For families with multiple kids, it adds up. Sarah Kremmerling is a mother of two in Boulder, Colo., and her family has qualified for free lunches on and off over the years. For both kids, her monthly bill could total upwards of $200 if they were to eat at school every day.&quot;I fill out the application every year, but the only time I&#x27;ve been able to qualify for them is usually when I&#x27;m working like almost less than part-time — like I really can&#x27;t be working at all to qualify for them,&quot; Kremmerling said. &quot;I just think that&#x27;s kind of crazy when you look at, like, the price of living.&quot;Mary Rochelle, who works as the program, events and grant coordinator at the Food Services Department of the Boulder Valley School District, said her district is scrambling to hire employees to help students purchase the meals as opposed to just being able to hand them a tray for food. Lawmakers waited until just days before all the waivers expired on June 30 to pass the bill that extended some waivers but left free school meals out. Congressional delay in extending, or not extending, pandemic school meal waivers also hindered schools&#x27; ability to plan.&quot;There was a lot of talk and a lot of hope that the universal meals would be extended and we weren&#x27;t really sure how much we should tell parents free meals are definitely ending because we felt like we weren&#x27;t given a clear answer until June and our school year ends the end of May,&quot; Rochelle said.The universal school meal debate resumesEven before the pandemic, progressives, food and nutrition advocates were pushing for a universal school meal system that would offer school meals to students regardless of income. Advocates said the existing system of having three categories of pricing results in burdensome application processes, stigmatizes students who receive free meals and can cause families to carry lunch debt.&quot;We also have seen kids who were eligible for free school meals kind of slipped through the cracks and not get certified either because they were missed in direct certification or there were literacy or language barriers to the school meal application,&quot; said Crystal FitzSimmons, director of school and out of school time programs at the Food Research and Action Center.Some states have taken their own action. California, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada and Vermont have passed legislation or rules to allow all students in their states to receive free meals this upcoming school year. Others have legislation pending in statehouses. &quot;There&#x27;s a lot of innovation happening in communities and at the state level. I think where the conversation gets stuck is at the federal level,&quot; said Davis. &quot;And a big part of that is because the discussions again are all around price tags and offsets through that very narrow lens.&quot;On the Hill, Democrats and Republicans are still divided. Some progressives have introduced legislation that would provide free meals, but GOP members argue the price tag would be too high and that free meals is an assistance program that should be targeted.&quot;Congress never intended to provide universal free breakfast and lunches to all K-12 students regardless of need,&quot; said Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-NY, during a floor speech debating the waiver extensions in June. She favored the bill because the free meals would be extended by only one year, not longer. &quot;By returning these programs back to normal we can return our responsibility to taxpayers and the principle that aid should be targeted and temporary.&quot;Many education, hunger and nutrition groups have asked the White House to recommend that Congress implement universal school meals as a part of the broader list of recommendations expected to come out of the conference on hunger, nutrition and health next month. But until then, schools will need to adjust for the foreseeable future — whether or not they or families are ready. Copyright 2022 NPR. To see more, visit https://www.npr.org.",

        "description": "Dinosaur Valley State Park is home to many dinosaur tracks, but when drought conditions caused Paluxy River to dry up, it revealed tracks that are usually not visible.Texas Parks and Wildlife DepartmentIt&#x27;s not often you find a bright side to drought, but in Texas, the heat and lack of rain have uncovered dinosaur tracks from 113 million years ago. The tracks were unveiled at Dinosaur Valley State Park in Glen Rose, Texas — about an hour&#x27;s drive from Fort Worth. The park is known for its dinosaur tracks, but these newer ones are usually covered with water from the Paluxy River and aren&#x27;t visible.&quot;Due to the excessive drought conditions this past summer, the river dried up completely in most locations, allowing for more tracks to be uncovered here in the park,&quot; the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said in a statement. &quot;Under normal river conditions, these newer tracks are under water and are commonly filled in with sediment, making them buried and not as visible.&quot;Dinosaur tracks are not as rare as, say, dinosaur bones, according to professor Jerry Harris, the director of paleontology at Utah Tech University, but that&#x27;s because dinosaurs left way more footprints throughout their lives and ultimately had only one skeleton to leave behind.Researchers are working to map and collect data on the tracks while they are still visible. Eventually rain will come and the tracks will be covered again, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said.Texas Parks and Wildlife DepartmentDinosaur tracks reveal more about how the reptiles livedStill, Harris said the newly exposed tracks present a valuable find for researchers because they were made by living animals and can tell those studying the fossils more about the dinosaurs&#x27; behavior and day-to-day lives.&quot;You can get a lot of information about the posture of the animal that would be more difficult to get from the skeleton, about the speed, the animal which was moving, how it was responding to the sediment when the sediment was loose before it was turned to rock,&quot; Harris said.It&#x27;s also possible to determine whether the dinosaur was moving in a certain direction, why it was going that way or whether multiple dinosaurs were moving together in a herd, Harris said, adding that all this is much more difficult to discern from studying skeletons alone.As for the dinosaur that left the newly uncovered tracks, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said they belong to a theropod called Acrocanthosaurus — one of the two dinosaurs that make up the majority of tracks found around the state park. &quot;This was a dinosaur that would stand, as an adult, about 15 feet tall and [weigh] close to seven tons,&quot; the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department said.Water will cover the tracks againEventually, water will cover the tracks again, and they&#x27;ll be filled with sediment that helps prevent them from eroding away. But before that happens, researchers are working on mapping the tracks and collecting data. While the discovery of the tracks is exciting, it also presents an interesting juxtaposition, Harris said.&quot;There&#x27;s some irony in the fact that dinosaurs, which were ultimately wiped out by very rapid climate change, now [the] evidence of their living animals was exposed because of human-made climate change today.&quot; Copyright 2022 NPR.

It is entirely possible to ‘build your own’ video platform, but this leads us back to complexities and pulling your development team away from core features to handle video delivery. From time to market, cost (and cognitive overhead), the best way to add video is to utilize a video streaming service. The great thing today is that you can use the same technologies used by Netflix or Hulu to deliver your videos.\nWhat Is Video Streaming And Why You Need Adaptive Bitrate Video\nVideo streaming is the way that most video content is delivered on the web today. It features a number of advantages to just using a static video in the &lt;video&gt; tag.\nThe coolest feature that video streaming introduces is Adaptive Bitrate Video. Before adaptive bitrate video was developed, only one bitrate of the video could be delivered to the customer, regardless of the device or bandwidth environment. This solution is fine when network speeds are fast, but it can be problematic when network speeds are not fast (or fluctuate). And if there is one thing we all know — we cannot control the speed network our customers are using. \nOn a slow network connection, a traditional video will be very slow to start and very likely to stall. (Stalling is the video streaming term for the video stopping and a “spinner of death” appearing). Adaptive bitrate videos have multiple versions of the video available and can adapt to the network speed of your customer. That ensures that the video will start playback quickly and is much less likely to stall during playback — no matter the speed of your user’s internet connection.\n\nIf the network suddenly slows down, the player can also adapt (in the middle of the playback) and begin playing a lower bitrate version of the video. All of these features of adaptive bitrate streaming lead to a better video experience for your customers. It almost sounds like magic, but let’s look at the technology and how it works.\nHLS: The Magic Behind Smooth Video Streaming\nThe industry standard for video streaming is HTTP Live Streaming (HLS). The term Live in the name is a little misleading. While HLS can be used to stream live video, HLS is primarily used for playback of recorded videos, and can be found powering many of the top streaming services.\nSo how does HLS video work? The first step occurs on video upload when the streaming service generates a number of copies of the video in different bitrates. Then, each copy of the video is sliced into short segments — usually about 5-10 seconds long. \n\nDuring playback, the video player handles the download and playback of the video. If the rate of download begins to slow compared to the rate of playback — it is possible that the video might stall. So when the player requests the next 5-10 second segment of the video, it requests a lower bitrate version — since lower bitrates download faster, and the chance of video stall is mitigated.\nThis is the magic of the adaptive bitrate playback — the player adapts the video to meet the network speeds of each unique viewer of your content!\nYou Mention A Player. Do Browsers Not Support HLS?\nHLS is not natively supported in many browsers (it does have native support in Safari). In order to play an HLS video, you’ll need a JavaScript player as a part of your site to play back the video.\nThis Sounds Complicated\nWith time and development, it is possible to build your own video streaming platform — delivering an incredible video experience by re-encoding the video to HLS and delivering a customized player to your audience. But, building a video encoding/streaming platform will take a lot of developer time, pulling the team away from building your product. This is why my recommendation is to use a video streaming platform.\nWhat Makes A Good Video Processing Solution?\nOutsourcing complicated problems to the experts is a smart idea — you’re hiring domain experts to handle the complicated things rather than tackling them yourself. So what are the features that you should look for in a video streaming solution?\n\nThink of the advantages of HLS adaptive bitrate streaming.If you’re paying for high-quality and robust video delivery, you want to make sure the best streaming solution is in place.\nSupport conversion from all major file formats.Mp4 (h264 and 265), MOV, WebM, and others. Videos come in a myriad of formats; there’s no reason to convert to a new format before uploading.\nYour video streaming tool should fit into your existing media pipeline.The media solution should be able to find your videos in your current process — when videos are added to the cloud, they should be automatically processed into streams. \nAn out-of-the-box video player.As discussed, HLS streams don’t play in all browsers. Does your solution include a customizable player that you can plug into your current website?\nIf you deliver both images and videos, you want a solution that includes an asset management dashboard that allows you to visualize and organize images and videos\nLast but not least, analytics.How many viewers have watched your videos, and how long was each view? You also want to see processing analytics on how many videos have been fully encoded.\n\n\nWhat Service Offers All Of These Features?\nimgix has recently released a Video API that meets all of these requirements. Your videos are automatically encoded and streamed from any cloud folder — and with native support for AWS S3, Google Cloud and Azure, imgix can fit seamlessly into your existing workflow.\nThe imgix API will create either HLS or MP4 versions of your video based on your needs, and you’ll have a customized playback URL to add to your website. You can see all your videos in their Asset Manager, as well as detailed playback analytics. You also get an out-of-the-box video player that easily works in React, Vue, static HTML, and other popular frontend frameworks.\nMost importantly, if you need to deliver a large number of images and videos, a solution like imgix can optimize and process both types of assets without you having to build it from the ground up or cobble together different solutions. It’s truly a one-stop platform for visual media processing.",

He’s best known as Kenny Beats, a hip-hop producer whose CV ranges from Vince Staples to Jpegmafia to Slowthai, and is something of an internet celebrity, too. He’s racked up millions of views for his YouTube series the Cave, on which Blume makes a beat on the hoof and guest artists, including Doja Cat, Lil Yachty and Freddie Gibbs, freestyle over it; Billie Eilish and Skrillex have appeared as judges on his Twitch channel “beat battles”, where unknown producers fight it out to win equipment.Despite his productivity, Kenny Beats has said he had no ambition to make a solo album on the grounds that he “didn’t have anything to say”, a noble sentiment that’s never stopped many musicians. His mind was apparently changed when he found himself unexpectedly quarantined in Bath – he was working on Idles’ fourth album, Crawler – and received the news that his father had been diagnosed with cancer.

        "description": "Isle Royale National Park&#x27;s gray wolf population has reached 28, a dramatic comeback after the species nearly disappeared from the Lake Superior island chain, researchers said Wednesday. Health problems from inbreeding caused a die-off that left only two wolves a few years ago, leading park officials to authorize an airlift of mainland replacements. Wolves play a crucial role in balancing the island ecosystem by preying on moose, which browse heavily on balsam fir and other plants.“Mission accomplished. The goals have been met,&quot; said John Vucetich, a Michigan Technological University biologist who has long studied the relationship between the island&#x27;s wolves and moose. Nineteen wolves were brought to the park in 2018 and 2019 from Minnesota, Ontario and Michigan&#x27;s Upper Peninsula. Some died and one found its way back to the mainland. But at least five litters of pups have been born to those that settled into their new surroundings. This year&#x27;s population is the highest since 2006, when it totaled 30, said Sarah Hoy, a research assistant professor and animal ecologist at Michigan Tech. A team of scientists surveyed the wolves and moose from the air last winter, resuming one of the world&#x27;s longest running field studies of a predator and prey. It was canceled in 2021 to protect the research team from exposure to COVID-19.“The wolves were doing everything we&#x27;d expect them to be doing,” Hoy said. “We found them killing moose, exhibiting courtship and mating behavior, defending their territories. It was great to see.”They appear to have divided into two packs, one occupying the main island&#x27;s western section and the other the eastern side. The moose population was estimated at 1,346 — a decline of 28 percent from the previous total of 1,876 in 2020, according to a report Hoy, Vucetich and biologist Rolf Peterson prepared from the excursion. Moose numbers boomed during the wolf drop-off but have plunged since. Predation accounted for nearly 9 percent of deaths over the past year. Other factors were blood-sucking tick infestations and malnutrition caused by a shortage of balsam fir, the moose&#x27;s primary winter food source. Because their long-term average population is around 1,000, the recent slump won&#x27;t be cause for concern unless it continues at a similar rate for several more years, Hoy said. Scientists believe the island&#x27;s first moose swam to Isle Royale, which is part of Michigan but closer to Minnesota, around the turn of the 20th century. Wolves arrived in the late 1940s, apparently crossing ice bridges from Minnesota or Ontario. Moose provide an ample food supply for the wolves, which in turn help keep moose numbers in check. Researchers believe other wolves have migrated to the park at times, helping refresh the gene pool. But as climate change heats Lake Superior&#x27;s surface, ice bridges are forming less often. That could create an occasional future need for more mainland wolves to prevent more drop-offs from inbreeding, Vucetich said, although the population is in good shape for now. Another question is whether park vegetation will recover to previous levels as moose numbers fall, he said.“If it doesn&#x27;t, it means we won&#x27;t be able to have as many moose and in the long term that would be trouble for wolves,&quot; Vucetich said.",

        "description": "“Funding the government is never a breeze, but a handful of factors converging this fall may make for an especially rocky ride,” Politico reports.\n\n\n\n“The House and Senate have just weeks after their August break to pass a short-term funding patch that keeps the government open after Sept. 30.”\n\n\n\n“While a shutdown isn’t likely, Republicans and even some progressives have suggested that approving a bipartisan stopgap won’t be easy if it includes certain energy permitting provisions meant to button up the climate portions of Democrats’ signature party-line domestic policy bill. The chances of reaching an agreement could all hinge on the fast-approaching midterms.”",

        "description": "Wall Street Journal: “The announcement brings to a close a fierce debate within the administration over how to approach student loans. The president had long been skeptical of using his executive authority to forgive debt. He raised concerns in internal meetings that the measure could benefit wealthy people and instructed his staff to impose an income cap so the benefits didn’t flow to individuals making lucrative salaries, according to administration officials and others familiar with the discussions.”\n\n\n\n“The president started warming to the prospect of using his authority to forgive some debt in recent months as senior aides, including White House chief of staff Ron Klain, made the case that it would be popular with young voters. Other Biden advisers argued that the move would help minority and low-income borrowers and be a legacy-defining moment for the president.”\n\n\n\nDavid Leonhardt: “It resembles a tax cut that flows mostly to the affluent: Americans who attend and graduate college tend to come from the top half of the income distribution and tend to remain there later in life. College graduates are also disproportionately white and Asian.”\n\n\n\nA Washington Post editorial: Biden’s student loan announcement is a regressive, expensive mistake.",

Doing it while going well beyond one campaign promise ($10K of student loan relief) and breaking another (all proposals paid for) is even worse.”",

        "description": "Wall Street Journal: “Mr. Biden’s plan will test the legal limits of the federal government’s authority to cancel student debt. Its success could depend on how courts would interpret the education secretary’s powers under the 1965 Higher Education Act, which allows the secretary to ‘consent to modification’ of loans, and ‘compromise, waive, or release’ unspecified amounts of student debt.”\n\n\n\n“Advocates for broad cancellation say the lack of explicit constraints in the law is deliberate, giving the executive branch flexibility with its ‘compromise authority’ to manage its relationship with borrowers. They note that presidents of both parties have used the law to forgive debt on a more-limited scale.”\n\n\n\nNew York Times: “Because Mr. Biden used executive action, rather than legislation, to forgive the loans, legal challenges are expected. It is unclear, however, who would have the standing to press their case in court. A recent Virginia Law Review article argued that the answer might be no one: States, for example, have little say in the operation of a federal loan system.”",

        "description": "How Moral Panic Has Debased Art Criticism &#8211; Alice Gribbin:\n\nArtwords are not to be experienced but to be understood: From all directions, across the visual art world’s many arenas, the relationship between art and the viewer has come to be framed in this way. An artwork communicates a message, and comprehending that message is the work of its audience. Paintings are their images; physically encountering an original is nice, yes, but it’s not as if any essence resides there. Even a verbal description of a painting provides enough information for its message to be clear.\nThis vulgar and impoverishing approach to art denigrates the human mind, spirit, and senses. From where did the approach originate, and how did it come to such prominence? Historians a century from now will know better than we do. What can be stated with some certainty is the debasement is nearly complete: The institutions tasked with the promotion and preservation of art have determined that the artwork is a message-delivery system. More important than tracing the origins of this soul-denying formula is to refuse it — to insist on experiences that elevate aesthetics and thereby affirm both life and art. \n\nI wonder if this move is driven, in large part, by the demands of the ancient warfare between art and criticism: the critical defining of art as a message-delivery system is a way of saying that art merely does what criticism does, just not as well. For critics are habitually in the message-delivery business. ",

Excelling in leadership at the state level means waging and winning risky, politically inconvenient fights that do little to raise a governor’s national profile. A far easier way to attract attention and ingratiate yourself to Democratic power brokers is by picking culture-war fights with enemies of convenience—that is to say, people whom most of your fellow partisans loathe—no matter how tenuously connected those fights might be to politics or policy in the place you’re supposed to govern.”\n\n\n\n“Many Democrats rightly scoff at Trump-era conservatives who care more about owning the libs than serving their constituents. But Newsom likewise seems to think that, in today’s political environment, the best way to improve his national prospects is to mock and irritate the other side. And for better or worse, he may be correct.”",

(credit: Samuel Axon)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nApple announced a new product launch event for September 7, and it's a safe bet that we'll see the next wave of flagship iPhone models when the company's executives and product managers take the stage at the Steve Jobs Theater.\nCuriously, this is the earliest in the month we can remember Apple recently hosting a September event, and it also might be the earliest the company has announced the event before it happens, given that it's more than two weeks away.\nBut those aspects aside, we don't believe this will be an especially unusual event. Apple always uses the September event to announce new iPhone and Apple Watch models, which is exactly what we expect on September 7.Read 24 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Garver pushed for substantial change at the behest of the Obama administration and more investment in the commercial space industry; whereas, Bolden was more supportive of traditional space and represented the views of many people at NASA at the time resistant to change. Bolden and his allies won the battle, ensuring NASA's development of the Space Launch System rocket.Read 23 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "The Justice Department has released a nine-page memorandum from 2019 to then-Attorney General William Barr that lays out the case for not prosecuting former President Donald Trump for obstruction of justice in connection with special counsel Robert Mueller&#x27;s Russia investigation.Andrew Harnik/APThe Justice Department on Wednesday released a memo from 2019 laying out the case for not prosecuting former President Donald Trump for obstruction of justice in connection with then-special counsel Robert Mueller&#x27;s Russia investigation. The nine-page memo dated March 24, 2019 was written by two senior Trump Justice Department officials: Assistant Attorney General Steven Engel and Principal Associate Deputy Attorney General Ed O&#x27;Callaghan. They conclude that none of Trump&#x27;s actions documented in the Mueller report— his firing of FBI director James Comey; his directing the top White House lawyer to fire Mueller; his exhorting witnesses not to flip — should be viewed as obstruction. &quot;We conclude that the evidence described in Volume II of the Report is not, in our judgment, sufficient to support a conclusion beyond a reasonable doubt that the President violated the obstruction-of-justice statutes,&quot; the memo says. &quot;In addition, we believe that certain of the conduct examined by the Special Counsel could not, as a matter of law, support an obstruction charge under the circumstances.&quot;The watchdog group Citizens For Responsibility and Ethics in Washington sued under the Freedom of Information Act for the memo to be made public. The Justice Department long fought its release, arguing that the memo was part of the department&#x27;s internal deliberative process. A district court judge and a panel of circuit court judges disagreed and ordered its release.Then-Attorney General William Barr ultimately declined to prosecute Trump for obstruction of justice stemming from Mueller&#x27;s probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election. Trump and his supporters lauded the decision, but many legal experts questioned the reasoning and conclusion. More than 1,000 former federal prosecutors signed a letter in 2019 saying that the conduct described in Mueller&#x27;s report would normally lead to multiple felony charges for obstruction of justice.The memo concludes that there was not sufficient evidence to establish Trump obstructed justice during Mueller&#x27;s probe. It says that obstruction cases usually are brought when a person prevents the investigation and prosecution of a separate crime, and that the Mueller probe did not establish an underlying crime or criminal conspiracy. It also says that there is considerable evidence that Trump took official actions, such as asking the White House Counsel to fire Mueller, &quot;not for an illegal purpose, but rather because he believed the investigation was politically motivated and undermined his administration&#x27;s efforts to govern.&quot;The memo points out that none of Trump&#x27;s requests to alter the investigation were carried out.The document has been released as the former president faces both criminal and congressional investigations for other matters, including storing presidential documents at his Mar-a-Lago residence.

        "description": "Canada will allow for the maintenance of five turbines used by Russia&#8217;s Nord Stream 1 pipeline as scheduled, the Canadian government confirmed this week.\n\n\n\nOttawa had granted an exception to sanctions on Russia&#8217;s oil and gas industry in July, allowing the return of a first turbine for the gas pipeline to Germany. However Russian gas supplier Gazprom refused to accept the turbine, blaming technical issues and missing documents.\n\n\n\nDespite Gazprom&#8217;s rejection, the Canadian foreign minister said the permit as it stands allows for the maintenance of the five other turbines as scheduled and their return to Germany.\n\n\n\n&#8220;That&#8217;s exactly what Germany asked us,&#8221; Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly told the CBC on Wednesday. &#8220;Canada doesn&#8217;t want to give any form of excuse to [Russian President Vladimir] Putin to continue to weaponize his flow of energy to Europe.&#8221; \n\n\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz was in Canada this week; Berlin has asked for the return of the turbines over fear of gas shortages in winter, but the decision met strong criticism from Ukrainian officials.\n\n\n\nGazprom plans to halt Nord Stream 1 flow for a three-day maintenance period starting August 31 at the Portovaya power compressor station in Russia. However, the company said Thursday that none of the equipment needed at the station was currently in Canada. \n\n\n\n&#8220;None of the turbines for the Portovaya compressor station are under repair in Canada,&#8221; said a statement from Gazprom&#8217;s Telegram channel. \n\n\n\nCORRECTION. This article has been corrected to note that the that the permit as it stands allows for the maintenance of the five other turbines as scheduled.",

        "description": "A lot of things happened. Here are some of the things. This is TPM’s Morning Memo.\n\n\n\nCall It What It Is: Corruption\n\n\n\nYielding to a FOIA lawsuit by CREW, the Justice Department has released a key memo that gave Trump Attorney General Bill Barr Barr everything he needed to whitewash the Mueller Report. \n\n\n\nIt&#8217;s difficult to capture what a compromised and disturbing document this is without going back in time and reliving those fraught days in the spring of 2019 when Barr bamboozled the press corp and shamelessly dragged DOJ into the business of protecting the incumbent president. \n\n\n\nLet&#8217;s put it this way: This memo by Steven Engel, the head of the Office of Legal Counsel, and Ed O’Callaghan, the principal associate deputy attorney general, never gets written if the answer it gave was anything other than exculpatory of Trump. The conclusion was baked in from the beginning, and the poor quality of the legal analysis is just one tell that the fix was in. \n\n\n\nBut let me yield the floor to the experts on this:\n\n\n\nThe NYT&#8217;s Charlie Savage has an excellent thread on Twitter expressing the appropriate level of skepticism about the memo&#8217;s convoluted legal reasoning, misleading recitation of some of the facts, and overall weakness. \n\n\n\nI should note that a lot of the news coverage of the memo treats it with a lot less skepticism. Even the NYT article that Savage co-authored reads like the memo is a somber legal analysis made in good faith – until about the eighth paragraph, when it finally lowers the boom:\n\n\n\nOutside specialists in white-collar law greeted the disclosure of the memo with some skepticism, describing its tone as essentially that of a defense lawyer in a trial rather than an even-handed weighing of the law and evidence. \n\n\n\nThe most worked-up commentator was understandably Andrew Weissmann, a former DOJ lawyer on Mueller&#8217;s team:\n\n\n\n\nThe bias of the new DOJ Barr memo is revealed, e.g., by how it deals with McGahn evidence that Trump asked him to lie and write a false memo. Barr says that is disputed by Trump but Trump never gave evidence to the GJ or an interview.  There was no Trump evidence refuting McGahn.&mdash; Andrew Weissmann (@AWeissmann_) August 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\nNeal Katyal gets it:\n\n\n\n\nThe most glaring problem w/this ridiculous DOJ memo is if they really thought DOJ should reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed crimes,then thats exactly the kind of thing they shouldve asked Mueller to do. But they were afraid to ask him b/c they were afraid of the answer&mdash; Neal Katyal (@neal_katyal) August 24, 2022\n\n\n\n\nRandall Eliason weighs in too:\n\n\n\n\nThe DOJ memo re: Trump and obstruction claims it would be extremely unusual to prosecute someone for obstruction when their underlying conduct was found not to be criminal.Huh.  Scooter Libby and Martha Stewart would like a word.&mdash; Randall Eliason (@RDEliason) August 25, 2022\n\n\n\n\nLet&#8217;s Take A Peek At The Election Prognosticators\n\n\n\nCook Political Report: Red Wave Looks More Like a Ripple\n\n\n\nKyle Kondik at Sabato&#8217;s Crystal Ball changes his rating on three races all in the Democratic direction:\n\n\n\nNY-18 moves from Toss Up to Leans Democratic\n\n\n\nNY-19 moves from Leans Republican to Toss Up\n\n\n\nOH-Sen moves from Likely Republican to Leans Republican.\n\n\n\nFlip The Script\n\n\n\nThe conservative reaction to Biden&#8217;s student loan forgiveness program has mostly been a curdled mix of complaining about bailouts and deep animus toward any collective action to help others. Here&#8217;s how Biden responded when a White House reporter gave voice to the grumps:\n\n\n\n\nREPORTER: Is this unfair to people who paid their student loans or chose not to take out loans?BIDEN: Is it fair to people who, in fact, do not own multi-billion-dollar businesses if they see one of these guys getting all the tax breaks? Is that fair?

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA):\n\n\n\nAccording to a Rome Police Department report, police officers responded to a 911 call on Wednesday at 01:03 a.m. that led them to initially believe a man who had been shot multiple times was in the bathtub at Greene’s home. The caller also stated there was a woman inside the home and possibly children with her. When officers arrived, Greene assured them there was no issue at the home.“After we cleared the call and went back in service, Rome-Floyd 911 received a call from the suspect, claiming responsibility for the incident and explaining his/her motives,” the report stated. “It was a computer generated voice. They explained they were upset about Ms. Greene’s stance on ‘trans-gender youth’s rights,’ and stated they were trying to ‘swat’ her.”\n\n\n\nHow Are Things Going For Ron Johnson?\n\n\n\nHe&#8217;s just a victim, y&#8217;all.\n\n\n\nI&#8217;m up against massive amounts of spending. I&#8217;m up against the media. They&#8217;re very good. They are very good at assassinating people&#8217;s character, playing&nbsp;class envy, distorting things beyond any reasonable recognition of things I say.\n\n\n\nPlease stop persecuting Sen.

        "description": "The death toll from a Russian rocket attack as Ukraine observed its Independence Day has risen to 25, including an 11-year-old boy found under the rubble of a house and a 6-year-old killed in a car fire near a train station that was the target, a Ukrainian official said Thursday.Russia&#x27;s Defense Ministry said its forces used an Iskander missile to strike a military train that was carrying Ukrainian troops and equipment to the front line in eastern Ukraine. The ministry claimed more than 200 reservists &quot;were destroyed on their way to the combat zone.”The deputy head of the Ukrainian presidential office, Kyrylo Tymoshenko, did not say if the 25 victims he reported from Wednesday’s attack all were civilians. A total of 31 people sustained injuries, he said.The lethal strike in Chaplyne, a town of about 3,500 residents in the central Dnipropetrovsk region. nonetheless served as a brutally painful reminder that Russia&#x27;s military force is causing civilians to suffer and testing Ukraine&#x27;s resilience after six months of a grinding war.In Geneva on Thursday, the U.N.’s human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, decried the time since Russian President Vladimir Putin sent troops into the neighboring country as “unimaginably horrifying.” She called on Putin “to halt armed attacks against Ukraine.”The train station strike took place after Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky warned that Moscow might attempt “something particularly cruel” this week as Ukraine marked both its 1991 declaration of independence from the Soviet Union and the six-month point of Russia&#x27;s invasion on Wednesday.Tetyana Kvitnytska, deputy head of the Dnipropetrovsk regional health department, said the people wounded in the attack suffered a range of injuries.“There are craniocerebral injuries, limb fractures, many patients with explosive and shrapnel injuries, burns,&quot; she said. &quot;People were in a difficult condition, both physically and psychologically.”“Now our efforts are focused on the children who suffered. We work with four children. Three children out of four are in serious condition. In addition to severe stress, they have blast and shrapnel injuries, burns, and fractures,&quot; Kvitnytska said. &quot;The children are in serious condition.”The Russian government has repeatedly claimed following attacks in which civilians died that its forces only aimed at legitimate military targets. Hours before the train station attack, Russia insisted it was doing its best to spare civilians, even at a cost of slowing down its offensive in Ukraine.Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu, speaking Wednesday at a meeting of his counterparts from a security organization dominated by Russia and China, said Russia was carrying out strikes with precision weapons against Ukrainian military targets, and “everything is done to avoid civilian casualties.”“Undoubtedly, it slows down the pace of the offensive, but we do it deliberately,” he said.It was the second time Shoigu has made such a claim; he said the same thing in late May.Elsewhere in Ukraine, three people were killed in the eastern region of Donetsk on Wednesday and one more was wounded, Gov. Pavlo Kyrylenko said on Telegram.Nikopol, a city across the river from the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, came under more Russian shelling overnight, Valentyn Reznichenko, the governor of the Dnipropetrovsk region, said.",

        "description": "The White House on Thursday hailed a ruling by a federal judge in Idaho late Wednesday that temporarily halted the state’s abortion ban from taking effect, while vowing further action to safeguard access to abortions in emergency situations.\n\n\n\n“Yesterday, a federal Idaho district court determined that women in Idaho will continue to receive life-saving and health-preserving emergency care — including abortion care,”&nbsp;White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement. “This ruling will prevent serious harm to women in Idaho.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ruling represented a significant win for the Biden administration after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit over Idaho's abortion ban earlier this month in its first legal challenge to a state abortion law since the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June.\n\n\n\nAt the same time, the White House sharply criticized an earlier ruling in Texas blocking guidance issued by the Biden administration requiring doctors to offer care to pregnant people in emergencies, including abortions, even if it conflicts with state law. The guidance was released by the Department of Health and Human Services in July.\n\n\n\n“Americans across the country and of all backgrounds agree that women should have the right to make their own personal health care decisions and to receive life-saving medical care, without interference from politicians, and the President will continue to take action to protect women’s access to lifesaving health care,” Jean-Pierre said Thursday. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nJean-Pierre did not specify what further actions President Biden could take. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden has signed two executive orders on abortion rights since the ruling overturning Roe v. Wade that aim to protect access to abortion pills and emergency care for pregnant people and support people who travel out-of-state to seek abortions. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, the president has been under pressure to take more aggressive action. Thus far the White House has resisted calls to declare abortion access a public health emergency but has not ruled out that or other actions.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/campaign/3614856-democrats-cannot-afford-to-be-silent-on-abortion/",
        "description": "Two months ago this week, the Supreme Court overruled Roe v. Wade, its 1973 abortion decision. That decision ended the constitutional right to abortion and rolled back nearly half a century of reproductive freedom in American law. If it feels like the court made its fateful decision a lifetime ago, that’s because Republicans across the country have been working with alarming speed to dismantle what few abortion protections remain.\n\n\n\nIt took just 60 days for Republican-controlled state legislatures to ban abortion in 18 states, and anti-choice legislation is growing like kudzu through our state governments. Idaho and Tennessee both recently banned most abortions, helped by pre-existing “trigger” laws put into place before the court’s decision. Almost a third of the country now lacks access to fundamental reproductive freedom. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Democrats are riding their own wave: Surveys suggest abortion is rising in importance as a voting issue, and the Democratic Party is poised to benefit at the polls. If Democrats want to translate the base’s enthusiasm into real votes, they’ll need to show voters the horrifying reality of Republicans’ post-Roe America.\n\n\n\nThey’ll also need to send a jolt to the White House, where a commission established last year to prepare for America’s post-Roe future has failed to generate much enthusiasm — or much measurable output. Last month, the newly-energized Congressional Progressive Caucus produced a list of 10 executive orders it hopes Biden will enact to shore up both abortion rights and Democrats’ credibility as abortion defenders. If Biden has seen that list, it hasn’t spurred him to take fresh action.\n\n\n\nThe situation in the states is dire. Idaho’s abortion ban makes it so difficult for medical professionals to legally comply with that a federal judge implied it likely violates federal law. States with already sky-high maternal mortality, including Louisiana (58.1 deaths per 100,000 births) and Georgia (48.4 per 100,000), are enacting laws that not only ban abortion but functionally ban some forms of contraception as well. Louisiana’s draconian law is currently tied up in the courts, leading to a statewide rush on products like the Plan B emergency contraceptive.\n\n\n\nThose already sobering numbers are set to rise as more states enact sweeping bans on abortion and contraception. Researchers at the University of Colorado’s Institute of Behavioral Science expect strict bans to send maternal death rates soaring as much as 24 percent. That isn’t just from lack of abortion access, but from the creation of what experts call “maternity care deserts” created when family planning clinics close — taking their health care services with them. Seven million American women already live in maternity deserts, and the situation is rapidly worsening.\n\n\n\nDemocrats cannot afford to be silent on abortion. Fortunately for them, when Democrats get loud about abortion, they tap into a powerful current of anti-Republican sentiment that cuts across party lines. That’s what Americans saw in New York, where Democratic House hopeful Pat Ryan won an upset victory in New York’s 18th Congressional District by making abortion a centerpiece of his campaign. Ryan defied the GOP-created political myth that talking about abortion is political suicide for Democrats. By forcing his opponent to defend Republicans’ extreme abortion position, Ryan kept Republican Marc Molinaro in a constant defensive crouch. \n\n\n\nRyan did something bold: He actually read the polling data. A new survey from nonprofit newsroom South Dakota News Watch found that a near-supermajority (57 percent) of South Dakotans oppose a full ban on abortion. South Dakota is hardly a socialist paradise (voters there supported Donald Trump by a 2-to-1 margin in 2020), but its voters highlight just how many conservatives also believe in keeping the government out of people’s reproductive choices.\n\n\n\nThat trend is best observed in the House special elections that have taken place since the court’s decision to overrule Roe. Democrats in Nebraska’s 1st District cut a 15-point GOP advantage to just 5 points. In Minnesota’s 1st District, the Republican advantage fell from +10 to +4. That’s a huge red flag for GOP lawmakers.\n\n\n\nFrom Ryan’s big win in New York to voters in Kansas rejecting Republican-backed efforts to strip away the state’s abortion protections, Democrats are proving that the American electorate is ready for a real discussion about reproductive freedom. But those grassroots local efforts are no match for the national resources pumped into the anti-choice movement by deep-pocketed, Republican-aligned interests. That kind of effort requires a true national response, and that call to action can only come from the White House.\n\n\n\nBiden is riding high after a string of signature legislative victories, and that optimism has Democrats more confident in their political hopes than at any other time in Biden’s presidency. Now is the time to boldly and unapologetically center abortion rights and reproductive freedom as a unifying issue for the Democratic Party.\n\n\n\nIf Biden and congressional Democrats want to ride the wave of pro-choice enthusiasm into November, they’ll need to step more visibly into the fray and start leading the crowd.\n\n\n\nMax&nbsp;Burns&nbsp;is a Democratic strategist and founder of Third Degree Strategies, a progressive communications firm.

        "description": "Giants left-hander Jose Alvarez&#8217;s 2022 season is over due to a setback in his injury rehab, Susan Slusser of the San Francisco Chronicle reports.  Alvarez hasn&#8217;t pitched since mid-June due to a pair of injured-list stints, first for a back strain and then elbow inflammation that Slusser reports was later diagnosed as a UCL strain.  The problem is serious enough that Tommy John surgery is likely necessary, though Alvarez will probably seek out a second opinion before making his final choice about surgery.\nDue to the usual 12-15 month recovery timeframe for TJ surgery, Alvarez seems likely to miss the entire 2023 season.  On the off chance that Alvarez does find a favorable second opinion, it would still seem like he&#8217;d be facing a lengthy absence that might make him questionable for the start of the 2023 campaign, and there&#8217;s no guarantee that he wouldn&#8217;t eventually end up getting a Tommy John surgery anyway in the event of another setback.\nIt&#8217;s a tough outcome for the 33-year-old, who will end his 10th Major League season with just 15 1/3 innings pitched and a 5.28 ERA.  Alvarez signed a free agent with San Francisco prior to the 2021 season that ultimately paid him $2.55MM over the 2021-22 seasons, after the Giants exercised a club option on his services for 2022.\nAs such, the left-hander will now head into free agency with a lot of health uncertainty hanging over his market.  It doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean that Alvarez won&#8217;t be able to find a new deal this winter, as several pitchers in similar TJ situations have signed two-year contracts, with only a minimum salary for the first year of the contract in the understanding that the pitcher will miss most or all of the year rehabbing.\nAlvarez had a solid track record of success as a member of the Angels and Phillies bullpens from 2015-19, posting a 3.36 ERA/3.80 SIERA over 295 innings in those seasons.  Alvarez wasn&#8217;t just a left-handed specialist, as he delivered good numbers against right-handed batters in addition to dominating left-handed batters.  His solid run was interrupted by an injury-plagued 2020 season, as he tossed only 6 1/3 innings for Philadelphia due to a groin injury.\nIt made for an ill-timed platform season as Alvarez was eligible for free agency for the first time, and the Giants ended up with a nice bargain for their modest $2.55MM investment.  Despite a 4.42 SIERA in 2021 and one of the lowest (15.8%) strikeout rates of any pitcher in baseball, Alvarez outperformed his peripherals to post a 2.37 ERA over 64 2/3 frames last season, benefiting from a 50.5% grounder rate, lots of soft contact, and a .251 BABIP.\nThis performance made it a pretty easy call for the Giants to exercise their club option, but Alvarez unfortunately again finds himself heading into free agency as a big injury question mark.  It wouldn&#8217;t be surprising to see the Giants re-sign Alvarez to another low-cost two-year deal, even if there&#8217;s naturally more risk attached to an older pitcher coming off Tommy John surgery.",

Excelling in leadership at the state level means waging and winning risky, politically inconvenient fights that do little to raise a governor’s national profile. A far easier way to attract attention and ingratiate yourself to Democratic power brokers is by picking culture-war fights with enemies of convenience—that is to say, people whom most of your fellow partisans loathe—no matter how tenuously connected those fights might be to politics or policy in the place you’re supposed to govern.”\n\n\n\n“Many Democrats rightly scoff at Trump-era conservatives who care more about owning the libs than serving their constituents. But Newsom likewise seems to think that, in today’s political environment, the best way to improve his national prospects is to mock and irritate the other side. And for better or worse, he may be correct.”",

        "description": "The hard work and resilience of teachers and pupils to reach this point is the  most impressive result of allThis summer’s GCSE results are the first from examinations in three years. Results are significantly lower than last year but we should not read anything into that. After two years of grades increasing with the use of teacher-assessed grades, the government signalled its intentions early that we should begin the process of returning to pre-pandemic grade distributions. In September, the qualifications regulator, Ofqual, announced results would be around the midpoint of those in 2019 and 2021.This is exactly what we have seen in today’s data. The proportion of entries from 16-year-olds awarded a grade 4 or above is down from 79% last year to 75% today, and the proportion getting the higher grades (grade 7 and above), which peaked at 30% in 2021, has fallen to 27% this year.

        "description": "Dutch health authorities are investigating the death of a 3-month old baby in a reception center for asylum seekers, the country&#8217;s Health and Youth Care Inspectorate announced Wednesday.\n\n\n\nHealth authorities said the baby died Wednesday morning in a &#8220;gym that serves as an emergency shelter for asylum seekers,&#8221; in the village of Ter Apel in the east of the country.\n\n\n\nThe inspectorate said in a statement that they did not have much information on the death of the baby. It added that it is investigating &#8220;all possible aspects that may have played a role in the death of the baby,&#8221; including the medical cause, whether care was previously provided, and the conditions at the center. &#8220;Unfortunately, medical help was of no help,&#8221; the agency stated.\n\n\n\nThe incident elicited numerous reactions from Dutch politicians. Members of parliament Kati Piri (Labor) and Suzanne Kröger (GroenLinks) have called on State Secretary Eric van der Burg, in charge of asylum and migration, to issue a letter to clarify the circumstances surrounding the event. Member of parliament Jasper van Dijk from the Socialist Party submitted a request for a parliamentary debate on the issue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Dutch government is being sued by the Dutch Council for Refugees over the conditions at its centers for asylum reception, which the organization deems as inhumane. The group filed a summary proceedings against the government on August 17. \n\n\n\nThey say that the reception locations are &#8220;not suitable for habitation,&#8221; and lack &#8220;the most basic conditions such as privacy, sufficiently clean sanitary facilities, beds, enough and decent food and protection against weather conditions.&#8221; The lawsuit is expected to be heard at the district court of The Hague on September 15.",

Washington will be calling up prospect Cade Cavalli to make a start for them.\nAround Major League Baseball\nIn 2023 all 30 major league teams will have to play each other for the first time in MLB history.\nDodgers star Cody Bellinger looks nothing like the player that won the 2019 MVP so what happened to the burgeoning star?\nPirates shortstop Oneil Cruz recorded the hardest hit ball in Statcast history with a 122.4 mph single.\nMariners rookie George Kirby set a new record by throwing 24 straight strikes to start the game.\nIn a new report about the Astros cheating scandal, GM Jeff Luhnow reportedly deleted phone data to hide information from MLB investigators. \nYesterday at Amazin’ Avenue\nOn the latest episdoe of A Pod of Their Own, Kate Feldman of the Daily News was on to discuss the new A League of Their Own streaming series.\nThis Date in Mets History\nToday would have been Pedro Feliciano’s 46th birthday.

        "description": "People who use therapeutic cannabis are more likely to also use nicotine products than the general population, according to a new study.\nThe study, published in the American Journal on Addictions, is among the first to examine nicotine use among patients of a medical marijuana dispensary.\n&#8220;Simultaneous use of cannabis and nicotine is a growing concern, but while the relationship between recreational cannabis and nicotine use is well-established, little is known about nicotine use among users of medical cannabis,&#8221; says Mary Bridgeman, a clinical professor at Rutgers University&#8217;s Ernest Mario School of Pharmacy.\nThe researchers surveyed 697 patients between ages 18 and 89 at a medical marijuana dispensary on their nicotine and cannabis use, how they self-administered the cannabis (smoked, vaped), and the medical conditions that qualified them for using therapeutic cannabis.\nThey found that close to 40% of medical marijuana users also use nicotine—sharply higher than the 14% of United States adults who smoke.\nTherapeutic cannabis users who also used electronic cigarettes or didn’t use nicotine at all were about four times more likely to vape, rather than smoke, cannabis than those who exclusively smoked cigarettes.\nThe study also found 75% of the respondents smoked cannabis rather than vaped and about 80% of the cigarette smokers reported planning to quit in the next six months.\nThese findings reveal that while medical cannabis dispensaries may recommend vaping rather than smoking cannabis due to the health concerns associated with combustible products, this recommendation alone may not influence patients who also smoke cigarettes,&#8221; says coauthor Marc Steinberg, author of the study and a professor in the department of psychiatry at Rutgers Robert Wood Johnson Medical School.\n&#8220;Between the higher rates of nicotine use in those using medical cannabis, the fact that cigarette smokers opt to smoke cannabis as well, and that those people also are seeking to quit using nicotine presents a strong argument that dispensaries provide tobacco control messaging at the point of sale to encourage cigarette smokers to quit,&#8221; Steinberg adds.\n&#8220;The strategy also could increase the chances that a medical cannabis user would vape the product, which is a less harmful route than smoking.&#8221;\nSource: Rutgers University\nThe post 40% on medical marijuana also use nicotine appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Monkey Barrel, EdinburghThe Australian comic takes incongruity to uncommon lengths – and this year he’s recalibrated his show towards warmth“My mind is a prison full of crazy ideas. And I think there’s going to be a jailbreak!” That’s Sam Campbell: freewheeling concepts for comedy set loose at you from all angles, by an act who’s sharply aware of the ridiculousness of that undertaking. It’s after midnight when he traps his audience in this subterranean space, and nocturnal giddiness may play a role in what follows, as Campbell splices manic standup, unexpected cameos and dotty visual gags on-screen. None of it has anything to do with anything: it’s the incongruity, taken to uncommon lengths, that’s funny.And it is here, more so than on previous occasions I’ve seen the Australian’s work. Like those great oddball comics Hans Teeuwen and Sam Simmons, there’s always been an edge of instability to what Campbell does. His boyish face could burst out crying any minute, or grow the devil’s horns. But there’s a recalibration this year fractionally more towards warmth, and the show is delivered with increased verve and attack.Sam Campbell is at the Monkey Barrel, Edinburgh until 28 August Continue reading...",

(credit: Sam Machkovech)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the early hours of Thursday morning, Sony announced massive news for its PlayStation 5 console family. Around the world, console prices are going up.\nThe price hike for both models of PlayStation 5 (one with a disc drive, one without) is effective immediately in at least six regions, with Japan joining the price-hike fray on September 15. Sony's announcement lists specific price increases for some of its biggest gaming territories, yet it additionally warns that \"select markets\" may see their own price hikes in the coming days. These include territories in the Asia-Pacific region, Central and South America, and the massive cluster of nations that comprises the EMEA (Europe, the Middle East, and Africa).\nSomehow, one particular region is out of Sony's price-hike crosshairs for now: the United States.Read 8 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

The 4K resolution HP Z32k G3 claims to be the first monitor to use an IPS Black panel along with a Thunderbolt 4 USB-C port.\nDell was the first to use IPS Black, tapping the LG Display tech for 27-inch and 31.5-inch USB-C UltraSharp monitors. IPS Black is a type of IPS panel that's supposed to double the typical contrast ratio of traditional IPS by delivering darker black levels. LG Display claimed that IPS Black's black levels are \"35 percent deeper than existing IPS products.\"\nHP's Z32k G3 claims a 2,000:1 contrast ratio, compared to the standard IPS monitor, which is typically around 1,000:1, with premium IPS examples reaching around 1,300:1. Assuming HP shared an accurate figure, it's worth noting that the spec doesn't match a strong VA monitor or, compared to contrast offered by displays with more expensive backlighting technology, Mini LED or OLED.Read 7 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

Exciting AIO releases in the US are few and far between, and ever since Apple discontinued the 27-inch iMac, there has been somewhat of a gap for users seeking the simplicity of an AIO, along with ultra-high resolution and strong components. HP has apparently noticed that gap because in September, it will release a 34-inch AIO with 5120×2160 resolution, current-generation Intel and Nvidia parts, and flashy features aimed at workers.\nMagnetic webcam(s)\nA webcam that can magnetically attach to anywhere on the display's bezel is one of the hallmark features of HP's 34-inch all-in-one Desktop PC announced today at HP's Amplify channel partner conference.\nThe cameras use temporal noise reduction when producing an image, and there's Windows Hello support for facial recognition logins. (credit: HP)\nThis is similar to a magnetic webcam concept Dell showed us in December, but the camera isn't wireless and can't attach directly to the display. The AIO also supports up to two of these magnetic cameras; they would use pixel binning for 4 MP per still or video image, according to HP.Read 11 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "People who&#8217;ve had a psychedelic experience and those who&#8217;ve had a near-death experience that didn&#8217;t involve drugs report less fear of death.\nPeople in both groups also reported that the experience had a lasting positive effect, providing personal meaning, spiritual significance, and psychological insight.\nThe survey study of more than 3,000 adults appears in the journal PLOS ONE.\nThe results are consistent with several recent clinical trials showing that a single treatment with the psychedelic psilocybin produced sustained decreases in anxiety and depression among patients with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis.\nThe author of the new survey conducted the largest of these trials (Griffiths et al., 2016) at Johns Hopkins University. That study, a randomized trial of 51 patients with cancer who had clinically significant anxiety or depressive symptoms, demonstrated that receiving a controlled, high dose of psilocybin given with supportive psychotherapy resulted in significant increases in ratings of death acceptance, as well as decreases in anxiety about death.\nFor the present study, the researchers analyzed data gathered from 3,192 people who answered an online survey between December 2015 and April 2018. Participants were divided into groups: 933 individuals had non-drug-related near-death experiences, and the rest of the participants had psychedelic experiences, which were prompted by either lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (904), psilocybin (766), ayahuasca (282), or N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) (307). Participants were predominantly white (85%) and mostly from the United States.\nCompared with the non-drug group, there were more men in the psychedelic group (78% versus 32%), and they tended to be younger (32 versus 55 years of age) at the time of the experience.\nSimilarities between the groups include:\n\nAbout 90% of participants in both groups reported a decrease in fear of death when considering changes in their views from before to after the experience.\nMost participants in both groups (non-drug group, 85%; psychedelics group, 75%) rated the experience to be among the top five most personally meaningful and spiritually significant of their life.\nParticipants in both groups reported moderate to strong persisting positive changes in personal well-being and life purpose and meaning.\n\nDifferences between the groups include:\n\nThe non-drug group was more likely to report that their life was in danger (47% versus the psychedelics group, 3%), being medically unconscious (36% versus the psychedelics group, 10%), or being clinically dead (21% versus the psychedelics group, less than 1%).\nThe non-drug group was more likely to report that their experience was very brief, lasting five minutes or less (40% versus the psychedelics group, 7%).\n\nThe researchers say that future studies are needed to better understand the potential clinical use of psychedelics in ameliorating suffering related to fear of death.\nSource: Johns Hopkins University\nThe post Psychedelic, near-death experiences ease fear of death appeared first on Futurity.",

There are cameos in Larry Dean’s new show Fudnut (nominated yesterday for the Dave’s Edinburgh comedy awards) for the hypnotherapist addressing his vape addiction, and the counsellor urging him to “feel his feelings” instead of joking about them. I have some sympathy with her point of view, while acknowledging that this is a fine set from the Glaswegian. The cracks are showing in his cheeky-chappy demeanour – which, if un-ideal for his wellbeing, is encouraging for his standup.Dean certainly comes across more highly strung than hitherto, as he tells a series of stories branching off from his central tale of being “bum-searched” for drugs in Abu Dhabi airport. We hear about a gig he once performed to a homophobic audience, about his posh lawyer boyfriend, and their breakup – and we hear about Dean’s “best good friend” Paul, whom he turns to for comic support when the Abu Dhabi peril escalates.

        "description": "The 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law by President Biden on Aug. 16, includes provisions for lowering the deficit and lowering prescription drug costs even as it subsidizes substantial investment in renewable sources of clean energy. It devotes $369 billion to those investments. It derives its funding by imposing a 15 percent minimum tax on large corporations and a 1 percent excise tax on corporations’ buying back their own stock; it also funds enhanced IRS enforcement applied to high-income taxpayers.\n\n\n\nWith regard to climate change, the IRA targets roughly a 40 percent cut greenhouse gas emissions relative to 2005 levels by around 2030, but it is silent about what happens if that target is not met.\n\n\n\nSome think these programs will not be as effective as anticipated so that goals will not be achieved because there are real-world obstacles that have not been included in the budget impact and economic efficacy calculus. Others, like me, think that the prescribed goals and objectives will more than meet expectations because there are real-world opportunities that come into play given the strong and, frankly, unexpected signal of significant U.S. action on climate change. That translates into an anticipation that relying on carbon in your business planning and personal investment will become increasingly expensive and decreasingly profitable.\n\n\n\nTwo caveats apply at this point. The first is the 40 percent by 2030 target. The lates Carnegie Mellon University Professor Lester Lave, an old colleague, once advised that economists should give a date or a number but not both. Emissions will be down by 2030, but perhaps not by 40 percent. Emissions will be down by 40 percent, but perhaps not before 2031. The real question is whether or not the IRA will put us on a trajectory that keeps open the potential of achieving the long-term goal of net-zero emissions sometime well before the turn of the next century.\n\n\n\nThe second caveat arises from the simple fact that the IRA does not explicitly price carbon at the point of its use. Economists have long pointed to the efficiency of such a plan, but the U.S. Congress (particularly the Senate) is allergic to taxing carbon. Indeed, five carbon pricing and revenue-sharing bills have been proposed in this 117th Congress, but none of them has come anywhere close to the president’s little signing desk.\n\n\n\nSo, is there any way to infer that the IRA contains enough pricing substance to pick up the efficiency gains of a pricing mechanism? I think so — at least modestly.\n\n\n\nIn the first and most obvious instance, the new law increases or tax credits for capturing and (re)utilizing or sequestering carbon dioxide at industrial facilities and power plants. The increase is from $50 to $85 per ton for carbon stored by industry and from $30 to $60 per ton if it is used in drilling. The increase is from $50 to $180 per ton for carbon removed from the atmosphere if it is stored and from $35 to $130 if it is used. Don’t look now, but these are ranges on the price of carbon that are higher than last month. They set a context for decision-makers looking to the future when their use of carbon might be taxed at a socially accepted price that will persistently climb over time.\n\n\n\nIn a second less direct way, the IRA creates “shadow prices” for carbon that are related directly to its various investment provisions. Take, for example, the incentives for individuals to install solar panels. They will reduce personal and industrial demand for electricity from fossil fuel plants by very simple economically driven substitution. Every student in an introductory economics course would understand that.\n\n\n\nThe extended point about shadow prices is not much more complicated. There is a price of carbon (tax) that could accomplish the same substitution. That is a shadow price reflective of a tax intervention that would be equivalent to the IRA effects.\n\n\n\nThe shadow price will even increase as solar investments increase over time in projectable ways. Even though nobody is paying a \"shadow tax,\" investors in all sorts of energy projects will likely use the distributions of those prices as signals — representations of the effects of IRA that will influence their decisions of where to put their long-term investment money. These are the opportunities mentioned above.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe IRA creates an economic environment that is muddier than one in which there would one price for carbon that would increase every year at a predictable rate. There is a different shadow price for each component in IRA and there are codified ranges for carbon capture, utilization and storage. That variability is a source of efficiency loss. So, too, is inertia in industrial policy that has been created by the IRA. Finally, the IRA generates its compensating revenue from tax provisions that are not at all related to carbon emissions while a carbon tax directly influences the relative prices of all goods with respect to their carbon content.\n\n\n\nThere are efficiencies that have been foregone for political expedience, but the IRA can nonetheless have a comparable long-term effect on reducing fossil fuel reliance.&nbsp;It is better than nothing by a long shot.\n\n\n\nIt is not a solution, though. There are no solutions to the climate problem. We can only create some combination of abate, adapt and suffer. So, the real questions in evaluating the IRA are only:\n\n\n\n1) Is it enough to put us on the right track?\n\n\n\n2) How soon will we have to make a mid-course correction?\n\n\n\nGary Yohe,&nbsp;Ph.D., is the Huffington Foundation professor of Economics and Environmental Studies, Emeritus at Wesleyan University.",

        "description": "Newly revealed emails show that former White House counsel Pat Cipollone agreed that materials the National Archives requested be returned by former President Trump should be given to the agency.\n\n\n\nCipollone, who also served under the Trump administration as a designated representative to the Archives, reportedly told National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) chief counsel Gary Stern that the documents needed to be returned, The Washington Post reported. \n\n\n\n“It is also our understanding that roughly two dozen boxes of original presidential records were kept in the Residence of the White House over the course of President Trump’s last year in office and have not been transferred to NARA, despite a determination by Pat Cipollone in the final days of the administration that they need to be,” Stern wrote in an email to Trump's lawyers in May 2021, according to the Post.\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, NARA officials grew concerned about Trump and his team keeping dozens of boxes of official documents and repeatedly declining requests to return those documents.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStern also noted in his emails to Trump’s legal counsel that two classified documents, which were letters from North Korea leader Kim Jong Un and former President Obama, were missing from their archival list. \n\n\n\n“We know things are very chaotic, as they always are in the course of a one-term transition,” Stern wrote in the email. “ ... But it is absolutely necessary that we obtain and account for all presidential records.”\n\n\n\nStern wrote in the emails that he consulted with other attorneys in Trump’s legal counsel to return the requested documents. \n\n\n\nThe report comes after the FBI executed a warrant at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence earlier this month in search of classified documents Trump brought to his Florida residence after the end of his term at the White House.\n\n\n\nTrump returned up to 15 boxes of classified documents to NARA earlier this year, but NARA officials continued to urge Trump's team to look for more documents at his Florida residence and referred the matter to the Department of Justice as well, the Post noted.",

        "description": "The Republican group Winning for Women Action Fund rolled out a six-figure digital ad buy on Thursday hitting incumbent Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.) over the issue of crime and boosting Murray's GOP opponent, Tiffany Smiley.\n\n\n\nThe ad accuses Murray of being \"out of touch\" and of \"turning her back on law enforcement.\" Additionally, the buy includes a website called wokepattymurray.com, which also targets her on the issue.\n\n\n\n“Senator Murray has been given nearly 30 years to improve the lives of Washingtonians and, instead, is part of the problem,” said Annie Dickerson, the chair and founder of Winning for Women Action Fund.\n\n\n\n“Great cities like Seattle are no longer recognizable and are unsafe for its own citizens, much less tourists. It’s time for big changes in Washington and everyone knows it. Tiffany Smiley provides the experience and energy for a new generation of leadership.”\n\n\n\nThe Hill was the first outlet to report on news of the buy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublicans up and down the ballot have focused their messaging on crime, hoping to put Democratic incumbents on the defense on the issue. \n\n\n\nThe ad buy comes as Republicans have increasingly turned their attention toward Washington state's Senate race.\n\n\n\nIt will likely be an uphill battle for Smiley and the GOP. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the race as \"solid Democratic,\" and polls show Murray leading by double digits. ",

        "description": "Right-hander Chase Anderson signed a minor league deal with the Rays a month ago, and is now going to exercise an opt-out clause in that contract, FanSided&#8217;s Robert Murray reports (Twitter link).  Anderson came to Tampa Bay after opting out of another minors pact with the Tigers.\nA veteran of the last eight MLB seasons, Anderson has yet to see any big league time in 2022, instead tossing a combined 80 innings at Triple-A.  His work with the Rays&#8217; affiliate in Durham (3.60 ERA in 10 innings) has been better than his 70 frames (4.63 ERA) with the Tigers&#8217; top affiliate in Toledo, with Anderson delivering improved strikeout and walk rates over his short time in the Rays organization.\nHowever, it would seem as if this performance didn&#8217;t put Anderson on Tampa Bay&#8217;s radar for a call-up to the majors, and so Anderson will hit the open market again in search of another opportunity.  Anderson&#8217;s track record as a starting pitcher would theoretically provide some use to a team in need of rotation depth.  In hindsight, it&#8217;s a little surprising that Detroit (crushed by pitching injuries all season long) didn&#8217;t call Anderson up to fill any of its many rotation vacancies.\nOf course, recent results haven&#8217;t favored the 34-year-old, who posted a 6.94 ERA over 81 2/3 innings in the majors with the Blue Jays and Phillies in 2020-21.  Hitters mashed 21 homers off Anderson in those 81 2/3 frames, and he has continued to have trouble with the long ball at the Triple-A level this year.  Anderson has surrendered 16 homers in his 80 innings with Durham and Toledo.",

        "description": "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Wednesday vowed to make Russia “bear responsibility” for a rocket attack against a Ukrainian train station in Chaplyne that killed more than 20 people during the country’s Independence Day.\n\n\n\n“Chaplyne is our pain today,” Zelensky said in his evening address. “As of this moment, there are 22 dead, five of them burned in the car, an 11-year-old teenager died, a Russian missile destroyed his house.”\n\n\n\nZelensky had warned that Russia might step up its attacks on Wednesday during the holiday, which also marked six months since Russia invaded Ukraine, saying “something particularly cruel” might happen.\n\n\n\n“Search and rescue operations at the railway station will continue,” Zelensky said in his evening address.\n\n\n\n“We will definitely make the occupiers bear responsibility for everything they have done,” he continued. And we will certainly drive the invaders out of our land. Not a single stain of this evil will remain in our free Ukraine.”\n\n\n\nAuthorities in Kyiv banned large gatherings during Independence Day out of fear of Russian attacks.\n\n\n\nAir raid sirens sounded during the day, and the population mostly laid low, but crowds gathered on a main street in the city to see a display of destroyed Russian tanks, armored personnel carriers and rocket launchers.\n\n\n\n“The occupier believed that in a few days he would be on parade in our capital’s downtown,” Zelensky said earlier on Wednesday in an address marking Independence Day.\n\n\n\n“Today, you can see this ‘parade’ on Khreshchatyk,” Zelensky added. “The proof that enemy equipment can appear in the center of Kyiv only in such form. Burnt, wrecked and destroyed.”\n\n\n\nPresident Biden marked Ukraine’s holiday, which celebrates the country’s independence from the Soviet Union in 1991, by pledging an additional roughly $3 billion security assistance package.\n\n\n\nThe package, which includes six National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile Systems and laser-guided rocket systems, is the single largest U.S. assistance measure to Ukraine since Russia invaded in February.\n\n\n\n“They have stood resolute and strong in the face of Russia’s full scale invasion of Ukraine. And today is not only a celebration of the past, but a resounding affirmation that Ukraine proudly remains — and will remain — a sovereign and independent nation,” Biden said in a statement on Wednesday.",

        "description": "The U.S. economy shrunk at a slower pace between April and June than the federal government initially calculated, according to revised data released Thursday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).\n\n\n\nThe BEA said U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) fell at an annualized rate of 0.6 percent during the second quarter of 2022. That’s down 0.3 percentage points from the 0.9 percent decline the agency estimated in July.\n\n\n\nThe BEA issues three estimates of each quarter’s change in GDP to incorporate new and revised data. The agency said the second quarter dip in economic activity was less severe than first believed after looking at broader, more complete data on consumer spending and private inventory investments.\n\n\n\nPersonal consumption expenditures — a catchall for consumer spending — rose 1.6 percent in the second quarter of 2022, according to revised figures, up from an initial estimate of 1 percent.\n\n\n\nSpending on goods fell far less than first estimated, dropping 2.4 percent between April and June instead of the 4.4 percent decline initially estimated. Spending on services rose 3.6 percent, 0.6 percentage points below the BEA’s first estimate.\n\n\n\nWhile the decline in growth was less severe than first estimated, the U.S. economy still appeared to contract for two consecutive quarters after Thursday’s revisions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo straight quarters of negative GDP growth has long been a rule-of-thumb threshold for a recession in the U.S. But economists have warned that the strength of the U.S. labor market and other pockets of the economy make it unlikely the country is currently in recession.\n\n\n\n\"With many still asking whether the economy is in a recession, it’s important to reiterate that my preferred 'triple P' recession rule isn’t satisfied: a recession is a persistent (lasting in time), profound (in magnitude) and pervasive (across regions and sectors) contraction in economic activity,\" wrote Gregory Daco, chief economist at EY-Parthenon, in a Thursday analysis.\n\n\n\n\"The labor market is cooling, but companies are still hiring; businesses are still investing, even if they’re being more cautious in their decisions; and consumers are still spending (with a grin) in the face of high inflation.\"\n\n\n\nThe U.S. still added more than 1 million jobs during the second quarter, even as GDP shrunk. Gross domestic income, another measure of economic output, rose at an annualized rate of 1.5 percent during the second quarter after a gain of 1.8 percent in the first quarter.\n\n\n\nEven so, Daco warned the U.S. faces higher recession risks as summer ends, the economy cools down and higher interest rates set by the Federal Reserve weigh heavier on the pace of growth.\n\n\n\n\"As the surge in summer outlays fades, we anticipate seeing a greater drag on consumer spending, residential activity and business investment from inflation, easing job growth, reduced disposable income and rising interest rates. We continue to anticipate the US economy will experience a recession toward year-end with GDP growth averaging around 1.4% this year and slowing to around 0.4% in 2023.\"\n\n\n\nUpdated at 9:53 a.m.",

        "description": "New York City officials claim that Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R) is placing bar codes on migrants who were bused to the city, calling the move an intimidation tactic amid the escalating feud over migrants in the U.S.\n\n\n\nCBS affiliate WCBS published a video on Wednesday showing migrants arriving in New York City wearing wristbands with bar codes on them. \n\n\n\nA total of 237 of those migrants on the five bus loads were also subjected to an unseen security system that has not been used in the city, according to WCBS.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn response to the video, some city officials expressed their disapproval of the treatment of the migrants. \n\n\n\n\"Gov. Abbott is bar-coding people and treating them as less than human, as if they were cattle,\" New York City Commissioner of Immigrant Affairs Manuel Castro told the news outlet. \"I was incredibly shocked when I saw children with bracelets and bar codes and security personnel treating them as less than human beings.\"\n\n\n\nCastro also believed that Abbott placed the bar code wristbands on the individuals in an effort to intimidate them. \n\n\n\n\"We know that Gov. Abbott has been trying to dehumanize people, trying to foment anti-immigrant hatred, and while New York will continue to welcome asylum seekers, it's also our moral responsibility to denounce this kind of behavior by Gov. Abbott,\" Castro added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe new complaints come as Abbott has been sending migrants from the southern border to New York and Washington, D.C., in a protest of the Biden administration's immigration policies. \n\n\n\nThe Biden administration earlier this year rescinded Title 42, a Trump-era policy that prevents migrants seeking asylum from entering the U.S. due to COVID-19 pandemic concerns.\n\n\n\nNew York City Mayor Eric Adams (D) has asked for federal assistance on this issue, even sparking a war of words with Abbott, calling for him to be voted out of office in November’s midterm elections and accusing the governor of using migrants “as political pawns to manufacture a crisis.”",

Borrowers who received federal Pell Grants and meet the income limits are eligible for up to $20,000 in loan forgiveness.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPell Grants, which have a maximum allowance of $6,895 per academic year, are typically awarded to undergraduate students in serious financial need. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdministration officials said Wednesday around 20 million borrowers will see their debt erased if everyone eligible claims the relief. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That’s 20 million people who can start getting on with their lives,”&nbsp;Biden said at the White House on Wednesday.&nbsp;“All this means, people can start to finally crawl out from under that mountain of debt. To get on top of their rent and utilities. To finally think about buying a home or starting a family or starting a business.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Education Department said in its announcement that information regarding applications for relief will follow in the coming weeks, but 8 million borrowers whose financial data is readily available could see immediate relief.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s plan does not address borrowers who have privately held loans, with a bank or credit union,&nbsp;which accounts for about 13 percent&nbsp;of student borrowers and 8 percent of the nation’s outstanding loan debt — close to $140 billion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFurther, borrowers who received loans after June 30 will not be eligible for forgiveness, White House Domestic Policy Council Director&nbsp;Susan Rice&nbsp;confirmed. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe administration also announced it is extending the pandemic-related moratorium on student loan payments. It will be the final extension of the pause, which has lasted more than two years and spanned across two administrations. Payments are set to resume in January 2023.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s forgiveness plan falls short of progressive advocates and lawmakers, including Sen. Majority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), who pushed for $50,000 in cancellation. But Schumer praised the president’s action on social media, saying the effort could provide a way toward the middle class for millions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor decades, borrowers looking to pursue the American Dream have been held back by a predatory student loan system that turned their dreams into debt—while banks and collectors profited. Today, @POTUS helped right this wrong and helped restore a pathway to the middle class,” Schumer tweeted.",

        "description": "This month marks the fifth anniversary of the height of the Burmese military’s genocide against the Rohingya. Today, in the face of ongoing risks to the Rohingya, it’s time, as Secretary of State Antony Blinken explained in his&nbsp;March 21 genocide determination&nbsp;made at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, to begin this “path out of genocide.”\n\n\n\nThe determination was the result of years of sounding the alarm of genocide and telling the world what happened to&nbsp;Rohingya in Burma, now known as Myanmar, not only in the military’s rampages of 2016 and 2017 that killed thousands and forced approximately 700,000 to flee to neighboring Bangladesh, but in its decades-long campaign of systematic violence and persecution.\n\n\n\nWe were relieved when the U.S. government finally formally recognized the genocide against the Rohingya. We welcomed the $1 million in additional funding for the Independent Investigative Mechanism for Myanmar. And we recognize the significant funds the United States has dedicated to humanitarian assistance for the Rohingya since the genocide.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow is also the moment to articulate further changes and outline what making a genocide determination means going forward.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe urgency is all too glaring. The approximately 600,000 Rohingya who remain in Burma face a growing risk of mass atrocities, including genocide. Those living as refugees in neighboring Bangladesh face untenable and worsening living conditions. No one has been held accountable in a court of law for the brutal crimes committed against the Rohingya. Rampant impunity helped contribute to an environment where in February 2021, the Tatmadaw launched a coup ousting the civilian government. Since then, these perpetrators of genocide are estimated to have killed over 2,100 people as they brutally try to assert their control over the country. Their victims include peaceful protesters, children and democracy activists — including well-known leaders executed in late July in a marked escalation in the military’s response to political opposition.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nProtecting Rohingya and other groups from mass atrocities must feature prominently in a broader U.S.-Burma policy. At the fore of that policy must be a commitment to listen to the Rohingya community. While each genocide survivor may call for different things, there are a few common refrains from the community.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrioritize supporting efforts to advance justice\n\n\n\nFor Rohingya community members, this means both holding perpetrators accountable and supporting Rohingya-led efforts to bring cases forward around the world. It also means ensuring their equal rights as an ethnic group, including the restoration of full citizenship, and their safe return to their homes in Burma — both would help prevent the Tatmadaw from achieving one of their goals with the genocide, which was ridding Burma of the Rohingya. An expansive approach to pursuing justice would also include pursuing restitution for the land, property and other losses Rohingya endured — which would be essential steps to allow the Rohingya community to recover and rebuild.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHelp the Rohingya community rebuild and become self-sufficient\n\n\n\nThe Rohingya community should be treated as a group full of resilience and dignity. The U.S., working with other governments, should support efforts to have host countries grant Rohingya access to education and employment. This will help them become self-sufficient and minimize the burden of host countries, notably Bangladesh, India and Malaysia.\n\n\n\nSupport the preservation of the Rohingya identity\n\n\n\nThe harm of genocide can never fully be repaired, but steps can be taken to support the preservation of the Rohingya culture, language and unique identity — an identity that the Tatmadaw sought to destroy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs the new&nbsp;U.S. “Strategy to Anticipate, Prevent, and Respond to Atrocities”&nbsp;articulates, the U.S. cannot on its own craft a path out of genocide. It must work with an array of local, regional and international actors. With that in mind, Burma’s National Unity Government (NUG), a government in exile representing the country’s democratically elected leaders, is a critical partner. It must build meaningful and sustained engagement with the Rohingya community through working with Rohingya leaders to develop a comprehensive transitional justice plan that will secure a safe future in Burma for the Rohingya community as well as the many other groups who have suffered mass atrocities at the hands of the Tatmadaw.\n\n\n\nAs a world leader, the United States should prioritize building an international coalition to support accountability efforts for mass atrocities and raise the consequences on the Tatmadaw for its continued crimes. The Rohingya community is in this fight for the long haul and will do whatever it takes to advance justice, rebuild and preserve their culture and accountability. They need to know that they have the backing of world leaders who are dedicated to pursuing a “path out of genocide” for the Rohingya.\n\n\n\nNaomi Kikoler is the director of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum’s Simon-Skjodt Center for the Prevention of Genocide.\n\n\n\nWai Wai Nu is the executive director of the Women’s Peace Network in Burma.",

        "description": "&#8220;With early voting now two months away, the ad competition has begun in the race for Texas governor. Last week, Gov. Greg Abbott released a first ad and, on Thursday, Beto O’Rourke, the former El Paso congressman and perennial Democratic hopeful, countered with two of his own,&#8221; the New York Times reports.\n&#8220;The O’Rourke campaign, looking for leverage in a tightening but still uphill campaign, focused on abortion, seeking to harness anger among women at the overturning of Roe v. Wade and to direct that anger at Mr. Abbott.&#8221;\n&#8220;Its two ads were released on the day that a so-called trigger law — made possible by the Supreme Court’s overturning of Roe v. Wade — went into effect in Texas. The law, signed last year by Mr. Abbott, bans abortion with no exception for rape or incest and with only limited medical exceptions.&#8221;",

I heard that the DoJ had released the heavily redacted memo by former Attorney General Barr, the one that basically said that the Mueller Report (that we hadn't at the time seen) was a Nothingburger, without the redactions. So I expected there would be something interesting on MSNBC. The show opens with an in-detail horse race story that said basically we fucked up and it wasn't a foregone conclusion that the Repubs would take Congress in the upcoming midterm election as we have been reporting since just after the 2020 election. Right. This is now horserace journalism of a higher order, the horserace we're judging is how well Hayes et al were doing at predicting the outcome of the election, which btw, is a theoretical thing because (pause here) THE FUCKING ELECTION STILL HASN'T HAPPENED. Sorry for screaming, but this is such a waste, and how could anyone possibly care about this. Every time they report conventional wisdom, they have driven far off course, they are no longer doing news, they are doing self-butthole examination. What a waste. And it's kind of obvious (imho) that Hayes has been going to the Tucker Carlson School School of Acting. He's trying to talk like him. It's really sad. Maybe MSNBC could just hire Carlson to work for them. After all if the Mets can buy players from Cleveland or the Dodgers, why can't MNBC buy an actor from Fox News to play for them. The amount of actual news reporting on both networks is pitifully small.",

Every time they report <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_wisdom\\\">conventional wisdom</a>, they have driven far off course, they are no longer doing news, they are doing self-butthole examination. What a waste. And it's kind of obvious (imho) that Hayes has been going to the Tucker Carlson School School of Acting. He's trying to talk like him. It's really sad. Maybe MSNBC could just hire Carlson to work for them. After all if the Mets can buy players from <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Francisco_Lindor\\\">Cleveland</a> or the <a href=\\\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_Scherzer\\\">Dodgers</a>, why can't MNBC buy an actor from Fox News to play for them. The amount of actual news reporting on both networks is pitifully small.\",\n    \"created\": \"Thu, 25 Aug 2022 13:47:55 GMT\",\n    \"type\": \"outline\",\n    \"image\": \"http://scripting.com/images/2017/11/29/racehorse.png\",\n    \"permalink\": \"http://scripting.com/2022/08/25.html#a134755\"\n}",

        "description": "LONDON — Albanian nationals now make up more than half of all migrants who arrive in the U.K. on small boats across the English Channel, after a huge spike in numbers this summer.\n\n\n\nHome Office figures released Thursday revealed 2,156 Albanians were recorded arriving in the U.K. in the first six months of 2022, out of a total of 12,747 people&nbsp;— compared with just 23 Albanians in the same period of the previous year.\n\n\n\nBut even those figures fail to capture the most recent summer spike. The department said the total number of Albanians to have arrived so far this year is now close to 6,000 and still rising quickly, with nearly six out of 10 migrants in small boats now holding Albanian nationality.\n\n\n\nMore than half of Albanian asylum applicants — 53 percent — were granted asylum by the Home Office in the year to June, suggesting many are genuine refugees. Those arriving during the huge spike in recent weeks have not yet had their applications processed.\n\n\n\nThe Home Office said the spike in the numbers of Albanians arriving in recent weeks could be explained by a combination of factors, including family pull and specific targeting by people smugglers.\n\n\n\nAfter law enforcement officials launched a crackdown on people-smuggling routes across the Continent, organized crime gangs opened up a new Balkan way into Europe via Albania, which has itself experienced a leap in arrivals from those fleeing conflict or poverty in the Middle East, North Africa and Asia.\n\n\n\nUnlike undocumented migrants from outside Europe, Albanian citizens benefit from freedom of movement throughout the EU, which facilitates their journey across the Continent toward various coastal locations in northern France.\n\n\n\n“The significant increase of people making dangerous small boats crossings continues to pressurize the U.K.’s asylum system and our ability to make timely casework decisions,” said Simon Baynes, minister for illegal migration, insisting those traveling through countries deemed “safe” should claim asylum there.\n\n\n\nAs the data was released, Home Secretary Priti Patel announced a deal with the Albanian government to accelerate removals of Albanian nationals who do not have permission to stay in the U.K. A delegation of Albanian state police officers will visit the U.K. next week to boost joint working.\n\n\n\nAlbanians were rarely seen on small boats in previous years, the Home Office said, with only 898 arrivals in the three years between 2018 and 2021.\n\n\n\nAs happens every summer, the warm and dry weather has encouraged crossings throughout July and August — but this year arrivals are reaching new highs. Monday alone saw a record 1,295 people in 27 boats being intercepted by British authorities.\n\n\n\nMore than 22,560 people have crossed the Channel in small boats so far this year, and U.K. officials fear the annual figure will surpass last year’s total of 28,526 by a significant amount.\n\n\n\nThe boats are also now carrying more passengers, increasing their risk of capsizing, according to U.K. officials who said there were an average of 44 people per dinghy this summer — up from 28 last year.",

        "description": "Photo by Matthew Stockman/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Mets just concluded an exhausting 10-game road trip that saw them go 4-6. The Mets (79-46) are finally back at Citi Field after what felt like a never-ending road trip, as they begin a 10-game homestand with four against the Rockies (54-70). The Mets took two of three from the Rockies at Coors Field when the two teams squared off in May.\nThe Yankees enacted their revenge on the Mets in the form of a two-game sweep in the Bronx by identical 4-2 scores. Following an emotional win over the Phillies on Sunday afternoon, the Mets’ offense was listless all night on Monday, collecting just four hits in defeat. Max Scherzer, meanwhile, was not quite at his peak, allowing runs in the first, third, fifth, and seventh, making it two straight starts allowing four earned runs. The Mets’ offense came in the form of a two-run shot by Daniel Vogelbach in the seventh, bringing the Mets within run. However, Andrew Benintendi’s run-scoring double in the fifth remained the difference, and he drove in an insurance run in the seventh for good measure. Oh, and Aaron Judge hit his 47th homer.\nJudge would go on to hit #48 in Tuesday’s game as well. Meanwhile, the offense was again mostly listless, though they tied things up thanks to a Starling Marte run-scoring single in the fifth and a wacky play on a Jeff McNeil double that scored Pete Alonso from first in the sixth. However, Benintendi again drove in the game-winning run in the seventh, while Judge provided the insurance run with a single that brought home Jose Trevino later in the inning.\nAlonso really struggled during the team’s road trip, hitting just .154/.214/.256 with one home runs, a 30 wRC+, and a -0.3 fWAR in the 10 games. It could just be late-season fatigue, especially with 10 games in nine days, but he looked lost at the plate and showed his frustration by snapping his bat over his knee following a strikeout on Tuesday. While I am sure Buck Showalter would love to give him a day off to rest and regroup, the team can ill afford to lose any more ground with the Braves breathing down their necks. Had they been in any other division and enjoying a comfortable double-digit lead, I’m sure thay would have happened already. The Mets find themselves just 1.5 games up on Atlanta.\nMcNeil and Marte, meanwhile, excelled on this road trip. McNeil hit .439/.452/.610 with a 204 wRC+ and a 0.8 fWAR over the team’s past ten games to continue his torrid pace as of late. McNeil currently finds himself third in the NL batting title race with a .321 average on the season, trailing just MVP frontrunner Paul Goldschmidt (.335) and Freddie Freeman (.324). Marte hit .325/.400/.550 with a team-leading two home runs, a 172 wRC+, and a 0.5 fWAR in those ten games.\nThe Rockies are coming off a series split with the Rangers., squeaking by 7-6 in the first game before getting blown out 16-4 in yesterday’s matinee finale. Prior to that, they took two out of three from the Giants.\nThe Rockies find themselves in a familiar position, sitting in last place in the NL West. They are 33 games behind the first-place Dodgers, and 13.5 games out of the final playoff spot in the National League. It hasn’t been a good season on either side of the ball for Colorado. They currently find themselves 12th in the NL in wRC+ (91), though they are sixth in OPS (.729), not far behind the Mets’ .737 mark. They also don’t strike out much, as their 20.5% K% is fourth-best in the NL, though their 7.4% BB% is tied for the worst mark in the league. Their rotation, meanwhile, sports a 5.38 ERA, which is second-worst in the NL behind only the Nationals. Their bullpen’s 4.83 ERA is also second-worst in the NL.\nThursday, August 25: Ryan Feltner vs. Jacob deGrom, 7:10 p.m. on SNY\nFeltner (2022): 56.2 IP, 49 K, 18 BB, 10 HR, 5.88 ERA, 4.79 FIP, 1.39 WHIP, -0.3 bWAR\nFeltner turned in one of the best starts of his young career his last time out, tossing 6.0 innings and holding San Francisco to one earned run on two hits while walking two and striking out five. It was similar to a start he had earlier in the year against the Padres in which he hadt he same line while striking out six and walking one. Aside from a handful of bright spots, it’s been a mostly difficult run for Feltner in his first full season in the majors after a brief cup of coffee last year.\ndeGrom (2022): 23.1 IP, 37 K, 1 BB, 1 HR, 2.31 ERA, 0.64 FIP, 0.51 WHIP, 0.9 bWAR\ndeGrom was pushed back one day after his longest outing of the season so far. In that start, allowed three earned runs, though he still had a great outing aside from a couple of hiccups. He stumbled in the third and appeared to be fighting with himself on the mound as he tried to straighten himself out, and then settled down to retire 12 straight Braves’ batters before giving up a two-out single in the seventh. He was lifted in favor of Seth Lugo, who allowed a single that scored the in-motion runner all the way from first, which helped hand deGrom his first loss since April 28, 2021. In total, deGrom ended up with three earned runs on his record, as well as five hits allowed, and nine strikeouts in 6 2⁄3 innings.\nFriday, August 26: TBD vs. Chris Bassitt, 7:10 p.m. on SNY\nTBD\nThe Rockies have not yet named a starting pitcher for Friday night’s game against the Mets.\nBassitt (2022): 141.0 IP, 138 K, 36 BB, 15 HR, 3.26 ERA, 3.52 FIP, 1.13 WHIP, 3.0 bWAR\nBassitt has been on a tear since the All Star break, posting a 1.85 ERA in six starts. If you focus on just his appearances since the trade deadline, he’s even better, with a nice 0.69 ERA, 2.31 FIP, and 1.12 WHIP in 26.0 innings across four starts—the third-best mark among NL starting pitchers. He’s won each of those four starts to improve to 11-7 on the season. In his last start, he allowed two earned runs on seven hits, striking out four and not walking anyone over his four innings of work against Philadelphia.\nSaturday, August 27: Kyle Freeland vs. David Peterson, 7:10 p.m. on SNY\nFreeland (2022): 137.0 IP, 99 K, 43 BB, 16 HR, 4.93 ERA, 4.42 FIP, 1.42 WHIP, 0.8 bWAR\nFreeland has alternated good and bad starts in August. His last time out, he was tagged for six runs (five earned) on seven hits, with three walks and five strikeouts over 6 1⁄3 innings against the Giants. Prior to that, he went 6.0 innings and allowed three earned runs on seven hits, with one walk and two four strikeouts against the Cardinals.\nPeterson (2022): 83.2 IP, 97 K, 40 BB, 9 HR, 3.44 ERA, 3.88 FIP, 1.33 WHIP, 1.2 bWAR\nPeterson struggled in his last start, resulting in the team’s only loss in their trip to Citizens Bank Park. He lasted just 4 2⁄3 innings, needing 100 pitches to slog through that start. He allowed three earned runs on eight hits while striking out six and walking two. It was the first time he had allowed three earned runs in a start since his outing against the Reds back on July 6. With Carlos Carrasco still set to miss a few weeks, Peterson will remain a fixture in the rotation until his return.\nSunday, August 28: Germán Márquez vs. Max Scherzer, 1:40 p.m. on WPIX\nMárquez (2022): 139.2 IP, 115 K,48 BB, 23 HR, 5.22 ERA, 4.69 FIP, 1.43 WHIP, 0.9 bWAR\nOne year after making his first NL All Star team, Márquez has had a tough season for the Rockies. He currently has the worst ERA and the second-worst FIP among all qualified NL starting pitchers, while his 1.48 HR/9 is the third-worst mark for NL starters. After three quality outing in a row, he was rocked by the Ranger sin his last start, allowing six earned runs on eight hits, with one walk and seven strikeouts over 6.0 innings. It was his ninth straight outing of six-plus innings so, at the very least, he has been pitching deep into games for Colorado. He lost to the Mets earlier this season, allowing five runs (four earned) on a season-high 11 hits over 6.0 innings.\nScherzer (2022): 115.2 IP, 137 K, 21 BB, 9 HR, 2.33 ERA, 2.56 FIP, 0.94 WHIP, 4.4 bWAR\nScherzer was looking to join a select group of pitchers who had reached 200 wins before 100 losses, but he failed in those efforts his last time out and was handed his 100th career loss. Mad Max, who has been tremendous all season long, especially since returning from his oblique injury, allowed four earned runs for the second straight start, which is a rare and unsettling sight. In all, he was charged with the four runs on seven hits, with a season-low three strikeouts over 6 2⁄3 innings. He was hard on himself in game and in the post game, so he should come out firing on Sunday as he tries for win #200.\nPrediction: The Mets take three of four from the Rockies.",

        "description": "Enlarge (credit: Aurich Lawson / Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday when the California Air Resources Board gathers for its monthly meeting, it's widely expected it will approve a ban on new vehicles with internal combustion engines, set to go into effect in 2035. The state has been a leader in accelerating the transition to clean transportation, and this latest move continues that trend.\nIn fact, the proposed ban on new gasoline or diesel engines has been in the works for some time; just under two years ago, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed an executive order requiring that from 2035, all new passenger cars and light trucks be zero-emissions.\nAround the world, cities and countries are starting to plan for the end of the internal combustion engine. Paris, Madrid, Athens, and Mexico City have announced plans to ban the sale of new fossil fuel-powered vehicles in the next three years—a target that might be somewhat ambitious post-pandemic.Read 8 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Steven Matz suffered a torn left MCL in late July, leading to fear that the left-hander&#8217;s season would possibly be over, even if surgery wasn&#8217;t required.  However, Matz is now making increased progress towards a return, with Cardinals manager Oliver Marmol telling reporters (including MLB.com&#8217;s John Denton) that Matz&#8217;s knee was pain-free while fielding some grounders on Wednesday.  Matz also threw 30 pitches off the mound during the warm-up session.  It could mean that Matz is nearing a minor league rehab assignment, though the Cardinals will continue to closely monitor his status considering his lack of workload.\nMatz has pitched just once since May 22, as a shoulder impingement kept him on the injured list for almost two months, and he then suffered his MCL injury in his first start back off the IL.  St. Louis has Miles Mikolas, Adam Wainwright, and trade deadline acquisitions Jordan Montgomery and Jose Quintana all thriving in the rotation, so if Matz is able to return, he could be used in a bullpen role or competing with Dakota Hudson, Jake Woodford, or another rehabbing starter in Jack Flaherty for that final spot in the rotation.  The Cardinals could potentially also explore using a six-man rotation down the stretch, or perhaps just give some of their regulars some rest if the Cards can clinch the NL Central title relatively early.  With a 17-5 record thus far in August, the Cards have opened up a 5.5-game lead over the struggling Brewers in the division race.\nSome other items from around the Central&#8230;\n\nRoberto Perez believes &#8220;there’s interest from both parties&#8221; in a new deal between the Pirates and the veteran catcher, Perez told Jason Mackey of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (Twitter link).  Perez inked a one-year, $5MMM free agent contract with the Pirates last winter, but played in only 21 games before undergoing season-ending surgery on his left hamstring.  The catcher confirmed that his season is indeed over, as he had been hoping to make enough rehab progress to return for the final few games of the schedule.  Re-signing Perez would add a seasoned backstop to a Pittsburgh catching mix that doesn&#8217;t include a lot of big league experience, though the Bucs are hoping that if all goes well, former first overall pick Henry Davis might be able to make his MLB debut before the 2023 season is up.\nThe Reds dealt away Luis Castillo, Tyler Mahle, and Brandon Drury at the trade deadline, in a flurry of rebuilding moves that added a lot of depth and quality to Cincinnati&#8217;s farm system.  Bobby Nightengale of the Cincinnati Enquirer explores the front office&#8217;s approach to the deadline, which first included some last-minute contract extension talks with Castillo and Drury&#8217;s representatives.  When those talks didn&#8217;t result in much progress, the Reds shifted focus to the trade market, with GM Nick Krall noting that the interest in Castillo allowed them to make high initial asks.  If other clubs weren&#8217;t open to that first ask, &#8220;then we can just move on&#8230;.It was a pretty good way to trim the number (of teams) down from the very beginning,&#8221; Krall said.  Cincinnati had always targeted Noelvi Marte and Edwin Arroyo when speaking with the Mariners, and both of those highly-regarded infield prospects ended up included in the package the Reds received for Castillo.  The Reds also had several offers on the table for Mahle and Drury, with the front office ultimately deciding that the offers from the Twins (for Mahle) and Padres (for Drury) were the best of the group.",

The same with cutting that same piece of metal back into two. Home pest control would be a snap, as would &#8220;direct line-of-sight&#8221; communication.\n\n\n\nThis is particularly useful for older less mobile or sleepy cats. In this day and age of digital communication, technology cat laser beams can serve a useful purpose for direct line-of-sight communication particularly at night. The cats can communicate directly between themselves or the engineer companion may direct the code by way of butt scratches.\n\n\n\nThe pair previously employed cat lasers at Christmas to battle each other.",

        "description": "Modifying a surgical mask with a rubber band can improve its protective seal against particle exposure to the level of an N95 respirator, report researchers.\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic and when maximum protection is needed against air-born infections, the N95 respirator has remained the gold standard of personal protective equipment. However, it is also much more difficult to produce and obtain than a standard surgical mask.\nTo achieve N95-level protection, the respirators should demonstrate a minimum score of 100 on a standardized battery of tests—the Occupational Safety and Health Administration&#8217;s passing threshold—against the passage of particles that would potentially expose an individual to disease. Standard surgical masks are not as protective because they don&#8217;t seal around the wearer&#8217;s face, allowing particles to bypass the filter peripherally.\n&#8220;Photographs of the simple modification demonstrating an individual properly donning the modified mask. (A) Modified mask components consist of a standard ASTM Level 1 surgical mask and two 8” rubber bands. (B) While wearing an ASTM Level 1 surgical mask which has been adjusted to fit along the bridge of the nose, apply one 8” rubber band along the crown of the head and place the front of the rubber band under the nose. (C) Take another 8” rubber band and apply it perpendicularly under the first rubber band so that two loops are formed above and below the first rubber band. (D) Shift the first rubber band so that it is over the bridge of the nose and fold the second rubber band in half on itself along the first rubber band on the horizontal axis. (E) Place the second rubber band along the cheeks and under the chin. Adjust both rubber bands as needed to achieve a full seal as shown in this anterior view of the final construct. (F) Lateral view of the final construct.&#8221; (Credit: Dardas, et al. PLOS ONE, 2022)\nA research team led by a Michigan Medicine surgeon worked with 40 health care workers to test standard surgical masks modified with two 8-inch rubber bands over the crown of the subject&#8217;s head, bridge of the nose, around the cheeks, and under the chin within the boundaries of the mask.\nThirty-one of the subjects, or 78%, had modified masks that passed a fit test with a score of greater than 100. The passing masks scored an average of 151, a significantly better fit than an unmodified surgical mask score of 3.8 but lower than a properly fitted N95 mask&#8217;s score of 199. By the last day of investigation, all of the modified masks passed the N95 threshold, suggesting that greater experience with the banding improved fit and performance.\nThis easy modification could address N95 respirator shortages worldwide and provide health care workers and individuals in under-resourced regions—or even in a resourced area like the US when production demands can&#8217;t properly meet needs in a pandemic—a practical means for increased personal protection, says Jaimo Ahn, senior author of the paper and professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Michigan Medical School.\n&#8220;While not a vaccine, this approach emphasizes prevention rather than treatment,&#8221; Ahn says. &#8220;While not sophisticated, it has the potential to save lives and preserve wellness. Its effect will last as long as there are respiratory diseases and PPE demand exceeds supply. It is immediately impactful and sustainable, yet simple and cheap.&#8221;\nAdditional coauthors are from the University of Pennsylvania.\nSource: University of Michigan\nThe post Use 2 big rubber bands to majorly improve a surgical mask appeared first on Futurity.",

She also recently led communications efforts for the resettlement of Afghan refugees after the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.\n\n\n\nDalton previously worked on the transition team for the Biden administration, and she worked for President Biden when he was serving as a senator.\n\n\n\nThe White House also announced Kate Berner will be promoted from deputy communications director to principal deputy communications director. Berner has worked sporadically for Biden since 2012, and she was viewed as a possible replacement for communications director Kate Bedingfield when Bedingfield briefly planned to step down before changing her mind.\n\n\n\nBerner’s old role will be filled by Herbie Ziskend, who currently works in Vice President Harris’s office and previously worked with Biden during his first term as vice president.\n\n\n\n“We are so lucky to have these three incredibly talented people on our team,” Bedingfield tweeted. “They are stars who have played pivotal roles on Team Biden-Harris going back many years and will be critical voices moving forward. Huge congrats to Olivia, Herbie and Kate — so well-deserved.”\n\n\n\nThe new staff members cap off months of changes within the White House communications operation that started in May with the departure of former press secretary Jen Psaki. Since then, roughly a half dozen press staffers have departed the White House, most of them for other jobs in the administration.\n\n\n\nJean-Pierre was elevated to press secretary, and John Kirby came to the White House from the Pentagon to serve as national security spokesman\n\n\n\nFor his part, Biden has largely avoided media interviews throughout the summer, staying out of the spotlight as key pieces of his agenda made it through Congress. He is set to attend a rally on Thursday night with the Democratic National Committee, his first political event in weeks.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA new study details the extent of new-onset type 2 diabetes among youth throughout the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough historically girls were more likely than boys to be diagnosed with the condition, researchers found new cases were more common among boys during the study window.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType 2 diabetes rates doubled among Black youth, nearly doubled among Hispanic youth and decreased among white youth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew research led by a team at Johns Hopkins Children's Center details an unprecedented increase in the number of new type 2 diabetes diagnoses among youth throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. However, “whether the increase was caused by COVID-19 infection, or just associated with environmental changes and stressors during the pandemic is unclear,” authors wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInvestigators assessed records of more than 3,000 children newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes between March 2018 and February 2021.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFindings, published in the Journal of Pediatrics, showed new diagnoses of type 2 diabetes rose by 77 percent during the first year of the pandemic. A total of 825 cases were identified on average in the two pre-pandemic years compared with 1,463 in the first year of the pandemic.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDiagnosis rates nearly doubled in Hispanic youth over the past two years, while rates in Black children did double but rates in white children declined. The majority of newly diagnosed cases were among youth with public insurance.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It used to be rare to hear about a child with type 2 diabetes, but its prevalence in adolescents has almost doubled in the past 20 years,” said co-author Megan M Kelsey of the Children’s Hospital Colorado in a statement. But “in the spring of 2020 we were inundated with new youth-onset type 2 diabetes cases,” Kelsey said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll included patients were between the ages 8 and 21, had a body mass index in the 85th percentile and presented to one of 24 U.S. hospitals. Few patients also had COVID-19 upon hospitalization.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrevious research has shown COVID-19 increases diabetes risk, especially among those already susceptible to the disease.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nObesity is also a key risk factor for the condition, while in the United States, nearly 1 in 3 children are currently overweight. Decreased physical activity stemming from virtual school and social isolation could have increased sedentary behaviors among children throughout the pandemic. Disrupted sleep schedules and more unhealthy eating also might have contributed to the uptick.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn addition to increased diagnoses, electronic medical record data showed “likelihood of presenting with metabolic decompensation and severe diabetic ketoacidosis also increased significantly during the pandemic.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese new onset conditions put an “enormous strain” on pediatric diabetes health care providers, families, and patients alike, authors wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSeveral social determinants of health contribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes, including limited access to healthy food. In the United States, non-Hispanic Black patients are twice as likely as their white counterparts to die from diabetes and are more likely to be hospitalized for lower limb amputations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Youth with type 2 diabetes are known to be exposed to significant environmental stressors, as evidenced by a high proportion coming from single-caregiver and low-income households, with low parental education attainment,” authors wrote.\n\n\n\nIn addition “mental health disorders are common in youth with obesity and diabetes. It is possible that elements of this underlying stress could contribute to the pathophysiology of diabetes.\"\n\n\n\nAlthough girls are typically diagnosed with type 2 diabetes more often than boys, results showed that in the first year of the pandemic 55 percent of new onset cases were among boys. “This was one of the more unusual findings from our study,” noted co-first author Risa Wolf in a release.\n\n\n\nResearchers concluded by underscoring the importance of clinician screening for type 2 diabetes and an increased focus on exercising and healthy eating for children.",

A lot of people said that’s why they fired me. I don’t care, they don’t owe me a job. Fox News doesn’t owe me a job. That’s OK. I had a great time at the network, I’m proud of all the work I did, I’m proud of the work that I did with other people. The news division of Fox was great when I was there,\" Stirewalt said during an appearance on CNN this week. \n\n\n\nThe former top editor at Fox said he did not make the call himself but was rather \"part of a decision desk team that made a call.\"\n\n\n\n“Lordy day, did people get very angry about that,” he continued. “I had one U.S. senator call for my firing and say we were engaged in a cover-up. I thought, ‘Are there ballots under the table that I haven’t looked at? What are you talking about?'”\n\n\n\nStirewalt was apparently referencing comments made by Sen. Kevin Cramer (R-N.D.) just days after the election saying he and other \"knuckleheads\" at the network should be fired. \n\n\n\nThe Arizona race call, which was made first by Fox, infuriated former President Trump and his allies on the night of the election. \n\n\n\nBiden won the state with the help of Maricopa County, a highly populated area that includes Phoenix. Since the election, Arizona has also been the subject of controversy after various members of the GOP have called for election recounts. \n\n\n\nStirewalt was later fired by the network in what it said was a post-election restructuring. \n\n\n\n“As we conclude the 2020 election cycle, Fox News Digital has realigned its business and reporting structure to meet the demands of this new era,\" Fox said at the time. \"We are confident these changes will ensure the platform continues to deliver breakthrough reporting and insightful analysis surrounding major issues, both stateside and abroad.”\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, Stirewalt was hired by startup cable channel NewsNation, which is owned by The Hill's parent company, Nexstar Media, to serve as its top political editor. \n\n\n\nHe also testified before the select committee investigating the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol and is currently promoting a new book about his life and career in politics and media.",

Ron DeSantis (R) in 2019, narrowly lost his nonpartisan primary against attorney Nancy Jacobs.\n\n\n\nJacobs received roughly 51.9 percent of the vote, beating Smith by about 3.7 percentage points, or roughly 7,900 votes.\n\n\n\nSmith had ruled in January that the 17-year-old, who was kept anonymous in court documents, could not receive an abortion, citing her grades. An appeals court overturned the ruling.\n\n\n\n\"While she claimed that her grades were 'Bs' during her testimony, her GPA is currently 2.0,” Smith ruled. “Clearly, a 'B' average would not equate to a 2.0 GPA.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFlorida is one of six states that require both parental notification and consent for minors to obtain abortions, according to the Guttmacher Institute. The teen had asked the court to waive the requirement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnder Florida law, a judge can waive parental consent if it finds by “clear and convincing evidence” that the minor is “sufficiently mature” to decide to have an abortion. In considering those requests, judges are required to assess factors like the minor’s age, overall intelligence and emotional stability.\n\n\n\nThe statute has led to multiple high-profile cases, including one earlier this month in which a Florida appeals court ruled a 16-year-old did not demonstrate she met the maturity requirement to circumvent the parental notification and consent requirements.\n\n\n\nSmith received an array of endorsements in the primary race, including former Florida Gov. Bob Martinez (R), the Tampa Bay Times’s editorial board and multiple retired judges who served on the circuit.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats have hoped the Supreme Court’s overturning of the constitutional right to an abortion in June will help energize voters in this year’s midterm elections and avoid steep losses for the party as it seeks to maintain control of Congress.\n\n\n\nVoters in Kansas, a traditionally red state, rejected a ballot question earlier this month that would remove abortion rights from the state constitution.\n\n\n\nAs voters headed to the polls in Florida on Tuesday and defeated Smith in his circuit court race, New York’s simultaneous primary showed another sign of the potential impact of the abortion ruling.Pat Ryan (D), who made supporting abortion rights a cornerstone of his campaign, defeated Marc Molinaro (R) in the state’s 19th Congressional District, a bellwether district that voted for former President Obama in 2012, former President Trump in 2016 and President Biden in 2020.",

        "description": "A Denver high school is facing criticism after playing a video advising students to avoid interactions with police in racially motivated attacks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCBS affiliate KCNC reported on Wednesday that during a schoolwide assembly, South High School students were shown a video titled \"Don't be a Bystander: 6 Tips for Responding to Racist Attacks” published by the Barnard Center for Research on Women.\n\n\n\nOne of the six tips mentioned in the five-year-old video was to avoid the police in such incidents due to authorities' tendency to escalate the situation and \"often treat victims as perpetrators of crimes.\"\n\n\n\nIn a statement, the Denver Police Foundation expressed its disappointment and concern, saying sharing this type of advice to students is “irresponsible” and “discourages cooperation of the victim, potentially leading to no accountability of the offender and their behavior.” \n\n\n\n“The Denver Police Foundation supports and commends South High School for engaging their student body in learning how to combat, mitigate and act in the face of terrifying acts of bias-motivated crimes against those in their community, but showing a video that asks their students to directly engage in a potentially violent situation with no training or expertise on how to deescalate AND telling them not to call police is beyond disappointing and discouraging,” the group said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSouth High School principal Rachel Goss wrote a letter to families of the students, according to KCNC, saying the school’s initial purpose was to provide empowerment for students “who may witness these types of attacks, not to have any sort of negative impact on the longstanding relationship between the Denver Public Schools and the Denver Police Department.\"&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill has reached out to Denver Public Schools for more information.&nbsp;",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion bans in Idaho, Tennessee and Texas officially take effect Thursday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn total, 11 states with trigger laws have outlawed abortion. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbortion is expected to be banned or restricted in even more states.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThree more states officially outlawed abortion Thursday, as a&nbsp;wave of new abortion restrictions&nbsp;take over the U.S. following the Supreme Court&nbsp;decision to overturn Roe v. Wade two months ago.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIdaho, Tennessee and Texas will officially join eight other states that have banned abortion through “trigger” laws, legislation designed to take effect immediately or upon quick state action the moment Roe v. Wade no longer applies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThose laws jumped into action as soon as the Supreme Court issued its decision on the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization case in June, effectively overturning Roe and ending a nearly 50-year precedent that protected abortion as a constitutional right.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere are the latest abortion laws taking effect:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIdaho&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEnacted in 2020, Idaho’s abortion legislation is structured to take effect on Aug. 25, 30 days after Roe is overturned and it bans abortions after six weeks of pregnancy. It makes exceptions for rape, incest and if the mother's life is in danger.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nViolators of the law can be charged with a felony punishable by at least two years in prison.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJust one day before Idaho’s abortion law was set to take effect, a federal judge halted part of the ban — asserting the state cannot punish doctors for performing abortions to protect the life of a pregnant woman within an emergency room situation. The decision stems from a lawsuit brought by the Department of Justice, which argued that Idaho’s ban violated the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act. The pause will remain in place until the lawsuit is resolved. \n\n\n\nTennessee&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEnacted in 2019, Tennessee’s abortion law was set to go into effect Thursday,&nbsp;30 days after Roe is overturned. It&nbsp;bans abortions beyond six-weeks of pregnancy, with violators subject to a felony charge.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTennessee voters also chose to amend the state’s constitution back in 2014 to ensure it would not protect a right to abortion or funding of abortion.\n\n\n\nTexas&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTexas already passed a restrictive abortion law last year, known as Senate Bill 8, which bans abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy while also allowing private citizens to bring lawsuits for $10,000 or more against violators.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA new mechanism takes effect Thursday, increasing the penalty for anyone who provides or attempts an abortion to a first or second-degree felony and a fine of at least $100,000 for each violation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Biden has tried to protect federal access to abortion, signing two executive orders that protect access to medication abortion, emergency care for pregnant women and support for women who need to travel out-of-state in order to receive an abortion. \n\n\n\nHowever, most states that had trigger laws in place have now enacted them. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAdditional states could also move to curtail abortion access. In Florida, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) vowed that he will work to expand abortion restrictions after the Supreme Court’s June decision. Currently, abortion is legal up to 15 weeks of pregnancy.  ",

Whether he actually is or not is something else altogether.\n\n\n\nA lot of Trump’s most loyal supporters think just that — that he really is getting a raw deal, that he's nothing more than a political target of the Department of Justice (DOJ) because, well, because he’s Donald Trump. No surprise there: Trump’s most loyal supporters think their favorite president of all time can never do anything wrong.\n\n\n\nBut it’s also what some of my more thoughtful conservative friends think — friends who wish Trump would take a vacation in Outer Mongolia and not come back until 2025, if then.\n\n\n\nThey’re suspicious over what motivated the FBI raid at the home of the former president. In their more paranoid moments, they attribute the worst motives to the FBI, the DOJ, the attorney general, and even the current president of the United States, who, they make sure I realize, may wind up running against the man whose home was raided.\n\n\n\nAs for Trump’s most loyal fans, they’re so mad they can’t see their own hypocrisy.\n\n\n\nThey yelled bloody murder when progressive Democrats demanded that we “defund the police.” Now, it’s some of the hard right who want to “defund the FBI.”\n\n\n\nThey screamed when Trump was compared to Nazis. Now they compare the FBI to the Gestapo.\n\n\n\nOver the top? Yes. Stupid? I think so.\n\n\n\nBut there’s a reason a lot of Republicans question the validity of the search warrant that allowed the FBI to enter Mar-a-Lago and rummage around for all sorts of things. They remember that it was an FBI lawyer who lied to a judge to get a warrant during the investigation into Trump’s supposed collusion with the Russians. If the FBI lied then, they want to know, why should we trust them now?.\n\n\n\nBesides, some top FBI agents were transparently hostile to Trump while they were investigating his supposed ties to Russia. So why should Republicans simply accept that the FBI was just doing its job, absent any political motives?\n\n\n\nAnd my conservative friends — even those who don’t believe the election was “stolen” and who wish Trump would just go away — wonder if there’s one set of rules for Republicans and another for Democrats.\n\n\n\nWhy is Trump in the DOJ’s crosshairs, they ask, while Hillary Clinton, who also was accused of mishandling classified documents, barely got a slap on the wrist?\n\n\n\nThey remember that then-FBI Director James Comey rebuked Clinton for being “extremely careless” in using a private email address and server during her service as secretary of State. They remember that he raised questions about her judgment and said it was possible that hostile foreign governments had gained access to her account. They remember that he said a person still employed by the government — Clinton left the State Department in 2013 — could have faced disciplinary action for doing what she did. Yet he recommended no criminal charges against her, saying “our judgment is that no reasonable prosecutor would bring such a case.”\n\n\n\nSo why, conservatives wonder, do we hear talk now — especially on liberal cable news channels — about getting an orange jumpsuit ready for the former president?\n\n\n\n“Double standard” are two words I’ve been hearing a lot lately.\n\n\n\nMy friends also bring up the Russia collusion investigation that crippled much of the Trump presidency. Liberal politicians and their allies in the media couldn’t stop yapping back then about how Trump was somehow involved with the Kremlin.\n\n\n\nSo if they fell for the Russia collusion hoax — and perpetuated the “fake news” story — why, Trump fans wonder, should we give them the benefit of the doubt now that they’re convinced Trump is up to no good, yet again?\n\n\n\nAnd if Trump supporters believe — as an intelligent friend of mine put it to me just the other day — that “the deep state” won’t rest until it “gets Donald Trump,” let’s not simply chalk it up to paranoia (although, between us, I’m tempted to do just that). After all, it was Hillary Clinton who talked about “a vast right-wing conspiracy” that was out to get her husband, then-President Bill Clinton.\n\n\n\nIf liberals see right-wing conspiracies, is it really so hard to understand why conservatives see “deep state” left-wing conspiracies?\n\n\n\nBefore this is all over, it’s possible, I guess, that we may find out Trump had nefarious plans for the documents he allegedly took with him when he left office. If he planned to sell those to the Russians, I’d be the first one yelling, “Lock him up!” But I doubt he would do anything that crazy. Using secret documents to get a YUGE advance to spice up a memoir he might be thinking of writing? With Trump, that’s possible.\n\n\n\nWhat’s also possible, though, is that the raid was legal but not necessary and that, who knows, maybe it was politically motivated, as Trump fans believe.\n\n\n\nI don’t have enough information to know if Trump is a victim of the Biden administration — or if everything is on the up and up. But I do know you can have contempt for someone and still leave open the possibility that he’s being treated unfairly.\n\n\n\nTrump supporters may very well turn out to be way off-base in what they think motivated the raid at Mar-a-Lago. Just because you’re paranoid, as the saying goes, doesn’t mean they aren’t after you.\n\n\n\nAt absolute least, it just might mean you have a reason to be paranoid.\n\n\n\nBernard Goldberg is an Emmy and an Alfred I. duPont-Columbia University award-winning writer and journalist.

        "description": "The Economist: &#8220;States across the country have smashed revenue records in the past fiscal year. According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, a non-profit outfit, state governments saved $217.1bn in 2021, exceeding the 2019 record by nearly $100bn.&#8221;\n&#8220;Why the bonanza? An influx of federal dollars during the pandemic spared states from spending savings. Sales-tax revenues soared as federal stimulus cheques, tax credits and unemployment benefits gave people money to spend. Inflation helped, too. Not only did it boost the price of goods, which increased sales-tax revenues; it also raised salaries, in nominal terms, moving people into higher tax brackets.&#8221;\n&#8220;Although the average state carries a debt of $3,641 per resident, none seems to be using its excess revenue to pay off what it owes. Instead, after replenishing rainy-day funds, states are playing with taxes&#8230; Thirty-three states and Washington, dc, have passed some sort of tax relief.&#8221;",

Timothy Spall found fame as dim builder Barry in 80s comedy drama Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. But before that, he’d been in the National Youth Theatre, trained at Rada, worked for the RSC and starred in his first Mike Leigh film, Home Sweet Home. Obviously he can’t turn into a rat like he can in Harry Potter, but neither is he from from Birmingham, which will confuse fans of Red Dwarf (where he infamously invents the word “twonk”).

Potter discusses male anger in her film and the similarities between that and Rock’s real-life experience of being slapped by Will Smith at the OscarsWhen Will Smith strode on stage earlier this year at the Oscars and slapped Chris Rock for making a joke about his wife, Jada Pinkett Smith, the British director Sally Potter was putting the finishing touches to her new short, Look at Me. The film features a scene in which Rock, as an events organiser named Adam, is thrown to the floor by Leo (Javier Bardem), a drummer scheduled to perform that night at a gala fundraiser. The two men are lovers, which only heightens the tension as Leo raises his fist above Adam.Potter was instantly aware of the parallels between Look at Me, which she shot in 2019, and the fracas at the Oscars. “I had this feeling of: ‘OK. That’s interesting,’” says the 72-year-old film-maker, as she pours water for us in her office in a quiet east London courtyard. “I could see there was a thematic overlap here with the film about how men cope with their anger – issues of respect, humiliation and communication. There was a certain appropriateness to it.” Continue reading...",

        "description": "Chicken and partner Ellen Landress-Bawkett off to work. Photographs by Margie Smith Holt.\nBy Margie Smith Holt\nWalk up Central Park West and you’ll see plenty of dogs enjoying the last days of summer. But at least one dog frequenting the neighborhood is headed to work. And she’s looking for a few other dogs to join her.\nMeet Chicken, a therapy dog who’s back on the job after a two-year COVID layoff. She’s making house calls again, visiting Upper West Siders who are terminally ill, bringing comfort and a little bit of joy.\nEllen Landress-Bowkett and Chicken.\n“She opens hearts,” says Chicken’s partner, Ellen Landress-Bowkett. The two are volunteers with the Hospice Care Team at VNS Health (formerly known as Visiting Nurse Service of NY). Ellen credits Chicken—a rescue from a kill shelter—with getting her involved.\n“She had a purpose,” says Ellen. “I’d never had a dog before, but walking down the street, she would stare at somebody—just stop and stare—and then that person would start staring at her, then they would come toward each other like long-lost friends, and the person would always be so happy…So, after a little while with her, I realized that she needed to do something beyond just be my pet.”\nChicken getting her official ID pinned on before a visit.\nAfter an interview to make sure the 9-pound mixed breed had the right temperament for a therapy job, Chicken (and Ellen) trained for their new vocation at the Good Dog Foundation and, after zeroing in on VNS Health’s programs, got the additional training to do hospice and vigil work. Chicken was a natural.\n“She makes intense eye contact. She gazes with such love,” says Ellen. “Sometimes people just burst out into tears.\n“If you want to be unconditionally accepted, pet a dog.”\nChicken’s story, says VNS Health, underscores not only the benefits of animal therapy in hospice care, but also the need for more volunteers like Chicken and Ellen. Chicken is currently the only therapy dog on the hospice care team. Ellen hopes Upper West Side dog owners reading this will help change that. The work, she says, is so rewarding.\nPhotograph via Instagram.\n“I really hope that many, many people—and dogs—are interested in doing this because it&#8217;s so fulfilling. It&#8217;s so heart opening. It&#8217;s so magical,” Ellen says. “I’ve sat with people who I&#8217;ve just met, who are stroking a dog—just kind of in the zone—and they start pouring their hearts out. And it&#8217;s such a privilege to be there and to receive that kind of trust and openness from someone. It’s such a privilege to really connect with people that way.”\nAnyone interested in volunteering at VNS Health (with or without a dog) can submit an application or contact the organization at 212-609-1570 or by email at volguest@vnsny.org.\nYou can find more information on VNS Health’s hospice services here.\nFor the record, Chicken’s no chicken. When the West Side Rag met her, she was super chill and perfectly happy to meet a stranger. So, what’s with the name?\nBefore Ellen adopted her, she tried to imagine what it would be like having a little dog running around in her backyard. When she pictured the dog trying to slip through the gate, she thought it looked like a chicken. And then…\n“I met her and she looked exactly like the little dog that just appeared in my imagination. And the funny thing is, she answered to it immediately.”\nTo keep up with Chicken’s adventures, you can, of course, follow her on Instagram @chickenthetherapydog.",

        "description": "A federal magistrate judge has ordered the unsealing of a redacted affidavit laying out the Justice Department’s evidence for the Aug. 8 search of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate as part of an investigation into mishandling of classified information, theft of government records and obstruction of justice. Judge Bruce Reinhart instructed prosecutors to make the partially-obscured document public on the court’s docket by noon Friday. The Justice Department resisted making even a redacted version of the affidavit public, warning that any acceptable redactions would be so extensive as to render the document meaningless. It’s unclear whether the department will seek to appeal the order, which could produce further delays. Reinhart’s order came after Justice Department attorneys proposed redactions earlier Thursday to the secret document that prompted him to approve the FBI search of the waterside Palm Beach property that serves both as a home for the former president and a private club for members. Reinhart emphasized that prosecutors had shown “good cause” to redact elements of the affidavit that would reveal “the identities of witnesses, law enforcement agents, and uncharged parties,” “the investigation’s strategy, direction, scope, sources, and methods” and “grand jury information.”  The judge appeared to approve all of the deletions the Justice Department proposed, some of which are intended to shield investigators’ sources and methods for collecting evidence as part of their criminal probe into the “highly classified” documents the FBI discovered at Mar-a-Lago. Exactly what prosecutors contend needs to be protected from disclosure in the court submission and what specific arguments they’ve made for secrecy is unknown, since the DOJ filing was made under seal to a federal court in West Palm Beach. However, a Justice Department spokesman confirmed that prosecutors complied with the order to submit those suggestions by noon Thursday. Entries in the court’s docket that appeared right around the deadline, said the filings were sealed and offered no other details. “The United States has filed a submission under seal per the Court’s order of Aug. 22,” spokesman Anthony Coley said in a brief statement. “The Justice Department respectfully declines further comment as the Court considers the matter.” At a hearing last week, Reinhart signaled he was inclined to make portions of the affidavit public, even though such documents usually remain under seal until criminal charges are filed or an investigation is closed. However, the judge said in a written order on Monday that he would not release details about sources and methods the government relied on in the affidavit. But the intense national interest surrounding the investigation has drawn unusual attention to incremental developments in the ongoing case, often fueled by the former president himself, who has mounted a campaign to discredit the investigation, even as it has presented an increasingly acute legal threat. A wide array of news organizations, along with the conservative group Judicial Watch, petitioned the court to unseal the affidavit. Trump has said publicly that he wants all documents related to the search released, but he has not formally joined in the unsealing effort. His lawyers did make a separate legal move Monday to seek an outside party to oversee review of the materials the FBI seized during the Aug. 8 search at Mar-a-Lago. Another judge has asked Trump’s attorneys to provide more details on their request by Friday. DOJ has previously said that if ordered by Reinhart, it would propose redactions so extensive that it would render the search affidavit meaningless to the public. However, the department is also under pressure to reveal more details about the basis for taking the unprecedented step of executing a search warrant at the home of a former president. Attorney General Merrick Garland, who has acknowledged directly approving the search, has already recognized the unusual urgency of the matter, moving to unseal the search warrant itself, as well as two redacted receipts for property taken from Trump’s estate. Adding to that pressure: Trump has used the vacuum of information to assail law enforcement and contend that the search was a politically motivated attack against a potential contender for the White House in 2024. He and his allies have ratcheted up heated rhetoric around the search. Trump himself on Thursday morning described the search “the greatest political attack in the history of the U.S.,” in a post on his social media site. But the department has resisted making elements of the underlying affidavit public, warning it could scare off cooperative witnesses — particularly amid a rising tide of violent threats to law enforcement and others connected to the investigation — or reveal details about how the FBI collected evidence in the case. Making the document public could also set a precedent that would bolster efforts to get such records in other high-profile, politically charged investigations. A Justice Department prosecutor told Reinhart that process would be a burden on the government to handle in a slew of cases, but the magistrate judge said in his order Monday that he wasn’t concerned at the moment with other cases. “I do not need to reach the question of whether, in some other case, these concerns could justify denying public access; they very well might. Particularly given the intense public and historical interest in an unprecedented search of a former President’s residence, the Government has not yet shown that these administrative concerns are sufficient to justify sealing.” It’s unclear whether Reinhart’s ruling will be the final say on what, if anything, gets released. The Justice Department and any of the entities asking for public release of the affidavit could appeal his decision to a District Court judge and to the Atlanta-based 11th Circuit Court of Appeals. Reinhart suggested at the hearing last week that he would not release anything until any potential appeals were resolved.",

        "description": "In 2020, Elon Musk said artificial intelligence would surpass human intelligence within five years, on its way to becoming &#8220;an immortal dictator.&#8221; A new book says no way, not ever.\nThe book, Why Machines Will Never Rule the World: Artificial Intelligence without Fear (Routledge, 2022), argues against the possibility of engineering machines that can surpass human intelligence.\nCoauthors are Barry Smith, professor in the philosophy department at the University at Buffalo and Jobst Landgrebe, senior research associate in the philosophy department and founder of Cognotekt, a German AI company.\nMachine learning and all other working software applications—the proud accomplishments of those involved in AI research—are for Smith and Landgrebe far from anything resembling the capacity of humans. Further, they argue that any incremental progress that&#8217;s unfolding in the field of AI research will in practical terms bring it no closer to the full functioning possibility of the human brain.\nSmith and Landgrebe offer a critical examination of AI&#8217;s unjustifiable projections, such as machines detaching themselves from humanity, self-replicating, and becoming &#8220;full ethical agents.&#8221; There cannot be a machine will, they say. Every single AI application rests on the intentions of human beings—including intentions to produce random outputs.\nThis means the Singularity, a point when AI becomes uncontrollable and irreversible (like a Skynet moment from the Terminator movie franchise) is not going to occur. Wild claims to the contrary serve only to inflate AI&#8217;s potential and distort public understanding of the technology&#8217;s nature, possibilities, and limits, they argue.\nReaching across the borders of several scientific disciplines, Smith and Landgrebe argue that the idea of a general artificial intelligence (AGI)—the ability of computers to emulate and go beyond the general intelligence of humans—rests on fundamental mathematical impossibilities that are analogous in physics to the impossibility of building a perpetual motion machine. AI that would match the general intelligence of humans is impossible because of the mathematical limits on what can be modelled and is &#8220;computable.&#8221; These limits are accepted by practically everyone working in the field; yet they have thus far failed to appreciate their consequences for what an AI can achieve.\n&#8220;To overcome these barriers would require a revolution in mathematics that would be of greater significance than the invention of the calculus by Newton and Leibniz more than 350 years ago,&#8221; says Smith. &#8220;We are not holding our breath.&#8221;\nLandgrebe points out that, &#8220;As can be verified by talking to mathematicians and physicists working at the limits of their respective disciplines, there is nothing even on the horizon which would suggest that a revolution of this sort might one day be achievable. Mathematics cannot fully model the behaviors of complex systems like the human organism,&#8221; he says.\nAI has many highly impressive success stories, and considerable funding has gone toward advancing its frontier beyond the achievements in narrow, well-defined fields such as text translation and image recognition. Much of the investment to push the technology forward into areas requiring the machine counterpart of general intelligence may, the authors say, be money down the drain.\n&#8220;The text generator GPT-3 has shown itself capable of producing different sorts of convincing outputs across many divergent fields,&#8221; says Smith. &#8220;Unfortunately, its users soon recognize that mixed in with these outputs there are also embarrassing errors, so that the convincing outputs themselves began to appear as nothing more than clever parlor tricks.&#8221;\nAI&#8217;s role in sequencing the human genome led to suggestions for how it might help find cures for many human diseases; yet, after 20 years of additional research (in which both Smith and Landgrebe have participated), little has been produced to support optimism of this sort.\n&#8220;In certain completely rule-determined confined settings, machine learning can be used to create algorithms that outperform humans,&#8221; says Smith. &#8220;But this does not mean that they can &#8216;discover&#8217; the rules governing just any activity taking place in an open environment, which is what the human brain achieves every day.&#8221;\nTechnology skeptics do not, of course, have a perfect record. They&#8217;ve been wrong in regard to breakthroughs ranging from space flight to nanotechnology. But Smith and Landgrebe say their arguments are based on the mathematical implications of the theory of complex systems. For mathematical reasons, AI cannot mimic the way the human brain functions. In fact, the authors say that it&#8217;s impossible to engineer a machine that would rival the cognitive performance of a crow.\n&#8220;An AGI is impossible,&#8221; says Smith. &#8220;As our book shows, there can be no general artificial intelligence because it is beyond the boundary of what is even in principle achievable by means of a machine.&#8221;\nSource: University at Buffalo\nThe post Book: AI is cool, but nowhere near human capacity appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has been given additional authority to investigate the situation at a nuclear power plant that Russia has taken over during its invasion of Ukraine.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOfficials from the IAEA, which partners with more than a dozen organizations in the United Nations, will visit the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant in southern Ukraine soon, as world leaders have expressed concerns about the plant’s stability, Bloomberg reported Thursday. \n\n\n\nTwo diplomats with knowledge of the visit told Bloomberg that the delegation will include security and safety authorities along with officials responsible for accounting for nuclear materials at the plant. Agency officials had previously only intended to ensure that uranium-rich stockpiles of material were not missing amid the six-month-long conflict.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe safety and security officials will allow the agency to possibly perform a forensic evaluation of shelling that has occurred at the plant, Bloomberg reported. This evaluation could be used to hold attackers of the plant responsible for the damage it has received. \n\n\n\nThe IAEA did not immediately return a request from The Hill for comment.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussia took control of the plant, the largest in Europe, months ago, and Ukraine and Russia have blamed each other for skirmishes and shelling that have occurred near it. \n\n\n\nPresident Biden discussed the need to protect the plant on a call on Sunday with United Kingdom Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz. \n\n\n\nReuters reported last week that Macron said Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to allow IAEA officials to visit the plant. \n\n\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned that a “catastrophe” could happen if the plant is not properly defended, saying that any “radiation incident” could affect members of the European Union and other nearby and even more distant countries. \n\n\n\nBloomberg reported that the IAEA wants the visit to happen before Sept. 5, when a two-week international mission was already planned to look into the safety systems of the plant. The mission, which was scheduled before the war began six months ago, would be the first safety evaluation at the plant in 16 years.",

With only a handful of races left to be decided, Democratic chances of keeping their majorities in the U.S. House and Senate and winning key state and local races in November are growing, thanks to a strong field of highly qualified candidates with records of leadership and problem-solving who embrace moderate positions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn contrast, in several key states and races across the country, Republican primary voters have nominated far-right extremists who in many cases embrace defeated former President Donald Trump’s false claim that he won the 2020 presidential election and was robbed of victory by both Republican and Democratic state and local officials who rigged the election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany of these radical Republicans have never run for office before and are less qualified for government positions than I am to be an NFL quarterback. Still, Democrats must become much more aggressive in talking to and motivating voters of all backgrounds to support them this fall.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere are a few of my recommendations to Democratic campaign managers and others working across the country.\n\n\n\nFirst, take our campaigns directly to Democratic, Republican and Independent voters using GOTV, which stands for \"Get Out the Vote\" drives, not just \"Go On Television.\" Focus particular attention on people who often skip voting in midterm elections. The time to begin these voter drives is now, not two weeks before Election Day. We should remember that millions of people will start voting&nbsp;next month&nbsp;and many more will be voting absentee in October. Again, this is a big change from the pre-pandemic years.\n\n\n\nSecond, Democrats have positive cases to focus on, including the major achievements of the administration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris and Democrats in Congress, including:&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;Inflation Reduction Act, which will reduce health insurance and prescription drug costs for millions of Americans, fight dangerous climate change, impose a minimum tax on multibillion-dollar corporations and crack down on wealthy tax cheats.&nbsp;&nbsp;The $1.9 trillion&nbsp;American Rescue Plan&nbsp;that funded free COVID-19 vaccinations and treatments and sent checks to most Americans and many small businesses to help them cope with the pandemic.&nbsp;The $1.2 trillion&nbsp;infrastructure law&nbsp;to improve America’s roads, bridges, mass transit, rail, airports, ports, waterways and energy systems,&nbsp;all the while&nbsp;creating good jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;The most significant&nbsp;gun safety reforms&nbsp;in 30 years.On top of this, Biden issued an executive order Wednesday canceling $10,000 in student loan debt for individuals earning less than $125,000 a year or living in households earning less than $250,000 annually. People who received Pell grants for low-income students will get $20,000 in student loan debt canceled. Some 45 million people owe $1.6 trillion in federal student loan debt.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThird, remind voters that the disruption and deaths caused by the pandemic are easing, gasoline prices have&nbsp;plummeted&nbsp;by more than $1 a gallon since June, inflation is&nbsp;slowing, the unemployment rate&nbsp;is down&nbsp;to&nbsp;only 3.5 percent&nbsp;in July (the lowest since before the pandemic), supply chain bottlenecks are&nbsp;clearing up, Biden has rallied the world in support of Ukraine against Russian aggression and expanded the NATO alliance, and al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri was&nbsp;killed&nbsp;in a U.S. drone strike ordered by Biden.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLastly, Democrats must&nbsp;draw attention to how millions of Americans would suffer if Republicans take control of one or both chambers of Congress or state houses because of the GOP’s radical positions of opposing the common sense solutions discussed above. It needs to be stressed that all of these accomplishments took place while Democrats held a razor-thin majority in the House and had to deal with an evenly split Senate. Under the circumstances, the Democrats’ legislative achievements are truly astonishing, but further progress will be impossible if Republicans make even minimal gains in November.\n\n\n\nIn primary races, Trump has attacked Republicans who might be able to win general election campaigns and thrown his support to sycophantic candidates who accept his Big Lie that he was reelected two years ago and shower him with praise. This has produced&nbsp;nominees&nbsp;popular with Trump’s base but not with the rest of the electorate.\n\n\n\nSome Trump-endorsed candidates who have won their party’s nominations have said they would have&nbsp;refused&nbsp;to certify Biden as the winner of the 2020 presidential race and have given indications they would declare Trump the winner if he runs in 2024 regardless of what voters decide. They don’t just oppose Democrats; they oppose democracy.\n\n\n\nIn addition, some Republican nominees have called for&nbsp;ending&nbsp;entitlement funding for Social Security and Medicare (meaning funding could be cut), advocated for&nbsp;reduced aid&nbsp;to public schools, called for sugarcoating American history in public schools to cover up the role of&nbsp;racism, and favor&nbsp;tax cuts&nbsp;for the rich that would result in soaring deficits and less funding for vital programs.\n\n\n\nThe Republican civil war fueled by Trump has left the party disunited, with Republicans like Maryland Gov. Larry Hogan, who is term-limited, saying he will not vote for Dan Cox, the Trump-endorsed GOP nominee for governor. Hogan&nbsp;has called&nbsp;Cox “a nut” and “a QAnon whack job” who “is not, in my opinion, mentally stable.” Even Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) has decried the sad&nbsp;“candidate quality”&nbsp;of the current crop of GOP nominees.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo take advantage of the weak GOP field, Democrats must focus on the issues and put party labels aside to demonstrate to voters which party can accomplish the most for the American people. From fighting inflation to getting people vaccinated to reopening schools and repairing roads, bridges and tunnels, to connecting every community, it’s Democrats who are driving forward and looking at the road ahead, while many Republicans are focused on the rearview mirror and Trump’s election defeat.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThese developments, along with the willingness of Democrats to campaign everywhere, should leave the party optimistic that, unlike in most midterm elections, the party in the White House will come out stronger in November. The mixture of a marvelously productive two years for Democrats and the weakness of Republican nominees has created the opportunity for historic wins in 2022. We need to grasp that opportunity.\n\n\n\nDonna Brazile is a political strategist, a contributor to ABC News and former chair of the Democratic National Committee.

        "description": "Two decades ago today, Ant and Dec presented the first ever series of the reality show. From adorably candid moments to pomp-skewering redemptive force, no wonder it’s still going strong“I’ve never met anyone like Joey before in my life.” So said the snooker player Steve Davis, after watching the beauty queen Amy Willerton teaching Joey Essex to tell the time by drawing a clock in the dirt with a stick. Davis’s total bewilderment offers a clue to the enduring appeal of the annual celebrity hazing show I’m a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here!. Today, it turns 20 (and later this year, it will be returning to the Australian jungle after its Covid hiatus in Wales) but, thankfully, it shows no sign of growing up.Obviously, the 2013 scene is innately hilarious – Essex grapples with the concepts of the big hand and the little hand and tries to see past the confusion induced by “all the ticking” normally associated with clocks. Meanwhile, Davis and EastEnders actor Laila Morse look on, curious, and increasingly incredulous, as Willerton gently tries to furnish Essex with a new life skill. But there is something sweet about it too: as perplexed as they are, no one is laughing at Essex, or at least not with any spite. It is just an odd, singular moment where, on national TV, defences have come down and something of the human realities behind the celebrities is revealed.I’m a Celebrity does this kind of thing all the time. If it didn’t, it would not have made it to TV adulthood. Davis had never met anyone like Joey Essex before – and if it weren’t for I’m a Celebrity, he probably never would have. These oddball culture clashes happen surprisingly often: you may recall EastEnders actor Joe Swash’s 2008 triumph, but can you remember who claimed the lesser podium positions? Tennis legend Martina Navratilova and Star Trek actor George Takei. The show is a gloriously incongruous celebrity tombola, in which no potential friendship (or indeed antagonism) is off the table. Kate Price living in close proximity to John Lydon? Who knows, it might just work? Only one way to find out … Continue reading...",

        "description": "1:16PM: Walsh has been placed on the 60-day IL, the Angels announced.  This officially ends the first baseman&#8217;s 2022 season.\n10:06AM: The Angels announced a series of roster moves prior to today&#8217;s game with the Rays, including the news that Jared Walsh has been placed on the 10-day injured list due to thoracic outlet syndrome.  Infielder Phil Gosselin was also designated for assignment.  Filling the two roster spots are catcher Matt Thaiss (called up from Triple-A), and first baseman Mike Ford, whose contract was selected from Triple-A.\nThoracic outlet syndrome is a condition much more commonly seen in pitchers, making Walsh something of an outlier as a position player.  While Walsh drew some attention as a two-way player early in his career and during his time in the Angels farm system, he has only 26 2/3 professional innings pitched, and none since 2019.  Most pitchers who undergo surgery to correct TOS aren&#8217;t the same performance-wise after returning to the mound, but it remains to see if Walsh will indeed need surgery, or how such a procedure could impact his future production given that he isn&#8217;t pitching.\nEven if Walsh opts for treatment without going under the knife, it would seem like the remainder of his 2022 season could be in jeopardy.  With the Angels out of contention, they would seemingly not have any reason to rush Walsh back into action.\nWalsh hit .280/.338/.531 over 693 PA with the Angels in 2020-21, earning a seventh-place finish in 2020&#8217;s Rookie of the Year balloting and a slot on the 2021 AL All-Star team.  However, 2022 has been much more of a struggle, as the 29-year-old has contributed only 15 home runs and a .215/.269/.374 slash line.  Despite some decent defense at first base, this poor offensive production has resulted in an overall sub-replacement level performance for Walsh, who has -0.5 fWAR and -0.6 bWAR.\nEven in 2020-21, Walsh has below-average walk and strikeout rates, but those numbers have sunk further downward in 2022 &#8212; Walsh&#8217;s 30.4% strikeout rate puts him in only the sixth percentile of batters.  He is also hitting with far less power, with an Isolated Power metric of only .158 (down from .354 in 2020 and .232 in 2021).  This decline has robbed the Angels of a key bat in their lineup, as Los Angeles has gotten very little from any players besides Mike Trout, Shohei Ohtani, Taylor Ward, and the emerging Luis Rengifo.\nGosselin had enough MLB service time that he can reject an outright assignment to Triple-A, assuming that he clears waivers and the Angels don&#8217;t release him.  The Angels claimed Gosselin off waivers from the Braves in mid-July, and the veteran utilityman ended up playing 22 games with Anaheim, mostly as a third baseman.  Unfortunately, Gosselin provided very little offense, with only a .269 OPS over 51 plate appearances.\nGosselin has only sporadically delivered at the plate over his 10 Major League seasons, with a career .254/.305/.349 slash line over 1199 PA.  The 33-year-old has suited up for seven different big league teams, and this is his second stint with the Angels, after playing 104 games with the Halos in 2021.\nFord is in today&#8217;s starting lineup as the cleanup hitter, putting Ford on pace to see action for a fourth different Major League team this season.  The first baseman has appeared in 22 games combined with the Giants, Mariners, and Braves, with San Francisco and Seattle ping-ponging him back and forth between their rosters a few times earlier in the season and Atlanta releasing Ford earlier this month.  He signed a new minor league contract with Los Angeles in mid-August, and might now in line for some consistent playing time if Walsh does miss most or all of the remainder of the season.\nIn 2019, Ford burst onto the scene with 12 home runs and a .909 OPS over 163 PA as a rookie with the Yankees.  Since that initial breakout, however, he has scuffled to a .138/.267/.253 slash line in 206 PA since the start of the 2020 season, and the Yankees dealt him to the Rays in June 2021.  Ford also ended up heading to the Nationals on a waiver claim later in the 2021 season, making it quite a whirlwind of organizational change for the Princeton product in just 14 months&#8217; time.",

        "description": "Google has been hard at work turning Workspace and more specifically Google Chat into the next social network. Actually, it&#8217;s becoming more of an intranet with copious amounts of discoverability within your organization&#8217;s efforts and communications, but that&#8217;s neither here nor there. Chat Spaces have become a replacement for Google Currents (formerly Google+), and we continue to see more ways to interact with them.\n\n\n\nIn an update to its Workspace blog, Google just announced that it&#8217;s offering a new way to quickly find one of the growing number of Spaces available to you in your teams. While you do have a long list of Spaces directly in Chat, you will now be able to search for them directly in Gmail alongside queries for mail and messages.\n\n\n\nGoogle Workspace Updates Blog\n\n\n\nBy allowing this, the company wants to encourage users to be more connected and community-oriented in their hybrid workplaces. By simply typing a name or description, or any text that was entered into a specific Space into the Gmail search bar and hitting enter, you will be shown all matching results. In addition to showing things from Spaces you&#8217;ve already joined, you&#8217;ll also see content from discoverable and restricted spaces that you&#8217;ve been invited to.\n\n\n\nOver the next two weeks, this feature will become available to all Workspace customers, as well as those who still hold a legacy G Suite Basic or Business license. Sadly, it&#8217;s not yet coming to those with personal Google Accounts, but that&#8217;s alright. Aside from myself, I&#8217;ve yet to see a personal user with many Spaces on their account. For these types of people, it&#8217;s really useful for those looking to collaborate within their own family to meet their goals, but let me know in the comments what you use Spaces for!\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

But away from the spotlight, the aftershocks of a different breakthrough, in an Illinois court, may soon reverberate far beyond debates over superstar dalliances with the genre. After a long, hard-fought legal battle, the house music originators Larry Heard and Robert Owens have won the right to reclaim their music as their own.“It felt beautiful, and it gives me peace knowing that there is a clear road moving forward,” says Owens. “I’ve seen the destruction that often occurs in this music industry, so I feel blessed and grateful for all those that have been here in my life, helping me through this journey, who wanted to correct something wrong.” Continue reading...",

        "title": "Alder Lake-N Chromebooks may seriously leapfrog performance for affordable devices",
        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/alder-lake-n-chromebooks-performance-low-cost/",
        "description": "For years at this point, Chromebooks with Intel silicon inside have fallen on one of two sides of the coin: large core or small core.  That&#8217;s a simplistic way to put it, but in general, this is how we&#8217;ve seen Intel approach Chromebooks over the past 6 or 7 years.  As an example, as 4th-gen (Haswell) and 5th-gen (Broadwell) large-core Chromebooks launched, we had the small-core devices as well with Bay Trail and Braswell processors.  We moved on to Apollo Lake, Gemini Lake and now Jasper Lake in the affordable Chromebook segment, but it looks like things could change a bit on that front as 2022 comes to to a close.\n\n\n\nMaking sense of Alder Lake-N\n\n\n\nWhen we first started seeing signs of Alder Lake-N in the Chromium Repositories, we simply thought these chips would offer up a fanless, lower-power version of the very fast 12th-gen Alder Lake processors we have in a handful of Chromebooks at this point like the new Acer Chromebook Vero 514 and HP Elite Dragonfly Chromebook.  While that is technically true, there&#8217;s more to Alder Lake-N than simply being fanless versions of existing processors.\n\n\n\nTo be realistic, the &#8216;-N&#8217; in the name should have given us a bit of a clue as to what we should expect with these processors.  In the past, small-core Intel processors have come with &#8216;N&#8217; in the model name.  Looking at Jasper Lake processors, for example, we have models like the Celeron N4500, N5100, and Pentium Silver N6000.  See anything interesting in those model names?  \n\n\n\nFor years Intel has done this with their small-core chips, and Alder Lake-N is a clear call to this naming structure.  Where we&#8217;ve had differing names for large and small-core chips from Intel in the past, it looks like things could be changing with Alder Lake, unifying things around a single, generational code name and simply making large and small-core versions of the same over-arching chipset.\n\n\n\nAccording to a leak of Alder Lake-N chips, we are looking at small-core processors that should have big performance gains over the previous Jasper Lake generation of processors.  The chips look to still use Gracemont (small) cores, and there are configs with up to 8 of those in total along with an updated Xe-LP GPU from Intel.  With these better Gracemont small cores (the same small cores we see on hybrid Alder Lake large-core CPUs) and more of them, Alder Lake-N could combine better processing with the upgraded graphics performance to make affordable Intel chips go toe-to-toe with large-core processors released only a few years ago.\n\n\n\nFor Chromebooks, that&#8217;s a big deal.  We&#8217;ve said many times around here that the jumps in processing power for ChromeOS are less and less important as time passes.  ChromeOS is lightweight and unless you need extra power for Steam games or video editing, going back to something like a 10th-gen Intel Chromebook doesn&#8217;t really feel that much different than using a more-modern Alder Lake model.  That&#8217;s no knock to Intel: it&#8217;s just a testament to the speed of Chromebooks and ChromeOS.\n\n\n\nWith that in mind, having affordable processors that don&#8217;t need fans, perform at a high level, have great battery, and keep the overall cost of solid Chromebooks down to a minimum sounds like a real win in my book.  And consolidating large and small-core processors under a single generational name makes things feel far simpler to understand for general consumers.  \n\n\n\nWe&#8217;re tracking quite a few of these Alder Lake-N Chromebooks and now that we understand where they will position themselves, that makes sense.  There have been a ton of Jasper Lake Chromebooks released very quietly over the past year or so, but we knew a follow-up chip had to be on the way.  We&#8217;ve been waiting to see what that would be, and now it seems that Alder Lake-N is the answer.  \n\n\n\nIt will make it far easier to identify what generation small-core devices are in lock-step with the current large-core ones.  If the performance gains materialize like we think they will, Intel could be in a place to stave off the ingress of ARM-powered Chromebooks in the coming months.  As we get together a list of all the Alder Lake-N Chromebooks on the way, we&#8217;ll get a post out that at least makes a few attempts at identifying who is making a few of them. Stay tuned.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "If the most popular tax is the one levied only against the other guy — preferably a very rich other guy — Sen. Amy Klobuchar’s bill, Journalism Competition and Preservation Act, released Monday, comes close to perfection. The legislation isn’t actually a tax bill, but if enacted would ding the two top tech-media companies, Google and Facebook, for millions and perhaps billions of dollars a year that would go to the news industry. Klobuchar modeled her bill on Australia’s News Media Bargaining Code, which through a compulsory negotiation and arbitration set-up forces Google and Facebook to pay qualifying Australian news organizations (from both print and broadcast) about $150 million a year. The rationale behind the Australian shakedown and the proposed American one goes like this: News headlines and snippets on Google and Facebook have enabled the companies to convene mass audiences and abscond with billions in advertising revenues that were once the news industry’s near-exclusive franchise. This shift in advertiser preference from newspapers and TV to Google and Facebook has led to financial pain for many (but not all) news vendors. Given journalism’s high value as a public good, Google and Facebook must pay for the damage they’ve caused and help steer the news industry back to something close to the status quo ante. That’s the logic, at least. Though it might seem well-meaning, it also unfairly punishes one industry for the failures of another. And that’s not a recipe for good lawmaking. Few of us want the commercial tide to sweep the news business into the deep. Nor do many of us hold much sympathy for the over-rich, oligopolistic tech giants. And nobody thinks Google and Facebook will much miss the $2 billion one reporter estimates the two firms will end up paying annually to American newsies if the terms of the domestic arrangement parallels the Australian one. Google, after all, collected more than $200 billion in ad revenue last year. But the Klobuchar bill unjustly punishes the tech giants by making it prop up an industry that has largely failed to address its business problems and has been decaying for decades. It’s not clear whether these subsidies will restore the news business to health, and it appears likely that the act would serve as a prelude to direct government subsidies to save the news — another bad idea. Finally, the bill resembles a reparations package, which is unfair because the tech giants didn’t cause the news industry’s decline. They only contributed to it. It would be nice to blame all of the news industry’s problems on the tech behemoths, but the undoing of the newspaper industry began well before the web’s advent. Newspaper circulation’s per capita decline started in the post-WWII era, as did the industry’s share of ad spending, thanks to competition from radio and TV. Total advertising revenue peaked in 2005. Some savvy newspaper investors, like Warren Buffett, predicted the industry’s coming decline in 1992, a good half-decade before the commercial Internet was a thing. The newspaper audience and ad buyers had already begun migrating to other mediums, like TV and cable. One enduring myth of the Internet’s rise is that it caught the news industry by surprise. But that just isn’t so. The historical record shows that starting in the 1970s, they invested deeply and experimented widely on the electronic delivery of news and ads to homes (Viewtron, QUBE, Extravision, Gateway, Interchange, and many other systems) in hopes of inventing something like the web. What prevented them from dominating the electronic space was that the emerging, off-the-shelf technology and the open architecture of the Internet allowed open entry into the news and advertising market — no government licenses or big newsprint presses were required. Winning in this arena meant competing with all comers, and the news business proved to be a bad competitor. Google, which was founded in 1998, had the best ideas on how to sell ads in the space, and by 2012 its ad revenue surpassed that of the entire U.S. newspaper industry. The rise of Google and then Facebook did parallel the decline of newspaper revenues, but it would be a mistake to say one caused the other. As analyst Kamil Franek points out, Google and Facebook did not build their success by “stealing” newspaper advertising. They did it by disrupting the advertising universe with systems that allowed for more efficient and cheaper ways to attract prospective customers. For better than a century, the ad business had followed the dictum attributed to department store magnate John Wanamaker, “Half the money I spend on advertising is wasted; the trouble is I don’t know which half.” Internet advertising deflated Wanamaker’s wisdom by making it knowable which half was wasted. Web advertisers could finally measure the successes of their campaigns and refine where to advertise next. The web also proved to be a bargain for advertisers, as better and better ad performance became cheaper and cheaper: Total advertising as a percentage of GDP dropped 25 percent between the 1990s and the aughts. Google also created new places to advertise, such as on games and on smartphones. Benedict Evans, another analyst, holds that somewhere between two-thirds and three-quarters of Google and Facebook’s ad business came from companies that had placed no print advertising outside of the Yellow Pages. Although Klobuchar’s bill doesn’t use the word “reparations,” it proceeds as if Google and Facebook injured the news industry by taking something that rightfully belonged to them and should pay annual damages. We can concede that Google makes some money from news headlines and snippets — one independent analyst puts it at $1 billion a year while the news industry’s trade group says more like $4.7 billion. But as writer Frederic Filloux has put it, this is how the market works: Better and cheaper products replace what went before. In the Google and Facebook examples, the two companies did two things. First, they almost completely divorced advertising from editorial or entertainment content, making web ads more like billboards than newspapers. Second, they transformed advertising from a wasteful, crapshoot business that ran campaigns in newspapers, on TV and on billboards with almost zero feedback on effectiveness into an efficient, targeted enterprise whose success could be measured instantly. The analogy isn’t perfect, but what Google and Facebook did to the ad industry was transformative, akin to what digital cameras did to Kodak and personal computers did to typewriters. The newspaper industry had the resources to create something like Google or Facebook but didn’t. The onus for missing what was coming should fall on the news industry, not Google or Facebook. The news industry never had an inherent right to advertising dollars. To imagine they deserve any form of reparations because tech displaced them in the ad marketplace is laughable. The newsies can lament their losses all they want, but Google and Facebook owe them nothing. Sustaining the news business is a worthy goal. But sending the bill to Google and Facebook is simply unfair. ****** Don’t miss&nbsp;Bill Grueskin&quot;,&quot;link&quot;:{&quot;target&quot;:&quot;NEW&quot;,&quot;attributes&quot;:[],&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.cjr.org/business_of_news/australia-pressured-google-and-facebook-to-pay-for-journalism-is-america-next.php&quot;,&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-dae2-d9e7-ab9e-fbf335ef0002&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;33ac701a-72c1-316a-a3a5-13918cf384df&quot;},&quot;_id&quot;:&quot;00000182-dae2-d9e7-ab9e-fbf335ef0003&quot;,&quot;_type&quot;:&quot;02ec1f82-5e56-3b8c-af6e-6fc7c8772266&quot;}\">Bill Grueskin‘s excellent feature from earlier this year on the mechanics of the Australian system.

        "description": "As a state health secretary and a gay man watching the national response to the monkeypox outbreak, I’m upset. The recent spread of monkeypox in the United States has been understandably met by a public tired of new and deadly viruses after three years of the pandemic. Some want to throw up their hands and ignore the problem while others have turned to fear tactics and homophobia that our communities have struggled to move past. People are tired, angry and ready to move on. I get it. But being upset, focusing on missed opportunities and assigning blame isn’t the answer. And as with any communicable disease, the clock is ticking. We’ve got to work together to turn lessons learned from the Covid pandemic into a national response that works. As a nation, we must not ignore diseases as they spread around the world, because we know that viruses don’t respect political borders. We must demand that our elected leaders continue to make responding to these viruses a priority. It was alarming when Congress lost interest in funding our nation’s Covid response while the pandemic continued. And now, at a time when our underfunded public health workforce is exhausted, we must rally to confront yet another virus with monkeypox spreading throughout the nation. In responding to monkeypox we must be honest and transparent but cognizant of the risks and realities faced by LGBTQ Americans. We have already seen a resurgence of fear and hatred toward the LGBTQ community — fueling a stigma that can tie public health messaging in knots. Some worry that highlighting at-risk communities could lull others into a place of complacency, and that the simple association with the gay community could stoke acts of violence. The CDC lacks any reference to gender or sexual orientation on its webpage addressing monkeypox vaccination, but the data is clear: Gay, bisexual and other men who have sex with men (MSM) are currently at highest risk for becoming infected.    In North Carolina, our motto is “to be rather than to seem.” To me, that means get to work and continuously improve as you go. Before our first reported case on June 23, we were ready. We were prepared to test for monkeypox at our state lab, we gave guidance to healthcare providers and we planned for vaccine distribution. By July 6, limited doses of the vaccine began arriving and we had already set up regional vaccine locations around the state with local health departments. On July 14, we published a detailed response plan describing for providers, community organizations and the public our approach to testing, treatment, vaccination and sharing information. From the start, we were clear that data would drive our response and our message. We’ve published daily case numbers on our website, and as soon as we had sufficient numbers to protect privacy, we published demographic information about cases and vaccines. On Aug. 10, we released one of the first equity analyses in the nation, finding that while 70 percent of monkeypox cases in North Carolina were in Black men, less than a quarter of vaccines had gone to Black individuals. Our report offered key actions we and our partners in North Carolina are taking to improve, like working with party promoters to have vaccination events onsite. As North Carolina’s state health secretary, I care deeply about protecting people’s health. And to me, this is also personal.    Here are the five things we need most right now in our national response: First, data must drive the response. Anyone can get monkeypox, but right now nearly all cases are in men who report recent sexual contact with men. That’s why we must prioritize the MSM community, especially with the limited vaccine supply, while using empathetic messages to help destigmatize the disease. As we organize our operational response, it is non-negotiable for state health departments to collect and share detailed demographic data with the public, so that we can understand the impact on different communities and close equity gaps. Second, state and local health departments must partner with LGBTQ organizations to organize outreach to MSM, share information, answer questions and provide vaccines — fast. The city of Charlotte, the epicenter of North Carolina’s outbreak, celebrated Pride last weekend. I’m proud that we muscled together a partnership to deliver vaccines at the event, with support from all levels of government along with local organizations. This strategy can be replicated at other events and locations that serve the LGBTQ community. Third, more is needed from health care providers. Medical professionals should test anyone with unexplained sores or lesions, including those from outside the MSM community, so we can stay ahead of the spread of this virus. Providers should educate themselves about appropriate infection control protocols and navigate them with empathy and care for the patient, just as they would with other infectious diseases, such as strep throat. When a patient has monkeypox, be persistent to work through the current federal process to get treatment. And finally, to help get folks vaccinated faster, providers and clinics serving the MSM community can go through their medical records and proactively reach out to their patients eligible for the vaccine and offer them advice.  Access to vaccines needs to be fast, easy and confidential. Appointment scheduling must be online, not just by phone. Clinics must co-locate with other routine health services, so no one knows why someone is in line. Instead of asking a long list of invasive vaccine eligibility questions, just ask: “Considering all the criteria, do you qualify?” Fourth, while I’m encouraged that the federal government has declared monkeypox a public health emergency and assembled an experienced team to lead a national response, there are additional steps that the federal government needs to take. Start with cash. Making existing CDC Covid funding and FEMA disaster dollars available for monkeypox will allow states and localities to use the contact tracing and vaccine infrastructure that was built for Covid. HHS can issue a PREP Act emergency declaration to get pharmacists ready to vaccinate. We must also develop new test collection methods to move past painfully swabbing lesions and make those tests easier to use in mobile spaces and less reliant on health care staff. And of course, we need to continue to increase the supply of vaccines. TPOXX, an antiviral treatment for smallpox that is being used to treat monkeypox, can be very hard to get. I applaud the federal government for improving the process for obtaining it. They need to continue to tweak that process to make it easier for providers and patients to get it quickly. They must also work rapidly to build the data necessary to understand if TPOXX could be authorized for emergency use and deployed in normal channels. As long as the process remains cumbersome, many providers and patients will simply go without. Many people I know are scared, confused and being treated as diseases instead of human beings. People need help. Our workforce and healthcare system are tired and stretched. Our elected leaders in Congress need to refocus on bolstering our public health infrastructure. But we learned a lot over the past three years, and we have the tools and experience to successfully respond to this virus. For now, instead of playing the blame game, let’s get down to business.",

        "description": "Researchers have created engineered materials that &#8220;think.&#8221;\nThe work in the journal Nature, hinges on a novel, reconfigurable alternative to integrated circuits.\nIntegrated circuits are typically composed of multiple electronic components housed on a single semiconductor material, usually silicon, and they run all types of modern electronics, including phones, cars, and robots. Integrated circuits are scientists&#8217; realization of information processing similar to the brain&#8217;s role in the human body.\nAccording to principal investigator Ryan Harne, associate professor of mechanical engineering at Penn State, integrated circuits are the core constituent needed for scalable computing of signals and information but have never before been realized by scientists in any composition other than silicon semiconductors.\n\n&nbsp;\nHis team&#8217;s discovery revealed the opportunity for nearly any material around us to act like its own integrated circuit: being able to &#8220;think&#8221; about what&#8217;s happening around it.\n&#8220;We have created the first example of an engineering material that can simultaneously sense, think, and act upon mechanical stress without requiring additional circuits to process such signals,&#8221; Harne says. &#8220;The soft polymer material acts like a brain that can receive digital strings of information that are then processed, resulting in new sequences of digital information that can control reactions.&#8221;\nThe soft, conductive mechanical material contains reconfigurable circuits that can realize combinational logic: when the material receives external stimuli, it translates the input into electrical information that is then processed to create output signals.\nThe material could use mechanical force to compute complex arithmetic, as Harne and his team demonstrated, or detect radio frequencies to communicate specific light signals, among other potential translation examples. The possibilities are expansive, Harne says, because integrated circuits can be programmed to do so much.\n&#8220;We discovered how to use mathematics and kinematics—how the individual constituents of a system move—in mechanical-electrical networks,&#8221; Harne says. &#8220;This allowed us to realize a fundamental form of intelligence in engineering materials by facilitating fully scalable information processing intrinsic to the soft material system.&#8221;\nThe mechanical integrated circuit material translates mechanical force, such as squeezing, to electrical signals that produce computational results. (Credit: Kelby Hochriether/Penn State)\nAccording to Harne, the material uses a similar &#8220;thinking&#8221; process as humans and has potential applications in autonomous search and rescue systems, in infrastructure repairs and even in bio-hybrid materials that can identify, isolate, and neutralize airborne pathogens.\n&#8220;What makes humans smart is our means to observe and think about information we receive through our senses, reflecting on the relationship between that information and how we can react,&#8221; Harne says.\nWhile our reactions may seem automatic, the process requires nerves in the body to digitize the sensory information so that electrical signals can travel to the brain. The brain receives this informational sequence, assesses it, and tells the body to react accordingly.\nFor materials to process and think about information in a similar way, they must perform the same intricate internal calculations, Harne says. When the researchers subject their engineered material to mechanical information—applied force that deforms the material—it digitizes the information to signals that its electrical network can advance and assess.\nThe process builds on the team&#8217;s previous work developing a soft, mechanical metamaterial that could &#8220;think&#8221; about how forces are applied to it and respond via programmed reactions, detailed in Nature Communications last year. This earlier material was limited to only logic gates operating on binary input-output signals, according to Harne, and had no way to compute high-level logical operations that are central to integrated circuits.\nThe researchers were stuck, until they rediscovered a 1938 paper published by Claude E. Shannon, who later became known as the &#8220;father of information theory.&#8221; Shannon described a way to create an integrated circuit by constructing mechanical-electrical switching networks that follow the laws of Boolean mathematics—the same binary logic gates Harne used previously.\n&#8220;Ultimately, the semi-conductor industry did not adopt this method of making integrated circuits in the 1960s, opting instead to use a direct-assembly approach,&#8221; Harne says. &#8220;Shannon&#8217;s mathematically grounded design philosophy was lost to the sands of time, so, when we read the paper, we were astounded that our preliminary work exactly realized Shannon&#8217;s vision.&#8221;\nHowever, Shannon&#8217;s work was hypothetical, produced nearly 30 years before integrated circuits were developed, and did not address how to scale the networks.\n&#8220;We made considerable modifications to Shannon&#8217;s design philosophy in order for our mechanical-electrical networks to comply to the reality of integrated circuit assembly rules,&#8221; Harne says. &#8220;We leapt off our core logic gate design philosophy from the 2021 research and fully synchronized the design principles to those articulated by Shannon to ultimately yield mechanical integrated circuit materials—the effective brain of artificial matter.&#8221;\nThe researchers are now evolving the material to process visual information like it does physical signals.\n&#8220;We are currently translating this to a means of &#8216;seeing&#8217; to augment the sense of &#8216;touching&#8217; we have presently created,&#8221; Harne says. &#8220;Our goal is to develop a material that demonstrates autonomous navigation through an environment by seeing signs, following them, and maneuvering out of the way of adverse mechanical force, such as something stepping on it.&#8221;\nAdditional authors of the paper are from Penn State and the US Air Force Research Laboratory.\nHarne&#8217;s National Science Foundation Early Career Development Award and the US Air Force funded this research.\nSource: Penn State\nThe post New engineered materials can &#8216;think&#8217; appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Researchers have identified two compounds that are more potent and less toxic than current leukemia therapies.\nChemotherapy treatments generally have awful side effects, and it&#8217;s no secret that the drugs involved are often toxic to the patient as well as their cancer.\nThe idea is that, since cancers grow so quickly, chemotherapy will kill off the disease before its side effects kill the patient.\nThat&#8217;s why scientists and doctors are constantly searching for more effective therapies.\nThe newly identified molecules work in a different way than standard cancer treatments and could form the basis of an entirely new class of drugs. What&#8217;s more, the compounds are already used for treating other diseases, which drastically cuts the amount of red tape involved in tailoring them toward leukemia or even prescribing them off-label.\nThe findings appear in the Journal of Medical Chemistry.\n&#8220;Our work on an enzyme that is mutated in leukemia patients has led to the discovery of an entirely new way of regulating this enzyme, as well as new molecules that are more effective and less toxic to human cells,&#8221; says Norbert Reich, professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara.\nWhy chemotherapy is often so toxic\nAll cells in your body contain the same DNA, or genome, but each one uses a different part of this blueprint based on what type of cell it is. This enables different cells to carry out their specialized functions while still using the same instruction manual; essentially, they just use different parts of the manual. The epigenome tells cells how to use these instructions. For instance, chemical markers determine which parts get read, dictating a cell&#8217;s actual fate.\nA cell&#8217;s epigenome is copied and preserved by an enzyme (a type of protein) called DNMT1. This enzyme ensures, for example, that a dividing liver cell turns into two liver cells and not a brain cell.\nHowever, even in adults, some cells do need to differentiate into different kinds of cells than they were before. For example, bone marrow stem cells are capable of forming all the different blood cell types, which don&#8217;t reproduce on their own. This is controlled by another enzyme, DNMT3A.\nThis is all well and good until something goes wrong with DNMT3A, causing bone marrow to turn into abnormal blood cells. This is a primary event leading to various forms of leukemia, as well as other cancers.\nMost cancer drugs are designed to selectively kill cancer cells while leaving healthy cells alone. But this is extremely challenging, which is why so many of them are extremely toxic. Current leukemia treatments, like Decitabine, bind to DNMT3A in a way that disables it, thereby slowing the progression of the disease. To do this, they clog up the enzyme&#8217;s active site (essentially, its business end) to prevent it from carrying out its function.\nUnfortunately, DNMT3A&#8217;s active site is virtually identical to that of DNMT1, so the drug shuts down epigenetic regulation in all of the patient&#8217;s 30 to 40 trillion cells. This leads to one of the drug industry&#8217;s biggest bottle necks: off-target toxicity.\nClogging a protein&#8217;s active site is a straightforward way to take it offline. That&#8217;s why the active site is often the first place drug designers look when designing new drugs, Reich explains. However, about eight years ago he decided to investigate compounds that could bind to other sites in an effort to avoid off-target effects.\nLeukemia mutations\nAs the group was investigating DNMT3A, they noticed something peculiar. While most of these epigenetic-related enzymes work on their own, DNMT3A always formed complexes, either with itself or with partner proteins. These complexes can involve more than 60 different partners, and interestingly, they act as homing devices to direct DNMT3A to control particular genes.\nFormer graduate student Celeste Holz-Schietinger led early work in the Reich lab that showed that disrupting the complex through mutations did not interfere with its ability to add chemical markers to the DNA. However, the DNMT3A behaved differently when it was on its own or in a simple pair; it wasn&#8217;t to stay on the DNA and mark one site after another, which is essential for its normal cellular function.\nAround the same time, the New England Journal of Medicine ran a deep dive into the mutations present in leukemia patients. The authors of that study discovered that the most frequent mutations in acute myeloid leukemia patients are in the DNMT3A gene.\nSurprisingly, Holz-Schietinger had studied the exact same mutations. The team now had a direct link between DNMT3A and the epigenetic changes leading to acute myeloid leukemia.\nReich and his group became interested in identifying drugs that could interfere with the formation of DNMT3A complexes that occur in cancer cells. They obtained a chemical library containing 1,500 previously studied drugs and identified two that disrupt DNMT3A interactions with partner proteins (protein-protein inhibitors, or PPIs).\nWhat&#8217;s more, these two drugs do not bind to the protein&#8217;s active site, so they don&#8217;t affect the DNMT1 at work in all of the body&#8217;s other cells. &#8220;This selectivity is exactly what I was hoping to discover with the students on this project,&#8221; Reich says.\nThese drugs are more than merely a potential breakthrough in leukemia treatment. They are a completely new class of drugs: protein-protein inhibitors that target a part of the enzyme away from its active site.\n&#8220;An allosteric PPI has never been done before, at least not for an epigenetic drug target,&#8221; Reich says. &#8220;It really put a smile on my face when we got the result.&#8221;\nThis achievement is no mean feat. &#8220;Developing small molecules that disrupt protein-protein interactions has proven challenging,&#8221; notes lead author Jonathan Sandoval of the University of California, San Francisco, a former doctoral student in Reich&#8217;s lab. &#8220;These are the first reported inhibitors of DNMT3A that disrupt protein-protein interactions.&#8221;\nThe two compounds the team identified have already been used clinically for other diseases. This eliminates a lot of cost, testing, and bureaucracy involved in developing them into leukemia therapies. In fact, oncologists could prescribe these drugs to patients off label right now.\nWhat about long-term effects?\nThere&#8217;s still more to understand about this new approach, though. The team wants to learn more about how protein-protein inhibitors affect DNMT3A complexes in healthy bone marrow cells. Reich is collaborating with Tom Pettus, a chemistry professor at UC Santa Barbara and Ivan Hernandez , a joint doctoral student of theirs. &#8220;We are making changes in the drugs to see if we can improve the selectivity and potency even more,&#8221; Reich says.\nThere&#8217;s also more to learn about the drugs&#8217; long-term effects. Because the compounds work directly on the enzymes, they might not change the underlying mutations causing the cancer. This caveat affects how doctors can use these drugs.\n&#8220;One approach is that a patient would continue to receive low doses,&#8221; Reich says. &#8220;Alternatively, our approach could be used with other treatments, perhaps to bring the tumor burden down to a point where stopping treatment is an option.&#8221;\nReich also admits the team has yet to learn what effect the PPIs have on bone marrow differentiation in the long term. They&#8217;re curious if the drugs can elicit some type of cellular memory that could mitigate problems at the epigenetic or genetic level.\nThat said, Reich is buoyed by the discovery. &#8220;By not targeting DNMT3A&#8217;s active site, we are already leagues beyond the currently used drug, Decitabine, which is definitely cytotoxic,&#8221; he says, adding that this type of approach could be tailored to other cancers as well.\nAdditional coauthors are from UC San Francisco, Baylor College of Medicine, and UC Santa Barbara.\nSource: UC Santa Barbara\nThe post 2 compounds offer stronger, less toxic leukemia treatment appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlthough it remains illegal at the federal level, recent years have seen a growing number of states looking to legalize marijuana.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeveral of the provisions up for vote could expunge the records of those convicted of marijuana possession.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShould all measures pass, over half of the country will have legalized recreational marijuana use.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCome November, six states hope to join 19 others plus Washington D.C. and Guam in legalizing recreational use of marijuana.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSouth Dakota, Arkansas, Maryland, Missouri, North Dakota, and Oklahoma could all have ballot initiatives up for vote in the midterm elections. Should they all pass, half the country will have legalized adult recreational marijuana use at the state level.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe substance remains illegal at the federal level and is currently classified as a Schedule I drug, meaning “it has a high potential for abuse, no currently accepted medical use in treatment in the United States, and a lack of accepted safety for use under medical supervision,” according to the Drug Enforcement Administration.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNew research has revealed a growing number of young Americans report using marijuana and hallucinogenic drugs, while state marijuana legalization has been linked with a 20 percent increase in use frequency.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe substance is the most commonly used drug in the United States that is illegal at the federal level. Among states that have legalized the substance, data show the move is associated with fewer synthetic cannabinoid poisonings.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSouth Dakota&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSimilar to Washington D.C. the South Dakota initiative would not create a regulated commercial market, but would legalize both personal possession and home cultivation. However, dispensaries within the D.C. area have worked around regulations and the substance is technically allowed to be distributed for free as a gift.\n\n\n\nA previous amendment was introduced in South Dakota in 2020 to legalize the substance but was struck down by the state’s supreme court. The new proposal, Initiative Measure 27, would not establish a tax or regulatory structure for commercial sales, which would likely protect it from being derailed by lawsuits.\n\n\n\nArkansas\n\n\n\nAlthough the state’s Board of Election Commissioners rejected a recreational marijuana initiative this month, an advocacy group plans to repeal the decision to the Arkansas Supreme Court. The state voted in 2016 to legalize medical marijuana, and a petition to put recreational use on the November ballot garnered over 192,000 signatures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome commissioners in the state expressed concern about THC levels in edible products. Recent research has shown that increased potency of marijuna products is associated with rising rates of addiction and psychosis.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMaryland\n\n\n\nMaryland’s Marijuana Legalization Amendment is up for vote in November. Should it pass, the initiative would permit those 21 and older to legally use and possess marijuana beginning in July 2023. The state’s legislature would also subsequently pass laws for use, distribution, regulation, and taxation of the substance.\n\n\n\nAs the measure is a constitutional amendment, it would not need approval from the state’s governor to go into effect, while past convictions for any conduct made legal would be expunged.\n\n\n\nMissouri\n\n\n\nFollowing an announcement this month by Republican Secretary of State Josh Ashcroft, voters in Missouri will decide whether they want to amend the state’s constitution that currently bans possessing, consuming, delivering, manufacturing and selling marijuana.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShould it go into effect, home growers can receive a registration card, and, similar to Maryland’s proposal, those with nonviolent marijuana offenses on their record can petition to have them removed. Under the initiative, a 6 percent tax would be placed on sales.\n\n\n\nNorth Dakota\n\n\n\nNorth Dakota residents will also vote in November whether or not to legalize recreational marijuana use. A total of 23,368 valid signatures were amassed, clearing the 15,582 threshold needed to introduce a ballot measure. Under the measure, individuals age 21 and older could legally possess up to one ounce of cannabis. A regulatory system for marijuana businesses would also be established.\n\n\n\nHowever, under the new initiative public consumption of marijuana would be prohibited and a maximum of seven manufacturing facilities in the state would be allowed. The state legalized medical marijuana in 2016.\n\n\n\nOklahoma\n\n\n\nThis week, petitioners in Oklahoma gathered enough signatures to move State Question 820 forward, meaning it will likely end up on voters’ November ballots. However, the state’s supreme court has yet to approve the signatures. Once approved, opponents have 10 days to challenge the petition’s validity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf passed, the measure will legalize and regulate marijuana in the state. A 15 percent excise tax would be placed on recreational sales while money will go toward Oklahoma schools, health care and local governments.&nbsp;",

        "description": "As America’s children start getting back to school this month, our country needs a grown-up conversation about public education’s future. The odds of having one this fall are slim.\n\n\n\nIt’s more likely that the midterm election campaign will intensify today’s noxious trend toward politicizing public schools. That’s reprehensible, because our children, who suffered severe learning losses and emotional stress during the pandemic, deserve better than to be treated as hostages in the nation’s vitriolic culture wars.\n\n\n\nRepublicans, who seem to be at war with all of America’s public institutions, are the worst offenders. But Democrats aren’t blameless, and even as they fend off the right’s demagogic attacks on public schools, they need to come to grips with the valid reasons why parental frustration is boiling over.\n\n\n\nPublic faith in the K-12 system is approaching an all-time low. Only 28 percent of Americans express confidence in their schools. Many parents have been voting with their feet — public school enrollment has dropped by about 1.4 million students since the pandemic began.\n\n\n\nRepublicans see political gain this fall in fusing parents’ anger over school closings and learning losses with conservative bugaboos like mask and vaccine mandates, critical race theory and classroom discussions of race and gender. That’s the formula Glenn Youngkin used last year in making education the galvanizing issue of his successful race for governor in Virginia.\n\n\n\nAbout a quarter of Virginia voters named education as their top issue, after the economy. Youngkin, who branded his campaign events as “parents’ rallies,” won these voters by 15 points. That helped him carry independents as well as Virginia’s suburbs, reversing former President Trump’s losses the year before.\n\n\n\nSince then, red-state legislators have passed a slew of “parents’ rights” laws aimed at restricting classroom about race, sexual orientation and gender identity. And GOP governors with presidential ambitions, notably Florida’s Ron DeSantis, routinely stoke conservative white parents’ anger at “woke” school authorities.\n\n\n\nAcross the country, normally soporific school board meetings are erupting into screaming matches, and board members are targeted for online abuse, including death threats. Previously low-key elections for school superintendent suddenly are becoming hotly contested arenas of partisan conflict.  \n\n\n\nThe volatile new politics of education poses a dilemma for Democrats, who historically have dominated the issue.\n\n\n\nAccording to a recent survey by Impact Research, by a 47-43 percent margin, U.S voters now trust Republicans over Democrats to handle education issues. The GOP lead is bigger among parents (9 points) and voters of color (10 percent).\n\n\n\nAnother survey by the American Federation of Teachers found Republicans have a narrow (39-38) advantage on education in seven key battleground states with competitive elections. \n\n\n\nBoth polls show that, by enormous margins, voters want schools to concentrate on teaching math and reading rather than race and gender issues. The striking finding here – which may come as a shock to liberals – is that U.S. voters think Democrats are more fixated on these issues than Republicans.\n\n\n\nHow can Democrats regain public trust on education and keep our schools from becoming a culture war killing field?\n\n\n\nFirst, by focusing on the fundamentals of learning. They should challenge school authorities around the country to accelerate the pace at which students regain lost ground and make sure poor and minority students don’t fall even further behind.\n\n\n\nOver the past year, younger students have made up about a quarter of reading and math learning they lost when schools closed. But older students are recovering more slowly, and low-income and Black and Hispanic students also are struggling to catch up.\n\n\n\nSecond, by reclaiming the Clinton-Obama mantle of public-school reform, unwisely discarded by the Biden administration and congressional Democratic leaders.\n\n\n\nThe party establishment seems locked in a marriage of political convenience with an outdated K-12 system run by change-averse district school bureaucracies and powerful teachers’ unions. But parents want more than a return to the status quo pre-COVID-19.\n\n\n\nThe best way to blunt the GOP education offensive is to offer restive voters a progressive vision for reinventing public schools for the digital age. Drawing on the well-documented success of public charter schools, which performed more nimbly during the pandemic and saw their enrollment grow, Democrats should call for expanding parental choice, shifting decisions from central offices to school leaders, and shutting  down schools that chronically fail their students.\n\n\n\nThey also should push for closing the international achievement gap between U.S. students and their counterparts overseas, especially in China. And to ease the transition from school to work, U.S. high schools need to do a better job of exposing students to careers and creating work-study opportunities with local employers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThird, by forcefully rejecting the cultural left’s attempts to suppress free expression and discredit America’s founding ideals, which are all that holds this pluralistic, multiethnic democracy together. Their illiberal brand of identity politics is the mirror image of the right’s white ethnic nationalism, and just as damaging to our country.\n\n\n\nOn abortion and other issues, our country is in danger of splitting into separate red and blue zones where conflicting laws and social mores hold sway. We can’t let that happen to public education.\n\n\n\nOur children need to know the true history of the nation — both its sins and its contributions to human progress. Bigotry, discrimination and injustice are part of the American story; so are unceasing struggles to overcome them and extend the blessings of individual freedom, civic equality and democratic self-government to all citizens.\n\n\n\nThis is what we should teach kids in school. Today’s cultural warriors want to indoctrinate by telling kids what to think; our public schools should expose kids to facts and reasoned arguments and help them learn how to think for themselves.\n\n\n\nWill Marshall is president and founder of the Progressive Policy Institute (PPI).",

        "description": "Crowds started filling the Minnesota State Fairgrounds on Thursday morning, as the fair begins its 12-day run.Whether they&#x27;re there to exhibit livestock, catch a concert or try some of the dozens of new food and drink concoctions, hundreds of thousands of people are expected to attend this year&#x27;s Great Minnesota Get-Together.There was a long line at the Snelling Avenue gates before they opened Thursday. Jordan Johnson, a lifelong Minnesotan from Newport, was first in line this year, arriving at the gates 12 hours before the fair opened.He was there ahead of Ginger Johnson of Apple Valley — no relation — who&#x27;s long been a regular at the head of the line.Jordan Johnson said he decided to rise to the challenge this year.&quot;I just love the fair, and I found out that Ginger over here — a couple years ago I saw her in (Green Bay) Packer garb, and I thought, &#x27;That&#x27;s not right, for a Packer fan to be the first into the Minnesota State Fair.&#x27; So I was like, &#x27;I gotta beat her one of these years.&#x27; So I made it work this year.&quot;Circulating among the crowds early Thursday morning were a number of politicians, including Gov. Tim Walz.Walz said the eagerness of the crowd, to get back to a near-normal state fair, was palpable.&quot;I just really felt that sense of community, camaraderie. It wasn&#x27;t a lot of ... politics or anything like that; it felt more like neighborliness. &#x27;How you been? How&#x27;s the lake?&quot; And you can hear people in line who didn&#x27;t know one another, talking like that. ... We&#x27;re all out there together.&quot;The fair has adjusted its hours a bit this year, opening an hour later — at 7 a.m. each day — and closing an hour earlier, at 11 p.m. Entrance gates will close at 9 p.m.That may help cover for a number of open positions that officials were still scrambling to fill in the days leading up to the fair.The fair as well as Metro Transit, Southwest Transit and the Minnesota Valley Transit Authority are offering park-and-ride options from more than three dozen sites around the metro area.It remains to be seen just how far the fair&#x27;s attendance will climb back toward its pre-pandemic heights.The fair drew a record 2.1 million people in 2019, then was canceled due to COVID in 2020. Last year — with some pandemic restrictions still in place — the fair drew about 1.3 million visitors.",

        "description": "D.C. Attorney General Karl Racine (D) filed a notice of appeal Thursday to revive the antitrust case against Amazon that a judge dismissed earlier this year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe lawsuit, first filed in 2021, alleges Amazon has used its position as a giant in the e-commerce field to maximize profits at the expense of consumers, third-party sellers and wholesalers. It accuses Amazon of using anticompetitive practices by keeping third-party sellers from offering lower-cost proxies for products elsewhere. \n\n\n\nA judge dismissed the case in March in an oral ruling.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’re appealing the lower court’s decision because District consumers deserve a fair marketplace that promotes competition, innovation, and choice,” Racine said in a statement. “And we’re filing this appeal because the antitrust laws and the facts are on our side—and on the side of District residents. We look forward to making our case before the Court of Appeals.”\n\n\n\nThe appeal is Racine’s latest attempt to push the first government-led antitrust case against Amazon forward. In April his office filed a motion asking the court to reconsider the ruling.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) also urged the court to reconsider the decision to dismiss the case. DOJ attorneys wrote in an April filing that if “left uncorrected, the Court’s ruling could jeopardize the enforcement of antitrust law by improperly raising the bar on plaintiffs challenging anticompetitive contractual restraints in the District of Columbia.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Amazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The company has previously pushed back on the allegations in the lawsuit.&nbsp;",

We will take all necessary measures to defend our people,” he continued.\n\n\n\nCENTCOM said Wednesday evening that several rockets landed inside the perimeter of Mission Support Site Conoco at around 7:20 p.m. local time. Shortly afterward, rockets landed in the vicinity of Mission Support Site Green Village.\n\n\n\nOne service member was treated for a minor injury and was returned to duty at Conoco. Two others were under evaluation for “minor injuries,\" though it was unclear where they were located.\n\n\n\nU.S. forces responded to the attack, destroying three vehicles and equipment used to launch some of the rockets.  \n\n\n\nNo group claimed responsibility for the attack, but CENTCOM said Wednesday that initial assessments indicated that “two or three” suspected Iran-backed militants who conducted one of the attacks were killed during the U.S. response.",

        "description": "Australia’s massive 2020 “Black Summer” bushfires, which injected nearly a million tons of soot and other particulate into the stratosphere, strengthened and prolonged a spinning hole in the ozone above Antarctica, a new study finds.\n\n\n\nThe blazes around New Year 2020 were particularly large, giving birth to what a paper published on Thursday in Scientific Reports described as a massive “smoke infused thunderstorm.”\n\n\n\nOne such storm created a vortex that maintained shape for two months, making a 20-mile vertical conduit into the upper atmosphere, where sulfates and other burning byproducts were funneled, causing the air to absorb more heat.\n\n\n\nThe results were more like a massive volcanic eruption than a wildfire, the study said, adding that the last such warming event was the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. But they also had a contradictory, cooling impact — which helped give new strength to an old environmental threat. \n\n\n\nThe ozone layer, which shields the Earth from solar radiation, is a high-altitude belt marked by a higher than usual presence of oxygen molecules bound together in a distinctive bipod shape by the constant battering of photons from the sun. \n\n\n\nAn unusual and strangely stable “hole” in the ozone above Antarctica reached near record proportions in the period before the fires — and stuck around unusually long after them.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat Antarctic hole, which is in fact an area of lower ozone concentrations,&nbsp;is&nbsp;the same one that aroused alarm in the 1980s, leading to the banning of the refrigerant chemicals choloflorocarbons under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe layer is not expected to fully recover until 2041.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy 2021, the hole had grown to larger than average&nbsp;— reaching the size of North America, the U.S. government said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe study released Thursday argues the bushfires were to blame by disrupting a complex relationship between high altitude ozone layers and the polar vortex.\n\n\n\nThe polar vortex is a spinning seasonal system of storms above the poles that in essence keeps the cold in, according to the 2015 Encyclopedia of Atmospheric Sciences. Like a rider on a bicycle, the faster it moves, the more stable it is. \n\n\n\nIts usual spring breakdown precedes the transfer of the polar weather system from a winter state of cooling to a summer state of warming, the Encyclopedia said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe breakdown of ozone by chemicals that the bushfires released helped delay the normal seasonal collapse of the vortex — which&nbsp;in turn helped keep the existing ozone hole in place longer than usual. &nbsp;",

        "description": "Fires are consuming about twice the amount of forest they did two decades ago, according to research from the University of Maryland published in the journal Frontiers in Remote Sensing. \n\n\n\nResearchers found that compared to the turn of the 21st&nbsp;century, forest fires cause about 3 million more hectares of tree loss, approximately the landmass of Belgium. In 2021, forest fires accounted for about a third of tree cover loss, burning 9.3 million hectares worldwide, according to the study.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlthough climate change is not the sole factor in forest fires or their intensity, it is a major driver of conditions that make them more likely to spread out of control. Warmer temperatures contribute to reduced snowpack and drier conditions, leading to a feedback loop when the bigger fires produce more greenhouse gas emissions. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMuch of the recent coverage has focused on the particularly intense forest fires in the U.S., where more than 6 million acres —&nbsp;predominantly in the West — have burned so far this year. However, amid a sweltering European heatwave this summer, French forests have seen unprecedented&nbsp;fires this summer that burned more than 3,000 hectares in July in the southern part of the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe fires are triggering more intense climate reactions in another way as well: About 70 percent of tree cover loss since 2001 is in boreal, or northern, regions, and the losses have grown by about 3 percent during that period, or about half the worldwide increase, according to the University of Maryland study. Boreal forests are considered carbon sinks, or net absorbers of carbon, but the trend threatens to reverse this until they eventually emit more than they take in.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThose forests are major receptacles of underground carbon reserves, particularly in the permafrost that has not historically been at this level of risk of melting. Russia alone lost 5.4 million hectares of tree cover last year, a 31 percent increase compared to the year before, the study found.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/immigration/3615258-is-the-border-crisis-an-invasion/",
        "description": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott claims that President Biden’s failure to faithfully execute the immigration laws enacted by Congress has violated Article IV, § 4 of the U.S. Constitution, which provides that “[t]he United States  . . .  shall protect each [State in this Union] against Invasion.”  \n\n\n\nThe border crisis hit a new record in May 2022, which saw the largest number of illegal border crossers along our southern border since CBP began keeping track in 2000, and these unprecedented numbers are overwhelming local communities across Texas.\n\n\n\nAbbott has decided to attempt to exercise his state’s authority under Article I, § 10 of the U.S. Constitution to protect itself against an “invasion” of undocumented migrants at the Southwest border.\n\n\n\nClause 3 of Article 1 § 10 states:\n\n\n\n“No State shall, without the Consent of Congress, lay any Duty of Tonnage, keep Troops, or Ships of War in time of Peace, enter into any Agreement or Compact with another State, or with a foreign Power, or engage in War, unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.” (Emphasis added)\n\n\n\nThe Supreme Court has held — in the mid-1800s — that the phrases “unless actually invaded” and “in such imminent danger” refer to an invasion or the threat of an invasion by a foreign enemy, “indians,” or pirates.\n\n\n\nIt would be quite a stretch to apply that interpretation to this situation.\n\n\n\nBut the courts may do it anyway.\n\n\n\nIt’s reasonable to expect states to be able to protect themselves when a president releases more than a million migrants — about whom little if anything is known — into the country. \n\n\n\nGov. Abbott isn’t the only one who is concerned. Ipsos recently announced poll results which indicate that more than half (54 percent) of American adults believe it is at least somewhat true that we’re experiencing an invasion at the southern border (40 percent of the Democrats, 76 percent of the Republicans, and 46 percent of the independents).\n\n\n\nAnd 42 percent of American adults believe that it is at least somewhat true that the Biden administration is implementing an open border policy at the southern border (29 precent of the Democrats, 63 percent of the Republicans, and 37 percent of the independents).\n\n\n\nRecord-breaking numbers\n\n\n\nThe border patrol has encountered more than 1.8 million illegal crossers at land borders in fiscal 2022, and there are still two months left to go in the fiscal year. That number is higher than the entirety of illegal crossers in fiscal 2021, when the border patrol encountered nearly 1.7 million illegal crossers. The highest number of encounters in the four previous fiscal years was 859,501 in 2019.\n\n\n\nCatch and release\n\n\n\nIn May, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CPB) released 95,318 migrants into the United States that it had encountered at the Southwest border, bringing the total of illegal migrant releases under the Biden administration to 1,049,532 — which is a population larger than the number of residents in the president’s home state of Delaware.\n\n\n\nAndrew R. Arthur has observed that, “There were 496 days between Jan. 21, 2021 (the day after the inauguration) and May 31, 2022... DHS released — on average — 2,115 illegal migrants per day throughout that period.”\n\n\n\nBut is it an invasion?\n\n\n\nPhilip Bump, a national correspondent for the Washington Post, questions whether the border crossings can be considered an invasion. The migrants are stopped when they try to enter the United States, and the ones who are released are released on parole or alternatives to detention to wait for a hearing. Moreover, most of the migrants who are released show up for a hearing before an immigration judge.\n\n\n\nHe would have a good point if DHS maintained control over the released migrants, but that’s not the case.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEven if Bump is right that most of them appear for their hearings, “most” is not good enough when more than a million are released into the country: At past rates, more than 400,000 of them won’t appear at their hearings.\n\n\n\nAnd what difference does it make that many of them appear at their hearings if some of the ones who receive a deportation order abscond after their hearings.\n\n\n\nThe end-to-end enforcement lifecycle approach that CBP used in its Fiscal Year 2020 Enforcement Lifecycle Report (report) provides a more realistic measure, and it indicates that catch and release border policies don’t work.\n\n\n\nThe report describes the final or most current outcomes — as of March 31, 2020 — associated with the 3.5 million encounters with illegal border crossers and inadmissible migrants between 2014 and 2019. Overall, only 59 percent of their cases had been resolved through a final outcome of repatriation or relief from removal. Repatriations occurred in 1.8 million cases (51 percent) versus 1.7 million cases (49 percent) that had no confirmed departure, including the 284,000 cases in which the migrants were granted relief or other protection from removal (8.1 percent).\n\n\n\nDetention matters\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, 42 percent of the migrants remained in custody between their initial encounter and a final enforcement outcome. These migrants were repatriated 98 percent of the time, with only 0.5 percent receiving relief or other protection from removal and 1.5 percent remaining unresolved as of March 31, 2020.\n\n\n\nIn contrast, migrants who were not detained after their initial encounters were repatriated only 30 percent of the time, with 15 percent granted relief and 55 percent unresolved; 40 percent of the unresolved cases were still being processed, and 11 percent were subject to unexecuted removal orders.\n\n\n\nThat was then, and this is now\n\n\n\nI think the results are likely to be worse now.\n\n\n\nMany more undocumented migrants are being released, and the numbers are likely to double when the Title 42 order is terminated, which is inevitable. Approximately 1.7 million (53 percent) of the 3.2 million illegal crossers the Border Patrol has apprehended at the Southwest border during the Biden administration were expelled pursuant to that order.\n\n\n\nAlso, the wait for a hearing is much longer now. As of the end of July, the immigration court backlog was more than 1.8 million cases, and the average wait for a hearing was 818 days.\n\n\n\nIf you don’t want to call this an invasion, what would you call it?\n\n\n\nMore to the point: If it’s not an “invasion” under current interpretation of the law, what recourse should states have to limit the flood of undocumented migrants being released into their territories?\n\n\n\nNolan Rappaport was detailed to the House Judiciary Committee as an Executive Branch Immigration Law Expert for three years.

        "link": "https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/retail/coud-retail-search-benefits/",
        "description": "Cloud Retail Search, part of Discovery Solutions For Retail portfolio, helps retailers significantly improve the shopping experience on their digital platform with ‘Google-quality’ search. Cloud Retail Search offers advanced search capabilities such as better understanding user intent and self-learning ranking models that help retailers unlock the full potential of their online experience.Google Cloud’s Discovery Solutions For Retail are a set of services that can help retailers improve their digital engagement and are offered as part of our industry solutions.Executive SummaryRetailers are always working on trying to keep up with the ever changing consumer expectations and trying to forecast the next trend that can impact sales and revenue. The pandemic brought its own (and largely new) set of challenges which further complicated the issue over the last two years. The retailers were forced to adapt to the new consumer (low physical touch) behavior in which the browsing and product research was largely digital (endless aisle) and accelerated other trends such as buy online and pick up in stores (BOPIS), curbside pick up and pick up lockers. According to a McKinsey Global Survey from early last year, the pandemic has accelerated the pace of digital transformation by several years. The National Retail Federation (NRF) estimates that retail sales are expected to grow between 6% and 8% in 2022 (slower growth rate than in 2021), as consumers spend more on services instead of goods, deal with inflation and higher food &amp; gas prices due to geopolitical disruptions in the world. And the competition continues to be fierce as ever. Amazon continues its dominance in the U.S. retail world and new PYMNTS data shows that Amazon’s share of US Ecommerce sales hit an all-time high of 56.7% in 2021.Customers now have more choices than ever on how they want to engage with the retailers, where they want to spend the money and make their purchase. They also have increased expectations from the retailers around providing a high quality product discovery experience, which is forcing the retailers to invest heavily on improving customer engagement on their digital platforms to boost conversion rate and overall customer loyalty.This is where Retail Search can help by providing an enhanced search experience that uses Google-quality search models to understand the customer intent and takes into account the retailer's first party data (such as promotions, available inventory and price) for ranking results.How is Google Cloud Retail Search DifferentThe Ecommerce platform on-site search use case is not new and retailers have been trying to solve it effectively for the last two decades.  Most retailers recognize that search is a critical service on the platform and have spent countless resources to improve and fine tune it over the years. Yet the challenge remains. According to a Baymard Institute study in late as 2019, 61% of sites still required their users to search by the exact product type jargon the site uses. However, users now expect the same robust and intuitive search features as is offered by Google.com and other popular web platforms, who seem to have the uncanny ability to intelligently interpret and yield relevant results to complex search queries.Google's decades of experience and research in search technology benefits Cloud Retail Search solution and that is what differentiates it from the competition. Advanced Query Understanding: Retail Search can provide more relevant results for the same query due to better query understanding features and knowing when to broaden or narrow the query results. While most search engines still rely largely on keyword based or matching tokens results, Retail Search has the advantage of being able to leverage Google search algorithms to return highly relevant results for product listings and category pages. Semantic Search: Intent recognition is a key requirement for semantic search and identifying what the customers mean when they enter the query is a key strength of Retail Search. This is critical for retailers since this has a direct impact on Clickthrough rate, Conversion rate and the Bounce Rate.Personalized Search Results: Another key differentiator for Retail Search is its ability to leverage user interaction data and ranking models to provide hyper personalized search results. Retailers are able to optimize search performance to deliver desired outcomes: better engagement, revenue, or conversions. Self-Learning and Self-Managed Solution: Retail Search models get better over time because of the self-learning capabilities built into the solution. In addition, the service is fully managed, which saves precious resources needed to keep it running and managing its set up.Strong Security Controls: The service runs on Google Cloud and follows security best practices to keep our customers’ data secure. Google never shares model weights or customer data across customers using the Retail API or other Discovery Solution products. For more details about this data use, see a description of Retail API data use.High Level Conceptual ViewHere is a simplified high-level view of Retail Search API. Retailers can call the API for the given search query and get back the results which can then be displayed on their digital properties.The returned results contains two types of information:Search results: Query search results including product listings and category pages based on advanced query understanding and semantic search.Dynamic faceted search attributes: Faceted Search is a feature that allows further refinement of the search by providing ways to apply additional filters while returning results. Retail Search needs the following datasets as input to train its machine learning models for search:Product Catalog:  Information about the available products including product categories, product description, in-stock availability, and pricing.User Events: This is the clickstream data that contains user interaction information such as clicks and purchases.Inventory / Pricing Updates: Incremental updates to in-stock availability and pricing as that information is updated.(Keeping the product catalog up to date and recording user events successfully is crucial for getting high-quality results. Set up Cloud Monitoring alerts to take prompt action in case any issues arise).Retailers also have the ability to set up business/config rules to customize their search results and optimize for business revenue goals such as Clickthrough rate, Conversion rate, Average size order etc.How to get startedRetail Search is generally available now and anyone with a Google cloud account can access it. If you don’t already have an account, you can start with a trial account for free here.Establish a Success Criteria: It's important to establish a success criteria for measuring the effectiveness of Retail search. Get a consensus on which factor(s) you want to include in scope for measuring the effectiveness of Retail Search. This could include one or two from the following: Search Conversion Rate, Search Average Order Value, Search Revenue Per Visit and Null Search Rate (No Results Found).Initial Set Up: Create a Google Cloud Project and set up the Retail API. When you set up the Retail API for a new project, the Google Cloud Console displays the following three panels to help you configure your Retail API project:Catalog: displays product catalog and a link to import catalog.Event: displays user events and a link to import historical user events.Serving configs: contains details on serving configuration and a link to create a new serving configuration.Measuring Performance: Retail dashboards provide metrics to help you determine how incorporating the Retail API is affecting the results. You can view summary metrics for your project on the Analytics tab of the Monitoring &amp; Analytics page in Cloud Console. Set up A/B Experiments: To measure the performance of Retail Search with another search solution, you can set up A/B tests using a third-party experiment platform such as Google Optimize.Summary:As retailers try to navigate through the post-pandemic world where supply chain failures and digital transformation acceleration are major focus areas, they now also have to keep a close eye on the recent geopolitical challenges resulting in rising inflation and costs.While we can all agree that in-store shopping will continue to be a major source of revenue, it is also important for retailers to tweak the in-store experience for the digital world. Trends such as buy online and pick up in stores (BOPIS), curbside pick up and pick up lockers are here to stay.Given all the above, consumer engagement and digital experience is more important now than ever before. The cost of search abandonment is way too high and has both short and longer term impact. Retail Search is a great solution to help reduce churn, improve conversion and retention. It provides Google-quality search models to help understand customer intent and the retailers have the ability to set up business/config rules to optimize search results for business revenue goals such as Clickthrough rate, Conversion rate and Average size order.Related ArticleShoppers know what they want.

        "link": "https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/infrastructure-modernization/ecommerce-strategies-to-connect-customers/",
        "description": "Editor's note: Today's blog comes from Luke O'Connell, Head of Data and Technology at Danone. He shares the ways in which using commercetools deployed on Google Cloud is helping Danone to connect more directly with consumers and better understand their needs.With the rise of large eCommerce players and rapid home delivery, here at Danone we're seeing big changes in the way that consumers need our products to reach them. They want to be able to connect with brands and purchase products more directly, especially when traditional commerce channels become unavailable. Using commercetools deployed on Google Cloud, we're making the most of this opportunity to develop and deploy new digital and hybrid commercial models, whether that be digital sampling services for healthcare products, subscription services for water or the delivery of goods directly for our infant nutrition brands. Solving consumer goods shortages by connecting directly In 2013, we experienced how important being able to connect directly with consumers can be, when increased demand for our products in China led to shortages of our baby formula brands across Europe. Accessing food for their babies was an emotive issue for parents, and we needed to find a solution quickly to enable them to buy direct. We chose commercetools as the right solution for Danone because of its flexibility and its MACH-based cloud-native approach. This enabled us to get eCommerce solutions ready to deploy across multiple markets within weeks. When the COVID-19 pandemic arrived in 2020, consumers were once again faced with empty shelves in-store as their shopping habits were disrupted on a much larger scale. As we were already working with commercetools, we could easily deploy direct-to-consumer solutions by simply adding a cart function to our existing brand websites. And, because commercetools on Google Cloud is able to powerfully scale to meet demand, we didn't have to worry about spikes in traffic causing sites to crash.  Leveraging data to better understand consumer needsOne of the key reasons we chose to work with commercetools on Google Cloud was because the commercetools team understood we needed more than just a shopping cart. While there are many eCommerce vendors focused only on increasing sales, we wanted a flexible solution that helps us to add value and helps us to learn more about our customers.In the UK, Danone's healthcare division is deploying commercetools to enable its B2B consumers to order medical samples directly. Not only does that make the process easier for consumers, it's also helping Danone to gather important data on who its consumers are, and how they use its products.Connecting commercetools with Google Cloud enables us to collect and analyze this sampling data, as well as stream it into other software to help our reps in the field tailor their conversations with healthcare professionals. When it comes to data and the value this can unlock, we have been able to fully understand our consumers' journeys, which has previously been a challenge for us as a Consumer Packaged Goods company; we would normally rely on third-party data such as that acquired through POS or loyalty cards.Creating a tailored solutionOur choice of commercetools deployed on Google Cloud is part of a significant shift towards modular technologies that are enabling us to pick and choose the most effective components to suit our requirements. We've also recently created local digital transformation teams to integrate technology and data fully alongside business strategy. This is helping us to really understand the specific features we need to connect directly with our consumers, building and extending platforms that reach them quickly and easily.  commercetools is a next-generation headless enterprise commerce platform that enables customers to easily integrate game-changing features and functionality to their commerce sites. It's now available via Google Cloud Marketplace, offering brands and retailers deeper product integration, unified billing and an expanded go-to-market relationship, making it easier for customers to select Google Cloud as the cloud platform to drive their business growth with commercetools.",

        "link": "https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/introducing-virtual-machine-threat-detection-to-block-critical-threats/",
        "description": "Today we are delighted to announce that our unique, first-to-market detection capability with Virtual Machine Threat Detection (VMTD) in Security Command Center is now generally available for all Google Cloud customers. We launched this service six months ago in public preview and have seen a lot of enthusiasm from our customers. We’ve seen adoption from users around the world and in every industry. For years, we have said security must be engineered in, not bolted on. By baking this capability into our virtualization stack we are living up to our promise of delivering invisible security.  Our team has been busy scaling the service, refining our detection capabilities, and preparing our next major feature set. VMTD in general availability has been scaled to support significantly more frequent scanning across a tremendously large number of instances. Scaling the scanning of memory from the Google Cloud Compute Engine (GCE) fleet has posed unique challenges, and we’ve invested in caching scan results to enable more frequent scans of smaller – but more important – sections of memory. For customers, enabling VMTD is as easy as checking a box in their Security Command Center Premium settings. They consistently report that this is a game-changer compared to the challenges associated with third-party agent deployment. Because VMTD is deployed from the hypervisor, rather than inside the instance, our instrumentation is not as exposed to adversaries as are traditional endpoint detection and response technology (EDR) agents. This is an invisible-to-adversaries approach: they can not detect when we scan. By enabling VMTD, our customers have activated protection against millions of compute instances with a few simple checkboxes, and without using compute overhead.Deploying VMTD to Cloud customers has uncovered multiple attacks, and a few surprising false positives. In one example, our YARA rules detected a customer’s antivirus agent as mining cryptocurrency because that nameless agent happened to resolve a lot of mining pool domains as part of its protection scheme. Our YARA rules are developed in collaboration with the best of Google's threat intelligence community, drawing on expertise from Google's Threat Analysis Group as well as Google Cloud Threat Intelligence. As a cloud-native managed service, we’re always on the lookout for these cases and work hard to improve our service for all customers. With this release we are thrilled to announce that in addition to detecting mining on a particular instance, we now can–in the vast majority of instances–identify and report on the specific process that is engaged in mining activity. VMTD is now able to deeply understand the Linux kernel to report specific details about the threat execution we’ve observed without an agent inside the instance. This can enable easier triage, investigation, and response to our detection. In the academic literature of virtual machine introspection, understanding kernel data structure meaning from hardware contents is known as “bridging the semantic gap.” With this release, VMTD can bridge this gap and prove that insights useful to security teams can be pulled from the contents of memory for any given virtual machine.In the future, we plan on further improving VMTDs understanding of Linux kernels to detect additional advanced attacks and report live telemetry to our customers. With its unique position as an outside-the-instance observer, VMTD can detect rootkits and bootkits, attacks that tamper with kernel integrity and otherwise blind the kernel and EDR to their presence. We are delighted with the progress we’ve made on detecting the most common threats in Cloud computing environments. If you’re interested in trying out our service, navigate to the settings page of Security Command Center Premium and turn on Virtual Machine Threat Detection.

        "description": "The Rockies have reinstated right-hander Chad Kuhl from the 15-day injured list.  To create roster space, the team also announced that righty Robert Stephenson has been designated for assignment.\nStephenson is in his second season in Colorado, after being acquired from the Reds back in November 2020.  After being a top prospect during his time in the Cincinnati farm system, Stephenson never caught on as a starting pitcher but showed promise as a reliever in 2019.  He built on that production in 2021, when he posted a 3.13 ERA, 26.4% strikeout rate, and 9.1% walk rate over 46 innings out of Colorado&#8217;s bullpen.\nThe 2022 season has been a different story, as Stephenson has struggled to a 6.04 ERA over 44 2/3 frames.  While his 97mph average fastball velocity still puts him among the game&#8217;s hardest throwers, opposing batters have been crushing Stephenson&#8217;s four-seamer to the tune of a .379 batting average.  With only average secondary pitches and a lot of hard contact being allowed, Stephenson&#8217;s production has fallen off, especially in the last few weeks.  The righty has allowed at least one earned run in seven of his last nine appearances, with an ugly 10.24 ERA over his last 9 2/3 innings.\nSince Stephenson is out of minor league options, the Rockies had no choice but designate him for assignment in order to move him down to Triple-A.  Since Colorado already had an open 40-man roster spot to accommodate Kuhl&#8217;s return, the club didn&#8217;t strictly have to DFA Stephenson, so it is possible the Rox might be parting ways with him altogether.  A waiver claim from a rival team is a distinct possibility, as Stephenson&#8217;s velocity and fastball spin rate could interest other clubs.\nFor Kuhl, he hasn&#8217;t pitched since August 3 due to a hip strain.  The right-hander pitched well over the first three months of the season, but had a 10.17 ERA in the 25 2/3 innings and six starts prior to his IL placement.",

        "description": "It&#8217;s not easy&#8230;\nText and Photographs by Boysenberry45\nHow green is that pond? Very green, in the case of the Central Park Pool, near the west side entrance to the park at 100th Street, because it&#8217;s covered by duckweed (aka water lentils).\nA high-protein source of food for waterfowl, these simple plants have no stems or leaves – they are merely a few cells around an air pocket which enables them to float effortlessly atop fresh water.\n\nThey are spread by waterfowl and proliferate when water levels are low, reducing water evaporation while also providing shade for frogs and turtles. Think again if you are not in favor of this bright green blanket on the water – it absorbs excess nitrogen and phosphates, prevents algae from growing (which would be odorific), and slows mosquito breeding. Amazingly, Mother Nature has perfectly timed this neon-green water bloom to coincide with summer molting for many ducks.\nTime for a wardrobe change.\nDid you ever wonder where all of the beautiful mallard ducks went during the summer? They are still here, but in &#8220;eclipse plumage&#8221; during their summer molt, a labor-intensive process during which worn-out feathers are replaced. Much as the sun is eclipsed by the moon, the brightly colored plumage is eclipsed by dull brown replacement feathers. Beginning with their vibrant wing feathers, ducks lose all of their feathers at once, rendering them flightless for about one month each summer. The first feathers to return are dully colored and provide protective cover for the flightless ducks to swim incognito, making it difficult to distinguish between males and females, too.\n\nThe duck weed is a high protein food (higher in protein than soybeans) that helps fuel the regrowth of the ducks&#8217; feathers. It&#8217;s messy for the pond’s residents, sticking to everything and coating them like an oil slick, but not dangerous. In Southeast Asia, resourceful humans also enjoy this delicacy.",

According to the Pew Charitable Trusts, a non-profit outfit, state governments saved $217.1bn in 2021, exceeding the 2019 record by nearly $100bn.&#8221;\n&#8220;Why the bonanza? An influx of federal dollars during the pandemic spared states from spending savings. Sales-tax revenues soared as federal stimulus cheques, tax credits and unemployment benefits gave people money to spend. Inflation helped, too. Not only did it boost the price of goods, which increased sales-tax revenues; it also raised salaries, in nominal terms, moving people into higher tax brackets.&#8221;\n&#8220;Although the average state carries a debt of $3,641 per resident, none seems to be using its excess revenue to pay off what it owes. Instead, after replenishing rainy-day funds, states are playing with taxes&#8230; Thirty-three states and Washington, dc, have passed some sort of tax relief.&#8221;",

Exam board Pearson said there were 5,700 students who didn’t receive their grades for level two BTecs alongside GCSE results as scheduled on the morning of 25 August, plunging them into uncertainty over where they will be studying next year. This follows thousands of pupils failing to receive results for their level three BTecs from Pearson, and Cambridge Technicals from the exam board OCR last week. Pearson said the delays were due to problems with entries not meeting the “qualification criteria”, making them “ineligible” for grading.David Hughes, the chief executive of the Association of Colleges, urged Ofqual to launch “a full, thorough and open investigation into what went wrong to make sure this never happens again”.

When it causes severe illness, it can lead to bronchiolitis (inflammation in the small airways in the lungs) or pneumonia (infection in the lungs), in children under the age of 1, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There are a few companies working on RSV vaccine candidates, and Pfizer in particular has announced results from their phase 3 clinical trials of their version called RSVpreF.\n\n\n\nPfizer announced that their new RSV vaccine candidate is more than 85 percent effective in preventing severe lower respiratory tract illness in older adults, according to a statement on the company's website. They define severe illness as three or more symptoms. The vaccine candidate is more than 66 percent effective at preventing illness overall, defined as two or more symptoms. The company tested this vaccine candidate in about 37,000 people ages 60 and older and are looking to recruit a total of 40,000. \n\n\n\nImportantly, it targets the two main strains of the virus, giving broader protection. \n\n\n\n\"We are delighted that this first bivalent RSV vaccine candidate, RSVpreF, was demonstrated to be efficacious in our clinical trial against this disease, which is associated with high levels of morbidity and mortality in older adults,\" said Annaliesa Anderson, who is the senior vice president and chief scientific officer for vaccine research and development at Pfizer, in the statement. \n\n\n\nThis vaccine could help a lot of people. Worldwide, RSV is suggested to be the reason for hospitalizations of 336,000 older adults each year, resulting in 14,000 deaths, according to a study from 2020. \n\n\n\n“Scientists and researchers have worked to develop RSV vaccines with little success for over half a century,” Anderson said in the statement. “These findings are an important step in our effort to help protect against RSV disease, and we look forward to working with the FDA and other regulatory agencies to make this vaccine candidate available to help address the substantial burden of RSV disease in older adults.\" ",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/3615456-deadly-heat-to-surge-by-2100-even-with-emissions-reductions-study/",
        "description": "Much of the world will face a significant uptick in deadly heat waves by the end of the century, even if countries manage to meet their agreed-upon emission reduction goals, a new study has found.\n\n\n\nSuch heat events will be three to 10 times more common in 2100 than they are today in the U.S., Western Europe, China and Japan,&nbsp;regardless of efforts to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), according to the study, published in&nbsp;Communications Earth &amp; Environment&nbsp;on Thursday.\n\n\n\nAs part of the Paris climate agreement that was signed at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference, participating countries agreed to adhere to this limit, with hopes of keeping the increase to an even smaller 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\n\n\nTo improve their chance of success, each nation submitted its own climate action plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions. But the authors of Thursday’s study fear that these efforts will be insufficient to drive down heat.\n\n\n\n“The record-breaking heat events of recent summers will become much more common in places like North America and Europe,” lead author Lucas Vargas Zeppetello, a doctoral student at the University of Washington at the time of the study, said in a statement.\n\n\n\n“For many places close to the equator, by 2100 more than half the year will be a challenge to work outside, even if we begin to curb emissions,” added Vargas Zeppetello, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University.\n\n\n\nVargas Zeppetello and his colleagues evaluated projections for the future “heat index,”&nbsp;a combination of air temperature and humidity that measures the impact of heat on the human body.\n\n\n\nA “dangerous” heat index is defined by the National Weather Service as 103 degrees Fahrenheit, the authors explained. Meanwhile, an “extremely dangerous” heat index is 124 degrees Fahrenheit and is considered unsafe to humans for any amount of time.\n\n\n\n“These standards were first created for people working indoors in places like boiler rooms — they were not thought of as conditions that would happen in outdoor, ambient environments. But we are seeing them now,” Vargas Zeppetello said.\n\n\n\nThe scientists said they used a probability-based method to calculate a range of future possible scenarios, by combining historical data with population projections, economic growth and carbon intensity.\n\n\n\nThey observed that even if countries met their Paris agreement commitments, the U.S., Western Europe, China and Japan would cross the “dangerous” heat index threshold three to 10 more times than they do today by the end of the century.\n\n\n\nIn this same scenario, the tropics could see their “dangerous” days double —&nbsp;covering half the year, according to the study.\n\n\n\nAnd in a worst-case circumstance  —&nbsp;a scenario in which emissions remain unchecked until 2100 —&nbsp;“extremely dangerous” conditions could become common in countries near the equator, such those in sub-Saharan Africa and in India, the authors determined.\n\n\n\n“These are frightening scenarios that we still have the capacity to prevent,” Vargas Zeppetello said. “This study shows you the abyss, but it also shows you that we have some agency to prevent these scenarios from happening.”",

        "description": "California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) on Thursday announced a $100,000 donation to the campaign of Rep. Charlie Crist, who earlier this week secured the Democratic nomination to take on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) in November's general election.\n\n\n\n\"Time to make Ron DeSantis a one-term governor. I'm pledging $100k right now to @CharlieCrist. Who will join me in helping Charlie become the next Governor of Florida?\" Newsom tweeted.\n\n\n\nCrist on Tuesday won Florida's Democratic gubernatorial primary to take on DeSantis, who is seeking a second term. The Cook Political Report rates the race \"likely Republican,\" meaning the election analysis site predicts DeSantis is likely to win reelection.\n\n\n\nThe donation is the latest shot at Florida by Newsom, who has in recent months taken on a more national profile and spurred speculation about potential White House aspirations.\n\n\n\nNewsom in July launched a new ad, which aired on Fox News, targeting DeSantis and GOP lawmakers over a wave of legislation in the state targeting LGBTQ rights, voting rights, “critical race theory” and abortion.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I urge all of you living in Florida to join the fight, or join us in California, where we still believe in freedom — freedom of speech, freedom to choose, freedom from hate and the freedom to love,” Newsom says in the ad.\n\n\n\nDeSantis is widely viewed as a potential presidential candidate in 2024, and he has polled particularly well in instances where former President Trump is taken out of the prospective field. He has earned plenty of media attention and praise from conservatives with legislation targeting discussion of sexual orientation in the classroom and most recently suspended a local prosecutor who did not enforce the state's abortion ban.",

        "description": "Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee and former Rep. Beto O’Rourke released his first ads of the general election campaign cycle on Thursday, focusing on Texas’s stringent abortion restrictions on the same day the state’s trigger law takes effect.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOne ad shows a series of women blaming Gov. Greg Abbott (R), O’Rourke’s opponent,&nbsp;for the&nbsp;law, stating that they are no longer free to make decisions about their own body and noting that the law does not include exceptions for cases of rape or incest.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Women will die because of it,” the ad states. “All because of Greg Abbott’s abortion law.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ad states that O’Rourke “will give women our freedom back.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnother ad shows a wife, identified as a lifelong Democrat, and a husband, identified as a lifelong Republican, saying that Abbott’s abortion law is the “most extreme” in the country.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe wife references a University of Texas at Austin poll that showed only 11 percent of respondents said they supported providing no exception in cases of incest. The poll also showed that only 13 percent said they supported no exceptions in cases of rape.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is a free country,” the husband says. “We need a governor who gets that.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Texas Tribune reported that the ads will air in seven markets during a Houston Texans preseason NFL game on Thursday and a Dallas Cowboys game on Friday.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Abbott's campaign pointed to an ad and release accusing O'Rourke of not supporting any limitations on abortion, including third-trimester abortions.\n\n\n\nTexas previously had a six-week abortion ban in effect since before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in June.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe trigger law only permits exceptions to save the life of the mother and makes performing an abortion otherwise a felony. Doctors who perform them can face up to life in prison.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nO’Rourke’s ads come as Democrats may be seeing increased enthusiasm from their voters in the aftermath of Roe’s overturn.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrat Pat Ryan won a special election for New York’s 19th Congressional District on Tuesday in what was considered a possible bellwether race for the November midterm elections. Ryan campaigned heavily on abortion rights in the swing district, while his Republican opponent focused on the economy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats are hoping passion to defend abortion rights can help them avoid or minimize the historical trend that usually sees the president's party lose seats in Congress during the midterm elections.\n\n\n\n—Updated at 12:59 p.m.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/cybersecurity/3615343-as-governments-shun-ransomware-payments-cyberattacks-may-cost-taxpayers-even-more/",
        "description": "Rather than pay $20 million in ransom to a Russian hacking gang that took dozens of government and public entities offline for two months, Costa Rican officials sought other options. As the local economy reportedly bled about $30 million a day, much of it in lost productivity, Costa Rica set out to restore each attacked ministry, one at a time. Efforts are ongoing.\n\n\n\nThe response stands in sharp contrast to most other attacks on public entities, which — often on advice of their insurers and in a rush to restore public confidence — pay ransom because they determine it costs less and takes a shorter amount of time than other efforts to recover data or rebuild a system. In the last couple of years, the University of California paid hackers a ransom of $1.14 million; the city of Riviera Beach, Fla., handed over $600,000; and the town of Lafayette, Colo., made a $45,000 ransom payment. And the list goes on.\n\n\n\nIn fact, nearly half of the world’s government entities paid ransom in 2021, compared to just 32 percent of financial institutions. The average payment was $214,000, although many say it’s higher. That is a lot of taxpayer money being used to pay off hackers.\n\n\n\nBut the potential costs of these attacks are about to get higher.\n\n\n\nIn order to remove incentives for attacking amid the growing outcry of spending taxpayer money on ransom, some U.S. states have outlawed it, with more likely to do so. This is tied to the trend of companies in the private sector not publicly reporting ransomware attacks or payment of ransom, partly out of concern that it could further motivate future attackers, and also because victimized companies often don’t want law enforcement officials involved.\n\n\n\nBanning ransom payments makes sense as far as removing motivations for hackers. But at the same time, if ransom fades as an option, government and public entities could end up paying more to mitigate an attack, as the case of Costa Rica shows. Another example comes from Israel, where a public hospital was banned from paying ransom, but still reportedly had to spend about $11 million of taxpayer and state money mitigating an attack last year.\n\n\n\nRather than focus on banning ransom payments, governments and public institutions need to be doing more to shield taxpayers from cyber attack expenses. And the answer does not lie in requiring increasingly expensive cyber security insurance or increased post-attack transparency.\n\n\n\nGovernments and public entities need to be smarter about the efforts and resources they commit to strengthening resiliency. They need to follow the model that the private sector is increasingly embracing, mainly following a real-world risk-based approach to defense in addition to complying with government or industry standards.\n\n\n\nGovernments and other public institutions, like libraries, schools and medical centers, should carry out regular risk quantification and cost of breach assessments, and be able to put a dollar value on cyber exposure, just as many companies do. This allows them to see how much taxpayer money and assets are at risk, to make sure they are spending in the right places to truly increase security, and to budget accordingly in case of an attack.\n\n\n\nTo make the best decisions about what to protect, government and public entities need to be engaging in constant threat hunting, in order to identify and respond to emerging threats, and testing their security with ethical hacking. The public deserves to know that its tax dollars are used efficiently and effectively when it comes to cybersecurity spending.\n\n\n\nBecause attacks are inevitable, there needs to be a well laid out cyber response plan, in terms of incident response, training and simulation, including how to achieve a comprehensible status report within the required time and how to best communicate with the press.\n\n\n\nThis part of an attack — and the valuable amount of time and public money spent on it — is actually in the hands of the victim, and should be as efficient and effective as possible. If done well, this stage of response can also help the organization better defend against future attacks.\n\n\n\nIn addition, government agencies and branches need to have their data and activities under a central defense structure. For example, organizations need to comply with standards put forth by CISA, but CISA also needs to better understand each sector and where it fits into the overall cybersecurity landscape, and what needs protecting in order to implement an effective defense.\n\n\n\nThe recently enacted State and Local Government Cybersecurity Act, which is designed to improve coordination between CISA and state and local governments, allowing them to share tools, procedures, and information more easily, is a step in the right direction. Another new law, The Cyber Workforce Program Act, which allows U.S. federal cybersecurity and IT workers to rotate roles and jobs across government agencies, will also help in developing a more centralized approach. But other tax-funded or public infrastructure — such as hospitals, schools, and utilities — that are not directly part of the government need to be fully included in such agreements and other cyber security mandates.\n\n\n\nWhile these new federal initiatives are admirably aimed at improving cybersecurity, more needs to be done in terms of protecting the public from the costs of attacks.\n\n\n\nAt this point, the public and the government are asking more of companies when it comes to responsibility and accountability for cybersecurity. For example, proposed new SEC regulations seek to increase cybersecurity disclosures to shareholders. We should also be asking more of governmental and public entities themselves — especially as paying ransoms fades as a legal or ethical option.\n\n\n\nElad Leon is a cyber intelligence analyst and senior CTI expert at cyber security firm CYE.

        "link": "https://www.mprnews.org/story/2022/08/25/math-and-reading-proficiency-continues-to-drop",
        "description": "Updated: 4:35 p.m. | Posted: 10:27 a.m.New state test data released Thursday, shows the majority of Minnesota students are below state proficiency standards in math, and just over half are proficient in reading — a sharp decline since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. Just under 52 percent of students met or exceeded reading standards — a drop of eight percentage points since schools moved to distance learning at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Fewer than 46 percent of students statewide met or exceeded math standards — a drop of 10 percentage points from 2019.  Minnesota schools were far less able to give students of color what they needed to learn than white students. Test scores revealed deep inequities along lines of race, English language learner status and household income. This year’s North Star Accountability test scores are pulled from 2022 Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments (MCAs) and the Minnesota Test of Academic Skills (MTAS used for some students with disabilities).  The state department of education has identified 371 schools, including 15 entire school districts for training and support over the next three years based on their results from standardized tests, graduation rates and attendance, among other indicators. “We know our schools are in need of ongoing support as they work to meet our students where they are now and take them to where they need to be by the end of this school year,” Education Commissioner Heather Mueller said in a statement. “That’s why MDE is strengthening our partnership with school communities to provide them with the support they need so all students can have the successful school year they deserve.” Schools identified for support will get training from MDE and its Regional Centers of Excellence with guidance on the science of math and reading instruction. There’s also an emphasis on social and emotional learning and training, which many Minnesota students and educators have indicated has been a real and increasing challenge. “It builds not only a repository of best practices, but also helps to provide the professional development in real time in the settings of the schools and in partnership with school leaders,” Mueller said. “(It) gives us the opportunity to partner deeply with our schools, to meet them also where they are and help them move to where they need to get to.” In St. Paul, cautious optimismIn St. Paul, Minnesota’s second largest district, there were slight gains across the board in 2022 MCA test scores, compared to 2021. Thirty-five percent of students showed proficiency in reading — up 2 percentage points from 2020-21, but down 5 percentage points from 2018-19. Only a quarter of St. Paul students tested as proficient in math — a gain of 4 percentage points from 2020-21, but down from nearly a third of students in 2018-19. “We’re cautiously optimistic because we did see some increases — not back to pre-pandemic levels, so there is still a lot of work to do. But we’re hoping that this is the first sign of what we hope is an upward trend,” said Stacey Gray Akyea, Chief of Equity, Strategy &amp; Innovation for St. Paul Public Schools.  St. Paul has been using COVID-19 relief dollars to help students with academic recovery. Gray Akyea says one strategy that’s been helpful is funding an extra reading teacher in elementary — often third grade classrooms and some middle school classrooms. “All they do are small group instruction on things that students need,” Gray Akyea said. “That is kind of on our watchlist for something that could be extremely effective.”The district is also focusing on specialists who can help students with targeted math instruction. And they’re shifting their approach to credit recovery, hoping that making those interventions flexible and timed during the school day will help more students graduate. St. Paul, like other Minnesota districts, struggles to equitably instruct students. Gray Akyea said the problem is systemic and the solution also needs to be systemic with attention to enrollment, school supports and staffing among other priorities.“The pandemic was very hard on all of our students. Some students (fared) much worse than others. What we have to do as a system is understand the systemic inequities that exist in our district, in our schools and classrooms, in meeting rooms and hallways, and at the same time we’ve got to learn to provide the wraparound in the core and the intervention that is very specific to the needs of the learner. It’s very, very difficult, but it’s something we need to continue to work toward,” Gray Akyea said. InequalitiesMinnesota’s education system has some of the worst gaps in the country between white students and students of color. This year’s test results continued to show those gaps — sometimes by dozens of percentage points. “For many, this data is likely to be a wake-up call,” said Matt Shaver, who’s policy director at EdAllies, an education advocacy group. “Students and educators have faced an ongoing uphill battle due to everything from health to staffing combining to create another challenging year.” Editor’s Note (Aug. 25, 2022): A previous version of this report contained incomplete data on scores.

        "link": "https://smashingmagazine.com/2022/08/error-messages-ux-design/",
        "description": "When we design interfaces, we rarely think about error messages first. After all, how much is there to design anyway? We highlight the error, display a message, and nudge users toward the correct input. As it turns out, a strategic and thorough design of these messages can be critical for businesses, especially if they struggle with high abandonment. Error messages can make or break the experience in situations when things go south.\nErrors are everywhere, and so are error messages. They are of course common in web forms, but also in complex tables, incompatible filters, search queries and failed interactions. They can be small error notes and large error summaries; short tooltips and lengthy toast messages. So, where do we start? From the beginning.\nThis article is part of our ongoing series on design patterns. It’s also a part of the upcoming 4-weeks live UX training 🍣 and will be in our recently released video course soon.\n\nNot All Error Messages Are Equal\nNot all errors are the same. As Page Laubheimer has noted, there are actually two different types of errors. Slips occur when users intend to perform one action but do another (e.g., when filling in a form on autopilot). Mistakes occur when there is a mismatch between the mental model of a user and the system. Our interfaces need to support both types of errors, and slips are usually much easier to resolve than mistakes.\n\nFor slips, we can include helpful constraints (e.g. a reasonable width of a text box, prefixes and suffixes), provide recovery suggestions (e.g. autocomplete), choose reasonable defaults, and use forgiving formatting.\nTo prevent mistakes, we need to confirm destructive actions (when users go back to the previous page), set expectations early on (password requirements or file size), allow users to change their minds (change email or payment method), and in general, always provide a way out.\nTo measure the success of our error messages, we can define error-focused design KPIs and track them over time. These could include:\n\nthe average number of mistakes in a user journey,\nthe error recovery time,\nthe completion rates, and\n– completion times.\n\nWe can’t really eliminate mistakes altogether since no human input can be bulletproof, but we can reduce the number of errors by making it more difficult to make mistakes. One simple way of doing so is to improve the discovery errors, by never relying on the color of error messages alone.\nNever Rely On Red Color Alone\nWhen we think of error messages, we almost subconsciously think of bold red text errors. That’s indeed a very established pattern, but often not enough to indicate to all users that something is wrong.\n\nDue to color vision deficiencies, it’s a good idea to always complement error messages with an icon, e.g., a large exclamation mark on a red background — right next to the error message. We can also highlight the entire section, along with the field, label, the hint, the error message and the input field. For example, a thick red vertical line next to the error message is a common pattern for error messages on Gov.uk.\n\nSometimes the icon is displayed inside of the input field, on the right or on the left edge of the text box. When we display the icon on the right, users who zoom in and out might have difficulties spotting them. That’s why placing the icon on the left edge seems to be just a bit more reliable.\n\nAdditionally, it might be a good idea to guide users towards specific issues of the form with an error summary. That summary can contain links to the areas in the form which contain errors, so users can jump there directly.\nThe summary can appear on the top of the page, or just above the action button, as displayed in the example above.\nMost importantly, error summary probably shouldn’t appear under the action button. Too often, especially on mobile, users don’t realize that there is any error message at all, and keep clicking on that poor submit button hoping to get any kind of feedback — be it a status update from the browser, or a change of the URL. The feedback is actually there, under the button, yet in testing, it often shows very poor discovery rates.  \nIf the page is fully refreshed upon validation, the error summary should be at the very top of the page. But if the page is updated without a refresh, it’s reasonable to add the error summary just above the action button where the user has just clicked or tapped — and highlight it with the red color and icon as well.\nAvoid Auto-Scrolling and Auto-Jumps\nOnce a user clicks on the submit button, should we automatically scroll them to the first error? There is no clear answer to that question. Personally, I saw this pattern working very well for some users, but failing miserably for others.\nAny sudden movements on the page are likely to cause frustration with at least some users. If anything, users tend to find auto-jumps more annoying than auto-scrolling — as the latter at least communicates the direction of change and hints better at where users have moved to.\nShort answer? Start without auto-scrolling and display just an error summary with links. If it’s too slow, or doesn’t work as expected, consider adding auto-scrolling. And by no means move users up and down the page for no obvious reason — that’s a safe way to increase completion times and introduce confusion when it’s probably not needed.\nNever Cover User’s Input\nWhen we display error messages, we convey to users that there is a problem; a good error message, however, also guides users to a solution. This, however, requires the ability to consult the error as the error is being fixed. In other words, users should be able to edit the input field while also reviewing the error message(s) provided to them.\n\nSo far, so good. However, things become quite complicated once we also have a tooltip in play. Once a tooltip is open, users might lose sight of both the error message and the input. Should they desire to be able to see all three pieces of information at once, they’d be out of luck.\n\nHowever, we can fix it relatively easily. First of all, we avoid tooltips that open on hover and display the tooltip only once tapped or clicked. That means that a tooltip will never disappear automatically and must be closed manually.\nThen, we use the details component and inline accordions as an alternative to tooltips. Hence, we make space for the content of the tooltip to expand between the label and the other content, so nothing will be covered. The error message would be visible at all times as well, next to the input field.\n\nThis way, we show all three pieces of information at the same time — and users always have a choice to select what exactly they’d like to see. Is it too much? Maybe. But that’s a great option to keep in mind: at least to always display the input field and the error at the same time without them being covered by the tooltip.\nIn Forms, Display Error Messages Above Input\nNow, this might sound a little bit confusing at first. Usually, error messages will be sitting conveniently under the input field, or perhaps — less frequently — on the right side of the input field. As it turns out, there are a few accessibility issues that come as a cost of these conventions. \n\nUsers of a magnifying software might miss the error message when it’s located on the right.\nOn mobile, users might not be able to see the error message under the input because it will be covered by the virtual keyboard.\nWhen editing input, error messages might be covered by the browser’s autofill or dropdown’s autocomplete suggestions.\n\n\nDisplaying error messages above input fields typically helps us avoid the accessibility issues listed above. The cost of it, though, is layout shifts: with every new error appearing dynamically, the entire form has to shift vertically as we need to make space for the error message to appear. It might be noisy, but sometimes that noise might be very much worth it.\nFor lengthy error messages, it might sound tempting to display them as a tooltip, yet with it come all the usability issues discussed in the previous section. Using a collapsible accordion instead might be a better idea there.\nIn Tables, Display Error Messages Inline\nWhen displaying error messages in tables, it might be a good idea to consider alternative approaches as otherwise we would end up with a lot of layout shifts for each row.\nOne of the simpler patterns is to display the error message in the same row where the content lives. In that case, the error message is more likely to live under the input field, not above it. Lengthy error messages could be collapsed and expanded with a tap/click on the entire row.\n\nIf the same error affects multiple rows, we might want to highlight the rows that contain errors and display an error message at the very top of the page that would explain the error and what needs to be done to fix it.\n\n\nDon’t Rely On Toast Error Messages\nBut what about good ol’ toast error messages? Those animated notifications, informing users about change of status of the system with floating messages. They might be uncommon for forms, but they frequently appear in tables and enterprise dashboards.\n\nThere are a few common usability issues with toast error messages:\n\nUsers often don’t get a chance to fully read or understand the error message before it has disappeared, and there is no way to restore it or keep it floating. \nToast messages typically appear on the edges of the screen, and usually, it’s quite far away from the problematic input that has caused the error. There is quite a disconnect between the error message and the input, and it’s rarely possible to read the error message and correct the mistake simultaneously.\nLengthy toast messages usually block large areas of content that a user might be relying on — and potentially even the input that has caused the error.\nToast messages need to be announced to screen reader users while also allowing users to bring their focus back and forth between the error message and the erroneous input.\nWith toasts, we usually don’t have enough space to provide a detailed help using images or videos, and have to rely on plain text and links leading to external help pages that would usually open in a new tab.\n\n\nIf anything, toasts should be persistent if displaying information that can be acted upon, and users should be able to manually dismiss the notification.\nPersonally, I’d definitely stay away from designing error messages as toasts, even if they are persistent. The better we can connect an error with its cause visually, the less likely it is to be overlooked. And the better we can explain how to solve that error close to the erroneous input box, the faster users will understand what they need to do.\n\nAllow Users To Override An Error Message\nWe’ve all been there before: full of hope and passion, you type in your shipping address in an eCommerce checkout, willing to proceed with payment right away. Yet here it comes, an aggressive address validator, telling you that your address is wrong, and you better double check it. You have been living at that address for the last five years, yet for some reason, that’s not good enough for the address validator.\nWhat options do you have? Unless you are willing to deliver the item to another address, this problem will likely cause a 100% abandonment — an extremely high price to pay for a poor address validator. Surely you don’t want to deliver an item to non-existing addresses, yet you don’t want to abandon customers either. Indeed, it might be that only a small portion of customers will be affected by it, but why should we lose these customers either?\n\nNo single validation library is 100% reliable and bulletproof for all the edge cases. Eventually some percentage of your customers will be left out there in the woods, trying to figure out what to do next to proceed.  Aggressive validators cost money. Especially when they come in tandem with disabled buttons that literally block users without telling them what exactly needs to be done to fix the issue. \nFor cases when a validator might be too restrictive, we can allow customers to override validator’s warning. Surely we will get some wrong addresses as a result of that. But as a business, we need to measure just how much money we are losing due to increase in service desk inquiries vs. how much money we gain by allowing people to find a way to proceed even although the interface doesn’t want to play along. More often than not, it’s worth it.\nWhile this pattern works flawlessly for address input and telephone input, it probably won’t work for any input that needs to follow a particular convention — such as the length and checksum of an IBAN number or a credit card number. There, instead of giving customers a carte blanche, we need to meticulously check user’s input and guide them towards what exactly the problem seems to be.\nEstablish Stop-Words For Your Error Messages\nMany error messages in most web applications are remarkably generic. They do indicate errors, but they aren’t very helpful in indicating solutions on how to fix these errors. Most of the time, these messages don’t really refer to the specifics of the user’s input. They provide a very general statement explaining that the input is wrong, with plenty of floral and cryptic words along with it.\nIn my personal experience, starting a project off by exploring and defining error messaging can be a very valuable exercise. If we can convey friendliness and personality while being concise and helpful in our error messages, we should surely be able to achieve the same in our navigation, body copy and form labels. In many ways, the way we write error messages can help us figure out just the right voice and tone of the entire design.\n\nDepending on your product’s voice and tone, you might want to be very strategic about how your error messages should sound. Here are some of the stop-words that Gov.uk tends to avoid in their interface:\n\ntechnical jargon like ‘form post error’, ‘unspecified error’, and ‘error 0x0000000643’;\nwords like ‘forbidden’, ‘illegal’, ‘you forgot’, and ‘prohibited’;\n‘please’ because it implies a choice;\n‘sorry’ because it does not help fix the problem;\n‘valid’ and ‘invalid’ because they do not add anything to the message;\nhumourous, informal language like ‘oops’.\n\nThe choice of words matters. It’s worth emphasizing that spending time and effort on crafting helpful, adaptive error messages is probably one of the best investments a company might make to reduce abandonment and drive conversions.\nProvide Examples Of Correct Input\nTalking about the choice of words, how do we make it more helpful? And in general, what makes an error message helpful? For example, a clear set of guidelines of what a correct input is. That means adding a hint under the label and provide an example of correct input, so users understand how to re-route and what is expected from them.\n\n\nSurely, sometimes adding an example might feel unnecessary and just taking up the space in design. I’d challenge you to tackle your conversion issues with well-crafted examples of corrent input. Often it’s the easiest way to improve conversion, as users otherwise just can’t find a way to make something work — even if it’s as simple as an extra empty space.\nDisplay Error Summary On The Top\nInline validation deserves a separate conversation. As an alternative approach, of course we could validate the form on submit only. But it doesn’t mean that we have to drive users from one page to a separate new page with all the errors displayed. We could display an error summary just next to the Submit button (as displayed below, sketched by Jordan Moore). It would probably be better to display the error message above the Submit button rather than below it to prevent it from being rendered below the bottom of the viewport and thus not to be visible (thanks Rik!).\n\nHowever, if there are a few problems with the form, we can also use an error summary component. With it, we highlight the errors as links so that users can jump to them via the keyboard as well. While doing so, we need to bring focus to the first form field with an error. Preferably with a bit of scroll-margin-top, so screen reader users understand where they currently are.\n\nAdditionally, you might want to adjust the favicon and the title of the document if errors do appear, so impatient users who might have already left the form perhaps have a chance to return back and fix the errors, rather than assuming that everything has worked flawlessly.\n\nWrapping Up\nAt the first glance, dealing with error messages might not sound like a big deal. However, as we dive into fine details, there are plenty of considerations that might either cause high abandonment or help people resolve issues quickly.\nHere’s a quick overview of what we can do to improve the Error Messages UX in our websites and applications:\n\nDefine error-focused design KPIs by measuring the average number of mistakes in a user journey, the error recovery time, the completion rates, and completion times.\nNever rely on the color of the error message alone, and use icons, borders, and section highlights to indicate erroneous input.\nNever cover user’s input nor the error message. Ideally, allow users to consult the error message, the tooltip, and their input at the same time, e.g., by using inline accordions and avoiding tooltips for important details.\nConsider displaying error messages above input to avoid issues with auto-fill, autocomplete, magnifying software, and virtual keyboard.\nUse inline validation for password strength meters, but not for validating every field as users type in. Consider breaking the form into small steps and validate each step only on submit.\nFor complex tables, don’t rely on toast error messages and display errors within rows where an error has occurred.\nBe strategic about your error messaging and craft helpful messages that match the voice and tone of your brand, rather than being general and generic.\nAlways provide examples of correct input, especially for complex input that are less likely to be auto-filled.\nAllow users to override your validators for address input and telephone input, but not for any input that needs to follow a particular convention.\nWhen validating on submit, display an error summary on the top of the page, or guide users to an error in a popover. Also, change the favicon and the title of the document to communicate to users who’ve already left that something went wrong.\n\nWith these guidelines, we should be better off when boosting our error messages UX. And if you can’t really do much around the way errors appear in your product, explore what you can do to replace generic error messages with helpful ones. This might be a small change with a huge impact that will eventually show up in large business KPIs dashboards.\nMeet “Smart Interface Design Patterns”\nIf you are interested in similar insights around UX, take a look at Smart Interface Design Patterns, our shiny new 7h-video course with 100s of practical examples from real-life projects.

        "description": "VIENNA — The U.S. and Iran are closing in on an agreement to restore the 2015 nuclear deal after almost 17 months of negotiations.\n\n\n\nThe United States relayed to the EU on Wednesday its much-awaited response to Iran’s comments on the draft proposal to restore the nuclear deal, a U.S. official familiar with the matter told POLITICO.\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson of the Iranian Foreign Ministry Nasser Kanaani confirmed that it had received the U.S. response via EU senior official Enrique Mora, who acts as a mediator and coordinator of the talks. Iran still refuses to talk directly with the U.S. “Iran has started reviewing the US comments, and after the review Tehran will submit its views to the coordinator,” Kanaani said.\n\n\n\nThe U.S. response is expected to focus on final sticking points related to Iranian demands for economic guarantees and sanctions relief. U.S. officials were tight-lipped about the substance of the response. When asked for details, the official familiar with the matter said the response contained “a bunch of words and sentences and paragraphs.”\n\n\n\nA person familiar with the U.S. response said it focused on the issue of economic guarantees. The person declined to give details, but said the response “falls short of Iran’s expectations. So now we have to see if they realize this is as good as it gets or decide to push for more.”\n\n\n\nIn recent days, European officials have expressed increasing optimism they could revive the 2015 nuclear deal, which lifted many U.S. sanctions on Iran in exchange for strict but temporary curbs on its nuclear program. Western officials say that a number of technical questions related to economic guarantees and sanctions remain open but that other main sticking points have been resolved, making an agreement more likely. But they still cautioned that it would require tough political decisions both in Washington and Tehran in order to close a deal.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, Josep Borrell, the EU’s foreign policy chief, told the Spanish news agency EFE that time was of the essence: “We have only days left, a few days [to conclude the deal], because after the summer we will enter into a new political dynamic,” he said, speaking on the margins of the Quo Vadis Europa conference in Santander, Spain.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Israel Prime Minister Yair Lapid on Wednesday urged the Biden administration to abandon the talks with Iran, saying that the emerging deal failed to “meet the standards set by President Biden himself: preventing Iran from becoming a nuclear state.”\n\n\n\nLapid also warned that the frozen funds Iran would receive as part of a restored deal — worth an estimated $100 billion — would enable the regime in Tehran to fund even more malign activities in the region.\n\n\n\n“This money will fund the Revolutionary Guard,” Lapid said. “It will fund more attacks on American bases in the Middle East. It will be used to strengthen Hezbollah, Hamas and Islamic Jihad.”\n\n\n\nDiplomats from Britain, France, Germany, Iran, Russia, China and the United States have spent almost 17 months negotiating a revival of the 2015 nuclear accord in Vienna. The talks have been close to collapse several times.\n\n\n\nBut since the last physical meeting of the parties at the beginning of August in Vienna, some of the most complicated stumbling blocks appear to have been resolved. They were related to whether the U.S. would remove the Islamic Revolutionary Guards from the Foreign Terrorist Organization list, as well as to the fate of an investigation by the International Atomic Energy Agency into traces of nuclear material found at three sites in Iran.\n\n\n\nJohn Kirby, spokesperson for the National Security Council, confirmed on Wednesday that Iran dropped some key demands, allowing the two sides to make some progress.\n\n\n\n“We are closer now than we were even just a couple of weeks ago because Iran made the decision to make some concessions,” Kirby said. But he cautioned that “a lot of gaps remain. We’re not there yet.”\n\n\n\nEconomic guarantees\n\n\n\nIran is still seeking further guarantees that a future U.S. administration would not leave the deal again. The Biden administration has stressed on numerous occasions that it will uphold its obligations but cannot provide a legal guarantee for its successors.\n\n\n\nThe prospect of former U.S. President Donald Trump — or a like-minded Republican — returning to power has overshadowed the talks since they began in Vienna in April 2021. Trump,who called the original deal “horrible” and “one-sided,” left the agreement in 2018.\n\n\n\nIran wants assurances built into the new text to cushion the potentially negative effects on the Iranian economy should the deal collapseagain.\n\n\n\nOne such guarantee that is built into the draft text, according to Western officials, would allow foreign companies to continue their operations in Iran for two-and-a-half years without fear of being sanctioned, even if this renewed agreement falls apart.\n\n\n\nTehran would also receive what it calls an “inherent guarantee” that enables it to ramp up its uranium enrichment capacity fairly quickly in order to discourage Washington from scuttling the agreement once more. This will be achieved in part by allowing Iran to store some centrifuges and electronic equipment inside the country under the seal of the International Atomic Energy Agency instead of destroying them, a Western official with knowledge of the matter said.\n\n\n\nUnder the 2015 deal, Iran is only allowed to enrich uranium up to 3.67 percent purity, maintain a stockpile of 300 kilograms of uranium, and permitted to use only very basic IR-1 centrifuges — machines that spin uranium gas at high speed for enrichment purposes.\n\n\n\nIt has exceeded those limits dramatically in response to the U.S. exit from the deal.\n\n\n\nIran currently has a stockpile of some 3,800 kilograms of enriched uranium — some of which has been enriched up to 60 percent, which is close to weapons grade. Iran has also installed thousands of advanced centrifuges in breach of the 2015 deal, including IR-6 machines that spin much faster.\n\n\n\nShould the 2015 deal be restored, Iran will be forced back into compliance with the previous limits — but it will be allowed to mothball the advanced centrifuges, including the electronic infrastructure needed to operate them.\n\n\n\nSanctions lifting\n\n\n\nEven if the U.S. lifts nuclear-related sanctions under a new deal, numerous other American sanctions on Iran would remain, targeting the country over its support for terrorist groups and human rights abuses.\n\n\n\nThose additional sanctions are the result of Trump’s “maximum pressure” campaign on Iran, which entailed not only reimposing nuclear-related sanctions, but also adding new penalties. That has made the Biden team’s job harder as it has tried to figure out which sanctions to lift and which to leave in place.\n\n\n\nNow, Iran wants to make sure those remaining U.S. sanctions will not deter European and other non-American companies from doing business on its soil.\n\n\n\nOne Trump move that infuriated Tehran was the designation of Iran’sIslamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, a powerful military branch, as a terrorist group. U.S. President Joe Biden has said he would not remove the IRGC from that terrorist list. On Wednesday, the U.S. struck an IRGC compound of bunkers in Syria, as retaliation for a strike by an IRGC-affiliated militia on a U.S. base.\n\n\n\nComplicating matters is the IRGC’s vast economic footprint throughout Iran, with major economic projects in key industries.\n\n\n\nThe current draft deal, according to Western officials, will allow European and other non-American companies to do business with entities that have “transactions” with companies owned by Iran’s IRGC.\n\n\n\nWhile some critics of the deal see that language as a weak point, allowing Tehran to use proxies to conduct business, other analysts say it’s not a significant change to how the United States currently approaches such situations.\n\n\n\nBrian O’Toole, a nonresident fellow at the Atlantic Council and sanctions expert, said that the language in the draft deal signifies no change from current rules. He says it is “just a restatement of existing rules in a more prominent place.” Similar statements have appeared in various official JCPOA documents from 2015 and 2016, according to O’Toole.\n\n\n\nIAEA safeguards probe\n\n\n\nEarlier in the discussions, Iran also insisted it wanted the International Atomic Energy Agency to close a probe into the origins of multiple traces of nuclear material found at three previously undeclared sites in Iran as a precondition for its return to the nuclear deal.\n\n\n\nWestern officials suspect that conclusive proof into the origins of the nuclear material could establish that Iran had a clandestine nuclear weapons program that ran until at least 2003. Iran, however, insists its nuclear program has always been solely for peaceful purposes.\n\n\n\nEU officials have offered a proposal that would close the IAEA investigation if Iran can offer the agency credible answers about the uranium traces’ origins before the so-called “reimplementation day” — the day the revived nuclear deal would go into effect. But the proposal would also enable Iran to block reimplementation day, should the probe remain open.\n\n\n\nIran seems to have agreed to this EU proposal since it did not raise the issue again in&nbsp;its reply last week to the final EU text, according to three senior Western diplomats.\n\n\n\nBut it also means that even if an agreement on restoring the nuclear deal is reached in the coming days, there may still be pitfalls ahead for its full implementation.\n\n\n\nLara Seligman contributed reporting from Washington, D.C.",

        "description": "5:56pm: New York officially announced Wiessert&#8217;s selection, as well as the previously-reported placement of Nestor Cortes on the 15-day IL and the reinstatement of Giancarlo Stanton. In order to create a spot on the 40-man roster, New York transferred center fielder Harrison Bader from the 10-day to the 60-day IL. Bader has already been on the IL since June 27, so the move is procedural and doesn&#8217;t affect his return window. Bader, who&#8217;s dealing with plantar fasciitis in his right foot, hasn&#8217;t yet begun a minor league rehab assignment.\n11:57am: The Yankees will select the contract of right-hander Greg Weissert prior to tomorrow&#8217;s game with the Athletics, according to Eric Hubbs of Barstool Sports (Twitter link).  A corresponding move will need to be made to officially add Weissert to the 40-man roster, and the New York Post&#8217;s Joel Sherman reports that the Yankees will be placing another pitcher on the injured list.\nWeissert&#8217;s first MLB appearance will be his debut in the Show.  An 18th-round pick out of Fordham in the 2016 draft, Weissert posted solid but unspectacular numbers in his first pro seasons before returning with a flourish after the canceled 2020 minor league season.  The right-hander has been getting better as he has gotten closer to the majors, with a 1.47 ERA over 36 2/3 innings of Double-A ball and a 1.85 ERA in 82 2/3 Triple-A frames.\nThis season has seen Weissert deliver a 36.8% strikeout rate in 46 innings of Triple-A ball, which is more than enough to counter a more average 10.4% walk rate.  Batters have simply not been able to do much against Weissert this year, with only 22 total hits.  Over his last 23 games and 23 1/3 innings, Weissert also hasn&#8217;t allowed a single run, either earned or unearned.\nThe bullpen went from being a major strength to more of a question mark for the Yankees in recent weeks, as Chad Green and Michael King were both lost to season-ending injuries and the likes of Clay Holmes, Miguel Castro, Albert Abreu, and &#8212; just yesterday &#8212; trade deadline acquisition Scott Effross were also lost to the injured list.  Weissert will provide some reinforcement, while Holmes, Castro, and Zach Britton are all on the way back, though it remains to be seen which new pitcher (as per Sherman&#8217;s report) has now also been sidelined.",

Unfortunately, TechCrunch reports that some of Plex’s user data—email addresses, usernames, and passwords—has been compromised, with the company admitting that the majority of its 30 million accounts were affected. Even though Plex says the passwords were hashed (cryptographically scrambled), the company is still warning users to change their passwords. If you missed or haven’t yet received the notice, here’s how to do that on the Plex website:\n\nClick the hamburger icon in the upper-right corner.\n\nClick Sign In and log in to your account.\nClick the hamburger icon again and then click Account Settings.\nLook under Security and click Edit to the right of Password.\n\n\nIf you haven’t already done so, you can also take the opportunity to turn on two-factor authentication.

        "description": "I got clued in to this tweet by the wonderful Federico Viticci through the latest Shortcuts newsletter from the equally wonderful Matthew Cassinelli and was enthralled by the possibility of grabbing an email&#8217;s URL to refer to it from outside of Mail.app.\n\n\n\nBecause I get a lot of email, it is often the source of knowledge, wisdom, and tasks, and so being able to refer to emails in other contexts (say, from tasks in OmniFocus or rapid-logged journaling in Agenda) is really valuable. So I set to work to make a Shortcut to manage just this.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI am generally opposed to AppleScript, JavaScript, or AnyScriptAtAll, simply because I&#8217;m not a developer, and I find these things too hard. Shortcuts is my jam. But until Mail gets Shortcuts support or a Share Sheet or something (come on, you cowards), I ran towards the danger a bit here.\n\n\n\nThis Mac-only Shortcut (because AppleScript) is for use with the Agenda app and my Agenda Daily Log Shortcut. It appends provided input to an Agenda note titled as EEEE MMMM d, yyyy (i.e. Saturday September 3, 2022), along with the currently selected email.\n\n\n\nThis Shortcut works very much like my Rapid Log Shortcut, except that it captures the currently selected email. That email will then be appended to anything entered in the Rapid Log, referred to by a reference that is asked for following the entry of Rapid Log content, linked back to the actual email itself.\n\n\n\nThe Shortcut will then archive the selected email (using the sending of keystroke ^ + ⌘ + a), bringing you back in to the Mail app, so that you can go on your merry way and Rapid Clip the next one (or hopefully just delete all the email).\n\n\n\nThe use case here is fast inbox processing, and this Shortcut is best used when invoked by a keyboard shortcut (there are too many kinds of shortcuts). Note that this Shortcut (capital S Shortcut) here offers all the same syntax support as the Rapid Logger, meaning that tasks can be generated in OmniFocus (which also contain the link to the referenced email), tagged and noted accordingly.\n\n\n\n\nDownload Agenda Rapid Email Clipper\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport HeyScottyJ&#8217;s work\n\n\n\nI love doing this work to try and help you be more productive by sharing ideas that have made me more productive.

        "description": "Update 07/19: Now with OmniFocus task notes\n\n\n\nUpdate 07/20: Fixed unintentionally re-used task note\n\n\n\nI shared my Rapid Log Shortcut for Agenda the other day, and it serves its purpose, but I am an OmniFocus user, and so really, my rapid logged tasks need to land there. As such, I have been fine-tuning my Shortcut for use with it, and with some bonus features.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI won&#8217;t rehash too much about what I already posted, but this Shortcut:\n\n\n\nAsks for inputTakes input, line by line, and appends it to a Daily Agenda LogIf the line of input starts with - (a dash and a space):The appended line in Agenda becomes a checklist item instead of a bulletA task is created in the OmniFocus inbox with that line&#8217;s nameThat appended Agenda line is linked to the task created in the OmniFocus\n\n\n\nHere&#8217;s what is bonus cool, though:\n\n\n\nThe task is created in OmniFocus using TaskPaper additionThis means your task could include something like @due(tom) to show that it is due tomorrow, and the OmniFocus task created will honour it&#8230; but that content is stripped from the text appended to Agenda for elegance@flagged is the exception, because if that is added, the Agenda line will be prefaced with a  to indicate the flagged stateYou can include tags inline as #tag1 and #tag2 (no spaces), and they will be honoured by OmniFocusThe Shortcut parses those in to TaskPaper format @tags(tag1, tag2) accordinglyYou can write tags inline in TaskPaper format too, of courseNone of that content is in the Agenda line appended (again, elegance)You can also include +(Project Name) inlineThis will become the project to which the task is added (instead of the Inbox)This is a search of Projects in OmniFocus, and the first match returned, so use clever keywordsSpaces are allowed for multi-word names/searchesThe use of a + here is a nod to todo.txt, which used + as the signifier for projectsIn case anyone cared?Still, eleganceLastly, you can use  //  as a notes delimiter (that&#8217;s a space, two slashes, and a space)Everything after that delimiter will be added to the notes field of OmniFocusThis content will be ignored in Agenda (assumed that this is in service of noting the task, not the journal)\n\n\n\nRead about TaskPaper notation you can include →\n\n\n\nThere is no enforced order here, so one could totally thoughtstream the entry (which I do). For example:\n\n\n\n- Call Marie about the budget #Urgent @flagged +(budget presentation) @due(fri) #Calls // The budget presentation is on our shared folder\n\n\n\nMetadata does not need to be entered in a particular order.\n\n\n\nI find that by rapid logging this way, I capture my commitments in OmniFocus, but I also diary that capture in Agenda, and also give myself the freedom to capture non-actionable things I have discovered or know.\n\n\n\nI&#8217;d love to hear what you think!\n\n\n\n\nDownload Rapid Logger OmniFocus Variant\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport HeyScottyJ&#8217;s work\n\n\n\nI love doing this work to try and help you be more productive by sharing ideas that have made me more productive.

        "description": "When it comes to capturing things as they come in to my life, I love the notion of rapid logging as is done in the Bullet Journal Method. The catch for me is that while I adore analog work, it often can&#8217;t scale to the pace or reusability of digital. This is where I have built up a solution for my daily logging that works digitally.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is all about my Rapid Log Shortcut, for use with the Agenda app (yes, that&#8217;s a referral link) and my Agenda Daily Log Shortcut. The basic conceit of this Shortcut is that it appends provided input to note in Agenda titled as EEEE MMMM d, yyyy (i.e. Wednesday June 29, 2022).\n\n\n\nThe Shortcut asks for input, and multiple lines of input can be provided. Lines of text are each added as bullet list items to the Agenda Daily Log titled as today’s date, each with a timestamp to represent when they were entered.\n\n\n\nIf, however, a line of inputted text begins with a dash and a space (- ), it is given special treatment, treated as a task:\n\n\n\nIt will be created as a Reminder (in a list chosen by an import question for this Shortcut)It will be shown as a checklist item in the Agenda note instead of a bullet list itemThe Agenda checklist item’s text will link to the Reminder\n\n\n\nAdditionally, for these task items, text can be entered inline when being asked for input by the Shortcut to add treatment to the Reminder created:\n\n\n\nAdding @flagged in this line will flag the task created in Reminders, and indicate the checklist item in Agenda with an orange diamond emoji (the actual @flagged text will not be included in Agenda nor in the Reminder title)Adding tags inline as #tag1 #tag2 (no spaces allowed in a single tag) will add those tags to the Reminder created (this text will not be reflected in Agenda)\n\n\n\nCertainly, the overall construct of this Shortcut could be fairly easily manipulated to have tasks created in OmniFocus or other task managers, but I wanted this to work out of the box for anyone using Agenda (and if you aren&#8217;t, there&#8217;s that referral link again). And yes, in the end, what this Shortcut produces is markdown, which could be sent to another note manager if you prefer. The key is having a predictable and always correct destination for the content, which is why I use today&#8217;s formatted date as a title.\n\n\n\nI&#8217;d love to hear what you think and if this is useful!\n\n\n\n\nDownload Rapid Log Shortcut\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport HeyScottyJ&#8217;s work\n\n\n\nI love doing this work to try and help you be more productive by sharing ideas that have made me more productive.

        "description": "I thought it would be good to do a series about how I automate my days as a means of keeping myself on track and conserving energy. The first part of this is in how I set up my day using the Agenda app.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have been using the Shortcut I&#8217;ll describe here for a while now, but have been inspired to improve it and make it shareable so that everyone can benefit from it. I think the features this creates in my Agenda experience are super cool.\n\n\n\nThis Shortcut creates a new note titled as EEEE MMMM d, yyyy (i.e. &#8220;Saturday September 3, 2022&#8221;) in the project of your choosing. The note contains a list of all-day events from your calendar under the heading “Today”, as well as a list of timed calendar events under the heading of “Events”.\n\n\n\nHere&#8217;s the coolest part, though: next to each event is a linked arrow which, when clicked, creates a new note linked to that calendar event and pre-populated with that event’s name, location, organizer, and attendees (taken from the calendar). This makes it easy to generate relevant notes for the day. The Shortcut builds Agenda URLs for each of those events.\n\n\n\nAll calendar items in the note are preceded by a designated emoji, defined in a dictionary at the top of the Shortcut.\n\n\n\nNext in the note, under the heading of “Tasks” is a checkmark list of Reminders from a designated list that are either due today or overdue (designated by the emoji ), flagged (designated by ), or tagged with a particular tag (and designated with an emoji, both of which have text actions to let you customize). Each item is linked back to the actual Reminder to update as needed.\n\n\n\nLastly, a horizontal rule is added with a heading of “Rapid log”, where logging of notes for the day can be added as they occur.\n\n\n\n\nDownload Daily Agenda Log Shortcut\n\n\n\n\nI chose to do this with Reminders so that everyone can benefit, but this could be modified easily enough to be used with OmniFocus, or any other task management system that allows either Shortcuts or URL access to its content.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think? Is this useful for you?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport HeyScottyJ&#8217;s work\n\n\n\nI love doing this work to try and help you be more productive by sharing ideas that have made me more productive.

Without that kind of thinking, I don&#8217;t even know what I&#8217;d be doing.\n\n\n\nI tweeted recently and asked what topics about productivity would be interesting when thinking about dealing with chronic illness or disease, and the clear response (thanks to everyone who got in touch) was that there are two areas of interest:\n\n\n\nEnergy management and optimization/conservationMeasurements of success\n\n\n\nI really appreciated how clear everyone was about this, and these topics seem the most right for me to think and write about.\n\n\n\nI&#8217;m keen to start blogging more regularly again, but I thought it would be good to set up with this context about what I&#8217;ll probably talk most about (energy and measures) and why that is. Same tools still all apply here, but that&#8217;s the lens through which I&#8217;m looking at life.\n\n\n\nFor now, I&#8217;m polishing a few new/updated Shortcuts that I&#8217;ll be excited to share, and will get back to the grind.",

It will ask for a term to search for, a term to replace that with, then replaces terms accordingly (case sensitive) in the original note, replacing the original note in its totality with the updated text.\n\n\n\nBe cautious, because this will replace the matched term absolutely, so if you replaced “tow” with “truck”, the word “toward” becomes “truckard”. You get the idea.\n\n\n\nAlso, I&#8217;ll admit this is a list bit brute force, because it is a wholesale replacement of a note with updated text, but I think this could be quite handy for turning keywords in to tags, or just plain renaming stuff.\n\n\n\nHope this is useful &#8211; your feedback is always welcome!\n\n\n\n\nDownload Agenda Search and Replace\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport HeyScottyJ&#8217;s work\n\n\n\nI love doing this work to try and help you be more productive by sharing ideas that have made me more productive.

        "description": "&#8220;You&#8217;re not dying, you just can&#8217;t think of anything good to do.&#8221; &#8212; Ferris Bueller\n\nI&#8217;ll not exhaust the story too much, but a couple of months ago, the right side of my body went numb. This was scary, but thankfully, I was diagnosed with migraines (they don&#8217;t have to be pain headaches, I&#8217;ve learned), and prescribed meds to manage.\nSince, symptoms have escalated, and that has led to MRI and more MRI and further testing. Who knows what is happening to me (we&#8217;ll figure it out in time), but I do know this:\nMy productivity has been galvanized like never before.\nAs I combat wild levels of fatigue, energy is now a very special resource. This means I ask, of all things I do, is this important enough to risk not being able to do the rest of my day?\nPeeking behind the scenes a bit more, I&#8217;m on vacation from work, which was mostly planned ahead of time and fortuitous in timing since I can&#8217;t keep up, so I am lucky to not have to worry about that, but all else I do is done with incredible deliberateness.\n&#8220;Time management&#8221; is the term that I hear most often, but it&#8217;s really &#8220;action management&#8221; (that which consumes time), which is really &#8220;choice management&#8221; (that which inspires action), which is really &#8220;values management&#8221; (that which drives choice). Never before have I been so clearly able to see a line so directly connecting my core values to what I am doing in every moment.\nThat&#8217;s probably exhausting too, but it makes me happy to live through.\nI don&#8217;t know what the takeaway here is, except to say that, where possible, really identifying and then leaning in to core values to drive how one spends the time one has agency over is incredibly rewarding. And hopefully, you don&#8217;t have to have your whole body go numb to signal this.",

        "link": "https://heyscottyj.com/2021/07/12/lists-to-go-with-cheatsheat/",
        "description": "It was just a month or so ago that was thinking I needed a good way to take particular OmniFocus lists with me on my watch, because I love ditching my phone when I can.\nLo and behold, Cheatsheet, an app I love, just added Shortcuts support. This means I can very easily create a list from OmniFocus and put it in a cheat, making it ready to take with me (requires Cheatsheat&#8217;s Pro in-app purchase, but well worth it).\n\nWhat&#8217;s great about this is that I can make a complication that gets me right to this portable list of mine. Now, of course, I can&#8217;t check stuff off, because it&#8217;s just text, but it&#8217;s a super convenient way of carrying a list to go.\nA few bits about the Shortcut:\n\nTune the Find Items OmniFocus action as you see fit. Yes, I could have done import questions, but there are so many different dimensions of how to select tasks to include that that didn&#8217;t seem to make sense (I just use available tasks with a particular tag, but you could involve flags, dates, and any other number of things).\nFeel free to adjust how the text is passed to the cheat for each task. I used an ASCII circle to make each line feel OmniFocusesque, and also added blank lines between each, but you might want to personalize here.\nPick the right Shortcut version. I made one for OmniFocus 3 as well as for those folks who might be running on the OmniFocus 4 beta.\nOne thing you could do is set up a folder in Cheatsheet for this cheat, and then add actions to the beginning of the Shortcut to get and delete all cheats from that folder when you run it. The reason for this is intentionally enforcing a temporary kind of use here, which I am fond of. A setup like this doesn&#8217;t lend well to Shortcut distribution, however, so I left it out.\n\nLastly, for anyone who thinks as much as I do about these things and since I did get some questions on Twitter, some thoughts about why I think Cheatsheet is great for this compared to other apps I could do this in:\n\nDrafts: This could surely be done in Drafts, but to me, Drafts is not a place I refer back to, it&#8217;s where text starts.\nOmniFocus flagged: Sure, I could just flag stuff to show up in the flagged spot in OF itself, but that risks polluting what flags mean. And then what if I don&#8217;t do stuff? Do I unflag? Re-flag?\nReminders: Honestly, it&#8217;s a miracle on some days that I can keep one productivity system going, adding another seems dangerous. Even if for one use case, it&#8217;s risky. It feels like getting a bag of Skittles, but just for the yellow ones. That whole bag is getting eaten, no matter what I tell myself.\n\nAnyway, enough of the preamble, here are the Shortcuts!\n\n\n\nFor OmniFocus 3\n\n\n\nFor OmniFocus 4 beta\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport HeyScottyJ&#8217;s work\n\n\n\nI love doing this work to try and help you be more productive by sharing ideas that have made me more productive.

        "description": "v1.21 update\n\n\n\nMinor updateAdded Maps as a source for phone numbers in the Phone branchAdded alert to Bookmarked URLs branch to align to all the others\n\n\n\nDownload link below \n\n\n\nv1.2 update\n\n\n\nAdded branch for Things, using its show URL scheme query parameter to show a particular project, or else the id parameter to show a built-in list\n\n\n\nv1.1 update\n\n\n\nAdded branch for DEVONthink To GoAdded branch for Craft (requires choosing the workspace to open when you actually use the URL, but hey, you play the hand you&#8217;re dealt)Added branches for OmniFocus 4 BetaAdded branch for Agenda 13.1 BetaAdded comment actions to capture changelog and protips\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI was listening my pals Jay Miller, Rosemary Orchard, and David Sparks discuss Hook on a recent episode of the Automators podcast, and got thinking about how often I benefit from linking across resources on my phone/iPad (or would like to benefit from it, if I actually did it more).\n\n\n\nSome real examples:\n\n\n\nPut a phone number in an OmniFocus taskReference an OmniFocus project in an Agenda noteAdd a location in a Note\n\n\n\nAnd plenty more.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo I got to thinking and assembled a new iOS Shortcut that I call Bubble Gum (because what better way to stick things together than with the stuff you have at hand?).\n\n\n\nI really like running this Shortcut from Spotlight on an iPad, so that I can get to it whenever. It lets you search various things you might have and copies links to them to your clipboard for insertion elsewhere. I also use this on my phone set to the Back Tap accessibility move, because I can invoke that from anywhere.\n\n\n\nAs an aside, iPadOS does this infuriating thing where after running the Shortcut from Spotlight, Spotlight still holds the focus of typing, but ⌘+space will dismiss that (thanks to friends Christopher Lawley and Matthew Cassinelli for saving me from rage deleting my iPad).\n\n\n\nNow, it wasn&#8217;t until I was waaaaaay down the rabbit hole when the realization struck me: you can’t really link to a calendar event or note by url. That made me sad. So instead, I made the desired event or note details be captured in url-encoded JSON, and added that as a parameter in a url to run Bubble Gum later, which would identify the only possible event or note you mean to be referring to, and open it.\n\n\n\nThis has been enormously useful for me, and I hope it is for you, too! I can see myself adding other branches here and iterating on this, so let me know if there is something else you&#8217;d find useful to add!\n\n\n\n\nDownload the Bubble Gum Shortcut\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSupport HeyScottyJ&#8217;s work\n\n\n\nI love doing this work to try and help you be more productive by sharing ideas that have made me more productive. If what I&#8217;ve shared here has help put some time back in your day, I&#8217;d love your support to keep me making things. Thank you!",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/movies-tv-shows-exit-google-play-store/",
        "description": "Back in May, we received word that Google had plans to give movies and TV shows found on the Play Store a similar treatment that music had undergone years prior. Instead of being featured or even housed in the store itself, songs, albums, and artists were removed in favor of being stored in the Google Play Music app, which later became YouTube Music. Today, you won&#8217;t find a way to discover or buy music tracks from the Play Store, and that&#8217;s because it simply made more sense to get it at the source app you were listening in.\n\n\n\nEver since Google Play Movies &amp; TV had become Google TV, we knew that the content&#8217;s time in the store and with the Play branding was limited. Now, the bottom navigation in the store no longer has an option for it, and we&#8217;re left with just &#8220;Games&#8221;, &#8220;Apps&#8221;, and &#8220;Books&#8221;.\n\n\n\nMovies &amp; TV Shows have moved to the Google TV app!\n\n\nThere&#8217;s no need to worry though! Just as with music, Movies &amp; TV are simply moving to where they&#8217;re accessed and purchased most often &#8211; the Google TV app. In addition to news highlights for content you follow and a dedicated TV remote, you&#8217;ll also be able to directly browse the latest movies and TV shows directly from the &#8220;Shop&#8221; tab.\n\n\n\nStarting in May 2022, the Google TV app will be your home for buying, renting, and watching movies and shows on your Android mobile device or tablet. On the Google Play app, Movies &amp; TV will no longer be supported. Google Play will continue to be your store for apps, games, and books. On Google TV, you will find the same experience you are used to on Google Play Movies &amp; TV with the latest new releases, rentals, deals, and great recommendations for you.&#xA0;Google\n\n\n\nNow that the transition is complete, your purchased content will be available directly through both the Google TV app and YouTube. The only thing you can still do in regards to your film content on the Play Store is view and request refunds for your purchases. Additionally, any and all wishlist items you&#8217;ve added for movies and TV shows over the years are now baked directly into your Google TV Watchlist, which can be found on the bottom navigation of the standalone app.\n\n\n\nGiven this trend of placing content where it&#8217;s most useful (a trend I&#8217;m wholly in favor of), I believe that the next exit from the Play Store will be books and audiobooks. These will likely live just and only in the Google Play Books app via the &#8220;Shop&#8221; tab, and the Play Store itself will probably get a bottom navigation rework. However, with just apps and games being featured down there, it may just make more sense for the company to get rid of the bottom navigation altogether in favor of just the good old hamburger menu.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

Our findings show that this disparity starts in the workplace.Working professionals from ethnically diverse backgrounds are nearly twice as likely to have been told they won’t be getting a promised pay rise this year due to inflation (19% compared with 10% of white professionals). To compound matters, two-thirds (67%) of racially diverse working professionals believe that a white colleague doing the same job is on a higher salary. Continue reading...",

        "description": "A federal appeals court on Thursday said Arkansas can’t enforce its ban on transgender children receiving gender affirming medical care. A three-judge panel of the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed a judge’s ruling temporarily blocking the state from enforcing the 2021 law. A trial is scheduled for October before the same judge on whether to permanently block the law. Arkansas was the first state to enact such a ban, which prohibits doctors from providing gender confirming hormone treatment, puberty blockers or surgery to anyone under 18 years old, or from referring them to other providers for the treatment. There are no doctors who perform gender affirming surgery on minors in the state. “Because the minor’s sex at birth determines whether or not the minor can receive certain types of medical care under the law, Act 626 discriminates on the basis of sex,” the court’s ruling Thursday said. The American Civil Liberties Union challenged the law on behalf of four transgender youth and their families, as well as two doctors who provide gender confirming treatments. Republican Gov. Asa Hutchinson vetoed the ban last year, but GOP lawmakers overrode him to enact the law. Multiple medical groups, including the American Medical Association, oppose the ban and have said the care is safe if properly administered. The Justice Department has also opposed the ban as unconstitutional. Arkansas argued that the restriction is within the state’s authority to regulate medical practices. An attorney for the ACLU told the appeals panel in June that reinstating the restriction would create uncertainty for families around the state. Hutchinson vetoed the ban following pleas from pediatricians, social workers and the parents of transgender youth who said the measure would harm a community already at risk for depression and suicide. Hutchinson said the law went too far, especially since it wouldn’t exempt youth already receiving the care.",

        "description": "AUSTIN, Texas — Texas's leading oil and gas regulator on Thursday cheered the state government’s push against environmental, social and governance investing (ESG) “extremists” like BlackRock and UBS.\n\n\n\n“I’m thrilled to see my conservative colleagues join the defense against ‘woke’ Wall Street bankers,” Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Wayne Christian said in the statement.\n\n\n\n“Rally the troops: Here in Texas is where we will draw the line against ESG’s detrimental impact on oil and gas,” he added.\n\n\n\nChristian — who recently defeated a Republican primary challenger who was pushing for more statewide regulation of pollution caused by oil and gas — made his statement against the backdrop of a broader campaign by Texas’s state government against companies it accuses of boycotting oil and gas.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, State Comptroller Glenn Hegar banned state and local entities from doing business&nbsp;with 10 banks that the state accused of boycotting the oil and gas industry.\n\n\n\nESG investors have often argued that consideration of those elements is necessary for truly responsible investing decisions — which Texas sees an implicit attack on oil.\n\n\n\nBut Republicans like Christian and Hegar — and their counterparts in other states — have sought to portray the movement as financially irresponsible and politically motivated.\n\n\n\nESG has “produced an opaque and perverse system in which some financial companies no longer make decisions in the best interest of their shareholders or their clients, but instead use their financial clout to push a social and political agenda shrouded in secrecy,” Hegar said in an agency&nbsp;statement on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nChristian was even more pointed in his comments. “Your retirement account is just collateral damage to radical environmentalists who are leveraging ESG investment strategies to defund the oil and gas industry,” he said.\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton (R) joined 18 other states attorneys general in a letter&nbsp;to BlackRock CEO Larry Fink challenging the company support for ESG.\n\n\n\n“Rather than being a spectator betting on the game, BlackRock appears to have put on a quarterback jersey and actively taken the field,” the letter said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt also accused the company of political interference by means of using “the hard-earned money of our states’ citizens to circumvent the best possible return on investment, as well as their vote.\n\n\n\nTexas’s ban is “not a fact-based judgment,\" a BlackRock spokesperson told The Texas Tribune.\n\n\n\n“BlackRock does not boycott fossil fuels — investing over $100 billion in Texas energy companies on behalf of our clients proves that.”\n\n\n\nBut for months, such objections have fallen on deaf ears amid a larger Republican move against ESG.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAcross the country, Republican leaders from Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis to former Vice President Mike Pence have sought to cast “woke capital” as a threat to fossil fuels and the American pension funds invested in them.\n\n\n\nAs with Christian, this push is often portrayed in militaristic terms.\n\n\n\n“I am leading the charge on this, but there is an army behind me,” West Virginia state Treasurer Riley Moore (R) told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTexas’s ban of those 10 banks follows one imposed in July by Moore, who banned five of the nation’s largest banks — including Goldman Sachs and Blackrock —&nbsp;from receiving contracts with West Virginia.\n\n\n\nGoldman attempted to push back in a letter, arguing that “we do not pursue divestment from sectors and industries as a policy.”",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe devastating toll of Hurricane Katrina on cities like New Oreans prompted some to re-analyze their own emergency evacuation plans.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, new data show that just seven of the nation’s 50 largest cities have strong plans in place, while some have no evacuation plans at all.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs climate change continues to exacerbate extreme weather events, more regions will need to better prepare for such natural disasters.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHurricane Katrina made landfall 17 years ago this month, bringing widespread devastation to residents of Gulf Coast states Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi, and is considered among the greatest natural disasters to ever hit the United States. \n\n\n\nHowever, new research from a team at Florida Atlantic University shows that within the past two decades, the country has not learned nearly enough from the catastrophe and that “only marginal improvements have occurred with respect to evacuation planning in America's 50 largest cities.”\n\n\n\nAnalyses show the cities with the strongest evacuation plans are Charlotte, N.C.; Cleveland; Jacksonville, Fla.; Miami; New Orleans; New York City; and Philadelphia. Researchers stressed other cities should look to these as models for disaster evacuations.\n\n\n\n“While it is promising that more cities are developing evacuation plans, overall, it remains disheartening that not every city was able to learn the lessons of not being prepared, especially for carless and vulnerable populations, as showcased to the nation during the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina in 2005,” said study co-author John L. Renne, professor and director at the Center for Urban &amp; Environmental Solutions at the university in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe findings spell concern for residents as extreme weather events exacerbated by climate change are expected to become more prevalent in the future.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo understand whether any changes were made in protocols throughout the 2010s and to assess the efficacy of these changes, researchers compared evacuation plans in the nation’s 50 largest cities throughout this time period with those recorded a decade earlier.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCarless and vulnerable populations included those with low incomes, the elderly, young individuals with specific needs, or tourists on vacation without a car.\n\n\n\nInvestigators also devised an evacuation preparedness rating system based on the following metrics: special needs registries; specialized transportation plans for individuals with specific needs; pick-up location plans; multimodal evacuation plans; and pedestrian evacuation plans.\n\n\n\nData were assessed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic and cities were scored based on a composite evacuation preparedness rating system: weak, 0–4 points; moderate, 5–7 points; strong, 8–10 points; and N/A, plans that were not reviewed.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA total of 17 cities, including Atlanta, Chicago, Detroit, Las Vegas, Los Angeles and Minneapolis, didn’t make plans available to researchers or did not have plans at all. \n\n\n\nThe six cities with the weakest ratings were Colorado Springs, Colo.; Honolulu; El Paso, Texas; San Antonio, Texas; Memphis, Tenn.; and Indianapolis. \n\n\n\n“Many cities that have strong plans, including Jacksonville, Miami, New Orleans, and New York are coastal cities that have experienced strong hurricanes in the past,” Renne explained.\n\n\n\n“This study lends support to the theory that cities do not develop strong evacuation plans, ones that accommodate the needs of all people, unless they have already experienced a major disaster or are under a threat.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBecause the data were collected prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, researchers note the crisis may have led to updated emergency management plans for certain cities that are not reflected in the current study.&nbsp;",

Haha. Hahah. Sniff. Haha. Sniff. Ha--breaks down crying hysterically.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNEWS THIS MORNING&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOK, we’ll take it!:&nbsp;The U.S. economy didn’t shrink as much between April and June as the federal government had first calculated, according to revised data. Here are some of the specific numbers, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA):\n\n\n\nConsumer spending: Rose 1.6 percent, rather than the initially estimated 1 percent&nbsp;&nbsp;Spending on goods: It dropped 2.4 percent instead of the 4.4 percent drop that was previously estimated.&nbsp;Spending on services: Rose 3.6 percent.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is good news, but keep in mind: “While the decline in growth was less severe than first estimated, the U.S. economy still appeared to contract for two consecutive quarters after Thursday’s revisions.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore on today’s updated numbers&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s Thursday. I’m Cate Martel with a quick recap of the morning and what’s coming up. Did someone forward this newsletter to you? Sign up here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n💸&nbsp;In the White House&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut what about inflation?: \n\n\n\nPresident Biden’s plan to cancel at least $10,000 in student loan debt for most borrowers is coming under fire from some high-profile economists.\n\n\n\nLike: Former Obama economic advisers&nbsp;Jason Furman&nbsp;and&nbsp;Larry Summers&nbsp;argue it could inflame inflation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDo experts agree? Some do, some don’t: “Experts are divided over the inflationary effects Biden’s plan. Most agree, however, that even if student loan relief does lead to higher prices, the change will be marginal.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n^ Why?: “While Biden’s order will likely give student borrowers a total of at least $300 billion in relief over a decade, most experts don’t believe it will ignite a surge of consumer spending akin to previous rounds of stimulus checks doled out during the height of the pandemic.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe debate over whether canceling student debt will inflame inflation, via The Hill’s Karl Evers-Hillstrom and&nbsp;Sylvan Lane&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTIDBIT ABOUT PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS VS. OTHER BORROWERS:&nbsp;CNN’s&nbsp;MJ Lee&nbsp;pointed out, “One reason the Pell Grants piece of Biden's student loan debt cancellation announcement today is so significant -- some 60% of borrowers are Pell Grant recipients, per senior admin officials. That means majority of borrowers will qualify for $20,000 in loan forgiveness.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n‘WHO QUALIFIES FOR BIDEN’S PLAN TO CANCEL $10,000 IN STUDENT DEBT?’:&nbsp;Here’s a helpful Q&amp;A&nbsp;from The Washington Post’s&nbsp;Danielle Douglas-Gabriel&nbsp;and&nbsp;Jeff Stein&nbsp;\n\n\n\n‘10 OTHER WAYS TO GET YOUR STUDENT LOANS FORGIVEN’:Also From The Washington Post’s Danielle Douglas-Gabriel\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🌴&nbsp;In Mar-a-Lago&nbsp;\n\n\n\nArchives will take good care of them: Via The Washington Post’s Josh Dawsey and Jacqueline Alemany, White House lawyer Pat Cipollone agreed that former President Trump’s records should be given to the National Archives, according to a newly revealed email.  \n\n\n\nNational Archives and Records Administration (NARA) chief counsel Gary Stern said in an email to Trump lawyers in May 2021:&nbsp;“It is also our understanding that roughly two dozen boxes of original presidential records were kept in the Residence of the White House over the course of President Trump’s last year in office and have not been transferred to NARA, despite a determination by&nbsp;Pat Cipollone&nbsp;in the final days of the administration that they need to be.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMore on the efforts Archives made to recover the documents from Trump&nbsp;\n\n\n\n‘WHY DID [TRUMP] RESIST RETURNING THE GOVERNMENT’S DOCUMENTS?’:&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“As with so much else with the former president, there is not one easy answer as to why he refused and ignited a legal firestorm. But here are some possibilities.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe New York Times’s&nbsp;Maggie Haberman&nbsp;lists and explains a few of the possibilities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n‘JUSTICE DEPT. TO SUBMIT REDACTED AFFIDAVIT USED IN TRUMP SEARCH WARRANT’:&nbsp;Via The New York Times’s Glenn Thrush and Alan Feuer&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf this were 2008, Trump would change his Facebook status with McConnell from ‘it’s complicated' to ‘enemy’:\n\n\n\nFormer&nbsp;President Trump&nbsp;called for Senate Minority Leader&nbsp;Mitch McConnell&nbsp;(R-Ky.) to be booted from his leadership post, accusing him of being a “pawn for the Democrats.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump said in a statement on Wednesday: “Mitch McConnell is not an Opposition Leader, he is a pawn for the Democrats to get whatever they want. He is afraid of them, and will not do what has to be done. A new Republican Leader in the Senate should be picked immediately!”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Federalist story Trump cited about McConnell and his wife, Elaine Chao’s, alleged ties to China\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n🐘&nbsp;On the campaign trail&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExpect a MAGA-heavy House next year:&nbsp;“House Republicans are not only forecast to win control of the lower chamber in November’s midterm elections, they’re also poised to bring with them a roster of new arrivals who have embraced the former president and his false claims of fraud surrounding his 2020 defeat,”&nbsp;write&nbsp;The Hill’s&nbsp;Emily Brooks&nbsp;and&nbsp;Mike Lillis.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy that’s the case — primaries and retirements: “A number of Trump loyalists have bumped off more moderate Republicans in the summer primaries — a list that grew longer on Tuesday with conservative victories in Florida and New York — while a number of other centrists are stepping into retirement.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat this could mean for the next Congress&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJoe, could you stand over there? Ah, even further. Keep going. OK, right there!:\n\n\n\nVia The Hill’s Brett Samuels and Alex Gangitano, “Some Democrats running in competitive reelection races in November are still reluctant to attach themselves to President Biden, even as he and the White House have been buoyed by a few weeks of good news.”  \n\n\n\nWhere things stand for Biden: “Biden has in recent weeks racked up a series of major legislative victories, and he’s seen his poll numbers rebound slightly from all-time lows earlier in the summer. But that has yet to translate to enthusiasm among Democrats to embrace him on the campaign trail.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy some Democrats are still trying to keep their distance&nbsp;\n\n\n\n🦠&nbsp;Latest with COVID&nbsp;\n\n\n\n➤&nbsp;THE COVID-19 NUMBERS&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCases to date: 93.6 million&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDeath toll: 1,036,604&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCurrent hospitalizations: 32,512&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShots administered: 607 million&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFully vaccinated: 67.4 percent of Americans&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCDC data here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🐥Notable tweets \n\n\n\nI’m a little too excited about this: Bloomberg’s Steven Dennis tweeted, “USA now has 333M people per the Census.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/3615400-solving-the-student-debt-crisis-instead-of-prolonging-it/",
        "description": "President Biden announced Wednesday that he will use executive power to cancel up to $20,000 in higher-education student debt for millions of Americans. There is the obvious legal question of whether loan forgiveness counts as spending, and therefore would need direct congressional approval. There is significant skepticism from experts in the president’s own party. And while the idea generally tests well with the public, 59 percent of Americans worry that student loan forgiveness could make inflation worse.\n\n\n\nDespite the federal government trying to swoop in as the savior in the student debt crisis, it is a large source of the problem. As federal grants and loans expand, the total amount students are charged for tuition and fees also&nbsp;skyrockets, increasing the burden of obtaining a college degree on those who don’t qualify for outright aid and obscuring the real opportunity cost of going to college over other post-secondary options. If this investment, by both the government and private individuals, was creating a more educated and work-ready population, it might be worthwhile. But graduation rates within six years of starting a bachelor’s degree stand at just&nbsp;62 percent — and&nbsp;one-third&nbsp;of those students are underemployed after graduation.\n\n\n\nWhile those numbers might suggest a sizable number of Americans have debt from underutilized education holding them back, only about 14 percent of Americans currently hold student debt. Furthermore, total amounts of debt are significantly higher among those studying for jobs in high-paying fields like law, medicine and business, which will likely leave those borrowers well-suited to pay back the loans that set up their long-term financial success. This distorts the $1.6 trillion student loan figure, knowing much of it is held by Americans well on track to “pay their fair share.”\n\n\n\nWith President Biden’s announcement, more statistics about student debt will swirl around the internet. One figure that might be overlooked is buried in a recent survey from the left-leaning Data for Progress:&nbsp;43 percent&nbsp;of those who have student loans don’t have a college degree. This highlights the uncomfortable fact that even if the president’s bold order is legal and makes a difference to students unduly pushed to college, it does not fix the incentives or mechanisms that lead to overborrowing.\n\n\n\nIn fact, many analysts predict that the government cancellation of student debt will ultimately lead to an&nbsp;increase&nbsp;in tuition, exacerbating the crisis in the long-run. And Biden’s plan does nothing to address the current or future post-secondary education and training needs of the&nbsp;51 percent&nbsp;of Americans who reasonably question whether college is worth the investment for them.\n\n\n\nAll told, the estimated price tag of&nbsp;$300 billion&nbsp;could be spent in a way that reaches more Americans and provides the country more value. One way (which has the added benefit of reducing political friction) would be to return that federal money to the states so they can enact enrollment programs that are responsive to the specific needs and resources in local communities.\n\n\n\nWashington state has the Running Start program, which lets high school students enroll in community and technical colleges, thus reducing the time and cost of completing a degree after high school. The program also exists in a similar form in Hawaii, Montana, New Hampshire and Illinois. Oklahoma’s “Skills to Rebuild” program trains un- and underemployed workers, including those who already had a college degree, for critical technical jobs unfilled in local communities. These programs barely skim the surface of ways states are working to equip Americans with the skills and knowledge they need to be successful in today’s world.\n\n\n\nThere is a higher education crisis in America, but cancelling existing student debt will not solve it. Our education system is failing to prepare students for the jobs that need to be filled and doing it in a way where the investment is worth the return for the individual. The states are well ahead of the federal government on this front.\n\n\n\nIf President Biden and Democrats really want to solve the post-secondary education crisis, they should let states keep the $300 billion for investment in programs that provide useful and affordable education and training.\n\n\n\nErin Norman is the Lee Family Fellow and a senior messaging strategist at State Policy Network.",

Here was, if not a brave soul, then an electoral model for non-populist conservatives to follow.&#8221;\nHow naive that doubt now seems. Trump-endorsed candidates are thriving in the primaries for the midterm elections. Those who take a stand against him are not. The rout of the Republican lawmaker Liz Cheney in Wyoming this month was retribution for her role in the probe into last year’s siege of the US Capitol. About three-quarters of Republican voters deny that Joe Biden is the legitimately elected US president. Subscribers to the Big Lie include people attaining positions in the election bureaucracy of Arizona and other important states. Trump, if he runs again in 2024, will count on their chicanery.&#8221;\n&#8220;The decay of the GOP is existential for the republic.&#8221;",

        "description": "Oklahoma City forward Chet Holmgren, the No. 2 pick in the NBA draft, will miss the 2022-23 season because of a right foot injury.Holmgren was hurt while playing in a pro-am game last weekend in Seattle, near where he starred last season for Gonzaga, and the Thunder announced Thursday that he sustained a Lisfranc injury. Video appeared to show Holmgren was hurt on a play while defending LeBron James.“We know Chet has a long career ahead of him within our organization and the Oklahoma City community,” Thunder executive vice president and general manager Sam Presti said in a statement. &quot;One of the things that most impressed us during the process of selecting Chet was his determination and focus. We expect that same tenacity will carry him through this period of time as we work together and support him during his rehabilitation.”The 7-foot Holmgren, who is from Minneapolis, averaged 14.1 points and was fourth in the nation last season with 3.7 blocked shots per game.A high draft pick having to sit out his first NBA season isn’t unprecedented, and in some cases it hasn’t stopped players from reaching All-Star or even MVP-caliber levels.Ben Simmons went No. 1 overall in 2016 and missed the following season with a foot injury. Blake Griffin was the top pick in 2009 but had to sit while recovering from a knee injury, as was the case with No. 1 selection Greg Oden in 2007.Reigning NBA scoring champion Joel Embiid was the No. 3 pick in 2014 and missed his first two seasons with foot issues. Nerlens Noel was the No. 6 selection in 2013 and missed what would have been his first season with a knee problem, and Michael Porter Jr. was the 14th pick in the 2018 draft and missed the ensuing season with a back injury.It even happened previously to the Thunder franchise: Nick Collison was the No. 12 pick in the 2003 draft by Seattle, unable to play that following season with shoulder issues. Collison went on to spend his entire career with the Thunder, getting his No. 4 jersey retired — the first such honor bestowed by the team in the Oklahoma City era — and remains part of the team’s front office.There have been other instances of lottery picks missing what could have been their rookie years, including Jonas Valanciunas — the No. 5 selection in 2011 — not being able to join the Toronto Raptors until a year later because of his contract status with his European team at the time. Dario Saric and Ricky Rubio were lottery picks who played with their overseas clubs for two more years before coming to the NBA.And some lottery selections never get to the league at all: Orlando chose Fran Vazquez at No. 11 in 2005, but the Spanish big man never appeared in an NBA game.",

        "description": "By Jessica Lussenhop, ProPublicaProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches, a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.Do you have an experience to share related to new abortion laws in your state? ProPublica reporters want to hear from you. Contact us on Signal at 646-389-9881. For nearly three decades, long before the fall of Roe v. Wade, the blond brick Building for Women in Duluth, Minnesota, has been a destination for patients traveling from other states to get an abortion. They have come from places where abortions were legal but clinics were scarce and from states where restrictive laws have narrowed windows of opportunity. For many residents of northern and central Wisconsin, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan, it was faster to head west toward the Minnesota border than to go southeast to clinics in Milwaukee, Green Bay or Madison. Over the years, thousands of pregnant people climbed the stairs of the Building for Women to get abortions at WE Health Clinic, on the second floor. Treating travelers from other states is nothing new for WE Health or the other abortion providers around the state, but Minnesota’s role as a so-called abortion access island is. The state’s neighbors have either banned abortion, are poised to do so or have severely restricted the procedure.Data kept by Minnesota shows that white people make up a larger share of those who travel from another state for an abortion than those who seek abortions in state, raising questions about whether certain groups — particularly people of color — will be able to make the trip. According to the state’s data, Minnesota residents seeking abortions are a fairly diverse group. From 2018 through 2021, on average, 31 percent of patients were Black, 9 percent were Hispanic, 8 percent were Asian and 2 percent were American Indian; an additional 6 percent were recorded as “other.” White patients accounted for 44 percent. But among those coming from out of state, people of color made up a much smaller percentage on average of the patient population. White people made up 75 percent of out-of-state patients. Experts say some of the disparity results from the fact that the states bordering Minnesota are predominantly white, particularly in the rural areas adjacent to the state. But this also describes Minnesota’s population. So at least some of the difference could be tied to access to transportation or money to travel.“Minnesota is going to become a haven state, but for what percentage of people that actually need our services?” said Paulina Briggs, WE Health Clinic’s laboratory manager and patient educator. “That’s a huge thing.”When Roe was overturned in June, the small staff at WE Health Clinic was dismayed but not surprised. In fact, it was prepared to meet the estimated 10 percet to 25 percent increase in out-of-state patients.“We’ve anticipated this for a long time,” Briggs said. “So it’s not like sudden news to us.”While the clinicians in Duluth may have been prepared for the end of Roe, something much more unexpected happened 2 1/2 weeks later, when a district court judge delivered a surprise ruling that expanded abortion access in the state. Ruling in Doe v. Minnesota, the judge threw out measures that included a mandatory 24-hour waiting period before abortions, two-parent consent for minors and a requirement that physicians discuss medical risks and alternatives to abortion with patients. He also tossed out a requirement that only doctors were allowed to provide abortion care, including by telemedicine, and that after the first trimester, the care had to take place in a hospital.In contrast to the tearful scenes that played out in many clinics after Roe fell, in Minnesota that Monday morning, abortion providers and their support staff celebrated. Laurie Casey, the executive director of WE Health, was behind her long, crowded desk, doing paperwork when she first got news.“It’s like, ‘Oh my God, is this real?’” she said. “Something good happened?”Briggs said: “I think I audibly cheered. Like: ‘Yeah. Hell yeah.’”Lawyers for the plaintiffs in the Minnesota case, which was filed in 2019, had expected to go to trial at the end of August. Instead, the judge granted abortion supporters a big victory, leaving intact two measures: a requirement that abortion providers collect and report data on their patients to the state, and a law that dictates the rules for disposing of fetal remains.Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison, whose office represented the state in the lawsuit, announced that he would not appeal the court’s decision. Ellison also pledged that he would not prosecute abortion-seekers from other states and wouldn’t cooperate with extradition orders from outside jurisdictions.Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz signed an executive order making similar promises.Both officials have made abortion access central tenets of their reelection campaigns.In these early days of a post-Roe reality, it’s not yet clear who will need these protections, though the data can provide clues.States track demographic data on abortion differently; according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than two dozen publicly report the race and ethnicity of patients. Minnesota is the only access island state in the Midwest that releases those numbers; the state also separates that data into resident and nonresident figures.Signs in a window at the Building for Women face North First Avenue East in Duluth.Derek Montgomery for MPR News fileIllinois is projected to accept far more out-of-state patients than Minnesota, but its health department does not release statistics about the race and ethnicity of abortion patients. Kansas allows abortion up to 22 weeks, protects the right to abortion in its Constitution and reports one of the highest rates of out-of-state patients in the country, at nearly 50 percent and second only to Washington, D.C. But Kansas’ state health department does not combine where patients are from with demographic data.From 2008 to 2021, 13,256 patients who live outside Minnesota received abortion care there, an average of about 950 people a year, according to the state health department. Among that population, the racial and ethnic breakdown of patients has held fairly steady.A number of factors play into the lack of diversity, said Asha Hassan, a graduate researcher at the Center for Antiracism Research for Health Equity at the University of Minnesota.“There’s the obvious one that might be coming to mind, which is the effects of the way structural racism and poverty are interwoven,” Hassan said.Caitlin Knowles Myers, a professor at Middlebury College in Vermont who studies the economics of abortion, added, “Obviously resources like ability to take time off, ability to get and pay for child care, etc., etc. — that obviously prevents poor women from making a trip.”Then there is the cost of the procedure itself. In Minnesota, residents can use state medical assistance funds to pay for an abortion under certain circumstances; out-of-state residents cannot. According to Our Justice, a nonprofit that provides financial assistance for abortion care and travel to Minnesota, in-clinic abortion services can cost $400 to $2,000, depending on the gestational age of the pregnancy. A locally based telemedicine service and mobile clinic called Just the Pill charges $350 for abortion medication.Shayla Walker, executive director of Our Justice, said her organization helps people work through the kinds of barriers to travel that pregnant people of color face every day. Undocumented patients, for instance, may not have a driver’s license or other form of identification, meaning that flying from states like Texas or Oklahoma is out of the question.Of the out-of-state patients who come to Minnesota, residents from neighboring Wisconsin make up the vast majority. And like Minnesota and its neighboring states, Wisconsin is predominantly white: 80.4 percent of residents identified as such in the 2020 U.S. Census.From 2008 to 2021, an average of 690 patients from Wisconsin received abortion care in Minnesota each year. The proportion of Wisconsinites has dropped over the years — in 2008, 80 percent of out-of-state abortion patients reported that they lived in Wisconsin, compared with 63 percent by 2021. Over that same period, South Dakota residents ticked up from 4 percent to 16 percent, and Iowa patients rose from 2 percent to 6 percent.According to Myers, the lack of abortion providers in western and central Wisconsin likely drives the traffic across the border to Minnesota. These parts of the state are largely rural and mostly white. Wisconsin’s more diverse urban centers are concentrated in the southern and eastern parts of the state, much closer to the Illinois border.“A lot of them are likely to end up heading south to the Chicago area,” Myers said. “The Chicago area also has a lot of providers and likely a lot of capacity. And the question for Minnesota is, if the Chicago area ends up unable to absorb an enormous influx of patients heading their way from all directions, then you would expect to see patients spilling over into Minneapolis.”Leaders of the Options Fund, which provides financial help to pregnant people in rural central and western Wisconsin who are seeking abortions, said the majority of the money they provide is for care that takes place in Minnesota.“Certainly it’s not that people of color don’t exist, of course,” said the group’s vice president, who spoke on the condition of anonymity out of concern for her safety. “But I think generally, the more rural we get, the more white it’s going to be.”Of course, the data from Minnesota is backward-looking, from years when abortion was still legal, though restricted or sometimes difficult to access, in surrounding states. There are certain to be shifts in where patients travel from, most obviously North Dakota, where the state’s lone abortion clinic moved from Fargo to its Minnesota sister city of Moorhead, just across the border. And as reproductive rights supporters across the country respond to the end of Roe, abortion funds have reported huge increases in their donations, which may bring travel and abortion care in Minnesota within the grasp of more low-income pregnant people and people of color.The first week after the Doe v. Minnesota decision, WE Health Clinic’s patients felt the impact. Casey said she was able to tell a mother that her minor daughter could receive an abortion without the permission of her long-absent father or from a judge. Briggs was able to schedule a next-day abortion, which would have been illegal before the judge’s decision.At some point, a clinic worker went through intake folders and pulled out all the forms certifying that “state mandated information” had been provided to patients. They were fed into the office shredder.Tossing out their scripts, canceling the physician phone calls 24 hours in advance, no longer going down to the county courthouse to ask judges to grant their minor patients special permission to have an abortion — all of this will save the WE Health Clinic workers hours every week.Beyond that, the court ruling — which abortion opponents are seeking to have overturned — has the potential to increase the number of providers, as advanced clinicians like nurse practitioners and some classifications of midwives may now be able to get training, and eventually provide abortion care and telemedicine.This pivotal moment for abortion care in Minnesota and the country at large comes at a moment of major transition for WE Health as well. Casey is looking at retirement in the coming year, which means much of the work of adapting the clinic to serve patients in a post-Roe world will fall to her staff, including Briggs.Briggs started working at the clinic six years ago, when she was just 21. She wanted to do this work after receiving her own abortion at WE Health as a college student, an experience she found at once “nonchalant” and “empowering.”She is troubled by the disparities in who might be able to make it across the borders and climb the stairs of the Building for Women, to receive the kind of life-changing care that she did. Just keeping the doors open does not mean the care will be equitable.Haru Coryne contributed data analysis.",

        "description": "The Yankees will place left-hander Nestor Cortes on the 15-day injured list prior to tomorrow&#8217;s game, according to The Athletic&#8217;s Lindsey Adler.  Cortes is suffering from a groin injury.  As reported earlier today, New York was preparing to place a then-unknown pitcher on the IL to make room for the promotion of minor league right-hander Greg Weissert.\nWhile any pitching injury would&#8217;ve been a setback, losing Cortes for any amount of time is a tough blow to the Bronx Bombers.  &#8220;Nasty Nestor&#8221; has been arguably the Yankees&#8217; best starter this season, and one of the better pitchers in all of baseball.  After surprisingly emerging as a rotation stalwart in 2021, Cortes has kept on rolling, posting a 2.68 ERA and above-average strikeout (25.9%) and walk (5.8%) rates over 131 innings of work.  Despite a low-velocity four-seamer, Cortes&#8217; fastball has been extremely effective, and his cutter isn&#8217;t far behind in terms of sheer effectiveness.\nThough Cortes&#8217; 131 innings is a new career high for the 27-year old over any pro season, there hasn&#8217;t been much sign that Cortes is slowing down, and he was expected to be a big weapon for the Yankees in October.  This 15-day IL stint could perhaps serve as a bit of break in terms of keeping Cortes&#8217; arm fresh, though naturally his groin issue is now a new concern.  The severity of the injury or a possible timeline for Cortes&#8217; return isn&#8217;t yet known.\nNew York enjoyed a great run of pitching health over the first half of the season, but several injuries have cropped up in recent weeks.  The bullpen has taken the brunt of the injury woes, but the rotation hasn&#8217;t been immune, with Luis Severino out until mid-September due to a lat strain and now Cortes&#8217; injury.  The Yankees acquired Frankie Montas from the A&#8217;s at the deadline but also moved Jordan Montgomery to the Cardinals in another trade, plus Domingo German has been a little inconsistent (if generally solid) since making his season debut in July, after shoulder problems kept him on the sidelines.\nClarke Schmidt was recently called back up to the active roster, and the former first-rounder seems like the probable candidate to step into Cortes&#8217; rotation spot.  Over 22 games and 45 2/3 career innings at the MLB level in 2020-22, Schmidt has only made three starts, but the Yankees have mostly been using him in long relief this season and were stretching him out at Triple-A.",

        "description": "Europe&#8217;s largest nuclear power plant at Zaporizhzhia in southern Ukraine was disconnected from the power grid, Ukrainian nuclear operator Energoatom said Thursday, warning that creates a safety risk.\n\n\n\n&#8220;The actions of the invaders caused a complete disconnection of the ZNPP from the power grid — for the first time in the history of the plant,&#8221; Energoatom said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe power plant — which has six reactors, two of which are operating — was seized by Russian troops in March but its daily operation has remained under the control of Ukrainian staff.\n\n\n\nThe Ukrainian utility said that fires at ash dumps near the power plant twice cut off the last transmission line linking the facility to the Ukrainian grid. It added that three other transmission lines &#8220;were damaged during Russian shelling earlier.&#8221; \n\n\n\nHowever, the Russian-installed regional governor said: &#8220;At the moment, the power supply to all cities and districts of the Zaporizhzhia region has been restored&#8221; from the plant after earlier disruptions, CNN reported.\n\n\n\nRafael Mariano Grossi, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, told France 24 earlier Thursday: &#8220;If you have the external power feeding the plant and thus feeding the cooling system of the reactors interrupted, then you could be very, very soon in a place where you don’t want to be&#8221; and that could potentially &#8220;lead to a nuclear accident.&#8221;\n\n\n\nGrossi added that he is still negotiating the terms of an IAEA safety mission to Zaporizhzhia and hopes to go there &#8220;within days.&#8221;",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/chrome-biometrics-form-data",
        "description": "Last month an experimental flag was spotted in the Chromium Gerrit repository, which pointed at biometric authentication coming to desktops. This flag was described as being another option for authenticating when viewing saved passwords, not as a replacement. Currently, you are prompted to re-authenticate when trying to view a saved password by entering your computer password on Windows and Mac. In contrast, the authentication method on ChromeOS is via your Google password. The proposed changes would allow you to use biometrics in devices with the necessary hardware, much as you can currently do on mobile devices like smartphones and tablets.\n\n\n\nAs a follow-up to this new feature, Google is now adding an option to use biometric authentication when filling out form data, not just when viewing passwords. This will also be optional, with a flag that will add the toggle to your Chrome settings. This was discovered by u/Leopeva64-2, who had been following this new feature as it matured in the repositories.\n\n\n\nNew #biometric-authentication-for-filling Chrome flagSource: u/Leopeva64-2\n\n\nEnabling this flag and then subsequently toggling on the setting will require anyone on that device to enter some type of authentication before filling out form data. Acceptable biometrics could be a fingerprint, face unlock, or a PIN, depending on the device. In a demo of how the feature currently works in Edge, u/Leopeva64-2 showed this feature works very similar to when you want to view a saved password, with the system prompting for your credentials before proceeding.\n\n\n\nSince this feature will not be on by default and, for now, requires a flag, I do not see many users opting in to use it.

        "description": "An attorney who helped develop former President Donald Trump’s last-ditch strategy to subvert the 2020 election moved Thursday to block a subpoena for his testimony to an Atlanta-area grand jury investigating potential crimes connected to the effort. Kenneth Chesebro, who helped craft a plan to use false presidential electors to undermine the certification of Joe Biden’s victory, contended that he had an attorney-client relationship with the Trump campaign, which prevented him from appearing for an Aug. 30 interview. In a nine-page filing in Fulton County Superior Court, Chesebro contended that the Trump campaign itself had “instructed” him to “maintain all applicable privileges and confidentiality.” “Any testimony from Mr. Chesebro would necessarily relate to Mr. Chesebro’s representation of a former client — the Trump campaign,” he argued via his attorney, Scott Grubman. While Trump has had a number of formal and semi-formal lawyers working on his behalf at various times, it’s unclear if Chesebro ever served in an official capacity. Two senior Trump campaign officials said they could neither recall nor remember his involvement, leaving unaddressed the idea that he had been advised by the campaign to assert privilege. According to FEC filings, Chesebro has never received any payment from any of Trump’s political committees either during the 2020 election or in the years since. Grubman declined to answer questions about Chesebro’s formal relationship with the campaign.  \"Lawyers take on clients in many different circumstances,” he said in a statement. “What is consistent in all circumstances are the professional and ethical duties lawyers owe to those clients, primarily to represent them zealously and to always maintain their confidences.” Similar questions about representation emerged during litigation between the Jan. 6 select committee and John Eastman, another architect of Trump’s post-2020 strategy to stay in power. When a judge pressed Eastman to prove his attorney-client relationship to Trump, he filed an unsigned retainer agreement that raised additional questions. Chesebro is asking the judge overseeing the matter to call a hearing at which District Attorney Fani Willis, the lead investigator, would “be required to identify their planned areas of inquiry so that the parties can litigate this issue before Mr. Chesebro’s grand jury appearance.” The grand jury subpoenaed Chesebro for his testimony on July 12, at the same time it also sought appearances from several other figures in Trump’s orbit during the chaotic post-2020 election period. Those figures include Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), and Trump attorneys Rudy Giuliani, Cleta Mitchell and Eastman, who worked closely with Chesebro to develop the elector strategy. The probe — one of several advancing investigations into Trump — has emerged as an acute threat to the former president, focusing on his efforts to pressure state election officials to “find” enough votes to put him ahead in Georgia. Giuliani testified to the grand jury earlier this month, but it’s unclear if he asserted any privileges during the closed door session. Giuliani was recently informed by Willis that he has become a target of her probe. In fact, it was a memo drafted by Chesebro and sent to Giuliani, describing a day-to-day plan to attempt to disrupt the transition of power to Biden during a joint session of Congress on Jan. 6, 2021, that a federal judge in California ruled was evidence of a likely conspiracy between Eastman and Trump. Chesebro revealed in the filing that he had waived any challenge to the subpoena in New York, where a judge ordered him on July 25 to appear before the grand jury. He contended that as a New York-based lawyer, he is also required to maintain a duty of “confidentiality” that extends beyond attorney-client privilege.

        "description": "House Homeland Security Committee Chair Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.) and Rep. Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), chair of a cybersecurity subcommittee, are demanding that Twitter respond to allegations from a whistleblower about major security deficiencies that the Democrats said could pose national security threats.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Democrats sent a letter to Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal on Thursday asking for details about security flaws identified in whistleblower Peiter Zatko’s complaint, and about action Twitter took in response to warnings raised by Zatko during his time at Twitter or after his departure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThompson and Clarke underscored the need for Twitter to take proactive steps to protect users with the upcoming midterm elections around the corner, calling it an “inflection point” for American democracy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Twitter plays a unique role in our information and political ecosystems. Security flaws that put users’ sensitive personal data within easy reach of a hacker looking to take control of a high-profile account or a foreign dictator looking for information on dissidents are nothing short of a threat to national security,” they wrote.\n\n\n\n“If substantiated, the whistleblower allegations demonstrate a pattern of willful disregard for the personal data of Twitter users and the integrity of the platform.”\n\n\n\nZatko was Twitter’s former security chief. He filed an 84-page complaint alleging widespread security deficiencies at Twitter, according to a copy of the complaint reported by The Washington Post earlier this week. The disclosure was reportedly sent to the Department of Justice, Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Securities and Exchange Commission, as well as several congressional committees.  \n\n\n\nA spokesperson for Twitter did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Democrats’ letter. The company pushed back on the allegations raised by Zatko earlier this week, calling it a “false narrative” and “riddled with inconsistencies and inaccuracies.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZatko alleges Twitter has not been complying with a 2011 consent order from the FTC that called for the social media platform to create and maintain a security program to protect privacy and nonpublic consumer information. \n\n\n\nHe also alleged the platform is vulnerable to exploitation by foreign governments.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nZatko is slated to testify before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Sept. 13. ",

When Alford graduated with his Bachelor of Arts in political science with a minor in Black studies, he was around $50,000 in debt.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNow, at 30, with his Master of Science in adult and higher education, that number is closer to $120,000.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAlford is one of millions of Black Americans who have been disproportionately impacted by the student loan crisis. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBlack student loan borrowers hold the most debt out of any other racial group. An April&nbsp;report by PBS NewsHour&nbsp;found that, among 2016 graduates, nearly 40 percent of Black students graduated college with $30,000 or more in debt compared to only 29 percent of white students, 23 percent of Hispanic students and 18 percent of Asian students.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresident Biden on Wednesday announced a plan to&nbsp;cancel up to $10,000&nbsp;in student loans for Americans making less than $125,000 annually. But Alford, like many other Black Americans, had mixed emotions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s cool, but it really doesn’t mean anything,” said Alford. “I feel like there were promises for more, and I feel like more could be done to ease the burden on people of color and first generation students.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSome progressives&nbsp;praised&nbsp;Biden’s announcement; others, like those in the Congressional Black Caucus ,(CBC) called for more focus on the impact the crisis&nbsp;has had on Black borrowers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The burden of student loan debt has disproportionately impacted Black borrowers for far too long, leaving many stuck with thousands of dollars of debt, hindering their abilities to plan for the future and build intergenerational wealth,” said CBC Chairwoman Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) in a statement Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nShe applauded the president’s decision, saying it will “provide much-needed relief to Black borrowers,” but added that the caucus would&nbsp;continue to “push additional reforms to ensure current and future borrowers are not subjected to this cycle of burdensome debt.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBeatty’s is a sentiment shared by the NAACP.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"Many people were wiped out of homeownership because their credit-debt ratio was too high to qualify for homeownership or for quality housing.” \n\n\n\nFor months, the NAACP has called on the Biden administration to cancel a “bare minimum” of $50,000 in student loan debt.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“If student debt repayments can be paused over and over and over again, there's no reason why the President cannot cancel a minimum of $50,000,” the NAACP said in a critical&nbsp;statement Tuesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Biden’s move to forgive up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients —&nbsp;46 percent of whom are Black&nbsp;— saw Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP, walk back some of the organization’s criticism.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That goes to the president's commitment to address the racial wealth gap,” Johnson told The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Student Borrower Protection Center (SBPC) has also indicated the debt has exacerbated racial financial inequities.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The first thing you have to understand is the fact that student debt is not only a direct reflection of systemic disparities we have in this country, but it also continues to perpetuate them,” said Kat Welbeck, director of advocacy and the civil rights counsel at the SBPC.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelbeck said Biden’s decision was a positive and historic action, but added there is more to do to fix the “broken student loan system.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo do that, she argued, there must be an acknowledgement of the cyclical nature the crisis has on Black families.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“When it's time for [Black] families to send their children to school, they have less wealth to be able to pay for college,” said Welbeck. “So Black borrowers are not only more likely to borrow but also borrow higher amounts. When Black students leave school, they then also have these higher student debt balances that cuts into opportunities for wealth building over a lifetime.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd the “No. 1 accelerator” for wealth building is homeownership, Johnson said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Many people were wiped out of homeownership because their credit-debt ratio was too high to qualify for homeownership or for quality housing,” explained Johnson. “In order for us to address this gap, we first have to deal with the student loan crisis, which is one of the number one held debts that many African Americans hold.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPart of what’s kept Black families from building “intergenerational wealth” like homeownership, Welbeck added, has been the continued need for Black families to seek more and more student loans.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Because of the way that the repayment system is set up, people are only making payments on the interest and not principal, so their balances balloon over time,” said Welbeck. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis then forces families into taking out parent PLUS loans for their children, adding to their own debt.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat’s why 19-year-old college sophomore Nia Cloyd hasn’t taken out any loans yet, despite her tuition payments piling up. Her fear over debt repayment has her wondering if college is even the right choice for her anymore.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It's just all about the money,” said Cloyd. “You have to worry about the back end of the money and your financial situation and can I even get a degree if I don't pay my tuition?”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe concerns over debt repayment stopped Cloyd from going to her dream school. So when she heard about Biden’s loan forgiveness, she said it’s simply not enough for families like hers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The tuition that stopped me was $75,000 a year,” said Cloyd. Ten thousand dollars or even $20,000 is “still not enough equality” for Black families like hers, she added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut the $50,000 forgiveness the NAACP has been pushing for would be, she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“That will cover room, board, books, transportation – all the little fees that they add on,” said Cloyd.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCloyd said that putting off taking out loans is tied up in her desire to get ahead and build a better life. She’d always been told college would set her up for a successful, prosperous future. But after watching her mother struggle to pay her own student debt, Cloyd worries taking out loans would perpetuate a cycle of financial instability.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelbeck said this is a common feeling, especially among Black families, because wealth and income are two different things.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“You can have a lot of Black borrowers who might have an income that may not make them eligible now for debt forgiveness but … they have a very high debt to income ratio,” Welbeck explained. “You don't necessarily have a high income, because you might have a negative net worth because your debt is so high.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat’s exactly what 28-year-old Leonard is struggling with.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLeonard, who asked for his last name to be withheld, went to college with the help of Pell Grants. But he now makes an annual salary of $140,000, disqualifying him from this round of loan forgiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“While I am a higher earner and am better off than someone making a fraction of what I make, I still live paycheck to paycheck in NYC and am already freaking out about the repayment pause ending in December,” Leonard told The Hill in an email.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I come from a low-income family and sometimes help family members financially,” he added. “There should be some kind of forgiveness for recipients who are ‘high earners’ but are economically disadvantaged compared to the large majority of high earners (i.e higher earning white people).”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJohnson said situations like Leonard’s have actually been discussed between the NAACP and the administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We recognize that 90 percent of our borrowers will be able to qualify under the terms that the president announced,” said Johnson. “But with that there were individuals in the hole of the donut without high wealth … and we've got to continue to push the administration to figure out a way to address that population.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFor Johnson, voting in lawmakers who also want to eradicate student debt — including interest — will be the only way to accomplish the minimum $50,000 forgiveness.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWednesday’s announcement, he said, is one more action in a long line of successes that should be on voters’ minds ahead of midterms and the 2024 presidential election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe NAACP plans to keep pushing the Department of Education to make it easier for borrowers to qualify for relief programs and make sure those who are working in the public sector — like teachers, law enforcement and firemen — will have an easier time qualifying for the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Education is our future,” said Johnson. “We need to seek a different model so we're not financing the future of this country on the backs of low income students. That isn't fair.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) filed a complaint on Wednesday alleging Starbucks illegally withheld wages and benefits from employees at unionized stores and those in the process of unionizing.\n\n\n\nThe 30-page complaint also alleges interim CEO Howard Schultz made a number of illegal statements under federal labor laws, including video calls where he told employees it would be futile for them to unionize and made implied promises of increased benefits to those who did not organize.\n\n\n\n“Any new benefit that we create for the company, we are not permitted by law, to offer that benefit to stores that voted for the union while they are in collective bargaining,” Schultz stated on a companywide call on April 11, according to the complaint.\n\n\n\nA Starbucks store in Buffalo, N.Y., became the first U.S. location to unionize in December, and more than 200 stores have since successfully held votes to join the union. Starbucks has battled many of those unionization efforts in court.\n\n\n\nThe pay increases, which became effective on Aug. 1, increased hourly rates for nonunion employees hired before May 2 to either $15 per hour or by 3 percent, whichever was higher. Employees with two or more years at the company received further increases.\n\n\n\nThe international president of the union sent a letter to Schultz the same day waiving the union’s bargaining rights and asking the company to extend the changes to unionized employees, calling Schultz’s belief that such a move was illegal “misleading at best.”\n\n\n\nThe NLRB’s complaint asks an administrative judge to require Starbucks to retroactively provide unionized employees with the increased wages and benefits and issue a letter of apology. \n\n\n\nThe NLRB also asked the judge to mandate a nationwide electronic notice posting for Starbucks employees, a video of Schultz reading the posting and a nationwide training session for managers and supervisors about federal labor laws.\n\n\n\n“Howard Schultz made the decision to deprive us of a raise in a time where the cost of living is skyrocketing,” Maggie Carter, a barista from Knoxville, Tenn., said in a statement distributed by the union.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“He claims to run a ‘different kind of company’, yet in reality, Howard Schultz is simply a billionaire bully who is doing everything he can to crush workers’ rights,” she continued.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn NLRB administrative judge will hold a hearing on Oct. 25 to consider the complaint.\n\n\n\nA Starbucks spokesperson did not return a request for comment.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/changing-america/respect/equality/3615632-omaha-archdiocese-releases-new-human-sexuality-policy-for-catholic-schools/",
        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Archdiocese of Omaha has rolled out a new policy for its 70 member schools to follow on “human sexuality,” whereby students, school staff and volunteers are required to use names and pronouns consistent with their sex assigned at birth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudents and staff under the policy will conduct themselves in accordance with their sex assigned at birth at all times publicly, including in virtual spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThose who refuse to comply with the changes will be dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Archdiocese of Omaha has instructed its schools to follow a new policy on “human sexuality,” by which students may be expelled and teachers may lose their jobs if they ask to be identified using pronouns or a name inconsistent with their sex assigned at birth.\n\n\n\nThe 70 Catholic schools in the archdiocese will be expected beginning Jan. 1 to follow a slate of policies that were designed to avoid confusion or “scandal” caused by a child’s expression of their gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\n\n\nUnder the new guidelines, which have been handed out to area schools in recent weeks, every current and prospective student and their parents must agree to “respect Catholic teaching concerning faith and morals, and particularly those addressing human sexuality.”\n\n\n\nThe policy also applies to all school employees and volunteers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA student cannot be enrolled in – and may be dismissed from – a Catholic school in the archdiocese if they “resist” the school’s instruction on “respecting the human person” by using a different name or pronouns than those they were assigned at birth or receive gender-affirming medical care including puberty blockers or hormones.\n\n\n\nStudents are required to conduct themselves in accordance with their sex assigned at birth “at all times publicly” – including online – and adhere to their school’s dress code or uniform policy. Access to facilities like multi-person restrooms and locker rooms will be determined by students’ sex assigned at birth.\n\n\n\nIf parents of transgender children do not willingly withdraw them from a Catholic school in the archdiocese, the school will dismiss the student and refer the family to counseling or mental health treatment.\n\n\n\nSchools under the policy “will not refer families to counselors or mental health providers who do not uphold Catholic teaching in their practices.”\n\n\n\nThe Archdiocese of Omaha did not immediately respond to Changing America’s request for comment, but Deacon Tim McNeil, a spokesperson for the archdiocese, told the Omaha World-Herald this week that the policy’s introduction should not come as a surprise.\n\n\n\n“The church has been clear,” McNeil said. “Pope Francis has been clear. Pope Benedict was clear. Pope John Paul II was clear about this. Catechism is clear.”\n\n\n\nThe new policy states that transitioning socially, medically or legally is “not a reality and not valid in the Catholic Church.”\n\n\n\nAccording to McNeil, school leaders have responded favorably to the new guidelines and are eager to work with students and parents to ensure they are implemented compassionately.\n\n\n\nThe policy specifies that students are encouraged to respectfully and thoughtfully question Catholic teachings in the classroom, but “showing hostility toward or defiance of Church teaching demonstrates that a student is not a proper fit for the school.”",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/congress-blog/3615621-17000-people-say-the-internet-is-already-broken/",
        "description": "As the leaders of the Artist Rights Alliance, Copyright Alliance, and CreativeFuture, we believe in the right of creative people to make a living through their creativity, ingenuity, and hard work. But that work is being undermined by the existential threat of digital piracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTechnology and widespread digital piracy have outpaced the notice and takedown system Congress established in 1998 with the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA). Piracy is destroying livelihoods and careers and harming innovation and the U.S. economy —&nbsp;to the tune of at least $47.5 billion and 230,000–560,000 jobs lost every year. Too many American creatives face the impossible task of policing the global internet for tens of thousands —many times, millions —of infringements of their copyrighted works.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn other words, under the current legal framework, a few tech giants have profited — to a degree that retired Harvard Business School professor Shoshana Zuboff has called “world-historical.” They have done so at the expense of those who make so much of the original content that draws users to internet platforms in the first place. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nAs leaders of three different creative coalitions, we think that’s a sure sign of a broken system, but you don’t have to take our word for it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfter an extensive, multi-year study, the U.S. Copyright Office concluded that the “balance” the DMCA sought to achieve “has been tilted askew.” Recently, over 17,000 Americans signed a petition calling for commonsense copyright law reforms. They aren’t stars or celebrities. Rather, they are independent creatives fighting to defend their rights and livelihoods online, as well as supporters of the creative industries.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCommendably, the Senate is currently considering the Strengthening Measures to Advance Rights Technologies (SMART) Copyright Act, a bill that proposes a new approach to the implementation of technical measures to prevent infringement. Congress expected tech companies to work with copyright owners to adopt such measures when it enacted the DMCA a quarter century ago, but as the U.S. Copyright Office observed, not a single automated tool has achieved official recognition as a Standard Technical Measure under the DMCA in nearly three decades. If enacted, the SMART Copyright Act would help achieve the balance Congress intended by establishing stronger incentives for tech companies to fulfill their responsibility to prevent abuse on their platforms and services.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis would be a small but significant step toward achieving Congress’s original goal and would help to bring the DMCA into the 21st century. In addition to clarifying and improving the DMCA Standard Technical Measure framework, the SMART Copyright Act would create a new system through which effective technical measures to address online infringement could be designated and implemented. Through a careful and flexible process, the Copyright Office could ensure that tools to effectively combat piracy are implemented consistently and in a way that addresses the concerns of service providers, copyright owners, and internet users. Importantly, the bill also has a number of built-in safeguards to protect against smaller services being unduly burdened or internet users being harmed, and to ensure that due process and free speech concerns are effectively addressed.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOpponents of updates to our copyright laws often claim that they will impede free speech or even “break the internet.” Such tired rhetoric rings hollow here. These commonsense reforms simply give internet companies a “duty of reasonable care” to protect the users and others who are most directly impacted by their platforms, just like brick-and-mortar businesses have done for decades. The SMART Copyright Act doesn’t seek to impose any burdensome standards or mandates. It simply creates a process by which the Copyright Office can gather information, vet ideas through rigorous and transparent processes, and engage stakeholders in identifying antipiracy approaches that have proven to be safe, practical, and effective in the marketplace.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAn internet that devastates content creators while bringing enormous profits to platforms is already broken. Users don’t access Google Search, YouTube, or Facebook to admire the source code. (In fact, it’s carefully guarded.) People use the internet to read articles and books, listen to music, watch television and movies, view photographs, play video games, and enjoy other expressions of creativity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOnline platforms have undermined creative professions, jeopardizing prospects for future creativity. Fortunately, we can fix the broken internet — a good place to start would be to consider adding the SMART Copyright Act to the toolbox.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCongress should act now — by bringing the DMCA into the 21st century and ensuring that creatives, through their hard work and ingenuity, can make a living creating the art and entertainment that is beloved by people around the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStacey Dansky is the executive director of the Artist Rights Alliance, an artist-run non-profit fighting for musicians, songwriters and performers in the digital landscape. Stacey previously worked on Capitol Hill as a senior counsel for the House Judiciary Committee.

Would this be the same Tony Blair who, back in 2004, vetoed the introduction of the radical reforms recommended by the Tomlinson report on the 14-19 curriculum?As I remember, Mike Tomlinson’s plans were comprehensive, coherent and widely supported by those of us keen to see the introduction of a more appropriate curriculum for young people. What a shame that, when it was required, Blair lacked the political courage to support the radical reforms so clearly needed.

Governments and businesses should speak upHosting an Olympics is the “ultimate goal”, Saudi Arabia’s sports minister has confirmed. Prince Abdulaziz bin Turki al-Faisal was speaking as Anthony Joshua fought Ukraine’s Oleksandr Usyk in Jeddah on Sunday – and one day after the United Nations human rights office denounced the 34-year prison sentence handed to Salma al-Shehab, a PhD student at Leeds University, for sharing Twitter messages. It is reportedly the longest known sentence for a women’s rights activist there.That the heavyweight title fight overshadowed her case should not surprise us. The international horror and condemnation at Jamal Khashoggi’s murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul did not last long, despite the CIA concluding that it was ordered by Mohammed bin Salman; the country’s crown prince and de facto ruler denies responsibility. Joe Biden vowed to make the country a “pariah”. But last month he bumped fists with the crown prince, for minimal noticeable return.

        "description": "ALBANY, N.Y. — Rep. Elise Stefanik represents a region on the opposite side of the state from New York’s new 23rd congressional district. Yet she went to great lengths to affect the outcome of the Republican primary there on Tuesday — and failed. Stefanik not only endorsed Carl Paladino, a Buffalo developer and one of the most controversial figures in modern New York politics. She also dispatched her trusted aides to the district in Western New York, where they personally advised the candidate. It helped that former President Donald Trump told Stefanik to get behind Paladino, according to a Republican familiar with their discussions. It certainly helped too that Paladino had supported some of Stefanik’s past races — even before she became the third-ranking member of the House GOP. “Loyalty,” the Republican said, “is everything to Elise.” But what also appears to have driven her was a running feud with the man who ultimately won the primary: Nick Langworthy, the chair of the state GOP. And local leaders took notice. Some said on Wednesday that Stefanik’s backing of Paladino over Langworthy was clear evidence of long-held grudges, not a political strategy for the good of the party. “She was trying to get back at Nick for things that had nothing to do with this race — personal reasons,” said Rodney Strange, a Chemung County legislator and former county GOP chair who backed Langworthy. Stefanik’s failure to do so might not hurt her standing in Washington, where she’s become an influential far-right figure deeply loyal to Trump. In New York, where Langworthy has clout and a more moderate wing of the party behind him, it might give her a diminished role, especially when it comes to the selection of a new leader for the state party. It’s not the only blow she took on Tuesday: Stefanik also stumped heavily for Republican Marc Molinaro, who lost a special election to fill the remainder of a Hudson Valley congressional seat.    In the 23rd district, which covers Buffalo’s suburbs and stretches across much of New York’s Southern Tier border with Pennsylvania, some local leaders were left unhappy by Stefanik’s involvement in the race. Some said it might have backfired with voters ahead of the general election — exposing them to one of the most extreme members of their party. \"I was highly disappointed about her position on the race,\" Dwight “Mike” Healy, the chair of the Allegany County GOP, said. \"It wasn’t in the best interest of our district, for sure.\" One Republican who has been involved in multiple local Republican races said Langworthy’s win was a “black eye” on Stefanik’s leadership because she chose to back a candidate that few of her colleagues in Washington viewed as a stable addition to the delegation. (Paladino once called Adolf Hitler “the kind of leader we need.”) Stefanik senior adviser Alex deGrasse, in a statement, pointed to the congresswoman's yearslong ties with Paladino and affirmed her strong support for him “in this very close race.” But he emphasized her priority now is taking back control of the House. “As the highest ranking NY Republican in Congress (and will be the longest serving in the next Congress), she looks forward to working with the entire NY Republican delegation including Nick Langworthy in the next Congress,” deGrasse said in a statement. “She is focused on picking up as many seats for Republicans in NY and across the country to earn a historic Republican Majority.“ Langworthy declared victory in the early hours Wednesday morning as he slowly took the lead over Paladino. After initially refusing to concede, Paladino later on Wednesday issued a statement thanking voters, Stefanik and his other backers “for their friendship and support” and said, “it is time to move onto the next chapter of my life.” Now Langworthy is a favorite in a November matchup against Democrat Max Della Pia in a district where Trump received 59 percent of the vote in 2020.    Langworthy has promised to relinquish his role as state Republican chair, which he’s had since 2019, if and when he is sworn into the House of Representatives. He spent his tenure prioritizing a GOP win in this year’s gubernatorial election and has spent over a year working to get his party’s nod for Rep. Lee Zeldin, who won the primary in June. His early backing of Zeldin was one thing that had inflamed his relationship with Stefanik, who was said to be weighing her own potential run at Albany. New York Republicans have not won a statewide race since 2002. Zeldin faces a tough battle against Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul in November, and Langworthy’s earned some criticism for setting his sights on Congress instead of the multiple state and local battleground races in New York. But he said on Wednesday in an interview on NewsRadio WHAM 1180 that he believes his mission is nearly complete. He was “brought in as brawler to take on Andrew Cuomo and Kathy Hochul,” he said. “My hope is that we have a brand new governor in Lee Zeldin that will be able to select a chair of the party of his choice to help move his agenda forward,” Langworthy told host Bob Lonsberry, who also supported his candidacy. Langworthy acknowledged that Tuesday’s elections — though an outlier as the second of New York’s bifurcated primaries this year — do give the GOP reason for pause. Democrat Pat Ryan's victory over Molinaro in the Hudson Valley swing district, for example, was a contest many see as a bellwether for November. Anyone who foresees a “total red wave” doesn’t understand that Republicans have a lot of work to do, he said. “Democrats have more wind in their sails here the last several months — they are organizing, raising a lot of funds after the Roe decision was overturned,” he said. “Republicans have to be prepared.” In the 23rd district race, the election seemed to split GOP voters, with Langworthy up about 4 percentage points — 52.1 percent to 47.9 percent — with most of the vote tallied. Paladino, who has gained notoriety for unashamed inflammatory rhetoric over more than a decade in and out of New York politics, won in the Buffalo suburbs where he has widespread recognition as a diehard Trump defender. Stefanik hosted a get out the vote tele-rally for him the day before the polls opened. “Carl Paladino was going to be another Marjorie Taylor Greene if elected, and sure enough, two days before the election, she endorses him,” Strange, the Chemung County legislator, said. “We don’t need that. We need someone who is going to go to Washington and fight for us and use common sense and get the job done. It would have been a disaster if Carl Paladino would have been the nominee.” The Paladino campaign did not immediately return request for comment. Langworthy — though largely considered the underdog during his short campaign — focused his efforts on the state’s Southern Tier, along its border with Pennsylvania, and the six rural counties in the district. All went overwhelmingly for him. \"Carl didn’t give us the time of day,\" Schuyler County GOP chair Larry Jaynes said Wednesday, explaining that only a cadre of Paladino advisers met with him. \"Nick has been here many, many times, and I never got a call from Carl asking for time or anything else for Schuyler County.\" Joe Spector contributed to this report",

        "description": "Two Florida residents pleaded guilty on Thursday to conspiring to traffic in stolen goods for selling a diary and other personal effects of President Joe Biden’s daughter Ashley Biden, the Justice Department said. The criminal charges are the first to emerge from a federal investigation into how, prior to the 2020 presidential election, the journal reached the conservative video outlet Project Veritas. The group has said it paid for rights to publish the diary, but never did so because it couldn’t authenticate it. Contents from the diary later emerged on a more obscure conservative site. Last November, the FBI carried out search warrants at the home of the founder of Project Veritas, James O’Keefe, and those of two of his colleagues, in connection with the investigation. None of those individuals have been charged, but O’Keefe has denounced the raids as an attack on press freedom. In a Manhattan federal court hearing on Thursday, Aimee Harris, 40, of Palm Beach and Robert Kurlander, 58, of Jupiter each pleaded guilty to a single conspiracy charge stemming from their involvement in selling the journal, the U.S. Attorney’s Office in Manhattan said in a statement. “Harris and Kurlander stole personal property from an immediate family member of a candidate for national political office,” Damian Williams, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York, said in a statement. “They sold the property to an organization in New York for $40,000 and even returned to take more of the victim’s property when asked to do so. Harris and Kurlander sought to profit from their theft of another person’s personal property, and they now stand convicted of a federal felony as a result.” The charging document filed on Thursday says that after Harris told Kurlander what she had discovered, he texted her that they could “make a SHIT TON of money” off of the journal. The pair tried to offer the diary to the Trump campaign, but an unidentified representative of the campaign turned them down and suggested they give the materials to the FBI. “They want it to go to the FBI. There is NO WAY [Candidate-2] can use this. It has to be done a different way,” Kurlander texted to Harris, according to the filing. Both defendants pleaded guilty as part of agreements with prosecutors. Kurlander has agreed to cooperate with investigators as part of his deal, Williams’ office said. Details of the plea agreement were not immediately available. Each defendant faces a maximum possible sentence of five years in prison, but defendants are typically sentenced under federal guidelines that usually call for a sentence well below the maximum. Harris and Kurlander have each agreed to forfeit their $20,000 share of the sum Project Veritas paid. A White House spokesperson referred a request for comment on the charges to the Justice Department. Through a spokesperson, an attorney for Ashley Biden declined to comment. O’Keefe has said his group was told that the diary and Ashley Biden’s other effects were abandoned by her when she left a Delray Beach, Fla., home where she’d been staying. The group eventually turned the materials over to police. Justice Department officials have declined to comment on whether they treated Project Veritas as a media outlet and granted it protections that sharply limit investigations into news organizations. The conservative group, known for its video exposés, said it obtained records indicating the FBI considered it to be part of the media at the outset of the investigation. The charging document filed on Thursday, known as a criminal information, describes Project Veritas solely as an “organization” located in Mamaroneck, N.Y. The information suggests that Project Veritas officials should have realized at a September 2020 meeting with the defendants in New York that the diary was stolen. “Harris’s explanations to the Organization during this meeting confirmed for Kurlander that Harris had stolen the Victim’s property,” the court document says. The status of the federal probe into Project Veritas is unclear. A lawyer for the group, Paul Calli, defended its actions in connection with the diary and suggested that charges against it or its personnel would be unwarranted. “Project Veritas’s news gathering was ethical and legal,” Calli said in a statement. “A journalist’s lawful receipt of material later alleged to be stolen is routine, commonplace, and protected by the First Amendment.” Ashley Biden, 41, is the president’s second daughter and his first with first lady Jill Biden. His first daughter, Naomi, died in a car accident in 1972 at age 13 months along with her mother, Neilia Biden. Daniel Lippman contributed to this report.",

        "description": "Serbian tennis star Novak Djokovic has announced that will miss the 2022 US Open due to being unvaccinated against COVID-19.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Sadly, I will not be able to travel to NY this time for US Open,” Djokovic wrote in a tweet to his 9 million followers on Thursday.\n\n\n\n“Good luck to my fellow players!” Djokovic added. “I’ll keep in good shape and positive spirit and wait for an opportunity to compete again. See you soon tennis world!”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis comes after Djokovic said in July that he hoped U.S. authorities would change rules requiring foreign visitors to be vaccinated against COVID-19, so he could compete at the tournament.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I’m not vaccinated and I’m not planning to get vaccinated so the only good news I can have is them removing the mandated green vaccine card or whatever you call it to enter United States or exemption,” Djokovic said in a statement at that time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security (DHS) extended a rule in April that required all non-immigrant non-citizens to provide proof of vaccination against the virus prior to boarding a plane headed to the U.S.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDjokovic, a 21-time Grand Slam champion, has been in the center of controversy in the tennis world since he was placed in quarantine in Australia amid an ultimately unsuccessful legal battle over whether he could participate in the Australian Open.\n\n\n\nThe 35-year-old tennis star was allowed to participate in the French Open and Wimbledon recently, despite his unvaccinated status.\n\n\n\nDjokovic, along with Brooklyn Nets guard Kyrie Irving and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, was among the handful of prominent athletes who voiced their skepticism about COVID-19 vaccines and mandates.\n\n\n\nThe 2022 US Open is set to begin on Monday, Aug. 29.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nResearchers said Americans may be experiencing a “false social reality” as supporters of policies targeting climate change outnumber opponents 2 to 1, while the perception is the opposite.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAbout 66 to 80 percent of Americans said they support major climate change mitigation policies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBut&nbsp;just 37 to 43 percent of respondents said they believed their fellow citizens held the same views.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmericans may be greatly underestimating just how concerned their compatriots are about climate change and the degree to which they support transformative climate policies, according to a new survey-based study.\n\n\n\nThe research published in Nature Communications this week found roughly 80 to 90 percent of U.S. citizens misjudged just how many of their peers are concerned about the effects of climate change.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile the majority of Americans surveyed — about 66 to 80 percent — said they themselves support major climate change mitigation policies such as a carbon tax and sourcing power from 100 percent renewable energy sources by 2035, just 37 to 43 percent of respondents said they believed their fellow citizens held the same views.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nResearchers said Americans may be experiencing a “false social reality” as supporters of policies targeting climate change outnumber opponents 2 to 1, but the perception of Americans is that the opposite is true. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe misperception appeared to be consistent throughout every state and demographic category researchers looked at, including political affiliation, race, media consumption habits and rural versus suburban. Along party lines, conservatives were more likely to underestimate support for climate change policies, but liberals also believed support was in the minority. Researchers also found a link between consuming conservative media and increased misperception about the popularity of climate change policy.\n\n\n\n“Americans in every state and of all major demographics are 20 percent or more off in their estimates of support for all climate policies. In all cases, Americans failed to understand that a strong majority of fellow Americans support climate policy, instead, estimating it to be a minority,” the study states.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Given both the ubiquity and magnitude of misperception, this represents a notable form of pluralistic ignorance, perhaps best described as a false social reality, defined here as a case where an inverted perception of the attitude of others is nearly held by all&nbsp;in a society,” the study reads.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe study’s authors suggest the phenomenon may keep people from organizing to push for greater climate action if they believe their viewpoint is unpopular, and a focus on educating people on how prevalent the support is may be needed. The study includes a nationally representative survey of more than 6,000 Americans adults.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe research comes just after President Biden signed a sweeping climate, health care and tax bill into law.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "title": "EV provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act protect our national security",
        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3615500-ev-provisions-in-the-inflation-reduction-act-protect-our-national-security/",
        "description": "The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 is the most significant piece of legislation to advance electric vehicles (EVs) in the nation’s history. Its passage is crucial to reducing the stranglehold that oil has on our nation’s transportation systems and, in turn, protecting our national security. Russia’s war against Ukraine, which is enabled by oil revenues, highlights the urgency to accelerate transportation electrification. EVs powered by our nation’s domestic electric grid will diversify the way we power transportation, reducing the U.S. and global oil demand.\n\n\n\nThe new law brings a variety of incentives that support transportation electrification. Many of these policies are long sought-after goals of groups like mine, the Electrification Coalition. The future of a transportation system that is fueled by domestic electricity has never looked brighter.\n\n\n\nThese measures include an extension of the federal light-duty EV tax credit, which provides up to $7,500 with the purchase of an EV, through 2032. This long-term extension will benefit the millions of consumers that will be switching from fossil fuel-powered cars to electric vehicles over the next decade. Over the past decade, the credit has been a critical driver in the transition to EVs as we hit manufacturing scale and, in turn, has spurred American innovation, significant private sector investments and increased manufacturing.\n\n\n\nWith the rose, though, comes the thorn. Beginning in 2023, to be eligible for the full credit, 40 percent of the vehicle’s critical minerals must be mined or processed in the U.S. or countries with which we have a free trade agreement or recycled in North America. Likewise, 50 percent of battery components must be manufactured or assembled in North America, with both of those percentages increasing over the next few years.\n\n\n\nThese requirements will be a challenge for automakers and, indeed, they should have been more gradually phased in and included more friendly countries to ensure that a greater number of EVs are eligible for the full tax credit.\n\n\n\nNevertheless, as we shift from a fossil fuel-based economy to a minerals-based economy, we cannot trade the instability of purchasing oil from unfriendly counties for purchasing minerals from unfriendly countries. We must ensure that the mining, processing and recycling of these crucial minerals are done responsibly within our borders and by our allies. These provisions accomplish that while setting the U.S. up for successful long-term growth of the EV market — both on the light-duty side and for the medium- and heavy-duty sectors.\n\n\n\nA new tax credit of up to $4,000 on used EVs will make certain that these vehicles continue to have a life beyond their first owner. It will also get more clean vehicles into historically underrepresented communities, which are often disproportionately affected by air pollution. Consumers will also benefit from the lower fuel and maintenance costs of an EV, which can save drivers more than $2,000 each year in fuel costs.\n\n\n\nAdditionally, electrification is about to revolutionize commercial freight and transit. Medium- and heavy-duty vehicles made up only 5 percent of vehicles registered in 2018, but over 26 percent of the U.S. transportation sector’s fuel consumption. We cannot reduce the negative effects of our transportation sector’s dependence on oil without transitioning medium- and heavy-duty vehicles. The new tax credit for medium- and heavy-duty EVs, included in the Inflation Reduction Act, will accelerate commercial freight electrification by reducing the higher up-front capital costs of transitioning to electric vehicles and will lead to lower transportation costs and emissions in the long run.\n\n\n\nRobust charging infrastructure is also critical to accelerating electrification. The passage of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act last year provided funding to begin building out a national charging network. The long-term extension of the Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit in the Inflation Reduction Act will allow more homes and businesses to install charging equipment that powers vehicles with domestic electricity.\n\n\n\nThere are several other measures in the new Inflation Reduction Act that further advance electrification, including important funding to electrify the U.S. Postal Service fleet and critical incentives for EV manufacturing and supply chains.\n\n\n\nJust a few short weeks ago, as consumer demand for electric vehicles was at an all-time high amidst record-high gas prices, it seemed unlikely that Congress would do its part to secure our nation by reducing our dependence on oil. Thankfully, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) negotiated this landmark deal and the president signed it into law.\n\n\n\nFor over a century, oil has been at the center of our transportation systems and our economy, leading to instability around the world, as well as instability in family and business budgets. The measures in the Inflation Reduction Act will help to end this dependence — it is indeed the EV moment.\n\n\n\nKatherine Stainken is the vice president of policy at the Electrification Coalition (EC), which is focused on transitioning our transportation sector to electric.",

It is reportedly the longest known sentence for a women’s rights activist there.That the heavyweight title fight overshadowed her case should not surprise us.

        "description": "Enlarge / Google's Nest Hub Max is a 10-inch smart display designed for viewing photos, making video calls, controlling smart home devices, and accessing the Google Assistant, among other tricks. The speakers aren't the best, though, and there's no physical shutter for the built-in camera. (credit: Google)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe kingdom of Google's third major operating system, Fuchsia, is growing a little wider today. 9to5Google reports Google completed the rollout of Fuchsia to the Google Nest Hub Max. Along with the original Nest Hub/Google Home Hub, that puts two of Google's three smart displays on the new OS, with the one holdout being the 2nd Gen Nest Hub. The Nest Hub Max is the first device running Fuchsia that Google is currently selling—the Home Hub only got Fuchsia after it had been discontinued.\nThe Google smart display user interface is written in Flutter, a Google programming language designed for portability, which runs on Android, iOS, Fuchsia, and the weird cast platform Nest Hubs typically use. So it's not right to describe the user interface as \"similar\" after the OS swap—it's the exact same code because Flutter runs on nearly everything. You are getting a slightly newer code version, though, and it comes with a Bluetooth menu. If you dive into the settings and hit \"about device,\" you'll see a \"Fuchsia Version\" field that will say something like \"6.20211109.1.3166243.\"\nIt's a bit weird to do an entire OS switch to the futuristic, secretive Fuchsia project and then have basically nothing to show (or say) for it in terms of obvious improvements in performance or security. You can dive into the minutia of the Fuchsia source code, but it continues to be a mystery in terms of what practical benefits it offers consumers. Google never talks about Fuchsia, so not much is known about what, exactly, Google is accomplishing here.Read 4 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "Enlarge / Nvidia couldn't make enough GPUs last year, but now it has the opposite problem. (credit: Sam Machkovech)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow quickly things change: A year ago, it was nearly impossible to buy a GeForce GPU for its intended retail price. Now, the company has the opposite problem. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said during the company's Q2 2023 earnings call yesterday that the company is dealing with \"excess inventory\" of RTX 3000-series GPUs ahead of its next-gen RTX 4000 series release later this year.\nTo deal with this, according to Huang, Nvidia will reduce the number of GPUs it sells to manufacturers of graphics cards and laptops so that those manufacturers can clear out their existing inventory. Huang also says Nvidia has \"instituted programs to price position our current products to prepare for next-generation products.\" When translated from C-suite to English, this means the company will be cutting the prices of current-generation GPUs to make more room for next-generation ones. Those price cuts should theoretically be passed along to consumers somehow, though that will be up to Nvidia's partners.\nNvidia announced earlier this month that it would be missing its quarterly projections by $1.4 billion, mainly due to decreased demand for its gaming GPUs. Huang said that \"sell-through\" of GPUs, or the number of cards being sold to users, had still \"increased 70 percent since pre-COVID,\" though the company still expects year-over-year revenue from GPUs to decline next quarter.Read 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

They said they knew it was her house before they arrived but didn't kick the door down like they might during an actual swatting because they \"were still unsure\" of \"exactly what had transpired.\" A few minutes later, Greene answered the door and sent the police away after they performed a quick wellness check in the house to ensure there was no threat.\nToday, Greene tweeted again, saying that she was swatted again.Read 17 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "link": "https://cloud.google.com/blog/topics/retail/cloud-retail-search-benefits/",
        "description": "Cloud Retail Search, part of Discovery Solutions For Retail portfolio, helps retailers significantly improve the shopping experience on their digital platform with ‘Google-quality’ search. Cloud Retail Search offers advanced search capabilities such as better understanding user intent and self-learning ranking models that help retailers unlock the full potential of their online experience.Google Cloud’s Discovery Solutions For Retail are a set of services that can help retailers improve their digital engagement and are offered as part of our industry solutions.Executive SummaryRetailers are always working on trying to keep up with the ever changing consumer expectations and trying to forecast the next trend that can impact sales and revenue. The pandemic brought its own (and largely new) set of challenges which further complicated the issue over the last two years. The retailers were forced to adapt to the new consumer (low physical touch) behavior in which the browsing and product research was largely digital (endless aisle) and accelerated other trends such as buy online and pick up in stores (BOPIS), curbside pick up and pick up lockers. According to a McKinsey Global Survey from early last year, the pandemic has accelerated the pace of digital transformation by several years. The National Retail Federation (NRF) estimates that retail sales are expected to grow between 6% and 8% in 2022 (slower growth rate than in 2021), as consumers spend more on services instead of goods, deal with inflation and higher food &amp; gas prices due to geopolitical disruptions in the world. And the competition continues to be fierce as ever. Amazon continues its dominance in the U.S. retail world and new PYMNTS data shows that Amazon’s share of US Ecommerce sales hit an all-time high of 56.7% in 2021.Customers now have more choices than ever on how they want to engage with the retailers, where they want to spend the money and make their purchase. They also have increased expectations from the retailers around providing a high quality product discovery experience, which is forcing the retailers to invest heavily on improving customer engagement on their digital platforms to boost conversion rate and overall customer loyalty.This is where Retail Search can help by providing an enhanced search experience that uses Google-quality search models to understand the customer intent and takes into account the retailer's first party data (such as promotions, available inventory and price) for ranking results.How is Google Cloud Retail Search DifferentThe Ecommerce platform on-site search use case is not new and retailers have been trying to solve it effectively for the last two decades.  Most retailers recognize that search is a critical service on the platform and have spent countless resources to improve and fine tune it over the years. Yet the challenge remains. According to a Baymard Institute study in late as 2019, 61% of sites still required their users to search by the exact product type jargon the site uses. However, users now expect the same robust and intuitive search features as is offered by Google.com and other popular web platforms, who seem to have the uncanny ability to intelligently interpret and yield relevant results to complex search queries.Google's decades of experience and research in search technology benefits Cloud Retail Search solution and that is what differentiates it from the competition. Advanced Query Understanding: Retail Search can provide more relevant results for the same query due to better query understanding features and knowing when to broaden or narrow the query results. While most search engines still rely largely on keyword based or matching tokens results, Retail Search has the advantage of being able to leverage Google search algorithms to return highly relevant results for product listings and category pages. Semantic Search: Intent recognition is a key requirement for semantic search and identifying what the customers mean when they enter the query is a key strength of Retail Search. This is critical for retailers since this has a direct impact on Clickthrough rate, Conversion rate and the Bounce Rate.Personalized Search Results: Another key differentiator for Retail Search is its ability to leverage user interaction data and ranking models to provide hyper personalized search results. Retailers are able to optimize search performance to deliver desired outcomes: better engagement, revenue, or conversions. Self-Learning and Self-Managed Solution: Retail Search models get better over time because of the self-learning capabilities built into the solution. In addition, the service is fully managed, which saves precious resources needed to keep it running and managing its set up.Strong Security Controls: The service runs on Google Cloud and follows security best practices to keep our customers’ data secure. Google never shares model weights or customer data across customers using the Retail API or other Discovery Solution products. For more details about this data use, see a description of Retail API data use.High Level Conceptual ViewHere is a simplified high-level view of Retail Search API. Retailers can call the API for the given search query and get back the results which can then be displayed on their digital properties.The returned results contains two types of information:Search results: Query search results including product listings and category pages based on advanced query understanding and semantic search.Dynamic faceted search attributes: Faceted Search is a feature that allows further refinement of the search by providing ways to apply additional filters while returning results. Retail Search needs the following datasets as input to train its machine learning models for search:Product Catalog:  Information about the available products including product categories, product description, in-stock availability, and pricing.User Events: This is the clickstream data that contains user interaction information such as clicks and purchases.Inventory / Pricing Updates: Incremental updates to in-stock availability and pricing as that information is updated.(Keeping the product catalog up to date and recording user events successfully is crucial for getting high-quality results. Set up Cloud Monitoring alerts to take prompt action in case any issues arise).Retailers also have the ability to set up business/config rules to customize their search results and optimize for business revenue goals such as Clickthrough rate, Conversion rate, Average size order etc.How to get startedRetail Search is generally available now and anyone with a Google cloud account can access it. If you don’t already have an account, you can start with a trial account for free here.Establish a Success Criteria: It's important to establish a success criteria for measuring the effectiveness of Retail search. Get a consensus on which factor(s) you want to include in scope for measuring the effectiveness of Retail Search. This could include one or two from the following: Search Conversion Rate, Search Average Order Value, Search Revenue Per Visit and Null Search Rate (No Results Found).Initial Set Up: Create a Google Cloud Project and set up the Retail API. When you set up the Retail API for a new project, the Google Cloud Console displays the following three panels to help you configure your Retail API project:Catalog: displays product catalog and a link to import catalog.Event: displays user events and a link to import historical user events.Serving configs: contains details on serving configuration and a link to create a new serving configuration.Measuring Performance: Retail dashboards provide metrics to help you determine how incorporating the Retail API is affecting the results. You can view summary metrics for your project on the Analytics tab of the Monitoring &amp; Analytics page in Cloud Console. Set up A/B Experiments: To measure the performance of Retail Search with another search solution, you can set up A/B tests using a third-party experiment platform such as Google Optimize.Summary:As retailers try to navigate through the post-pandemic world where supply chain failures and digital transformation acceleration are major focus areas, they now also have to keep a close eye on the recent geopolitical challenges resulting in rising inflation and costs.While we can all agree that in-store shopping will continue to be a major source of revenue, it is also important for retailers to tweak the in-store experience for the digital world. Trends such as buy online and pick up in stores (BOPIS), curbside pick up and pick up lockers are here to stay.Given all the above, consumer engagement and digital experience is more important now than ever before. The cost of search abandonment is way too high and has both short and longer term impact. Retail Search is a great solution to help reduce churn, improve conversion and retention. It provides Google-quality search models to help understand customer intent and the retailers have the ability to set up business/config rules to optimize search results for business revenue goals such as Clickthrough rate, Conversion rate and Average size order.Related ArticleShoppers know what they want.

        "description": "A few weeks ago, we announced third-party event sources for Eventarc, with the first cohort of third-party providers by our ecosystem partners. This blog post describes how to listen for events from one of those third-party providers, Datadog, and route them to a service in Google Cloud via Eventarc.Datadog is a monitoring platform for cloud applications. It brings together end-to-end traces, metrics, and logs to make your applications and infrastructure observable. In Datadog, you can create monitors that track metrics, events, logs, integration availability, and network endpoints, and you can set alert thresholds on those monitors. Once these thresholds are reached, Datadog notifies your teams or services via email, Slack, and now a Google Cloud service via Eventarc. Let’s take a look at what it takes to set up one of those monitors and notify a Google Cloud service when a threshold is reached.Discover the Datadog providerAn Eventarc provider is a service or entity that can emit events directly to Google Cloud; those events are then routed to your project. Third-party providers, such as Datadog, are non-Google Cloud providers that are integrated with Google Cloud through Eventarc.You can see all Google Cloud providers (and also the Datadog provider) in a region in Google Cloud Console or using gcloud:Create a channelTo receive events from a provider, you need to set up a channel. The process involves creating and activating the channel with the provider:Event subscription flowYou can create a Datadog channel from the Eventarc section of Google Cloud Console:Creating a channelThe channel will be in a pending state until you send the activation token to Datadog:Channel in a pending stateLogin to Datadog, go to the integrations page, and make sure the Google Eventarc integration is installed:Google Eventarc integrationIn the configuration section of the Google Eventarc integration, enter the full channel name and the activation token:Google Eventarc integrationAfter a few seconds, you should see the channel become active in Google Cloud Console:Channel in an active stateNow, you're ready to use the channel. Create a workflowYou need a destination in Google Cloud to receive events from Datadog. Eventarc supports a number of event destinations including Cloud Run, Workflows, and Kubernetes services. In this case, deploy a workflow to simply log the received events.code_block[StructValue([(u'code', u'main:\\r\\n params: [event]\\r\\n steps:\\r\\n - logStep:\\r\\n call: sys.log\\r\\n args:\\r\\n data: ${event}'), (u'language', u''), (u'caption', &lt;wagtail.wagtailcore.rich_text.RichText object at 0x3e42e3186310&gt;)])]Note that the workflow is receiving an event as a parameter. This event will come from Datadog monitoring via Eventarc. Once the event is received, the workflow simply logs the received event.Create an Eventarc triggerYou are now ready to connect events from the Datadog provider to Workflows with an Eventarc trigger.Create a trigger with the Datadog channel, event type, and the workflow destination:code_block[StructValue([(u'code', u'gcloud eventarc triggers create datadog-trigger1 \\\\\\r\\n --location $REGION \\\\\\r\\n --destination-workflow $WORKFLOW_NAME \\\\\\r\\n --destination-workflow-location $REGION \\\\\\r\\n --channel $CHANNEL_NAME \\\\\\r\\n --event-filters type=datadog.v1.alert \\\\\\r\\n --service-account $PROJECT_NUMBER-compute@developer.gserviceaccount.com'), (u'language', u''), (u'caption', &lt;wagtail.wagtailcore.rich_text.RichText object at 0x3e42e3f3c2d0&gt;)])]Create a Datadog monitorYou are now ready to create a Datadog monitor and connect it to Eventarc. In this example, it is a simple Hello-World type monitor with default values. You will manually trigger it to generate the monitoring alerts, which in turn will generate an Eventarc event in Google Cloud.To create a monitor in Datadog, first log in to Datadog. Then hold the pointer over Monitors in the main menu and click New Monitor. There are many monitor types. Choose the Metric monitor type.In the New Monitor page, leave the defaults for steps 1 and 2.In step 3, set Alert threshold to 1In step 4, set Test monitor for Eventarc as the monitor name and set Notify your team to @eventarc_&lt;your-project-id&gt;_&lt;your-region&gt;_&lt;your-channel-name&gt;Test the Datadog and Eventarc integrationTo test the Datadog monitor and the Eventarc trigger, you can manually trigger the monitor.At the bottom of the monitor creation page, click the Test Notifications button:Test notifications buttonThen, click the Run Test button:Test notifications This should simulate the state transition in the monitor and trigger an Eventarc event. In the workflow, you should see that there's a new execution. In the details of that execution, you should see the Datadog event type datadog.v1.alert generated from the monitoring alert in the input of the workflow and also in the logs:Workflows executionNext stepsThis post covered how to route Datadog monitoring alerts to Google Cloud with Eventarc. If you want to run through these steps in your own project, we have a codelab that you can try. It is only useful to listen for alerts if you can act upon them. In this second codelab, you will learn how to respond to Datadog monitoring alerts with Workflows. More specifically, you will create two Compute Engine virtual machines and monitor them with a Datadog monitor. Once one of the VMs is deleted, you will receive an alert from Datadog to Workflows via Eventarc. In turn, Workflows will recreate the deleted VM to get the number of running VMs back to two. This is just a simple example of how to automatically respond to Datadog alerts with services in Google Cloud.Feel free to reach out to me on Twitter @meteatamel for any questions or feedback.Related ArticleEasily connect SaaS platforms to Google Cloud with EventarcEventarc launches 3rd party sources (Preview).

        "description": "The Nationals have claimed right-hander Tommy Romero off waivers from the Rays, and assigned Romero to Triple-A.  Both Romero and Kevin Herget were designated for assignment by Tampa Bay on Tuesday, and the Rays announced that Herget been outrighted to Triple-A after clearing waivers.\nRomero has a 7.71 ERA over three appearances and 4 2/3 innings for the Rays this season, marking the 24-year-old&#8217;s first bit of Major League experience.  A 15th-round pick for the Mariners in the 2017 draft, Romero has been in the Rays organization since 2018, and posted some quality numbers down on the farm.  He has a 2.66 ERA and 25.91% strikeout rate over 473 2/3 career innings in the minor leagues, with some variance both well above and well below that K%.\nRomero has started 80 of his 108 games in the minors, though some of those were rather abbreviated outings, as the Rays experimented with some opener/piggyback starter scenarios.  Most recently, Romero has been working only as a reliever, with Tampa eyeing him as bullpen depth rather than rotation help if he got another call later in the season.\nThe waiver claim now makes that a moot point, and it seems likely the Nationals will stretch Romero out again as a starting pitcher.  The Nats have been aggressive on the waiver wire (as noted by the Washington Post&#8217;s Jesse Dougherty) in recent months, as the team has used the high waiver priority afforded to Washington&#8217;s low position in the standings to audition and check out several players.  There isn&#8217;t much risk for the rebuilding Nats in seeing if they can find a hidden gem amongst these waiver claims, and in Romero&#8217;s case, his age (25), solid minor league track record and his full set of minor league options make him an interesting candidate.",

Glenn Youngkin had just won the Virginia governorship while keeping some distance from the twice-impeached former president. Here was, if not a brave soul, then an electoral model for non-populist conservatives to follow.&#8221;\nHow naive that doubt now seems. Trump-endorsed candidates are thriving in the primaries for the midterm elections. Those who take a stand against him are not. The rout of the Republican lawmaker Liz Cheney in Wyoming this month was retribution for her role in the probe into last year’s siege of the US Capitol. About three-quarters of Republican voters deny that Joe Biden is the legitimately elected US president. Subscribers to the Big Lie include people attaining positions in the election bureaucracy of Arizona and other important states. Trump, if he runs again in 2024, will count on their chicanery.&#8221;\n&#8220;The decay of the GOP is existential for the republic.&#8221;",

        "description": "When Massimo Scanziani’s daughter was young, he’d often see her eyes twitching beneath her eyelids while she was sleeping. These rapid eye movements (or REMs) are so obvious, Scanziani told me, that he can hardly believe that they were described just seven decades ago. In 1953, Eugene Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman identified a special phase of sleep when neurons were abuzz and eyes were shut but flitting about. During this phase, now called “REM sleep,” people tended to have vivid dreams. Maybe, Kleitman suggested, the eye movements reflected “where and at what the dreamer was looking” in their virtual world.Several researchers tested this “scanning hypothesis” in the ’50s and ’60s by waking sleeping volunteers when their eyes twitched and asking them what they had just dreamed. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these crude methods failed to produce consistent results. But despite alternative explanations—maybe the movements lubricate the closed eye or arise from random brain activity—the scanning hypothesis remains popular. And through a clever experiment involving mice, Scanziani and his colleague Yuta Senzai, who are both neuroscientists at UC San Francisco, think they’ve finally shown that eye twitches are a direct line into an inner dream world.As a mouse moves, a group of neurons in its brain tracks the direction of its head, acting like an internal compass. Some of these neurons fire when the mouse turns left; others buzz when it turns right. By analyzing a mouse’s activity, a scientist can tell you where it is facing without ever looking at the rodent itself. And during REM sleep, even though a mouse’s head isn’t moving, its head-direction cells still fire as if it were exploring.Scanziani and Senzai reasoned that, by recording the activity of these neurons with implanted electrodes, they could work out where sleeping mice are looking in their dream worlds. They then showed that the signals from this internal compass matched the movements of the rodents’ eyes (which they could track because mice often sleep with their eyes slightly open). When a mouse seems to move its head around in its dream, its eyes flick in the same direction, to the same degree, and at the same moment. “The rodent is certainly exploring the environment in its dream,” Scanziani told me. “By looking at its moving eyes, we have a window into its dreaming brain.”These results suggest that “in their dreams, mice are attending to the events unfolding before them and interacting with them actively, intentionally, and dynamically,” says David Peña-Guzmán, a philosopher at San Francisco State University and the author of When Animals Dream. Many philosophers would regard that as “a clear indicator of consciousness,” he told me.But other sleep researchers are not convinced that Scanziani and Senzai showed what they think they showed. Sara Aton, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, told me that head and eye movements are so tightly coupled when mice (and humans) are awake that you wouldn’t expect them to suddenly disconnect during sleep. That they remain linked doesn’t tell us whether mice are perceiving a dream world, let alone gazing about it. “We simply can’t read that out from the brain,” Aton said. Mark Blumberg, a neuroscientist at the University of Iowa, agrees. “The link to dreams is gratuitous,” he told me. Scanziani and Senzai “assert that they’re peering into the virtual world of dreams, but they haven’t done so—nor can they.”At first glance, this might seem like a semantic argument: “I can say that we’re looking at coordinated activity of distinct parts of the brain occurring during REM sleep that strongly resembles the activity that the brain has when it’s awake, or I can call it a dream,” Scanziani said. But those things aren’t necessarily identical, and Blumberg argues that equating them could distract us from understanding the role of REM sleep.He notes that when eyes move during this phase, other body parts twitch too, including limbs and whiskers. These movements look like more evidence of dreams spilling into reality—sleeping dogs chasing imagined rabbits—but they might represent something simpler. Blumberg argues that the brain uses REM sleep to test-drive the body. The brain pings the neurons that control muscles, creating twitches; it then collects sensory information from those moving limbs. By testing those connections during times of stillness, it can refine and recalibrate the network to work more efficiently during times of wakeful chaos. According to this view, REM-phase movements aren’t about dreams at all. They’re the work of a brain that’s learning how to more effectively pilot a body.This explanation better accounts for aspects of REM sleep that don’t easily fit with the scanning hypothesis. For example, people who are born blind still move their eyes during sleep, even though they don’t dream visually and clearly aren’t looking around. Also, the REM phase of sleep is longest in newborn humans, mice, and other mammals whose infants are relatively helpless at birth. These are exactly the individuals whose brain would need the most time to get to grips with their body. By contrast, if the twitches are linked to dreams, “why would newborns twitch so much when they have so little to dream about?” Blumberg said.  Since its discovery, REM sleep has been associated with dreaming (even though we dream in non-REM sleep too). And because dreams are so fascinating, they became the focus of our attempts to understand REM—the sun that other hypotheses orbit around. But what if they aren’t central? Scanziani told me that dreams might arise because the brain replays memories after “a long day of experiences” to better organize what it has learned, or “generates and explores possibilities to help us make better predictions when we’re awake.” This is essentially what the test-drive hypothesis argues, except here, the brain is just testing the connections within itself, rather than those with the rest of the body. It’s intuitive to see the dreams and twitches of REM sleep as connected phenomena. But perhaps they’re two independent reflections of a brain that’s relentlessly recalibrating.",

        "description": "Certain beaches are &#8220;sticky zones&#8221; that accumulate litter, a new study shows.\nCitizen scientists recorded trash on Pacific Northwest beaches, from southern Oregon to Anacortes, Washington, to contribute to the growing study of marine trash.\n&#8220;Thousands of volunteer hours allowed us to investigate what is driving the rubbish washing up on our beaches, and where it&#8217;s ending up,&#8221; says lead author Kathy Willis, a visiting scientist at the University of Washington who is a postdoctoral researcher at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, or CSIRO, in Australia.\n&#8220;Understanding how trash moves through the marine environment provides us with important clues to identify sources and implement strategies to prevent more trash escaping.&#8221;\nVolunteers with the Coastal Observation and Seabird Survey Team, or COASST collected all the data. The University of Washington-based citizen science effort began in the 1990s to study seabirds. In late 2015 the team added a group of volunteers focused on observing marine litter.\nPublished in the journal Marine Pollution Bulletin, the new paper uses observations of medium-sized refuse, between 1 and 20 inches (2.5 to 50 centimeters), from 2017 to 2021. Volunteers collect data year-round at distinct zones on each beach.\n&#8220;Trained volunteers with COASST are able to go out and observe many locations with a frequency that just wouldn&#8217;t be possible any other way,&#8221; Willis says.\nBeaches with more organic flotsam also tend to have more litter.\nThe study used statistical analysis to confirm that some parts of the beach are &#8220;sticky zones.&#8221; One such natural resting spot for garbage is the so-called wrack zone, the high-tide mark where kelp and other organic material accumulates. The other place trash likes to land is the wood zone, where driftwood washes up in storms and comes to rest. In general, beaches with more organic flotsam also tended to have more litter.\nResults also showed very different patterns for the 36 beaches surveyed in Puget Sound compared with the 27 beaches surveyed on the outer coast of Washington and Oregon. In the protected waters of Puget Sound, about half the waste was plastic, with the rest being heavier objects like metal, glass, or cement. This suggests that Puget Sound litter tends to originate from that area or neighboring beaches, according to the authors.\nBut on the outer coast, 90% of the observed items were plastic, mainly broken-down fragments of larger objects. The litter on the outer coast also showed a strong seasonal pattern, with more trash in the spring after winter storms, and lower litter levels in the fall.\n&#8220;In populated areas of Puget Sound, what the data suggest is that if you see a lot of trash, someone probably dumped it or it escaped accidentally nearby,&#8221; says coauthor Jackie Lindsey, science coordinator at COASST. &#8220;But if there&#8217;s a lot of trash in a remote region, the people who live there are not necessarily the people who are creating that trash—they&#8217;re just the ones who are dealing with it once it lands.&#8221;\nKnowing where and when beach litter tends to accumulate could help improve programs that collect and remove trash. The findings could also help managers evaluate strategies to prevent beach litter, such as launching educational campaigns around marine waste, installing secure trash bins, and banning plastic bags and other single-use products.\n&#8220;A lot of times people say: &#8216;There&#8217;s trash out there, let&#8217;s just go out and clean it up,'&#8221; Lindsey says. &#8220;But we need to also take a step back and use science to document how things happen in the system upstream, looking at the source of the problem to target our responses.&#8221;\nResults show that the total amount of beach trash in the region dipped slightly from 2017 to 2021, but the authors caution that it&#8217;s too early to know that it&#8217;s a downward trend.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s really exciting to have this baseline data,&#8221; Willis says. &#8220;We now know what type of rubbish is showing up in this region and what is driving it, so in the future we&#8217;ll be better able to evaluate how things might be changing.&#8221;\nAdditional coauthors are from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the University of Washington.\nA grant from the Australian-American Fulbright Commission and he more than 280 volunteers who collected data on the beach supported the work.\nSource: University of Washington\nThe post Beach &#8216;sticky zones&#8217; act as trash magnets appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "The White House's chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci advised against making the same assumptions about the current monkeypox outbreak that were made during the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n\n\n\nFauci and H. Clifford Lane, deputy director for clinical research and special projects at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), published a piece in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday in which they reflected on the similarities between the monkeypox outbreak and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which both men spent much of their careers studying.\n\n\n\nThe two researchers noted the obvious similarities, namely that most monkeypox cases have so far been detected among men who have sex with men. While the main mode of transmission for monkeypox is believed to be through prolonged skin-to-skin contact, they observed that some early data has suggested sexual transmission may play a role in the spread of the virus.\n\n\n\nPublic health officials have repeatedly stressed that while many monkeypox cases appear to have been transmitted during sexual encounters, the virus itself is not considered to be a sexually transmitted infection.\n\n\n\n\"Given how little we know about the epidemiologic characteristics of the current outbreak, it is prudent to heed an observation made during the first year of the HIV/AIDS pandemic: '… any assumption that it will remain restricted to a particular segment of our society is truly an assumption without a scientific basis,'\" Fauci and Lane wrote.\n\n\n\nTo better understand the virus, the two infectious disease specialists called for further studies and surveys as well as continued surveillance of new cases. According to federal data, over 16,000 U.S. monkeypox cases have been confirmed so far.\n\n\n\nIn the piece, Lane and Fauci — who is stepping down from his positions in the White House and the NIAID in December — noted there are some characteristics of monkeypox that suggest recent changes that led to the current outbreak, but emphasized that the virus has been known of for decades, with readily available vaccines and treatments.\n\n\n\n\"Thus, the challenge to the public health and research communities during this time of emergency response is to ensure the efficient and equitable availability and distribution of existing countermeasures to those in need of them while at the same time conducting the rigorous studies needed to define what the clinical efficacy may be, understand any potential safety concerns, and guide proper utilization,\" they wrote.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/finance/3615128-the-fed-wants-to-replace-private-cryptocurrencies-with-its-own/",
        "description": "The Federal Reserve’s academic publications and statements make it apparent that it intends to expand its regulatory authority over stablecoins. This concentration of power at the Fed relegates accountability to Congress and favors a framework where bureaucrats will substitute privately issued stablecoins with a central bank digital currency (CBDC) run by the federal government.\n\n\n\nEmployees at the Fed have proposed policy recommendations that threaten to wipe out privately issued stablecoins&nbsp;—&nbsp;digital assets backed by the U.S. dollar or bonds. One proposal, according to a&nbsp;paper&nbsp;co-authored by an attorney at the Fed, is to “introduce a central bank digital currency and tax private money out of existence.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn one footnote, the paper comments that this recommendation is “essentially the route the Peoples Bank of China has taken with respect to cryptocurrencies.” China banned private cryptocurrencies so that its citizens would adopt the state-run central bank digital currency. The Fed is not opposed to pursuing the same heavy-handed policy that will&nbsp;crowd out&nbsp;private cryptocurrencies, limit options for consumers and consolidate control over Americans’ payment transactions with the central bank.\n\n\n\nThe establishment of a central bank digital currency could provide the Internal Revenue Service with another tool to increase tax enforcement. The Fed’s&nbsp;report&nbsp;states that “governments could use a CBDC to collect taxes.” A&nbsp;study&nbsp;by Zijian Wang concludes that if a “CBDC offers less anonymity than cash” then the IRS would be able to more easily interfere in the lives of American taxpayers. Although Americans should pay what they owe in taxes, the IRS could use central bank digital currencies to target small businesses and abuse taxpayers’ right to privacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Fed also wants control over nonbank stablecoin issuers. The&nbsp;minutes&nbsp;of the Fed’s July meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee stated that there was discussion around “the need to strengthen the oversight and regulation of certain types of nonbank financial institutions.”\n\n\n\nThe President’s Working Group on Financial Markets recommended circumventing Congress to regulate nonbank issuers of stablecoins. A&nbsp;report&nbsp;issued in 2021 explicitly encouraged the Financial Stability Oversight Council to use its authority under Dodd-Frank (a drastic expansion of the federal government in its own right) to designate certain stablecoin payment activities and capital requirements as “systemically important” without any input from Congress.\n\n\n\nThis egregious policy shifts power from elected representatives in Congress to unelected bureaucrats in the executive branch. Instead of being funded by congressional appropriations, the Fed is&nbsp;primarily funded&nbsp;from the interest it earns on the securities that it owns. This will make it difficult for Congress to shape future policies affecting stablecoins.\n\n\n\nThe Fed also wants to drag money market funds and nonbank stablecoin issuers under the same regulatory framework as banks. In effect, only depository institutions would be able to issue stablecoins. This restrictive approach assumes that stablecoins, like money market funds, are destined to cause financial distress. This is misleading. While there were over 800&nbsp;money market funds&nbsp;in operation in 2007, only&nbsp;one&nbsp;fund’s net asset value fell below the $1-per-share price during the Great Recession. Additionally, Supreme Court&nbsp;precedent&nbsp;has clarified that money market funds, and by extension nonbank stablecoin issuers, cannot be regulated by the Fed under the Bank Holding Company Act.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA lighter touch and more transparent framework for the stablecoin market have already been proposed. The Cato Institute wrote language that offers investors more transparency into a stablecoin’s reserve assets, but also requires an adequate, but not overbearing, level of collateral requirements.\n\n\n\nConsumers need transparent disclosures, not impediments that will make it harder to pick and choose investment options that best suit their preferences.\n\n\n\nTo avoid costly litigation, regulators will ultimately need to wait for Congress to act on stablecoin regulation. The Supreme Court’s majority ruling in&nbsp;West Virginia v. EPA&nbsp;endorses the major questions doctrine and limits regulators’ authority to unilaterally pursue rules of&nbsp;great economic and political significance&nbsp;without congressional authorization. Considering that&nbsp;one in five&nbsp;Americans invest in, trade or use cryptocurrencies, and that there are likely numerous applications for digital assets that have yet to be discovered, Congress will need to act first.\n\n\n\nIncreasing the regulatory powers of the Fed could sound the death knell for private stablecoins. Future consideration of policies should enable both banks and nonbanks to utilize the innovative technology unhindered by excessive government intervention. This can best be achieved by offering a clear legislative framework that continues to enable members of Congress to have a direct say in future regulation, instead of handing off the job to unelected bureaucrats with no accountability to the American people.\n\n\n\nBryan Bashur is a federal affairs manager at Americans for Tax Reform and executive director of the Shareholder Advocacy Forum.",

        "description": "The Angels have claimed Rob Zastryzny off waivers from the Mets, and the left-hander has been optioned to Triple-A.  New York designated Zastryzny for assignment earlier this week.\nThe Mets signed Zastryzny to a minors contract in May, and he made a single appearance for the Mets (tossing one inning in the Mets&#8217; 4-1 loss to the Phillies last Sunday) before being designated for assignment.  While a brief stint, it was surely a welcome return to the bigs for Zastryzny, whose last MLB appearance came with the Cubs back in 2018.  The left-hander tossed 34 2/3 innings for Chicago in 2016-18 before bouncing around to multiple teams and eventually landing his next chance at the Show.\nZastryzny spent 2019 in the Dodgers farm system, and he&#8217;ll now head back to SoCal for an opportunity with Los Angeles&#8217; other team.  He&#8217;ll provide the Halos with some relief depth in the minors, and with Jose Quijada increasingly getting some save chances, there could be room for the Angels to call up Zastryzny for more of a traditional lefty relief role.",

        "description": "LONDON — France has held its nose on many occasions when it comes to dealing with the U.K., but perhaps never quite so literally.\n\n\n\nFrench MEPs have accused the U.K. of neglecting environmental commitments by allowing raw sewage to be dumped in the Channel and North Sea.\n\n\n\nThe action threatens health and marine life on the French coast, the politicians claimed in a letter calling for legal or political action from the European Commission.\n\n\n\nThe MEPs from President Emmanuel Macron’s party warn that in the short term, the leaks could damage bathing waters on the French coast and harm marine biodiversity, fishing and shellfish farming.\n\n\n\n&#8220;The Channel and the North Sea are not dumping grounds,&#8221; said Stéphanie Yon-Courtin, who sits on the European Parliament&#8217;s fisheries committee.\n\n\n\nThe MEPs’ intervention opens an international dimension to what has been a fierce domestic row within the U.K. this summer, with pollution warnings issued for almost 50 beaches in England and Wales after heavy rain caused sewage overflow to be diverted from overloaded drains into rivers and the sea.\n\n\n\nBritain&#8217;s privatized water industry has been blamed by campaigners for allowing the spills, while Conservative politicians have been inundated with angry correspondence after campaign material from opposition parties claimed the Tories “voted for” foul matter to be dumped in the country’s waters.\n\n\n\nIn the U.K., wastewater from toilets is carried to sewage treatment works through the same aged Victorian pipes as rainwater | Jack Taylor/Getty Images\n\n\n\nThe contention is not quite accurate — although Tory MPs did vote to block a specific amendment to the recent Environment Act placing tougher requirements on water firms — but it has created a bad smell in Westminster, which has lingered for more than a week.\n\n\n\nIn the U.K., wastewater from toilets is carried to sewage treatment works through the same aged Victorian pipes as rainwater. The system is designed to occasionally overflow and discharge untreated sewage, an issue that has occurred recently because of an increased risk of storm-flooding following unusually dry weather.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the U.K.&#8217;s Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was untrue that Britain was not upholding high standards. &#8220;The Environment Act has made our laws even stronger on water quality than when we were in the EU, from targets to tackle nutrient pollution to new powers to tackle harmful substances in our waters,&#8221; they said.\n\n\n\nOpposition MPs have been making hay, however. Liberal Democrats have accused ministers of “ignoring the country&#8217;s outrage at this scandal,” while the Labour Party claimed Britain&#8217;s “water infrastructure is at bursting point, with billions of liters of water being wasted every day and raw sewage being dumped into our waters.”",

        "description": "Even if global warming is limited to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), dangerous heat waves will become much more common by the end of the century, according to a new study.\nFurther, many tropical regions will experience &#8220;dangerous&#8221; heat for about half the year.\nRecord-breaking heat waves have occurred recently from Delhi to the Pacific Northwest, and the number of these deadly events is expected to increase. The new research gives a range of heat impacts worldwide by the end of this century, depending on future emissions of greenhouse gases.\n&#8220;The record-breaking heat events of recent summers will become much more common in places like North America and Europe,&#8221; says lead author Lucas Vargas Zeppetello, who did the research as a doctoral student at the University of Washington and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University.\n&#8220;For many places close to the equator, by 2100 more than half the year will be a challenge to work outside, even if we begin to curb emissions. Our study shows a broad range of possible scenarios for 2100,&#8221; he adds. &#8220;This shows that the emissions choices we make now still matter for creating a habitable future.&#8221;\nThe study looks at a combination of air temperature and humidity known as the heat index that measures impact on the human body. A &#8220;dangerous&#8221; heat index is defined by the National Weather Service as 103 F (39.4 C). An &#8220;extremely dangerous&#8221; heat index is 124 F (51 C), deemed unsafe to humans for any amount of time.\n&#8220;This study shows you the abyss, but it also shows you that we have some agency to prevent these scenarios from happening.&#8221;\n&#8220;These standards were first created for people working indoors in places like boiler rooms—they were not thought of as conditions that would happen in outdoor, ambient environments. But we are seeing them now,&#8221; Vargas Zeppetello says.\nThe study finds that even if countries manage to meet the Paris Agreement goal of keeping warming to 2 degrees Celsius, crossing the &#8220;dangerous&#8221; threshold will be three to 10 times more common by 2100 in the US, Western Europe, China, and Japan. In that same scenario, dangerous days could double by 2100 in the tropics, covering half the year.\nIn a worst-case scenario in which emissions remain unchecked until 2100, &#8220;extremely dangerous&#8221; conditions, in which humans should not be outdoors for any amount of time, could become common in countries closer to the equator—notably in India and sub-Saharan Africa.\n&#8220;It&#8217;s extremely frightening to think what would happen if 30 to 40 days a year were exceeding the extremely dangerous threshold,&#8221; Vargas Zeppetello says. &#8220;These are frightening scenarios that we still have the capacity to prevent. This study shows you the abyss, but it also shows you that we have some agency to prevent these scenarios from happening.&#8221;\nThe study uses a probability-based method to calculate the range of future conditions. Instead of using the four future emissions pathways included in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reports, the authors use a statistical approach that combines historical data with population projections, economic growth, and carbon intensity—the amount of carbon emitted for each dollar of economic activity—to predict the likely range of future CO2 concentrations.\nThe statistical approach &#8220;gives plausible ranges for carbon emissions and future temperature and has been estimated statistically from and validated against historical data,&#8221; says coauthor Adrian Raftery, a professor of statistics and of sociology at the University of Washington with an adjunct appointment in atmospheric sciences.\nThe authors translated the higher carbon dioxide levels into a range of global temperature increases, then looked at how that would affect global monthly weather patterns.\n&#8220;The number of days with dangerous levels of heat in the mid-latitudes—including the southeastern and central US—will more than double by 2050,&#8221; says coauthor David Battisti, a professor of atmospheric sciences. &#8220;Even for the very low-end estimates of carbon emissions and climate response, by 2100 much of the tropics will experience &#8216;dangerous&#8217; levels of heat stress for nearly half the year.&#8221;\nThe findings, published in the journal Communications Earth &amp; Environment, underline the need to both reduce future greenhouse gas emissions and to protect populations, especially outdoor workers, against dangerous heat.\nThe National Institutes of Health, the James S. McDonnell Foundation, and the Tamaki Foundation funded the work.\nSource: University of Washington\nThe post &#8216;Extremely dangerous&#8217; heat will be much more common by 2100 appeared first on Futurity.",

        "description": "The Yankees were known to be targeting Pablo Lopez prior to the trade deadline, and reports suggested that Gleyber Torres was involved in the talks between New York and Miami.  One trade proposed by the Marlins would&#8217;ve seen Lopez and Miguel Rojas head to the Bronx in exchange for Torres and infield prospect Oswald Peraza, The Athletic&#8217;s Ken Rosenthal reports, but the Yankees rejected the offer.\nAnthony Volpe is considered one of the top prospects in all of baseball, so while Peraza is a top-100 staple in his own right, he could&#8217;ve been more of an expendable piece in trade talks.  New York was still resistant to moving Peraza, and while the club was reportedly open to moving him in a possible Frankie Montas trade, the Yankees ended up landing Montas from the Athletics for another trade package that didn&#8217;t involve Peraza.  The inclusion of longtime Miami staple Rojas is an interesting wrinkle, as presumably the Marlins offered Rojas as a replacement for Torres in the Yankees&#8217; infield mix, and perhaps sought to give the veteran a chance at winning a ring with a contender.  It makes for an interesting deadline what-if, and any of these players could potentially be part of different trade talks should the two teams rekindle negotiations this winter.\nSome rumblings from the Marlins and Rays, as we check in on both Sunshine State teams&#8230;\n\nAfter some fielding drills and batting practice on Wednesday, Wander Franco told reporters (including Marc Topkin of the Tampa Bay Times) that &#8220;I feel super good right now and [am] getting better,&#8221; in regards to his injured right hand.  Soreness in that hand led Franco to be taken off his rehab assignment earlier this week, and the Rays will continue to monitor Franco&#8217;s injury before deciding when to restart his minor league work.  Speaking with Topkin and company today, Rays manager Kevin Cash said Saturday would be the earliest date for Franco to resume his rehab assignment.  Franco has played in only 58 games this season due to a quad strain and then hamate-bone surgery, and his return would be a big boost to a Rays club that is trying to secure a wild card berth.\nIn other Rays injury updates from Topkin, Josh Fleming and Matt Wisler each started minor league rehab assignments within the last two days, while J.P. Feyereisen will throw a live batting practice session before the team decides on his rehab assignment.  This is a good development for Feyereisen, who had a brief setback due to shoulder soreness earlier this month.  Shane Baz also told Topkin and other reporters that he&#8217;ll start a throwing program on Monday, but it remains to be seen if Baz can get fully ramped up in time to return to big league game action before the season is over.  An elbow sprain sent Baz to the 15-day IL and then the 60-day IL retroactive to July 14, so it will still be a few weeks before he is even eligible to be activated.\nGarrett Cooper is two games into a minor league rehab assignment and could be back on the Marlins&#8217; active roster as soon as Friday.  Manager Don Mattingly told reporters that Cooper was slated to play three games as part of his recovery from a stint on the seven-day concussion IL, and Cooper is no longer experiencing any symptoms.  Cooper&#8217;s IL placement was retroactive to August 17, and it doesn&#8217;t look like he&#8217;ll miss much more time beyond the seven-day minimum.",

        "description": "America’s first-ever reformulated COVID-19 vaccines are coming, very ahead of schedule, and in some ways, the timing couldn’t be better. Pfizer’s version of the shot, which combines the original recipe with ingredients targeting the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, may be available to people 12 and older as early as the week after Labor Day; Moderna’s adult-only brew seems to be on a similar track. The schedule slates the shots to debut at a time when BA.5 is still the country’s dominant coronavirus morph—and it means that, after more than a year of scrambling to catch up to SARS-CoV-2’s evolutionary capers, we might finally be getting inoculations that are well matched to the season’s circulating strains. Which is “absolutely great,” says Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona.In other ways, the timing couldn’t be worse. Emergency pandemic funds have been drying up, imperiling already dwindling supplies of vaccines; with each passing week, more Americans are greeting the coronavirus with little more than a shrug. The most recent revamp of the country’s pandemic playbook has softened or stripped away the greater part of the remaining mitigation measures that stood between SARS-CoV-2 and us. Calls for staying up-to-date on COVID vaccines are one of the last nationwide measures left—which puts a lot of pressure on shot-induced immunity to combat the virus, all on its own.[Read: The pandemic’s soft closing]The nation has latched on before to the idea that shots alone can see us through. When vaccines first rolled out, Americans were assured that they’d essentially stamp out transmission, and that the immunized could take off their masks. “I thought we learned our lesson,” says Saskia Popescu, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at George Mason University. Apparently we did not. America is still stuck on the notion of what Popescu calls “vaccine absolutism.” And it rests on two very shaky assumptions, perhaps both doomed to fail: that the shots can and should sustainably block infection, and that “people will actually go and get the vaccine,” says Deshira Wallace, a public-health researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. As fall looms, the U.S. is now poised to expose the fatal paradox in its vaccine-only plan. At a time when the country is more reliant than ever on the power of inoculation, we’re also doing less than ever to set the shots up for success.In terms of both content and timing, the fall shot will be one of the most important COVID vaccines offered to Americans since the initial doses. Since SARS-CoV-2 first collided with the human population nearly three years ago, it’s shape-shifted. The coronavirus is now better at infecting us and is a pretty meh match for the original shots that Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson produced. An updated vaccine should rejuvenate our defenses, prodding our antibody levels to soar and our B cells and T cells to relearn the virus’s visage.That doesn’t mean the shots will offer a protective panacea. COVID vaccines, like most others, are best at staving off severe disease and death; against BA.5 and its kin, especially, that protection is likely to be durable and strong. But those same shields will be far more flimsy and ephemeral against milder cases or transmission, and can only modestly cut down the risk of long COVID. And when partnered with a compromised or elderly immune system, the shots have that much less immunological oomph. Then say a new immunity-dodging variant appears: The shots could lose even more of their strength.Vaccine performance also depends on how and how often the shots are used. The more people take the doses, the better they will work. But no matter how hard we try, this reformulated shot “is not going to cover everyone, either because they choose not to get it or won’t be able to access it,” says Katia Bruxvoort, an epidemiologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. People who haven’t yet finished their primary series of COVID shots aren’t expected to be able to sign up for the BA.5 boosts—a policy that Bhattacharya thinks is a big mistake, not least because it will disadvantage anyone who seeks a first brush with vaccine protection this fall. “The better the degree of breadth right at the beginning,” he told me, the better future encounters with the virus should go. Most kids under 12 remain in that totally unvaccinated category; even those who have completed their initial round of shots won’t be eligible for the revamped recipe, at least not in this first autumn push. Among people who can immediately get the new booster, uptake will probably be meager and unbalanced. “Realistically, the boosters are going to be concentrated in the places that have been the least impacted by the pandemic” and in people who have already had at least one boost, says Anne Sosin, a public-health researcher at Dartmouth. Such widening gaps in protection will continue to offer the virus vulnerable pockets to invade.Crummy uptake isn’t a new issue, and some of the same deterrents that have plagued rollouts from the start haven’t gone away. Vaccines are a hassle and can come with annoying side effects. And in recent months, even more obstacles have been raised. The wind-down of COVID funding is making it much harder for people without insurance or other reliable health-care access to get boosted. And after nearly three years of constant crisis slog, far fewer people fear the virus, especially now that so many Americans have caught it and survived. A year into the Biden administration’s concerted push for boosters, fewer than a third of U.S. residents have nabbed even their first additional shot. With each additional injection Americans are asked to get, participation drops off—a trend experts anticipate will continue into the fall. “There’s a psychological hurdle,” says Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist at the Mayo Clinic, “that this is over and done.”[Read: New COVID vaccines will be ready this fall. America won’t be.]The reality that most Americans are living in simply doesn’t square with an urgent call for boosts—which speaks to the “increasing incoherence in our response,” Sosin told me. The nation’s leaders have vanished mask mandates and quarantine recommendations, and shortened isolation stints; they’ve given up on telling schools, universities, and offices to test regularly. People have been repeatedly told not to fear the virus or its potentially lethal threat. And yet the biggest sell for vaccines has somehow become an individualistic, hyper-medicalized call to action—another opportunity to slash one’s chances at severe disease and death. The U.S. needs people to take this vaccine because it has nothing else. But its residents are unlikely to take it, because they’re not doing anything else.If all goes as planned, COVID tests, treatments, and vaccines will be commercialized by 2023—making these fall shots perhaps the last free boosters we’ll get. And yet, officials have neither a new strategy for buoying vaccine uptake nor the ammunition for clear messaging on how well the shots will work. In service of speeding up the availability of the BA.5-focused shots, federal regulators are planning to green-light the new formulation based on antibody data from mice. (Both Pfizer and Moderna have human studies planned or under way, but results aren’t expected to be ready until after the rollout begins.) The reliance on animal experiments isn’t necessarily concerning, Bhattacharya told me; the approval protocol for annual flu shots doesn’t require massive human clinical trials either. But the shortcut does introduce a snag: “We know nothing yet about the efficacy or effectiveness of these Omicron-focused vaccines,” Poland said. Researchers can’t be sure of the degree to which the shots will improve upon the original recipe. And public-health officials won’t be able to leverage the concrete, comforting numbers that have been attached to nearly every other shot that’s been doled out. Instead, communications will hinge on “how much trust you have in the information you’re getting from the government,” UNC’s Wallace told me. “And that is very tricky right now.”Shots, to be abundantly clear, are essential to building up a properly defensive anti-COVID wall. But they are not by themselves sufficient to keep invaders out. Like bricks stacked without a foundation or mortar, they will slip and slide and crumble. Nor is a wall with too few bricks likely to succeed: If the goal is to preemptively quell a winter case surge, “a booster that will have maybe 30 to 40 percent uptake is not something we can expect to have a huge population-level impact,” Bhattacharya told me.[Read: Vaccines are still mostly blocking severe disease]All of that bodes poorly for the coming fall and winter, a time when respiratory viruses thrive and people throng indoors. The nation could see yet another round of “incredibly high surges,” says Jessica Malaty Rivera, a senior adviser at the Pandemic Prevention Institute, further sapping supplies of underutilized or tough-to-access tools such as tests and treatments, and straining a health-care system that’s already on the brink. Cases of long COVID will continue to appear; sick people will continue to miss work and school. And “God forbid we get another variant” that’s even more severe, George Mason’s Popescu told me, further overwhelming the few defenses we have.Pinning all of America’s hopes on vaccines this fall, experts told me, may have ripple effects on our future COVID autumns too. Asked to counter the virus alone, the injections will falter; they will look less appealing, driving uptake further down. If this fall is meant to set a precedent for subsequent vaccination campaigns, it may unspool one of the worst scenarios of all: asking shots to do so much for us that they hardly accomplish anything at all.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen&nbsp;stand to significantly benefit from Biden’s plan, as they borrow an average of about $31,000 in student loans while men borrow an average of about $29,000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpon graduating and entering the workforce, women are paid on average 83 percent of what men are paid.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen also lost nearly 1 million more jobs than men during the coronavirus pandemic, exacerbating long-standing economic disadvantage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWomen are poised to benefit greatly from President Biden’s historic student debt forgiveness plan, as they not only hold higher loan balances on average than men, but&nbsp;also face a gender wage gap and have disproportionately left the workforce or lost jobs since the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden announced on Wednesday borrowers who did not receive a Pell Grant and earned under $125,000 annually would be eligible to have $10,000 of their federal student loan balances forgiven. Those who did receive a Pell Grant could be eligible for $20,000 in forgiveness, with the same income cap. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nWomen&nbsp;stand to be significantly impacted by Biden’s plan, as they borrow an average of about $31,000 in student loans while men borrow an average of about $29,000, according to a report by the American Association of University Women (AAUW).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBlack women carry the most substantial debt burden, taking out about $41,000 in undergraduate loans, including principal and interest, one year after graduating. AAUW found white women borrow about $33,000, Asian women around 27,000, and Hispanic women about $29,000.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“The burden of student loan debt is especially heavy for Black and Hispanic borrowers who on average have less family wealth to rely on to pay for college. And the pandemic only made things worse. This relief helps to narrow the racial wealth gap and advance racial equity,” Biden tweeted.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAAUW CEO Gloria Blackwell applauded the president’s loan forgiveness decision but acknowledged that student loan debt remains&nbsp;“an enormous obstacle to both gender and racial equity.” &nbsp;\n\n\n\nCiting a recent study from the organization, Blackwell noted that “women of color are encountering the ‘perfect storm’ of challenges repaying student debt, due to the combination of the racial wealth gap, the gender and racial pay gaps, and economic instability caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUpon graduating and entering the workforce, women are paid on average 83 percent of what men are paid. Women of color earn about 57 percent of the wages of non-Hispanic white men.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAAUW also found that women’s anticipated salary after graduating was $35,338, which was only 81 percent of men’s&nbsp;expected&nbsp;earnings. Without childcare, that typically leaves a woman $148 per month – after costs like utilities, medical expenses, food, housing, andcar &nbsp;and student loan payments. With child care, that salary would typically put a woman in a monthly deficit of $372. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nWomen lost nearly 1 million more jobs than men during the coronavirus pandemic, exacerbating a long-standing economic disadvantage. They have&nbsp;also borne the brunt of caregiving responsibilities during school closures and local lockdown measures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThough most job losses incurred from the start of the pandemic have been regained, women are still faring worse than men. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe National Women’s Law Center found women are still experiencing a net loss of 100,000 jobs since February 2020—while men have recovered all of their net job losses and now hold 132,000 more jobs in July 2022 than in February 2020.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDebt forgiveness can help, especially among Black women, experts say. The Congressional Black Caucus applauded Biden’s forgiveness plan and chairwomen Joyce Beatty said, “even before applying the additional $10,000 for Pell grant recipients, the average Black borrower will see their balance cut nearly in half, and more than 1 in 4 Black borrowers will see their balance forgiven altogether.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat could free up resources for Black women who want to buy a home, car or build intergenerational wealth. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nSarah Sattelmeyer, project director for education, opportunity and mobility in the Higher Education initiative at New America, told Changing America that Biden’s plan would also help women of color that have disproportionately been burdened by student debt and the fallout of the pandemic. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This announcement will provide much needed relief and is an important step toward fully supporting those in the higher education system and with student loans,” she said.&nbsp;",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/3615769-ransomware-attacks-rose-47-percent-in-july/",
        "description": "Ransomware attacks rose 47 percent from June to July, with the majority of attacks targeting the industrials sector, according to a report released on Thursday by cybersecurity firm NCC Group. \n\n\n\nPrevious reports conducted by the firm indicated that ransomware cases had declined in the spring but soon picked up again, with attacks increasing from 135 in June to 198 in July.\n\n\n\n“This month’s [report] has revealed some major changes within the ransomware threat scene compared to June, as ransomware attacks are once again on the up,” said Matt Hull, global head of threat intelligence at NCC Group, in a statement.\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, the rise in ransomware attacks comes as several new threat actors emerge, including Lockbit 3.0, Hiveleaks and BlackBasts, which have been associated with the Conti ransomware group — a Russia-based hacker group.\n\n\n\nThe report also mentioned the rise of the Lazarus Group, which has been tied to several multimillion-dollar cryptocurrency hacks this year. The group has been associated with the North Korean government.\n\n\n\nIn April, the&nbsp;FBI accused the Lazarus Group&nbsp;of stealing about $620 million in cryptocurrency from the virtual game Axie Infinity.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, the Treasury Department said that the&nbsp;group used Tornado Cash, a cryptocurrency mixer, to steal more than $455 million in cryptocurrency, the largest known virtual currency heist to date, the agency said.\n\n\n\n“Following two major cryptocurrency heists, Lazarus Group seem to be improving their crypto-theft and ransomware operations, so it is more important than ever to monitor their activity closely,” Hull said.\n\n\n\nFederal agencies have continued to warn critical infrastructure to be wary of ransomware attacks, which has become a popular tool for cyber criminals.\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, FBI Director Christopher Wray said that in 2021 cybercriminals used ransomware against 14 of the 16 U.S. critical sectors, including the health care industry.\n\n\n\nThe health care industry has been a prime target for ransomware hackers, as it is a sector that stores valuable and sensitive information such as patient data and medical research and technology.\n\n\n\nLawmakers have urged the Biden administration to strengthen the federal government’s cyber defenses in the health care sector amid a rise in cyberattacks.\n\n\n\nIn a letter addressed to the Department of Health and Human Services, Sen. Angus King (I-Maine) and Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-Wis.) urged the agency to better protect the health care and public health sector from the growing number of cyber threats. \n\n\n\n“Ransomware attacks on the [health care and public health] sector have skyrocketed in the past two years as opportunistic criminals recognized that hospitals may pay quickly to resolve issues and protect patient safety,” the lawmakers said in the letter.",

        "description": "The White House is declining to give a price tag for President Biden’s decision to forgive student loan debts for millions of Americans amid attacks by Republicans that the plan will add to the deficit and increase inflation. \n\n\n\nWhite House officials have spent the 24 hours since the forgiveness plan was announced skirting questions about its costs.\n\n\n\n“Well, that that remains to be determined, and it will be a function of what percentage of eligible borrowers actually take up this opportunity,” domestic policy adviser Susan Rice, who helped lead the student loan forgiveness initiative, told reporters on Wednesday.\n\n\n\n“I think it depends on the numbers. Like, you know, unfortunately — and we're here to encourage as many people to take it up as possible — if 43 million borrowers take it up, that'll be different than if 50 percent of those 43 million take it up,” she added.\n\n\n\nBut Rice was unable to give an estimate for the cost if all 43 million eligible Americans took advantage of the program.\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Thursday also declined to offer a specific estimate.\n\n\n\n“All of this when it comes to cost will also depend on how many of the loans canceled were actually expected to be repaid. It will depend on how many borrowers actually take up this opportunity before we have a real sense,” she said.\n\n\n\nJean-Pierre would also not commit to eventually releasing a cost estimate once officials had one, deferring to the Department of Education.\n\n\n\nInstead of offering concrete estimates, Jean-Pierre focused repeatedly on the argument that the Biden administration’s efforts to reduce the deficit over the last year and a half helps offset any costs incurred by the student debt forgiveness program.\n\n\n\nBut the eventual cost of the program is one of a handful of lingering questions about it that the administration has been unable to answer a day after Biden announced the plan.\n\n\n\nBiden on Wednesday announced his administration is forgiving up to $10,000 in federal student loan debt for borrowers making less than $125,000 annually, or married couples making less than $250,000. The administration is also forgiving $20,000 in loans for Pell Grant recipients, marking the largest forgiveness of the loans per individual to date.\n\n\n\nThe president made the announcement under pressure from progressive groups that had been pushing him to go much further in forgiving student debt. Biden weighed the decision for months, knowing he was likely to take criticism from the left and the right. \n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called the plan a \"wildly unfair redistribution\" of wealth in remarks on Twitter on Wednesday.\n\n\n\nOther Republicans have said the cost on the loan forgiveness will be paid by taxpayers, including blue-collar workers who did not attend college.\n\n\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) on Thursday mocked the White House for not providing an estimate.",

        "description": "There’s an overwhelming sense of deja vu in this competently made but immediately forgettable tale of a superhero forced out of retirementIn Ryan Coogler’s knockout 2015 reboot Creed, OG prizefighter Rocky Balboa was wisely kept outside of the ring for the first time, focusing on something even more terrifying than getting really beat up: getting really old. Sylvester Stallone, whose screen persona had fully devolved into parody by that point with a series of increasingly risible action films, found new depths in the most textured iteration of his most known character, a bruised fighter weathered by the many battles of life. It scored him a much-deserved Oscar nomination and hinted at a late-stage career bloom, one that was less about fists and more about feelings.But such hope was short-lived, the actor returning to roles that required him to shoot first and emote later, and so remains an untapped potential, an action hero who could benefit from transforming into a character actor. In Amazon’s delayed superhero saga Samaritan, one of Stallone’s only non-franchise offerings of late (recent films include The Suicide Squad, Escape Plan 3 and Rambo 5 while next up is The Expendables 4 and Guardians of the Galaxy 3), there’s a brief hint of something more but a brief hint is all it is. It’s gone before you know it, replaced with more of the same. Something similar could be said of the film itself, a setup that suggests a left turn but instead takes us down a very familiar road, right down the middle. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Enlarge / This is definitely not a Razer mouse—but you get the idea. (credit: calvio via Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTwo weeks ago, Twilio and Cloudflare detailed a phishing attack so methodical and well-orchestrated that it tricked employees from both companies into revealing their account credentials. In the case of Twilio, the attack overrode its 2FA protection and gave the threat actors access to its internal systems. Now, researchers have unearthed evidence the attacks were part of a massive phishing campaign that netted almost 10,000 account credentials belonging to 130 organizations.\nBased on the revelations provided by Twilio and Cloudflare, it was already clear that the phishing attacks were executed with almost surgical precision and planning. Somehow, the threat actor had obtained private phone numbers of employees and, in some cases, their family members. The attackers then sent text messages that urged the employees to log in to what appeared to be their employers' legitimate authentication page.\nIn 40 minutes, 76 Cloudflare employees received the text message, which included a domain name registered only 40 minutes earlier, thwarting safeguards the company has in place to detect sites that spoof its name. The phishers also used a proxy site to perform hijacks in real time, a method that allowed them to capture the one-time passcodes Twilio used in its 2FA verifications and enter them into the real site. Almost immediately, the threat actor used its access to Twilio's network to obtain phone numbers belonging to 1,900 users of the Signal Messenger.Read 8 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/08/omicron-booster-vaccine-only-plan/671233/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "America’s first-ever reformulated COVID-19 vaccines are coming, very ahead of schedule, and in some ways, the timing couldn’t be better. Pfizer’s version of the shot, which combines the original recipe with ingredients targeting the Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, may be available to people 12 and older as early as the week after Labor Day; Moderna’s adult-only brew seems to be on a similar track. The schedule slates the shots to debut at a time when BA.5 is still the country’s dominant coronavirus morph—and it means that, after more than a year of scrambling to catch up to SARS-CoV-2’s evolutionary capers, we might finally be getting inoculations that are well matched to the season’s circulating strains. Which is “absolutely great,” says Deepta Bhattacharya, an immunologist at the University of Arizona.In other ways, the timing couldn’t be worse. Emergency pandemic funds have been drying up, imperiling already dwindling supplies of vaccines; with each passing week, more Americans are greeting the coronavirus with little more than a shrug. The most recent revamp of the country’s pandemic playbook has softened or stripped away the greater part of the remaining mitigation measures that stood between SARS-CoV-2 and us. Calls for staying up-to-date on COVID vaccines are one of the last nationwide measures left—which puts a lot of pressure on shot-induced immunity to combat the virus, all on its own.[Read: The pandemic’s soft closing]The nation has latched on before to the idea that shots alone can see us through. When vaccines first rolled out, Americans were assured that they’d essentially stamp out transmission, and that the immunized could take off their masks. “I thought we learned our lesson,” says Saskia Popescu, an infectious-disease epidemiologist at George Mason University. Apparently we did not. America is still stuck on the notion of what Popescu calls “vaccine absolutism.” And it rests on two very shaky assumptions, perhaps both doomed to fail: that the shots can and should sustainably block infection, and that “people will actually go and get the vaccine,” says Deshira Wallace, a public-health researcher at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. As fall looms, the U.S. is now poised to expose the fatal paradox in its vaccine-only plan. At a time when the country is more reliant than ever on the power of inoculation, we’re also doing less than ever to set the shots up for success.In terms of both content and timing, the fall shot will be one of the most important COVID vaccines offered to Americans since the initial doses. Since SARS-CoV-2 first collided with the human population nearly three years ago, it’s shape-shifted. The coronavirus is now better at infecting us and is a pretty meh match for the original shots that Pfizer, Moderna, and Johnson &amp; Johnson produced. An updated vaccine should rejuvenate our defenses, prodding our antibody levels to soar and our B cells and T cells to relearn the virus’s visage.That doesn’t mean the shots will offer a protective panacea. COVID vaccines, like most others, are best at staving off severe disease and death; against BA.5 and its kin, especially, that protection is likely to be durable and strong. But those same shields will be far more flimsy and ephemeral against milder cases or transmission, and can only modestly cut down the risk of long COVID. And when partnered with a compromised or elderly immune system, the shots have that much less immunological oomph. Then say a new immunity-dodging variant appears: The shots could lose even more of their strength.Vaccine performance also depends on how and how often the shots are used. The more people take the doses, the better they will work. But no matter how hard we try, this reformulated shot “is not going to cover everyone, either because they choose not to get it or won’t be able to access it,” says Katia Bruxvoort, an epidemiologist at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. People who haven’t yet finished their primary series of COVID shots aren’t expected to be able to sign up for the BA.5 boosts—a policy that Bhattacharya thinks is a big mistake, not least because it will disadvantage anyone who seeks a first brush with vaccine protection this fall. “The better the degree of breadth right at the beginning,” he told me, the better future encounters with the virus should go. Most kids under 12 remain in that totally unvaccinated category; even those who have completed their initial round of shots won’t be eligible for the revamped recipe, at least not in this first autumn push. Among people who can immediately get the new booster, uptake will probably be meager and unbalanced. “Realistically, the boosters are going to be concentrated in the places that have been the least impacted by the pandemic” and in people who have already had at least one boost, says Anne Sosin, a public-health researcher at Dartmouth. Such widening gaps in protection will continue to offer the virus vulnerable pockets to invade.Crummy uptake isn’t a new issue, and some of the same deterrents that have plagued rollouts from the start haven’t gone away. Vaccines are a hassle and can come with annoying side effects. And in recent months, even more obstacles have been raised. The wind-down of COVID funding is making it much harder for people without insurance or other reliable health-care access to get boosted. And after nearly three years of constant crisis slog, far fewer people fear the virus, especially now that so many Americans have caught it and survived. A year into the Biden administration’s concerted push for boosters, fewer than a third of U.S. residents have nabbed even their first additional shot. With each additional injection Americans are asked to get, participation drops off—a trend experts anticipate will continue into the fall. “There’s a psychological hurdle,” says Gregory Poland, a vaccinologist at the Mayo Clinic, “that this is over and done.”[Read: New COVID vaccines will be ready this fall. America won’t be.]The reality that most Americans are living in simply doesn’t square with an urgent call for boosts—which speaks to the “increasing incoherence in our response,” Sosin told me. The nation’s leaders have vanished mask mandates and quarantine recommendations, and shortened isolation stints; they’ve given up on telling schools, universities, and offices to test regularly. People have been repeatedly told not to fear the virus or its potentially lethal threat. And yet the biggest sell for vaccines has somehow become an individualistic, hyper-medicalized call to action—another opportunity to slash one’s chances at severe disease and death. The U.S. needs people to take this vaccine because it has nothing else. But its residents are unlikely to take it, because they’re not doing anything else.If all goes as planned, COVID tests, treatments, and vaccines will be commercialized by 2023—making these fall shots perhaps the last free boosters we’ll get. And yet, officials have neither a new strategy for buoying vaccine uptake nor the ammunition for clear messaging on how well the shots will work. In service of speeding up the availability of the BA.5-focused shots, federal regulators are planning to green-light the new formulation based on antibody data from mice. (Both Pfizer and Moderna have human studies planned or under way, but results aren’t expected to be ready until after the rollout begins.) The reliance on animal experiments isn’t necessarily concerning, Bhattacharya told me; the approval protocol for annual flu shots doesn’t require massive human clinical trials either. But the shortcut does introduce a snag: “We know nothing yet about the efficacy or effectiveness of these Omicron-focused vaccines,” Poland said. Researchers can’t be sure of the degree to which the shots will improve upon the original recipe. And public-health officials won’t be able to leverage the concrete, comforting numbers that have been attached to nearly every other shot that’s been doled out. Instead, communications will hinge on “how much trust you have in the information you’re getting from the government,” UNC’s Wallace told me. “And that is very tricky right now.”Shots, to be abundantly clear, are essential to building up a properly defensive anti-COVID wall. But they are not by themselves sufficient to keep invaders out. Like bricks stacked without a foundation or mortar, they will slip and slide and crumble. Nor is a wall with too few bricks likely to succeed: If the goal is to preemptively quell a winter case surge, “a booster that will have maybe 30 to 40 percent uptake is not something we can expect to have a huge population-level impact,” Bhattacharya told me.[Read: Vaccines are still mostly blocking severe disease]All of that bodes poorly for the coming fall and winter, a time when respiratory viruses thrive and people throng indoors. The nation could see yet another round of “incredibly high surges,” says Jessica Malaty Rivera, a senior adviser at the Pandemic Prevention Institute, further sapping supplies of underutilized or tough-to-access tools such as tests and treatments, and straining a health-care system that’s already on the brink. Cases of long COVID will continue to appear; sick people will continue to miss work and school. And “God forbid we get another variant” that’s even more severe, George Mason’s Popescu told me, further overwhelming the few defenses we have.Pinning all of America’s hopes on vaccines this fall, experts told me, may have ripple effects on our future COVID autumns too. Asked to counter the virus alone, the injections will falter; they will look less appealing, driving uptake further down. If this fall is meant to set a precedent for subsequent vaccination campaigns, it may unspool one of the worst scenarios of all: asking shots to do so much for us that they hardly accomplish anything at all.",

        "description": "When Massimo Scanziani’s daughter was young, he’d often see her eyes twitching beneath her eyelids while she was sleeping. These rapid eye movements (or REMs) are so obvious, Scanziani told me, that he can hardly believe that they were described just seven decades ago. In 1953, Eugene Aserinsky and Nathaniel Kleitman identified a special phase of sleep when neurons were abuzz and eyes were shut but flitting about. During this phase, now called “REM sleep,” people tended to have vivid dreams. Maybe, Kleitman suggested, the eye movements reflected “where and at what the dreamer was looking” in their virtual world.Several researchers tested this “scanning hypothesis” in the ’50s and ’60s by waking sleeping volunteers when their eyes twitched and asking them what they had just dreamed. Perhaps unsurprisingly, these crude methods failed to produce consistent results. But despite alternative explanations—maybe the movements lubricate the closed eye or arise from random brain activity—the scanning hypothesis remains popular. And through a clever experiment involving mice, Scanziani and his colleague Yuta Senzai, who are both neuroscientists at UC San Francisco, think they’ve finally shown that eye twitches are a direct line into an inner dream world.As a mouse moves, a group of neurons in its brain tracks the direction of its head, acting like an internal compass. Some of these neurons fire when the mouse turns left; others buzz when it turns right. By analyzing a mouse’s activity, a scientist can tell you where it is facing without ever looking at the rodent itself. And during REM sleep, even though a mouse’s head isn’t moving, its head-direction cells still fire as if it were exploring.Scanziani and Senzai reasoned that, by recording the activity of these neurons with implanted electrodes, they could work out where sleeping mice are looking in their dream worlds. They then showed that the signals from this internal compass matched the movements of the rodents’ eyes (which they could track because mice often sleep with their eyes slightly open). When a mouse seems to move its head around in its dream, its eyes flick in the same direction, to the same degree, and at the same moment. “The rodent is certainly exploring the environment in its dream,” Scanziani told me. “By looking at its moving eyes, we have a window into its dreaming brain.”These results suggest that “in their dreams, mice are attending to the events unfolding before them and interacting with them actively, intentionally, and dynamically,” says David Peña-Guzmán, a philosopher at San Francisco State University and the author of When Animals Dream. Many philosophers would regard that as “a clear indicator of consciousness,” he told me.But other sleep researchers are not convinced that Scanziani and Senzai showed what they think they showed. Sara Aton, a neuroscientist at the University of Michigan, told me that head and eye movements are so tightly coupled when mice (and humans) are awake that you wouldn’t expect them to suddenly disconnect during sleep. That they remain linked doesn’t tell us whether mice are perceiving a dream world, let alone gazing about it. “We simply can’t read that out from the brain,” Aton said. Mark Blumberg, a neuroscientist at the University of Iowa, agrees. “The link to dreams is gratuitous,” he told me. Scanziani and Senzai “assert that they’re peering into the virtual world of dreams, but they haven’t done so—nor can they.”At first glance, this might seem like a semantic argument: “I can say that we’re looking at coordinated activity of distinct parts of the brain occurring during REM sleep that strongly resembles the activity that the brain has when it’s awake, or I can call it a dream,” Scanziani said. But those things aren’t necessarily identical, and Blumberg argues that equating them could distract us from understanding the role of REM sleep.He notes that when eyes move during this phase, other body parts twitch too, including limbs and whiskers. These movements look like more evidence of dreams spilling into reality—sleeping dogs chasing imagined rabbits—but they might represent something simpler. Blumberg argues that the brain uses REM sleep to test-drive the body. The brain pings the neurons that control muscles, creating twitches; it then collects sensory information from those moving limbs. By testing those connections during times of stillness, it can refine and recalibrate the network to work more efficiently during times of wakeful chaos. According to this view, REM-phase movements aren’t about dreams at all. They’re the work of a brain that’s learning how to more effectively pilot a body.This explanation better accounts for aspects of REM sleep that don’t easily fit with the scanning hypothesis. For example, people who are born blind still move their eyes during sleep, even though they don’t dream visually and clearly aren’t looking around. Also, the REM phase of sleep is longest in newborn humans, mice, and other mammals whose infants are relatively helpless at birth. These are exactly the individuals whose brain would need the most time to get to grips with their body. By contrast, if the twitches are linked to dreams, “why would newborns twitch so much when they have so little to dream about?” Blumberg said.  Since its discovery, REM sleep has been associated with dreaming (even though we dream in non-REM sleep too). And because dreams are so fascinating, they became the focus of our attempts to understand REM—the sun that other hypotheses orbit around. But what if they aren’t central? Scanziani told me that dreams might arise because the brain replays memories after “a long day of experiences” to better organize what it has learned, or “generates and explores possibilities to help us make better predictions when we’re awake.” This is essentially what the test-drive hypothesis argues, except here, the brain is just testing the connections within itself, rather than those with the rest of the body. It’s intuitive to see the dreams and twitches of REM sleep as connected phenomena. But perhaps they’re two independent reflections of a brain that’s relentlessly recalibrating.",

        "description": "Few things are more satisfying for a certain type of college-football fan than a Notre Dame loss, and all the better if it’s an upset. So last September, when the Fighting Irish were in danger of losing to the University of Toledo Rockets, 16.5-point underdogs, I knew I had to watch. First I flipped over to NBC, where Notre Dame’s home games are generally aired. No luck. Even before I could Google it, my Twitter feed reminded me of the problem: I had been Peacocked. The game was only on NBC’s streaming platform, which costs $4.99 a month. By that point, it was late in the fourth quarter and I was getting desperate. A Good Samaritan sent me a password, and I logged on just in time to miss all the fun and see Toledo boot away the game with poor defense and clock management.The sports-streaming monster had come for me, and maybe it’s come for you too. With ever fewer exceptions, it is no longer possible to watch all of your favorite team’s games with only a cable-TV subscription or a digital look-alike, such as YouTube TV. The biggest leagues, such as the NFL and MLB, already offer expensive but useful packages to watch games that aren’t in your local market, but now all sorts of sports are getting far deeper in the streaming business. The past was about readily accessible games on TV and an add-on for the most committed fans who wanted to stay in touch with teams that were far away. The present is about paying more and more money to maintain what you had while being occasionally flummoxed about where to find it.The whole promise of streaming, in sports and beyond, was that it was supposed to make our lives easier and less expensive. We could keep watching the things we enjoyed—and more—without the commitment of cable. In the entertainment world, the promise has by and large held up. But in sports, the streaming gold rush has largely done the opposite. The experience of being a fan is now more expensive, more annoying, and more transactional. Even when your team wins, you end up as the loser.Whatever problems might exist with regular old streaming of movies and TV, the user experience is mostly good. The HBO Max app may be terrible, but The Sopranos is not, and it is right there for you at any hour of the day on any device. Yes, there are lots of different platforms, all of which offer different shows and movies, but most of us can reasonably be happy with one or two services that aren’t prohibitively costly. If your favorite show is Stranger Things, you can get it in one place. Netflix does not ship some episodes off to Hulu, nor does it have a cable channel that holds the season premiere.[Read: This is peak subscription]Sports streaming, in contrast, is a patchwork in which games are spread across  services. Particularly if you are a diehard who likes to watch a bunch of sports, this new world is trouble. Different leagues have made the streaming leap at different speeds, but they are all moving in the same direction—toward putting more and more games on direct-to-consumer platforms instead of traditional TV.Take the NFL: Starting this fall, the league will put Thursday Night Football exclusively on Amazon Prime Video, the first time the NFL has pulled a game off TV to put it somewhere else. The Big Ten, the richest conference in college athletics, will soon air eight football games and dozens of men’s and women’s basketball games on Peacock exclusively each year. Other sports leagues are already there. This year, MLB started showing a Friday game on Apple TV+ (for free, with a login required), and another Sunday-morning game is paywalled on Peacock. That service is already a must-have for American fans of the English Premier League who do not want to hunt for bootleg streams. But if you’re a fan of Europe’s other big soccer leagues, they’re on ESPN+, the same place you’ll also find early-tournament PGA Tour rounds and a healthy chunk of the NHL. It sounds like a buffet of options, but it’s really one of requirements for someone whose fandom has crossed a certain threshold of devotion. That applies if you like just one team or sport, and it’s an even costlier smorgasbord if you, like me, watch a lot of different sports from time to time.For fans of smaller, more niche sports or teams, streaming has some obvious benefits. The majority of college-football games played outside the big “Power Five” conferences are only on streaming platforms, to say nothing of sports such as volleyball or wrestling, which almost never see regular TV. All Major League Soccer games are slated to soon be on Apple TV+. At its best, streaming can brighten the limelight on smaller sports.On the whole, though, this status quo amounts to the worst of all worlds. Streaming has gone on top of cable rather than supplanted it. If your team is the Tennessee Titans, you’ll need to find your way to Prime Video for two games this fall. That will run you $8.99 a month at the very least. Even if you’re setting up an antenna to get CBS and Fox—and more power to you if so—you’ll still need cable to watch them on Monday Night Football against the Buffalo Bills in September.And if you were hoping that more credit-card charges would result in a better viewing experience, you have been disappointed. The problem is not the apps themselves, which usually work fine. Apple TV+ knows how to produce a baseball game. ESPN+ is easy to navigate. Peacock is clunkier, I have found in my limited uses, but it does what it says it will do. The problem is that livestreaming is still not perfect, especially compared with the speed of traditional broadcasts. Depending on the circumstances, games can lag for a minute or more, opening the door for social media or a text from Dad to spoil a home run.At the very least, these sorts of hiccups should get better over time. When television was new, it had similar growing pains in how sports were presented, John Carvalho, a professor emeritus of journalism at Auburn University who edited a research anthology on sports-media history, told me. “The quality of black and white,” he said, “and the experience with radio, was such that it satisfied the naysayer [who said] it really wasn’t a viewing experience that would draw people any more than radio would.” Of course it became really easy to watch sports in a timely fashion on TV, and nothing is stopping streaming from becoming just as easy.  But for now, the entire experience is downright confusing. “Everybody thought [streaming] is what the future would be,” Patrick Crakes, a former Fox Sports vice president who now covers the sports and media industries as a consultant, told me. “Cheap, everything choice. Of course, it’s not that, because you can’t get all the content in one place for an effective price. And so it’s put out all over the place, and it’s fractionalized, and it’s expensive.”Part of the problem is our immense collective value as sports fans, mixed with some tricky economics. Sports bring guaranteed audiences at guaranteed times in a way nothing else can: In 2021, 95 of the country’s 100 most-watched telecasts were sporting events, according to Sports Business Journal. As a result, the fees that media companies pay to show live sports have gone way up. But the number of Americans who have cable has not. Media companies are caught between what pays the bills now and what they believe may pay them in the future. Live games are crucial firepower for them on both fronts. They need them to collect advertising dollars and carriage fees today. But they also need them as subscriber boosters for what they hope will be their streaming empires of tomorrow. (And hey, it doesn’t hurt that streaming can offer an easy path to a lot of customer data in a way most TV viewership does not.)[Read: America didn’t need sports after all]Expect to be stuck in this purgatory for a while, because sports leagues have heavy incentives to remain on traditional TV even as they dabble with streaming. The NFL’s new slate of media deals is worth $110 billion over 11 years. The Amazon piece is worth about a tenth of it. The NFL has you by the cord even as it also grabs you by the scruff of your preferred streaming device. “No sports league can pirouette to [streaming], because of the opportunity-cost problem” of how much more money can currently be made by putting games on TV, Crakes said. Unfortunately, in the short and medium term, streaming is going to be an extra cost for sports fans rather than a lower one.Cord-cutting is still the present and the future, but the sum cost of even just a few big streaming sites, let alone all, is about the price of cable. With the messiness of streaming right now, it’s hard not to feel a little nostalgic about the expensive pay-TV-bundle model that once dominated. “That thing was so bad that more than 90 percent of all U.S. TV homes subscribed to it,” Crakes said. “In other words, people complained about it, but it clearly had utility.” Cable is just alive enough to ensure that the inexpensive elegance of sports streaming is often nothing more than a burdensome accessory.If there is any reason for optimism, it is that Notre Dame’s Peacock-exclusive game this fall is against the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, one of the country’s most hapless college-football teams that almost certainly will not mount a Toledo-like threat. At least I won’t be tempted this time.",

        "description": "Inspectors general have been referred to as the most powerful public officials you’ve never heard of. In fact, IGs are a crucial part of our democratic system’s checks and balances: They expose government misconduct, fraud, and abuse, and they promote transparency in government operations. Over the years, IGs have uncovered wasteful expenditures in pandemic-relief funding, investigated alleged misconduct by the secretary of Veterans Affairs, and brought to light the FBI’s misuse of sensitive national-security letters.Of course, IGs are not the only check on government—Congress, the courts, and the media also act as checks—but IGs are uniquely placed inside federal agencies, with unfettered access to all agency officials and records. They have the independent authority to investigate, audit, and report on the full range of government programs. An effective IG has the power to improve government and raise public trust in agencies; an incompetent or ineffective inspector general can have the opposite effect.Recently, a series of allegations surfaced regarding the conduct of Joseph Cuffari, the IG at the Department of Homeland Security. According to the January 6 committee, Cuffari knew about the deletion of Secret Service text messages relating to the Capitol riot but did not notify Congress about it for months. Allegedly, he also prevented his own investigators from seeking to recover the text messages. Now the chair of the committee says that Cuffari is not cooperating with its investigation of the missing texts.[Read: The January 6 Committee’s most damning revelation yet]According to media reports, Cuffari is additionally being investigated for prior retaliation against employees in his office and allegedly is not cooperating fully with that investigation either. He also allegedly declined to open a review of the Secret Service’s use of force in the June 2020 Lafayette Square demonstration, and he allegedly removed negative findings about the Secret Service from other reviews.We do not yet know all the facts in these cases, but these serious allegations are troubling. Cuffari was appointed IG at the Department of Homeland Security in 2019. He seems to have come to the attention of the Trump administration after working as a policy adviser to two Republican governors of Arizona—this is contrary to the 1978 Inspector General Act, which requires IGs to be selected without regard to political affiliation.Cuffari also appears to lack the management experience to lead one of the largest and most important IG offices. He worked as a criminal investigator in the Department of Justice’s IG office for 20 years, but his most senior position there was as an assistant special agent in charge of running a small regional office, where he supervised five people or fewer. That job was five levels removed from the IG position.The question of his experience aside, The Washington Post recently uncovered a previously undisclosed internal report alleging that during Cuffari’s time in the Department of Justice’s IG office, he violated ethics regulations and faced several other accusations of misconduct. According to the Post, these additional allegations were never investigated because Cuffari retired from that position shortly after the completion of the internal report in 2013.Cuffari’s case highlights the need for reforms in the ways that IGs are selected, assessed, and removed. Cuffari’s appointment reflected a failure in vetting. IGs hold a great deal of power and guard their independence zealously. That is why the experience and character of each IG is crucial, and why it is important to select the right IGs for these positions. That is also why it is equally important to have a fair and efficient process for removing the ones who fail to meet the standards that the office demands.I was an IG for 15 years, in four presidential administrations, both Republican and Democratic. I served as the IG of the Justice Department for 11 years (from 2000 to 2011) and also as the acting IG of the Department of Defense for four years (from 2016 to 2020). During that time, I witnessed the majority of my IG colleagues performing in an exemplary manner. Their work sent billions of dollars back to the federal Treasury and held government officials accountable for misconduct and inefficiency. Only a small minority of IGs were, unfortunately, not up to the task.[Read: The FBI’s reckoning]IGs have a challenging job in providing oversight of their agencies, one that does not make them beloved officials. I knew that I was not the most popular person in the Department of Justice cafeteria. Shortly after I became the IG there, I went to Capitol Hill to brief a senator about one of our reports. I took along my longtime colleague and deputy at the time, Paul Martin (he is now an accomplished and successful IG at NASA).  After I finished speaking, the senator said: “Good briefing, but now let me tell you what I think of IGs.” Jabbing his finger at me, he went on: “IGs must be independent. You will do things that I won’t like. You will do things other members of Congress won’t like. You will do things the attorney general won’t like. You won’t be liked. Nobody will like you. If you think you will be liked, don’t think that.”At that point, Paul had heard enough and interjected.“Don’t worry about that, senator,” he said. “Even I don’t like him.”The senator burst out laughing, but I took his point to heart: The IG’s goal is not to be popular; it is to make an agency run better and hold powerful officials accountable.The position of inspector general dates back to our country’s founding. During the Revolutionary War, George Washington relied on an IG, Baron Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben, to train the colonial troops and to instill discipline in a ragtag army. Other U.S. armed services also created their own IG positions to uncover and report problems to their military leaders.Civilian IGs are a relatively new creation, part of a series of post-Watergate reforms, enshrined in the IG Act. There are now 74 IGs throughout the federal government, located in virtually every agency. IGs are required to keep both the agency head and Congress informed of significant problems. At the larger agencies, IGs are appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate. IGs do not have a term of office. Unlike other presidential appointees, they are expected to remain even when administrations change, because their positions are supposed to be nonpartisan.So how was Cuffari selected to be the IG at the Department of Homeland Security, one of the biggest, most challenging, and most troubled IG offices in the federal government?A coordinating group of all federal IGs, the Council of Inspectors General on Integrity and Efficiency (CIGIE), is required to recommend candidates to the White House. According to the Post, the CIGIE was seemingly unaware of the earlier Department of Justice internal report on Cuffari’s alleged ethical misconduct and recommended him for an IG position after a less than hour-long interview. At a minimum, the process for selecting and vetting IG candidates needs improvement.Unfortunately, the CIGIE does not have a dedicated budget or sufficient staff to vet candidates for IG positions. The Council needs a direct appropriation. This need not be a huge budget; just a few million dollars would pay off many times over.Cuffari’s case also illustrates the need for a better process to investigate allegations of IG misconduct. The CIGIE has an Integrity Committee to coordinate investigations of IGs and their senior staff. But Integrity Committee investigations of misconduct are undertaken by other IGs on a rotating, volunteer basis. As a result, they take far too long, are handled inconsistently, and tend not to receive the attention they deserve because of other demands on the volunteers’ time.Accordingly, the investigations of Cuffari now under way may drag on for months, if not years. CIGIE’s Integrity Committee needs a dedicated budget and sufficient staff to investigate allegations of misconduct quickly, credibly, and consistently.At the same time, the independence of IGs, most of whom are doing their jobs well, needs better protections. The IG Act allows the president to remove any IG: The president is supposed to give Congress the reasons for the dismissal and wait 30 days before removal. But in 2020 President Donald Trump bypassed even that limited process in what the Post labeled the “slow-motion Friday night massacre of inspectors general”—in a matter of weeks, Trump replaced five IGs (full disclosure: I was one of them). Several of them were placed on administrative leave immediately.[Read: Was it worth it?]The IG Act should be amended to require the president to provide a full and specific explanation for removing an IG, not just a statement of a general loss of confidence as is commonly the practice now. The full 30-day waiting period must also apply, and more protections should be put in place to prevent the immediate removals enacted by putting IGs on administrative leave.A related problem is that many IG positions are filled by acting officials for years. For example, the Department of Defense has not had a confirmed IG for more than six years; in President Barack Obama’s administration, the permanent State Department IG position remained open during his entire first term. The president should nominate IGs more quickly, and Congress should make confirmations a priority.But it should not be a job for life. After the 11 years I’d served as the Department of Justice IG, I believed that a change would be good for the organization (and for me), so I stepped down. Other oversight officials have fixed terms—the FBI director’s term is 10 years, for example, and the term of the head of the Government Accountability Office is 15 years. IGs, too, should have term limits.And because some IGs remain in their posts too long—or because, for whatever reason, some underperform—we need a better way to assess them and remove ineffective ones, even absent a substantiated investigation of misconduct. An amended IG Act could require the CIGIE to create a committee of senior, well-respected IGs to issue and enforce standards of efficiency and effectiveness, as well as to make recommendations to the president to remove any IGs who do not meet those standards. This would be fairer than the current practice of relying on recommendations from agency heads, who may have a motive to remove an IG who aggressively pursues critical oversight in the agency.To be clear, many government leaders support the work of IGs. I will never forget my first meeting with one new attorney general at the Justice Department to brief him about my role and the independence of IGs.“So you are telling me that I can order around everyone else in this building,” he said, “but I can’t tell you what to audit or investigate.”“Yes, that is what the IG Act requires,” I said.“Okay, I get it,” he replied, “we follow the law around here.” And he did.In short, we need to ensure that the right IGs are selected and that ineffective ones are removed in a fair, efficient, and nonpartisan way. The inspector-general system plays a crucial part in the health of our democracy by promoting transparency in government and acting as a check on government officials. When they do the job right, IGs make government better.This article has been adapted from the author’s recent essay for the Brookings Institution.",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2022/08/zatko-twitter-tech-industry-whistleblowers/671227/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "When the hacker turned corporate-cybersecurity specialist Peiter Zatko went to work for Twitter in 2020, he thought he could help the company improve its practices after some embarrassing breaches. But either he couldn’t help Twitter, or Twitter didn’t want his aid—less than two years, later the company fired him. Last month he issued a massive complaint against it to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the Federal Trade Commission, alleging widespread malfeasance and fraud at the social network.Earlier this week, after The Washington Post and CNN broke news of the complaint, newspapers everywhere started calling Zatko a “whistleblower,” and I read the word so many times that it ceased to bear meaning. Zatko’s accusations are serious, but the complaint, and the reporting I’ve read about it, also makes them seem amorphous and inchoate, disconnected from real stakes. Zatko’s situation didn’t exactly have the sensibility of, say, a factory-farm foreman revealing that a major company is poisoning its chicken thighs, or a mid-level bureaucrat exposing a government perpetrating atrocities in the name of its citizens.Tech companies are so big and so powerful and do so many bad things without consequence, it’s understandable that people may feel they have no option other than blowing the whistle on these companies, the way a civil servant might on a government. But it’s an imperfect system for meting out justice. The problem lies less with Zatko and his specific accusations—many of which look pretty bad for Twitter—and more with the erosion of the whistleblower as a concept in contemporary life. That’s a path Zatko didn’t forge, even if he’s treading it. Whistleblowers used to be underdogs, willing to ruin their lives in the pursuit of the truth, so that its revelation might serve the commons. Now they’re more like corporate-espionage influencers, whose actions put attention-seeking and material gain before, or in place of, justice.Whistleblowing has a very long history. In 1777, during the American Revolution, 10 sailors aboard the warship U.S.S. Warren met in secret to conspire against a man much more powerful than them. Commodore Esek Hopkins, the commander of the Continental Navy, had tortured British sailors; the group wrote a petition to the Continental Congress, which, swayed by their case, suspended Hopkins. But the commander retaliated, and Warren sailors Samuel Shaw and Richard Marven were arrested and jailed. In response to that obviously corrupt outcome, Congress enacted what is considered to be the world’s first whistleblower law. It didn’t just protect righteous actors such as Shaw and Marven; it demanded that others in similar positions act similarly, decreeing that “it is the duty of all persons in the service of the United States, as well as all other inhabitants thereof, to give the earliest information to Congress or other proper authority of any misconduct, frauds or misdemeanors committed by any officers or persons in the service of these states, which may come to their knowledge.”In the following centuries, whistleblowers became symbols of moral honor. The English shipping clerk Edmund Dene Morel was instrumental in exposing the brutal, plantation slave labor in the Congo. The retired Marine general and Medal of Honor recipient Smedley Butler exposed a plot to overthrow the U.S. government during Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration. The epidemiologist Peter Buxtun, working for the U.S. Public Health Service, exposed the Tuskegee Study, in which his employer had denied treatment to Black men infected with syphilis over four decades. The government analyst Daniel Ellsberg leaked the documents that became known as the Pentagon Papers, a secret account of the U.S. government’s mishandling of the Vietnam War spanning multiple presidencies. The New York City police officer Frank Serpico disclosed widespread bribery and financial corruption in the force. Edward Snowden, an intelligence contractor, leaked evidence of the NSA’s global surveillance programs. (Snowden offers an illustrative example of how messy the designation of “whistleblower” can be. He was charged under the Espionage Act in 2013 and fled to Moscow, where he has lived since.)Fame often followed their revelations. An entire Whistleblower Cinematic Universe retold the stories of Serpico, Snowden, and others. But that notoriety came as a result of the moral stakes of the revelations and the virtue required to unveil them. Past whistleblowers did more than just expose misdeeds. They selflessly did so from a position of far less power than those they accused, in order to protect or defend others who similarly lack power. The whistleblower is—or was—an actor moved by duty, virtue, or both.To this day, the formal definition of a whistleblower descends directly from its 18th-century precedent, in the form of laws that encourage actors to reveal misconduct by protecting them if they do so. The protections formally afforded to whistleblowers increased over time, but most of those protections were still afforded to government workers.That changed relatively recently. In 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act became law. Dodd-Frank, passed in the aftermath of the Great Recession (and the wrongdoing by big banks that helped cause it), inaugurated a major shift in whistleblowerdom, especially in the private sector, where other laws generally didn’t reach. Crucially, Dodd-Frank added a financial incentive to the sometimes-risky practice of becoming an informant. Under the law, the SEC offers cash rewards for tips that lead to the receipt of monetary sanctions. Since its inception, the SEC has recovered billions of such dollars and awarded a cool $1 billion back to people who helped it get the goods. Money, once the enemy that inspired Serpico to blow a whistle, became a motivation for doing so.And predictably, whistleblowing has become a business. Stephen M. Kohn, a whistleblower attorney who won one of the largest awards in history, $104 million for a tax-evasion case, wrote a book about the practice, The New Whistleblower’s Handbook. “Doing what’s right,” a phrase that appears in the book’s subtitle, imbricated with doing what produces financial gain. This is a tremendous shift, and one with enormous consequences: Though some people will argue that whistleblowers deserve financial comfort—in addition to protection from persecution—for having the courage to speak up, society relies on people to tell the truth because it is right, not because they might get paid for it.Zatko may well be acting out of conscience. In his complaint, he calls his disclosures an “ethical obligation” and suggests that he aspires to remain true to a hacker’s obligation to notify an affected party of its security-related problems. The complaint exclusively refers to him by his hacker name, Mudge, seemingly to underscore that allegiance. But he is indisputably a different type of actor than the civil-servant whistleblowers of history. And the structures that have arisen around whistleblowing in recent years complicate its appeals to principle alone.Zatko’s complaint against Twitter contains dozens of allegations about what the company did wrong, including lax device security, poor control of its production environment, missaccounting of bot accounts, and more. (A Twitter spokesperson defended the company’s security practices to the Post, and told the paper that “Zatko’s allegations appeared to be ‘riddled with inaccuracies’ and that Zatko ‘now appears to be opportunistically seeking to inflict harm on Twitter, its customers, and its shareholders.’”) But all throughout the complaint, these claims are framed not principally as misdeeds against best practice, national security, user privacy, or other domains of legitimate concern to the general public. No, they are first presented as evidence of fraud. Defrauding investors is the financial crime for which the SEC can pursue redress and, upon a successful enforcement action, restitution. For every dollar or million that the SEC might recover from Twitter if Zatko’s allegations prove actionable, Zatko (and his lawyers) could be entitled to 10 to 30 percent.John Tye, chief disclosure officer of the nonprofit legal group Whistleblower Aid, which represents Zatko, says the prospect of a reward didn’t motivate Zatko. “In fact he didn't even know about the reward program when he decided to become a lawful whistleblower,” Tye said in an email. He did so, Tye said, to help the SEC enforce the laws. That’s fair enough. But enforcing securities law—already a somewhat dubious moral prospect compared with historical whistleblower interventions—now entails a reward whether you ask for one or not. Remuneration infects the process. Kohn did call it the new whistleblowing, after all.Whistleblower Aid also counts Frances Haugen, the Facebook Papers leaker, as a client. The eBay billionaire Pierre Omidyar has funded both Whistleblower Aid and Haugen’s efforts, a philanthropic gesture that might reasonably be construed as realpolitik to expose legitimate wrongdoing by some of the most powerful companies in the world, but that also amounts to the creation of a fundraising and organization-building activity—a whole jobs program surrounding tech oppositionalism.And then there’s the dude who has the most to gain from Zatko’s supposedly righteous revelations about Twitter: Elon Musk, the world’s richest man, who still hopes he doesn’t have to write a $44 billion check to buy the company. Zatko’s extensive warnings about the number of bots on Twitter, an issue that obsesses Musk, seem startlingly aligned with Musk’s interests rather than those of misled investors, let alone the public. (Tye, Zatko’s representative, told me that his client began the process that led to this disclosure in December, before Musk expressed any interest in acquiring Twitter. Musk has not been involved “in any way,” Tye said in an email.)Zatko’s complaint does issue some concerning accusations against his former employer. According to Zatko, Twitter played fast and loose with security, and in a way that might violate a settlement the company reached in 2011 after the FTC alleged major lapses in its data-security practices. But the complaint is also riddled with gripes that speak more to Zatko’s dissatisfaction than Twitter’s alleged corruption. His bosses didn’t take his advice, and Zatko didn’t like that. Then they froze him out, and fired him. Maybe doing so constitutes fraud or violation—the SEC and FTC will have to sort that matter out. But even if so, Zatko’s barrage of accusations might not amount to the “explosive” revelation that some news coverage of the complaint has described. The document reads like a paid legal expert’s report on why Twitter committed fraud by a disgruntled former employee who stands to gain from its exposure, not as a righteous man’s case for why a global social network is obviously and grievously dangerous.But alas, the media cannot resist the temptation to cast the new whistleblowers in the role of the old ones. As I wrote for The Atlantic when the Facebook Papers broke, stories such as Daniel Ellsberg’s come from the golden age of journalism, when information couldn’t find an audience without the aid of a newspaper or magazine or television network. Ad-driven internet companies such as Facebook and Google and Twitter absconded with that access, and the spoils that accompanied it. These companies royally mucked up both the business of journalism and the operation of the democracy the Fourth Estate holds in check; journalists are both right to hold the tech industry’s power to account and sometimes overly eager to do so.Perhaps one of the greatest ironies of the new whistleblowing is that tattling for material scraps is the only way the internet operates. Online life is a constant contest of appearance, both physical and moral. With attention at a premium and content proliferating, all anyone can do is scrabble to claim whatever crumbs any situation might shake loose: a hot take that produces clicks that burnish a reputation; a thirst trap that generates followers to justify sponsorship rates; a megaviral post that yields neither satisfaction nor even SoundCloud listens, but only the passing attention of a million people you’ve never met. A whistleblower complaint that might yet yield a payday, even if it also reveals a hidden truth.An amorphous creature has attached itself to the new whistleblowers, like a barnacle on the warship Warren: glory and the influence it might deliver. Once an act that at least aspired toward modesty, whistleblowing entailed sufficient risk that informing on a more powerful actor might still ruin one’s life. But now, in the internet age, whistleblowing has become a path—if a terrible, unintuitive one—to fame and its trappings. That glory drives the hungry maw of material success, whether or not the being that devours its spoils thrives or starves. Like everything else, whistleblowing is just another hustle.",

        "description": "When Russia’s siege of Mariupol began in February, Ivan Demkiv was the senior surgeon at a military hospital known simply by its number: 555. The hospital took in 20 wounded on the first day of the war. The number kept going up from there. For weeks, Demkiv hardly left the operating theater. His days were an endless succession of limb amputations and other lifesaving interventions, the sound of Russia’s bombardment of the city always in the background. Demkiv stayed at work even when Russians bombed the hospital itself, scattering broken glass over a patient unconscious on the operating table.The price of that dedication was his eventual capture. Demkiv was taken prisoner in mid-April, along with 77 other doctors and hospital staff, and has been held ever since at a complex called Olenivka in the Russian-occupied east. The experience of Demkiv and his colleagues is revealing on a number of levels. First, it shows Russia’s willingness to imprison noncombatant Ukrainians in areas it has captured, either to hold them as bargaining chips for prisoner swaps or to put them to work under duress. More than that, it suggests that Russia is violating humanitarian laws that apply to prisoners of war about food, hygiene, and access to the Red Cross, as well as subjecting them to intimidation and public curiosity.Compounding these concerns, in July a mysterious explosion killed more than 50 POWs at Olenivka. Ukraine blames the massacre on Russia and wants it investigated as a war crime. Demkiv and his colleagues were not harmed, but their relatives fear for their well-being. I spoke with several members of a support group formed by the relatives to seek the medics’ release.In the weeks before he was taken prisoner, Demkiv was constantly worrying about his family: his wife, Anna, and their two children, aged 11 and 8. He knew they were hiding in the basement of their apartment building in a badly bombed district near the ruined Port City mall. As Russian forces tightened their stranglehold on the city, they cut off food, water, power, and cellphone service—so the couple could no longer text each other.By the end of the war’s second week, Demkiv could bear the separation and uncertainty no longer. On March 4, in a break between surgeries, he grabbed a ride in an ambulance and rushed to evacuate Anna and the kids. But they were not at home. Anna had left him a note by the door saying that she had taken the children to the city’s main bomb shelter, under a regional drama theater. Demkiv had an intuition that she had not made it there. He rushed around the neighborhood, desperately looking for his family. After an hour of searching, he found them outside her mother’s apartment building.“I was holding the hands of my children and struggling with our luggage when I saw him coming toward us,” Anna told me. “At that moment I knew that he would always find me and rescue us.” On that same day, a Russian air strike hit the drama theater, destroying the building and killing hundreds of those hiding in its basement. “I could be among the dead, if not for Ivan,” she said. Demkiv brought his family to another hospital, No. 3, because intense Russian shelling had already hit No. 555, where he had worked since 2015.[David Patrikarakos: Russia’s hunger war]The family sheltered there for several days. But then, in another incident that became notorious around the world, a Russian strike reportedly killed a pregnant woman and her baby at Hospital No. 3’s maternity ward. So the Demkivs had to evacuate again. This time, Demkiv arranged for a colleague to help Anna and their children get out of Mariupol altogether and take refuge in western Ukraine. That was the last time the couple were together.Later in March, Hospital No. 3 was overrun by Russian forces. Demkiv and his team of doctors evacuated, this time to the Ilyich Iron and Steel Works, one of the last strongholds of Ukrainian resistance in besieged Mariupol. There, Demkiv and his colleagues continued to treat and operate on wounded Ukrainian civilians and soldiers until the Russian military seized the plant in the middle of April. The group of 78 medics was transported to Olenivka Correction Colony No. 120, in the eastern Donetsk region.The dilapidated former Soviet prison complex is poorly equipped for its new purpose as a Russian-operated POW camp: It has no running water, and inmates complain of the insanitary conditions. The prison’s name became infamous worldwide when, on the night of July 29, an explosion ripped through one of its barracks, leaving 53 prisoners dead and another 75 wounded. Russia blamed the explosion on a Ukrainian rocket attack; Ukraine has claimed that the building was mined by Russian operatives.What is undisputed is that the dead and wounded included members of the Azov Regiment, which had formed the core of the Ukrainian military’s defense of Mariupol and the last holdout before the Azovstal steel plant surrendered in May. Because of the regiment’s origins as a hard-line nationalist militia involved in the 2014 conflict with Russian-backed separatists, Moscow has made the regiment central to its propaganda about “de-Nazifying” Ukraine. Ukrainian officials fear that the Azov prisoners might have been targeted for torture and elimination, and they have called for the International Criminal Court to open a war-crimes investigation. (A U.S. official has warned that Russia may be trying to falsify evidence at the prison in an effort to lay the blame on Ukrainian forces.)According to Rachel Denber, a deputy director at Human Rights Watch, Russia has an obligation under the Geneva Conventions to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross in to inspect the scene of the explosion. “Russia should immediately give access to investigate deaths of Ukrainian POWs to international authorities, including the ICRC and the UN,” Denber told me. “Any abuse or killing of POWs is a grave breach of laws of war, and a war crime.” On a visit to Ukraine last week, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres announced that his agency was establishing a fact-finding mission to investigate the massacre.Anna begins every morning reading whatever news she can find about Olenivka. On the day of the explosion, she was one of the first among the relatives’ Facebook group to find out about it. She initially thought that the news might be a Russian fabrication, but as more reports came in confirming the massacre, she was gripped by fear: “I burst into tears.” Eventually, the group’s members realized that the explosion had not directly affected their people, the hospital staff held as prisoners. But the horror only underlined the relatives’ sense of powerlessness and despair. “I wonder if anybody in the world can stop this outrageous nightmare,” Anna told me.[Read: In Ukraine, youth has ended]I spoke with a former recent inmate of Olenivka, Konstantin Velichko, who was a volunteer driver for a humanitarian mission to evacuate civilians from Mariupol when the Russian military captured him at the end of March. He spent nearly 100 days in the prison before his release on July 4. He calls the experience “one constant nightmare.” He is convinced that his former captors were responsible for the explosion. “Those thugs were capable of simply destroying people’s lives,” Velichko told me. “They are totally nuts.”Velichko said that he and several fellow volunteer drivers were housed in one of half a dozen insanitary, crowded barracks, which contained about 300 inmates in total. Most inmates were captured soldiers, but they also included dozens of civilians and noncombatants like Velichko. The worst section of jail, he told me, was a wing known as the Isolator, where prison guards often beat prisoners.“We were 50 people in a cell for six inmates—dirt, walls covered in fungus, horrific stink, no windows,” he said. “There were at least 100 women kept in the Isolator—15 to 20 of them in one cell, where they’d have to take turns to sleep.”DemkiV remains incarcerated at Olenivka, along with his colleagues Vladmir Shpakov, a young surgeon; Yurik Mktrchyan, an anesthesiologist; and 25 other medical staff from Hospital No. 555 (the whereabouts of the 50 other medics originally captured with them is unknown; they may have been moved to different prisons). Anna saw a video posted by a Russian Telegram channel, Readovka, that showed her husband putting bandages on another inmate’s wounds. Shpakov’s wife, Olga, herself a doctor, told me that she had frantically scanned every video she could find on Russian Telegram channels that had covered the explosion, fearing that her husband might have been among the victims.The relatives are anxious for international agencies such as the ICRC to identify all of the hospital staff being held at Olenivka and to get confirmation from the Russian authorities of their POW status as noncombatants. They also want a channel of regular communication opened up between the prisoners and their families—though sporadic contact has occurred, through both semiofficial and clandestine means. Their ultimate hope is for a prisoner swap.Olga has had two phone calls from her husband, both less than a minute long. The first was on June 8, two months after their capture in Mariupol. “His voice sounded sad,” she said. “He called me by his usual name for me, Zaichonok [little bunny], asked about our baby boy.” Then he explained that a Russian TV channel was filming him as they spoke. “They clearly wanted to demonstrate how fair they were,” she said, “letting a prisoner call his wife, ask about his baby’s health.” Even so, she was grateful for any sign that he was alive and well.The second call came on June 20, from a Russian number; their conversation was very short and controlled. “How about the prisoner swap?” he asked her. A few days later, Ukraine did announce a prisoner exchange, securing the release of 144 Olenivka inmates, all of them wounded or disabled. No doctors were among them. Olga keeps her phone close, always in hopes of another call from her husband, perhaps with news of his freedom.[Veronika Melkozerova: The hate I feel]Anna, too, has received some word of what her husband is enduring. “In the last four months of his imprisonment, I’ve learned that my husband eats rotten porridge from dirty plates,” she told me. “He suffers from headaches but there are no painkillers, no surgical tools, no medicine in that colony, so his professionalism is completely wasted.“He does not deserve to be held in that concentration camp,” she went on. “He is just a surgeon who treated all patients, and his guards know that … My life is empty without him, but I hope he feels how much I love him.”Karina Mktrchyan, the sister of the anesthesiologist, has spoken a few times to her brother, in brief, hurried conversations in which he uses “coded language” in case the calls are intercepted. “We don’t even have the tennis rackets; do you understand what I mean?” he said to her on one occasion. She guessed that he meant the medics had no proper equipment or drugs with which to treat the wounded prisoners.In Olenivka prison, the days begin at 6 a.m., when prisoners are awakened by guards playing loud, pro-Russian audio messages. “That propaganda was made specially for that colony,” Velichko told me. “It called for us to surrender. It said, ‘We guarantee you will live and Ukrainian authorities have forgotten about you.’”In fact, Velichko is convinced that his life and others’ lives were saved precisely because of constant press coverage and public outrage about their plight. “The Russians were close to convicting us all for 10 years,” he said, “so we begged journalists, our loved ones, and friends to trumpet to the world about our captivity in that concentration camp.” For now, that is all the families of the medics in Olenivka can do.",

        "title": "Actually, Canceling Student Debt Will Cut Inflation",
        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/biden-student-debt-cancelation-stiglitz/671228/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "We want to fight inflation and we want to keep the labor market strong. One of the most important ways to achieve both goals is to forgive a portion of student-loan debt. And yesterday, President Joe Biden announced that he was doing just that—canceling up to $10,000 in student debt for those making less than $125,000 and designating an additional $10,000 in loan forgiveness for Pell Grant recipients. Yet critics are attacking the measure, even at its modest level and with its targeted exclusions and benefits, as inflationary and unfair.Whatever your view of student-debt cancellation, the inflation argument is a red herring and should not influence policy. Taking that logic to the extreme, canceling food stamps would do far more to reduce inflation—but that would be cruel and inhumane, and fortunately, no one has suggested doing so. A closer look at the student-debt-cancellation program suggests that the new student-loan policy may even reduce inflation; at most, its inflationary impact will be minuscule, and the long-term benefits to the economy are likely to be significant.The contention that debt cancellation will be inflationary contains a series of flaws. To start with, the value of the reduced debt repayments is so small that the cancellation’s impact will be negligible.Although the broad estimates of the total amount of canceled debt can be big—some reach hundreds of billions of dollars—these figures derive only from budgeting practices for how credit programs like student loans are recorded. The government and budget analysts calculate a number that is known as “the present discounted value of foregone payments.” This corresponds to a current estimated value not of the lost payments this year, but of those in all future years. In other words, this calculation treats all of the losses from debt cancellation as though they occurred right now in a single year (adjusted for inflation)—a far cry from the reality. Such an accounting procedure can be an appropriate practice for thinking about the government’s long-run balance sheet, but it is a very poor guide for understanding what actually happens to people’s spending.[Jerusalem Demsas: Who really benefits from student-loan forgiveness?]The inflation hawks compound this error by assuming that the indebted students will take their forgiven debt and go on a spending spree, a splurge of such magnitude that they would have to somehow find someone in the private sector willing to lend them the same amount at low interest rates to finance their extravagance. Economic theory says that these individuals will, at most, consider this an increase in their net wealth—I say “at most” because in many cases, these loans would never have been repaid at all. And economic theory also says that an increase in wealth is spent gradually over the course of a person’s life, not all in one year.The actual amount of annual debt payments that would be reduced now, during this present inflationary episode, will probably run to tens of billions of dollars, not hundreds of billions. The lower number is likely because, again, many of those whose debt is being forgiven would not be making the payments anyway; many people with these debts simply don’t have the economic means to repay them.The costs of cancellation are also far less than the value to be realized when student-debt payments resume after having been halted during the pandemic. Right now, because of the forbearance put into place in 2020, no payments are being made on government-owned student loans. This policy was essential to stabilize the economy during the pandemic. As part of a larger program of cancellation, the Biden administration would end forbearance; the resumption of payments in January is estimated to be worth more than $30 billion annually.These numbers are modest relative to the size of our economy. Still, their net effect will be to reduce inflation.Some of the critics demand that payments should simply resume without any cancellation. That would plunge a large number of student debtors back into immediate financial distress and further loan delinquency. According to analysis from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, just before the pandemic, 11 percent of student debt was either in default or more than 90 days in arrears. Because of pandemic forbearance and other emergency measures, that default rate went to zero for most student debt—though researchers found that student loans excluded from forbearance continued to default, not surprisingly, at a high rate. According to the New York Fed’s survey, once payments resume, we will quickly return to that world: A large segment of people will be unable to service their payments and, in the Fed’s words, “lower-income, less educated, non-white, female and middle-aged borrowers will struggle more in making minimum payments and in remaining current.”[Ben Sasse: How to really fix higher ed]This level of distress is bad for the economy, both in the short run, as we strive for a robust recovery, and in the long run. Having little or no access to credit means that starting a family or a small business, moving, or otherwise building up lives is much harder for so many young people. A growing body of evidence backs up the common-sense conclusion that student-loan debt is linked to people delaying significant life events such as getting married and having children.This has society-wide consequences. People’s well-being is obviously affected, and so is the economy. The Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia found that student debt is associated with weak new-business formation, in particular of new businesses with one to four employees. Given that the rapid increase in the number of small businesses—especially ones founded by Black and brown entrepreneurs—that we saw in 2021 may already be slowing down, we should be looking for ways to support that growth, not undercut it.Studies of those student debtors who have had the good fortune to get their debt canceled by courts have found that the freedom from loan payments allows people to borrow anew and move around the country to take better jobs. Because continuing to build up our labor force and help people find jobs better matched to their skills is so important, a comprehensive student-loan debt-cancellation program will have a valuable economic upside.Until recently, the U.S. led the world with high-quality and widely accessible college education. American prosperity and freedom have been tied to innovations such as the land-grant university, the GI Bill, and our world-class public universities. But because that education now comes at an ever-increasing price accompanied by an ever-increasing student debt for so many, our students fall behind before they even start their first jobs. The entire system of supporting and financing higher education needs an overhaul, but in the interim, we need to understand and address the immediate problem—and the Biden administration yesterday took a crucial first step by reducing the debt burden on many struggling American families.",

        "title": "The Trait That ‘Super Friends’ Have in Common",
        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/family/archive/2022/08/making-keeping-friends-attachment-theory-styles/671222/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "This article was featured in One Story to Read Today, a newsletter in which our editors recommend a single must-read from The Atlantic, Monday through Friday. Sign up for it here.For many of us, making friends as an adult is intimidating, and sometimes embarrassing or a bit baffling. But we all know those people who appear to be naturals: They balance bustling social calendars, glide easily into conversations with strangers, and seem to get invited to everybody’s wedding. Research shows that these super friends, as I like to call them, really exist: Not only are they better at initiating new friendships, but they also view their friendships as closer and more enduring.\r\nThis article was adapted from Marisa Franco’s book, Platonic: How the Science of Attachment Can Help You Make—And Keep—Friends (Penguin)\r\nSuper friends tend to have one quality in common—one that allows them to flourish outside of their relationships too. Studies find that people with this trait have better mental health; they’re more satisfied at work, more open to new ideas, and less prejudicial. Research suggests that they feel less regret; that during typically stressful events, like math tests or public-speaking engagements, they keep calm; and that they are less likely to have physical ailments such as heart attacks, headaches, ulcers, and inflammation.So what is the distinguishing quality of super friends? It’s secure attachment.Attachment is the “gut feeling” we project onto ambiguity in our interactions. It’s driven not by a cool assessment of events but by the collapsing of time, the superimposition of the past onto the present. Understanding our attachment style is invaluable, not so we can mentally flog ourselves for biased interpretations but so we can gain more control over our social worlds. When we recognize how we contribute to our own relationship problems, we can try to change course—toward greater security and stronger friendships.According to attachment theory, there are three major attachment styles: secure, anxious, and avoidant. (A fourth—disorganized attachment—is a mix of anxious and avoidant, but it’s under-researched in adults.) Secure people assume that they are worthy of love, and that others can be trusted to give it to them. People who are anxiously attached assume that others will abandon them—so they cling, or try too hard to accommodate others, or plunge into intimacy too rapidly. Avoidantly attached people are similarly afraid of abandonment; instead of clinging, though, they keep others at a distance. Attachment is a spectrum, and it can change over time; it’s common, for instance, to exhibit more insecure attachment when stressed. But we each have a primary attachment style we demonstrate most often.We develop our attachment styles based in part on our early relationships with our caregivers. If our caregivers were warm and validating, we become secure. If they were unresponsive or overprotective, then we develop insecure attachment, wherein we believe that others are bound to desert or harm us. To protect against the mistreatment we expect, we act anxiously or avoidantly (or both). But attachment isn’t all our parents’ fault. Although early experiences with caregivers establish expectations about how we’ll be treated, these expectations likely evolve in other relationships. And they shape those relationships in turn.[Read: The six forces that fuel friendship]The psychologist Fred H. Goldner coined the term pronoia to describe the optimistic counterpart to paranoia. People with pronoia possess the delusion that, despite any evidence to the contrary, others want the best for them. But presuming goodwill isn’t always uncalled for. Unless there’s contradictory evidence, secure people tend to assume that others are trustworthy.It’s tempting to think that secure people are setting themselves up for disappointment. But assuming the best sets people up to receive the best. In one study that demonstrates this, students played either an “investor” or a “trustee.” The investors were given money and told they could keep it with a trustee, who could then choose how much to grant them back. In one scenario, investors were told to threaten a financial penalty if the trustee didn’t return the investment; in another, they didn’t mention a penalty at all. In yet another, the trustee was told that the investor had declined to exact a penalty, regardless of the amount returned. The trustees provided the highest returns to the investors who could have fined them but did not, and the lowest returns to those who threatened a fine. “If you trust people, you make them more trustworthy,” Ernst Fehr, a University of Zurich professor who co-authored the study, told Nature.And when untrustworthy people weasel through the cracks and cause harm, secure people are less affected than the insecure. Research shows that security is a strong predictor of resilience and stress regulation. One study found that when people were primed with security, their heart-rate variability—changes in the time between heartbeats, which can be triggered by stress—didn’t fluctuate as significantly when they were socially excluded.Accompanied by this resilience and good faith, secure people are freed up to take risks in relationships. They’re more likely to initiate new friendships, as well as productively address conflict and share intimate things about themselves. People who tend toward anxious attachment, however, have a harder time trusting that those risks won’t end in hurt. In fact, they’re physically more sensitive to snubs: One study found that when rejection was simulated in the laboratory, the more anxiously attached someone was, the more the regions of their brain associated with distress lit up.[Read: A toast to all the rejects]If you feel this imperiled and alone, you won’t always behave generously. For my book, Platonic: How the Science of Attachment Can Help You Make—And Keep—Friends, I talked with someone who reminded me of this. (She requested not to be identified, to keep her personal history private.) When she was leaving her job at a tech company to travel internationally, she told me, a colleague sent her a kind farewell email. She responded with brevity, saying that it had been nice to work with him. She was surprised when he then sent her a series of angry texts, saying that her response was cold and impersonal.Her message had been short because she was in the middle of closing out her old job, archiving files, and delegating tasks to other employees, as well as preparing to move out of the country. The shortness of her response, she explained, had nothing to do with her colleague. Even worse, she’d read his reply on the same day she had felt a lump in her breast, and was worried it could be cancer. “Without knowing it,” she told me, “he spent a bunch of time kicking me while I was very down.”    When we don’t have full information, we have to infer why people are behaving a certain way. The stories we tell ourselves can be linked to our attachment styles—and they may not line up with the truth. Some people might jump to conclusions because they’re prone to what’s called vulnerable narcissism, which is associated with anxious attachment. Vulnerable narcissists reveal the self-centeredness of pain; they prioritize their own needs and dismiss those of others, because they assume (often incorrectly) that they’re the ones being slighted.Anxiously attached people commonly misfire like this. In one study, anxious subjects were quicker at recognizing jumbled letters as representing words that conveyed rejection, such as abandoned, or ridiculed, even if these jumbled words were preceded by a tone they’d been conditioned to associate with approval. Anxious people are so vigilant for dismissal that they register cues of it while ignoring signals of their acceptance.People with avoidant attachment, too, end up pushing others away for fear of rejection. Research finds that avoidantly and anxiously attached people are more likely to end friendships. And because romantic breakups can surface powerful emotions as well, avoidants, according to research, tend to prefer to eject using indirect routes, such as ghosting. Studies find that even though avoidants appear cool and collected during times of strife, their nervous systems are frenzied and their blood pressure is spiking—and they’re more likely to have poorer immune functioning, severe headaches, and chronic pain.Insecure attachment is a way for people to protect themselves from the hazards of connection, but it’s a system gone haywire. When people cling to protect themselves, it ultimately harms them. And when they reject or keep others at a distance to protect themselves, that also harms them. At some point, all the self-protection becomes self-harm. But they can fight against these impulses.[Read: The case for dating a friend]Most of us aren’t just insecure or secure; we’re insecure at times and secure in others. By bending toward security even if total security eludes us, we can grow—and that might mean becoming a better friend.One study found that when insecure people were primed with security—through writing about someone who was loving and supportive toward them—they then reported being better at taking initiative in friendship. “How bold one gets when one is sure of being loved,” Sigmund Freud once said.But why? Research into romantic couples suggests that the more positively we feel about ourselves, the more likely we are to assume that others like us. How people thought their romantic partner viewed them, the study found, was less a reflection of their partner’s perspective and more a reflection of how they viewed themselves. In platonic relationships, too, how we think others view us isn’t necessarily fact.When secure people assume that others like them, this is a self-fulfilling prophecy termed “the acceptance prophecy.” Danu Anthony Stinson, a psychology professor at the University of Victoria in Canada, hypothesized with her colleagues that “if people expect acceptance, they will behave warmly, which in turn will lead other people to accept them; if they expect rejection, they will behave coldly, which will lead to less acceptance.” To test this hypothesis, she told people they would join an ongoing focus group, asked them to report on how much they thought the group members would like them, and then instructed them to record a video to introduce themselves to the group. Observers then rated how likable the participant was in the video.The participants who assumed they’d be liked were, in fact, seen as more likable. This study built on a similar study conducted in the 1980s, which found that volunteers who were led to believe that an interaction partner liked them shared more about themselves, disagreed less, and had a more positive attitude—ultimately making the premonition come true.Overall, this research reveals one of the most important secrets to taking initiative in friendship: Assume that people like you. Tempted to ask a gym friend if they want to become a happy-hour friend? Assume they do. Want to reconnect with a friend you’ve fallen out of touch with? Assume they’re in. When we make this assumption, initiative feels less scary. We’re more likely to take some leaps of faith—and eventually navigate the friendship-making process, and life, with more peace, pleasure, and security.",

        "description": "“How to Build a Life” is a weekly column by Arthur Brooks, tackling questions of meaning and happiness. Click here to listen to his podcast series on all things happiness, How to Build a Happy Life.Lately, my back has been hurting. I did something weird in the gym, resulting in a dull ache, and now I’m taking it easy. I appreciate the feedback the pain provides, because I would like to be able to walk upright for a few more decades and don’t want to risk a more permanent injury. Still, I don’t enjoy it, so I’ve been taking acetaminophen to blunt my discomfort.Back pain is normal, but a different sort of hurt is even more typical in my life, and probably yours as well: mental suffering. I don’t mean clinical depression or anxiety, which require professional intervention, but rather the routine, chronic grind of conflict, dissatisfaction, and sadness, which often constitute a dull ache in the background of our days. Many philosophers have considered this discomfort to be our natural state. In his Pensées, Blaise Pascal asserted that, at rest, man “feels his nothingness, his loneliness, his insufficiency, his dependence, his weakness, his emptiness.” Maybe that seems a little overstated to you, but research does show that people tend to experience negative or mixed emotions nearly half the time.Wouldn’t it be nice to have a handy tool to blunt everyday mental pain a bit? Not to become numb to life—just to take the edge off, especially when it is interfering with normal life, the way you can swallow a Tylenol when your back hurts. It turns out that there are safe and healthy methods to do exactly this, including taking the same sort of painkiller for what ails your body and your mind. And that’s only the beginning.Want to stay current with Arthur’s writing? Sign up to get an email every time a new column comes out.The ancient-Greek writer Antiphanes believed that “all pain is one malady with many names.” He was right, neurologically speaking. Physical pain activates several parts of the brain, notably the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC. Neuroscientists have found that our thrifty brains piggyback the experience of emotional pain in the same location. In one example, from 2003, researchers at UCLA and Macquarie University in Sydney conducted an experiment in which participants’ brains were scanned while they played a virtual ball-tossing game. At one point, they were excluded from the game in a way that mimicked social exclusion. Sure enough, their ACCs became active, much as they would if the participants had been experiencing physical pain.Physical pain has two basic parts: the sensory component (the physical sensation) and the affective component (the perception of unpleasantness). Mental pain shares this second component, leading researchers to some interesting findings. For example, in 2005 researchers reported the case of a patient with a congenital physical pain insensitivity who experienced an intense headache for the first time in her life only after the unexpected death of her younger brother.If we experience emotional and physical pain at least partially in the same area of the brain, it’s no wonder that the same substances can blunt them. For example, just as opioids such as morphine and heroin can relieve severe physical pain, they can also mute the distress people feel from social separation. This is likely why people often report that heroin feels like love and why loneliness can lead to higher levels of opioid abuse, especially among women. Similarly, the psychologist C. Nathan DeWall and his colleagues have shown that a daily acetaminophen dose can lower self-reported hurt feelings compared with a placebo by lowering activity in the ACC. (And unlike opioids, this analgesic is not addictive, nor dangerous in ordinary doses.)[Read: Mindfulness hurts. That’s why it works.]That’s not to say that maximum blunting is the right solution. Like physical pain, mental pain serves a purpose: It helps us avoid things like social exclusion. DeWall and his colleagues have argued that the fear and bitterness we feel when we’re excluded are remnants of an earlier time in human history when being a social outcast could mean not having the protection of a community, making survival hard or impossible. Now it can be maladapted, making FOMO feel like a toothache. You can know intellectually that being criticized for your opinions is not like being thrown out of your community and being forced to live in the woods alone. But your ACC doesn’t know the difference, giving you a lot of suffering for something you know intellectually is pretty inconsequential.Whether it’s a useful warning sign or a pure inconvenience, mental pain can get in the way of our lives. The trick is to safely make it manageable, without erasing it completely, like over-the-counter painkillers do for daily aches. Here’s how.1. Feel your mental pain physically.A lot of mental suffering has bodily manifestations. When I am anxious or stressed, for example, I tend to hold my abdominal muscles tight; other people breathe shallowly or clench their fists.Noticing such physical signs can help you actively manage the feelings causing them. Try to pay attention to when your body tenses up—it is a cue that you have stress to deal with. Purposively relax your shoulders and chest and take deep breaths, and you’ll likely find some instantaneous relief. People who get good at recognizing physical symptoms of emotional issues and taking them on in these simple ways have been found to have superior emotional regulation.[Read: To get out of your head, get out of your house]2. Get spiritual.A substantial body of evidence suggests that religious and spiritual activity helps alleviate pain. A great number of people experiencing chronic physical pain turn to religious and spiritual practices for coping and relief. Meanwhile, participating in traditional religion can raise the subjective well-being of people suffering from mental pain, such as bereavement. Simple prayer can alleviate stress, as can mindfulness meditation. And no surprise at this point: When researchers look at the brain regions involved in meditation, they find reductions in pain-related activity in the ACC.The next time you notice a dull ache in your soul, try offering it up in prayer or meditation. Catholics, for example, will mentally join their suffering to that of Christ. Buddhists will use sadness in meditation to understand with compassion the suffering of others. Find your own way, in your own tradition.3. Don’t suffer by yourself.Connection to other people is highly protective against all kinds of pain. Experiments have shown that social support alleviates physical pain symptoms; the evidence for emotional pain is even more abundant. In a 2007 study in the journal NeuroImage, researchers tracked people for a 10-day period and assessed their hormonal responses to social stressors. They found that people with more social support had milder responses to the hormone cortisol in the face of stress. Not surprisingly, they also had lower activity in the ACC.Having family or friends around you—as long as the relationships are healthy—is protective when it comes to the mental pains of life. Cultivating those bonds is like taking a daily vitamin: When you are especially vulnerable, the defenses you’ve built up will offer relief. And you can always “up the dose” by reaching out to these people for support when your suffering is acute.[Read: The type of love that makes people happiest]4. Take a pill.If all else fails, or you simply need easier relief to make it through a tough day, you always have acetaminophen. I wouldn’t recommend this as your first or only line of self-care, because it doesn’t address the root of your issues, just some symptoms. But in a pinch, it can help.In one way, mental suffering is entirely unlike its physical counterpart: You can soothe your own pain by soothing that of others. Follow the example of President Abraham Lincoln, who lost one of his dearest friends, William McCullough, in a Civil War battle in Mississippi. In his grief, he reached out to McCullough’s daughter Fanny, who was inconsolable.In a letter dated December 23, 1862, he wrote, “It is with deep grief that I learn of the death of your kind and brave Father; and, especially, that it is affecting your young heart beyond what is common.” He went on to promise her, based on his own life experience, “You are sure to be happy again … The memory of your dear Father, instead of an agony, will yet be a sad sweet feeling in your heart, of a purer and holier sort than you have known before.”[Read: How to make the baggage of your past easier to carry]The letter was no doubt helpful to Fanny; I strongly suspect that it was also therapy for Lincoln. Studies have consistently shown that helping others in distress leads to better emotional regulation and lowers symptoms of depression. But you probably don’t need a study to remind you that giving love may in fact be the best strategy to reduce pain in this difficult life.",

        "description": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.Although today’s big news from the White House is about student-loan forgiveness, we should note that it is Ukrainian Independence Day, which usually passes unnoticed outside of Ukraine. Today also marks six months into Russia’s attempt to extinguish Ukraine and its democratic government, so it is a day that should have special meaning for everyone who lives in a democracy.But first, here are three new stories from The Atlantic.\r\n\tA prominent vaccine skeptic returns to Twitter.\r\n\tGavin Newsom, the Ron DeSantis of the left\r\n\tA risky monkeypox vaccine is looking better all the time.\r\nAn Unforced ErrorPresident Joe Biden has finally announced his program for alleviating the burden of student debt. Biden and his party have been on a winning streak for most of the summer: With a 50–50 Senate, they have managed to notch a string of legislative wins while gas prices have plunged, inflation has cooled, unemployment has remained low, and a dreaded summer COVID-19 meltdown has failed to materialize. And how will the Democrats spend this political capital? By celebrating a niche policy that will hand the Republicans a free issue in America’s ongoing culture and class wars, just as Biden and the Democrats head into the 2022 and 2024 elections.It could have been worse. Some Democrats were pressing the president to write off $50,000 of debt, an idea that I said more than a year ago would have been a political disaster. The current plan, by comparison, is merely bad and politically obtuse.The argument for loan forgiveness is not only that it is the right thing to do—I’ll come back to this—but that young, college-educated people are an important pillar of the Democratic Party’s base. It sounds moral and caring, at least within the bubble of a highly educated party, to advocate for relieving some of the cost of higher education. After all, everyone has to go to college, right? It’s practically a life requirement now. And kids don’t know what they’re signing up for when they take on boatloads of student debt—they’re only teenagers!The truth, however, is that most people don’t go to college, and the majority of those who do go manage to get out without life-destroying debt. Fewer than four in ten Americans over 25 have a four-year college degree. Only 13 percent have federal student debt, and the average undergraduate leaves college with an obligation about the size of a moderate car loan. (Graduate school is where the numbers really climb.)Worse, this policy is aimed at the young and college-educated, a group that is, in the main, composed of reliable Democratic Party voters—and who should by now be plenty motivated by the ongoing threat to democracy from the Republican Party. The legendary American general George S. Patton, describing his disdain for retreating and then having to retake the same ground, reportedly said that he hated to pay for the same real estate twice. But that’s what Democrats are doing: They are trying to buy a constituency that ought to be firmly in their camp. The point of a “base” is that it will vote for its own party come hell or high water. A “base” that needs to be enticed with a $10,000 bonus isn’t, by definition, a base.Instead, the whole business seems like class-based special pleading for a very specific and small group residing mostly within the Democratic Party. The right-wing narratives and Republican attack ads easily write themselves—and they will carry some sting with independent voters in swing states, many of whom are workers in blue- or gray-collar jobs, or in service, clerical, and other nonprofessional occupations. “Did you go to college? No? Tough luck. Your debts don’t qualify for forgiveness. Medical bills? Business failures? Too bad. Joe Biden is giving 10 grand to a select group of people as a thank-you, and you’re not one of them.”Yes, such ads will stink to the skies of rank hypocrisy. Republicans are happy to take bailouts when it suits them. And it will be unfair in the extreme to go after the Democrats for servicing an interest group in their party when the GOP is, in my view, nothing but a giant, cronyist pandering machine that hands red meat to its culture warriors and tax cuts and other breaks to its own special interests. But political messaging isn’t about fairness; it’s about messages that work, and this one is likely to land a punch that could cost the Democrats otherwise winnable votes. With democracy hanging in the balance, taking such risks for the transitory sugar high of a onetime hand-wave is irresponsible.I have said nothing so far about whether loan forgiveness is a good idea. It isn’t. Even if the Democrats controlled legislative supermajorities, I would still argue that one more bailout won’t solve very much (and might even contribute to reigniting inflation, according to Larry Summers and other economists). As my Atlantic colleague Jerusalem Demsas recently pointed out, some of the main arguments about who would benefit, and by how much, don’t hold up very well. “The issue’s prominence in our discourse,” Demsas writes, “has less to do with its merits than the changing political landscape that has stymied legislative efforts and given college graduates agenda-setting power.” The progressive political analyst David Shor has made the same point—and warned that the dominance of a college-educated elite in the Democratic Party could undermine effective messaging from the Democrats to the rest of America.My complaint here might seem pointless, since Biden’s decision is now done and dusted. And I think Biden’s doing a solid job—more than he gets credit for—as president. But I see this debt policy as an unforced error, and I hope that the Democrats do not make this a talking point in an election year. Republicans would be much happier debating college-debt forgiveness to households earning a quarter-million dollars a year instead of talking about how the GOP is a menace to American democracy.Related:\r\n\tBiden’s cancellation of billions in debt won’t solve the larger problem. \r\n\tHow the Democrats got radicalized on student debt\r\nToday’s News\r\n\tA Russian missile strike killed at least 22 people at a train station in central Ukraine. It was one of the deadliest strikes on Ukraine’s railways since another attack in April killed more than 50 people.\r\n\tThe Biden administration plans to offer updated COVID booster shots soon after Labor Day.\r\n\tRepresentative Charlie Crist defeated Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried in Florida’s Democratic gubernatorial primary, but polls show that he’s very unlikely to defeat Governor Ron DeSantis in November.\r\nDispatches\r\n\tThe Weekly Planet: The new EPA just quietly got stronger, Robinson Meyer reports.\r\n\tUp for Debate: Conor Friedersdorf explores the link between War on Drugs logic and overdose deaths.\r\n\tWork in Progress: There is no national teacher shortage, Derek Thompson argues.\r\nEvening Read\r\n(NASA / CXO / Fabian et al / Gendron-Marsolais et al / NRAO / AUI / NSF / SDSS)\r\nThe Spookiest Sound in AstronomyBy Marina Koren\r\nAh, the sounds of late summer.

Murina, perhaps the tautest and most gripping thriller you can see in theaters this year.Play our daily crossword.P.S.I am fully aware of the cost of college because I have a daughter attending school right now. But let me leave aside the arguments over student loans for a moment and reach out to those of you whose children, like mine, are leaving home for school—some for the first time, and some for their subsequent years of education. I don’t know about other parents, but for me, letting go after having my kid around all summer was, in some ways, harder than the freshman move-in.I am far too stoic and manly to admit to any tears here, but I have some recommendations for songs about children growing up that you should never play on a day like today. One of them, of course, is “The Riddle,” by Five for Fighting, in which a father and his child, pondering all of life’s big questions, realize that the “reason for the world” is “you and I.” Also, if you have a daughter, you might cross off “All-American Girl,” by Carrie Underwood. “That sweet little / Beautiful, wonderful, perfect all-American girl”—nope, not doing that one today. And under no circumstances should you let “The Circle Game” by Joni Mitchell cross your playlist on a day like this. This is not the time to think about how the “painted ponies go up and down” and why we’re “captive on the carousel of time.”Now if you’ll excuse me, it’s getting dusty in here again.–TomIsabel Fattal contributed to this newsletter.",

Sign up for the newsletter here.Question of the WeekObservers disagree about law enforcement’s case against Donald Trump, the former president whose Florida mansion was recently searched by federal officials in pursuit of classified documents. None of us knows whether Trump will face charges––or the merits of those charges if he does. Amid that uncertainty, some pundits warn that prosecuting any former president sets a bad precedent, especially when one of his political rivals is in the White House. Others counter that no one is above the law and anything other than following the facts is fraught. Noting that those perspectives are neither mutually exclusive nor exhaustive, what do you think?Send responses to conor@theatlantic.com.Conversations of NoteThis week the War on Drugs is top of mind for me because of an article I happened upon that features a quintessential example of what I’ve regarded for years as “War on Drugs logic.” That’s when you point to the catastrophic consequences of drug use that took place under prohibition in order to justify continuing those same prohibitionist policies. The article was in The Washington Post, headlined “Colombia, Largest Cocaine Supplier to U.S., Considers Decriminalizing.” It carries a Bogotá dateline, notes that Colombia is “the source of more than 90 percent of the drug seized in the United States,” and proceeds to report:  \r\nTwo weeks after taking office, the country’s first leftist government is proposing an end to “prohibition” and the start of a government-regulated cocaine market. Through legislation and alliances with other leftist governments in the region, officials in this South American nation hope to turn their country into a laboratory for drug decriminalization.\r\n\r\n“It is time for a new international convention that accepts that the war on drugs has failed,” President Gustavo Petro said in his inaugural address this month.\r\n\r\nIt’s a radical turn in this historically conservative country, one that could upend its long-standing — and lucrative — counternarcotics relationship with the United States. U.S. officials past and present are signaling concern; the drug was responsible for an estimated 25,000 overdose deaths in the United States last year. “The United States and the Biden administration is not a supporter of decriminalization,” said Jonathan Finer, the White House deputy national security adviser, who met with Petro here before his inauguration.\r\nAbout those 25,000 cocaine-overdose deaths––they didn’t just happen under the current policy of drug prohibition; they are a direct result of drug prohibition. Don’t take my word for it. See this press release from the Drug Enforcement Administration (emphasis added):\r\nFentanyl-related mass-overdose events, characterized as three or more overdoses occurring close in time and at the same location, have happened in at least seven American cities in recent months, resulting in 58 overdoses and 29 deaths …\r\n\r\nTragic events like these are being driven by fentanyl. Fentanyl is highly-addictive, found in all 50 states, and drug traffickers are increasingly mixing it with other illicit drugs—in powder and pill form—in an effort to drive addiction and attract repeat buyers. These mass-overdose events typically occur in one of the following recurring scenarios: when drug dealers sell their product as “cocaine,” when it actually contains fentanyl; or when drug dealers sell pills designed to appear nearly identical to legitimate prescriptions, but are actually fake prescription pills containing fentanyl. This is creating a frightening nationwide trend where many overdose victims are dying after unknowingly ingesting fentanyl.\r\n\r\nFentanyl is driving the nationwide overdose epidemic. The CDC estimates that in the 12-month period ending in October 2021, more than 105,000 Americans died of drug overdoses, with 66 percent of those deaths related to synthetic opioids like fentanyl.\r\nLocal health departments tell the same story. Here’s one from Illinois. Here’s another from Erie County, New York. And a third from Shasta County, California. Authorities across the nation basically agree that many people who want to buy pure cocaine are getting a fentanyl-laced product instead and dying in large numbers as a result, all under the current regime. Still, the Biden administration cites the overdose-death toll in the United States last year as if it is an argument for continuing the prohibitionist status quo rather than changing it.The Post article doesn’t mention fentanyl, but it does detail the fact that under the War on Drugs approach, “the Colombian trade has reached record levels,” tripling in the last decade, and that the U.S. is aware of the bloodshed in Colombia that prohibition guarantees. Put more simply, the status quo has immiserated a foreign country for decades, enriching its most sociopathic residents, while coinciding with record cocaine exports to the U.S. and spiking overdose deaths because a black market means no safeguards against fentanyl. The bipartisan consensus that continues to stand in defense of this deadly status quo is a moral abomination.Fear Not FailureOn what would have been Kobe Bryant’s 44th birthday, the NBA great, who died in a 2020 helicopter crash, was remembered in an unusual tribute published by Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, perhaps the greatest basketball player of all time. Abdul-Jabbar notes that Bryant holds the record for the most missed shots in NBA history––then argues that the statistic is to Bryant’s great credit:\r\nSome people—not just athletes—are motivated in life by the fear of losing. They strive and hustle and push because they don’t want to fail. That fear of failure is often rooted in anxiety about how they will look to others. They see themselves only as they are reflected in others’ eyes.\r\n\r\nHowever, the great ones are driven not to win, but to exceed their own expectations. The goal is to strive to reach one’s fullest potential—and sometimes push beyond what even they imagined that potential might be. Winning is not the goal, it’s a happy by-product.\r\n\r\nKobe Bryant holds the record for most missed shots in NBA history. To some that’s a bad thing. To me, it means he wasn’t intimidated by missing, by losing, by failure. He didn’t hesitate by worrying, “What if I miss? What will the coaches think? The team? The fans?” He acted like the ultimate competitor: he took the shot. To take the shot is to embrace failure and success at the same time. To miss so much and yet feel confident enough to shoot again and again embodies the best qualities of human beings: to imagine something beyond what is, beyond what you’ve ever been able to do, and to strive to make that a reality, no matter how many times you fail. We love Kobe because he wasn’t afraid to take the shot.\r\nI’m reminded of Rudyard Kipling’s call to “meet with Triumph and Disaster / And treat those two impostors just the same.” That’s how Bryant and other once-in-a-generation athletes excel over time.Surrounded by IlliberalismJonathan Chait is a harsh critic of post-liberal progressivism. He believes it poses “a problem that has anathematized dissent at many elite universities, private schools, media and entertainment organizations, nonprofits, and other progressive spaces.” Still, he is convinced the right is worse. “If you have serious concerns about the spread of these illiberal norms and feel tempted to vote Republican as a corrective measure, you should ask yourself a question,” he writes in a recent New York column. “Does electing Republicans make this problem better or worse?”He focuses on Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, opining that “DeSantis has no principled objection to blacklisting, censorship, or propagandistic indoctrination. All he wants is for the whip to be in his own hand. Figures like Trump and DeSantis sell themselves as the masters of the cultural fight, striking fear into their quavering enemies.” In turn, the post-liberal part of the left, “for all its loathing of the right, also has a curious appreciation for it. Every time a reactionary poses as a champion of free speech on campus, the left erupts in smug mockery of the liberals who advocated those ideals in earnest.”Chait sympathizes with those caught in the middle, but is firm about the choice he believes they should make. “I understand perfectly well the frustrations of liberals and moderates who have watched progressives all around them lose their minds. The key thing to understand is that the illiberalism of the left is a subcultural phenomenon while the illiberalism of the right has state power within its grasp,” he writes. “There is no failure of liberal norms on the left that the Republican Party cannot make immeasurably more dire.” I have agreed in the last two elections.Is DeSantis the Successor to Trump?Kari Lake was a longtime TV-news anchor in Arizona. Now she is running for governor of the state. And last week, according to The Arizona Republic, she stood on stage at a political rally and praised DeSantis by suggesting to the crowd that beneath it all he is extraordinarily … well-endowed:\r\nThe guy has bigger ... Wait, let me think about how I want to word this. My staff always says, “Whatever you do, do not say balls.” So I'm not going to say it. That guy has a backbone made of steel. I’ll tell you what he’s got. I don’t know if you’d heard of this. He’s got “BDE.” Anybody know what that means? Ask your kids about it later. I call it “Big DeSantis Energy.” Right? He’s got the same kind of BDE that President Trump has. And, frankly, he’s got the same kind of BDE that we want all of our elected leaders to have.\r\nAt The Bulwark, Jonathan Last flags that moment to explain why he doesn’t believe DeSantis is the future of the Republican Party:\r\nOne of the fundamental appeals of Donald Trump was his unpredictability. You knew that when Trump took the stage, anything could happen. Depending on your view, this was either energizing or terrifying. DeSantis gives you none of that. He’s a disciplined pol. He’s never going to suggest that you ingest bleach or say that he’ll pay for your legal bills if you punch a protestor. Hell, he even outsources his Twitter triggering to his staff so that he’s not personally on the hook for the stuff he has them say on his behalf.\r\n\r\nThere’s a reason that Donald Trump did not need a Christina Pushaw, but Ron DeSantis does. All of which is to say that I suspect the real heir to Trumpism will be someone much crazier and less predictable.\r\n\r\nCan you imagine DeSantis riffing about “Big Dick Energy” in front of a crowd? Because I cannot. Kari Lake gives you a frisson of danger similar to Trump. She’s more authentically crazy than DeSantis. She’s a better speaker and is better on TV than DeSantis. If she wins the governorship in Arizona, I think she instantly becomes the leading candidate for Trump’s VP and the most obvious heir to the MAGA throne. And whatever happens to Lake, I suspect that Trumpism’s heir will be more like her and less like DeSantis.\r\nDamon Linker agrees:\r\nThe shit-talking side of Trumpism isn’t sufficient, but it is as necessary as the paleocon policy mix and the combativeness on cultural issues. And that might make Trumpism a uniquely American variant of right-wing populism. Pick your foreign alternative: Viktor Orbán in Hungary, Marine Le Pen in France, the AfD Party in Germany, Benjamin Netanyahu in Israel, the Law and Justice Party in Poland, Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, Narendra Modi in India—none of them lead Trump-style, insult-driven, shock-talk rallies before a live audience of thousands and a TV and digital audience of millions who delight in the boorish spectacle. (Though, come to think of it, there may be a bit of overlap in trashiness with Brazil’s Jair Bolsonaro and the Five-Star Movement in Italy.)\r\n\r\nA Trump rally (or one for Lake or Pennsylvania gubernatorial candidate Doug Mastriano) is a blend of a standard political rally with an evangelical tent revival and a big-top circus led by a conman (or conwoman) who serves as a ringmaster of the (barely) controlled pandemonium. The bright lights, amplified music, and television cameras—not to mention the demotic crudeness—make it a modern event. But the form has deep roots in the American experience. Trump managed to tap into those historical antecedents with his rallies. And it may well be that the politician most capable of reproducing and even expanding on such public events is the one who will rise above the various contenders to succeed the former president as head of the Republican Party and leader of its right-wing-populist crusade.\r\nPerhaps they are correct. But I’m not yet convinced, because it seems clear to me that no one else combines Trump’s celebrity, charisma, wealth, instincts, and extraordinary lack of shame. Here’s a case for the proposition that Trump’s successor as head of the Republican Party is very likely to be unlike him: That is usually how things happen in American politics. In 1988, the GOP would have loved another Ronald Reagan, but there was no one else like him. In 2000, the Democrats would have loved someone with Bill Clinton’s charisma rather than Al Gore’s lack of it. In 2016, the Democrats would have loved another Barack Obama, but nobody fit the bill. Even coalitions that want a carbon copy of the last big thing often cannot get it.Provocation of the WeekIn The New York Times earlier this month, German Lopez observed that:\r\nAmerica’s homelessness problem has the makings of an acute crisis. Shelters across the U.S. are reporting a surge in people looking for help, with wait lists doubling or tripling in recent months. The number of homeless people outside of shelters is also probably rising, experts say. Some of them live in encampments, which have popped up in parks and other public spaces in major cities from Washington, D.C., to Seattle since the pandemic began.\r\nThe Washington Post reports that “inflation is making homelessness worse.”I wish I knew how to solve this complex problem. My informed hunch is that building more housing would help, at least in California, the jurisdiction with which I am most familiar. Others focus on urging improvements to the mental-health-care system, drug-and-alcohol-rehabilitation programs, or job-training programs, or even overthrowing capitalism in America.In history, Marxism has impoverished people more dramatically than it has lifted people out of poverty, but even it strikes me as more likely to help homeless people than the questionable focus of some housing activists: “Our unhoused neighbors are human, and the language we use should reflect that,” the L.A. Homeless Services Authority tweeted this week, continuing an ongoing trend. “Let's abandon outdated, ‘othering,’ and dehumanizing terminology- and instead, adopt people-centered language that emphasize personhood over housing status.” Instead of saying “the homeless” or “homeless people” or “the unhoused,” they urge saying “people experiencing homelessness” or “people who are unhoused” or “people living outside.”While I agree that our language should reflect the fact that homeless people are as fully human and worthy of love as anyone else, I reject the strange conceit that “people experiencing homelessness” vests them with more humanity than “homeless people.” I feel no less human if you call me a “writer” as opposed to a “person who writes,” and I deny that a “person who murders” is any more or less dignified than “murderer.” Substantively, both are killers. Whether you’re homeless or a person experiencing homelessness, I recognize your dignity––and I want these distracting word games to stop. Last year in Architectural Digest, Nicholas Slayton wrote:\r\nIn Los Angeles, Mayor Eric Garcetti and some members of the city council have embraced unhoused. In Seattle the city government uses the phrase person experiencing homelessness. That’s also what the Centers for Disease Control used in guidance for how to aid unhoused people during the COVID-19 pandemic; the word homeless is used only as an adjective. The change is happening in part as governments move away from punitive measures amid a deepening housing crisis. Past efforts have not resolved the matter, and both policy and messaging are shifting.\r\nWhat was that messaging shift worth? Well, homelessness is up. So are the deaths of homeless people. And Los Angeles has just passed a sweeping ban on homeless encampments near schools, while, according to the Los Angeles Times, leaders in “liberal cities across the country” where “people living in tents in public spaces have long been tolerated” are “removing encampments and pushing other strict measures to address homelessness that would have been unheard of a few years ago.”The much-vaunted embrace of newspeak accomplished nothing. It tends to confuse most people who aren’t paying attention, annoy most people who are paying attention, and achieve no substantive good. To better help people, progressive nonprofits should stop making it a focus.As ever, thanks for all your emails, and dissents are always welcome. See you next week.",

        "title": "Biden’s Cancellation of Billions in Debt Won’t Solve the Larger Problem",
        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2022/08/student-debt-relief-biden-loan-forgiveness/671223/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "For years, American lawmakers have chipped away at the fringes of reforming the student-loan system. They’ve flirted with it in doomed bills that would have reauthorized the Higher Education Act—which is typically renewed every five to 10 years but has not received an update since 2008. Meanwhile, the U.S. government’s student-debt portfolio has steadily grown to more than $1.5 trillion.Today, calls for relief were answered when President Joe Biden announced that his administration would be canceling up to $10,000 in student loans for those with federal debt, and up to $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients. As long as a borrower makes less than $125,000 a year, or makes less than $250,000 alongside a spouse, they would be eligible for cancellation. The president will also extend the current loan-repayment pause—originally enacted by then-President Donald Trump in March 2020 as a pandemic-relief measure—until December 31.The debt relief—which by one estimate could cost a total of $300 billion—is a massive benefit for Americans who have struggled to repay loans they accrued attending college, whether they completed a degree or not. But equally as important as addressing the damage that student loans have caused is ensuring that Americans aren’t saddled with overwhelming debt again. And the underlying issue of college affordability can be addressed only if America once again views higher education as a public good. Belatedly canceling some student debt is what a country does when it refuses to support students up front.According to a White House fact sheet, 90 percent of Biden’s debt relief will go to those who earn less than $75,000 a year—and the administration estimates that 20 million people will have their debt completely canceled.  “An entire generation is now saddled with unsustainable debt in exchange for an attempt, at least, for a college degree,” Biden said at a White House event. “The burden is so heavy that even if you graduate, you may not have access to the middle-class life that the college degree once provided.” That Democrats arrived at this point at all, though, is a testament to how grim the student-loan crisis has become. A decade and a half ago, Democrats were advocating for small increases in the federal grant program to help low-income students afford college. Over successive presidential campaigns, Democratic hopefuls, including Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, have called for canceling most, or all, student debt issued by the government—effectively hitting reset on a broken system. And now the party is announcing one of the largest federal investments in higher education in recent memory.[Read: How the Democrats got radical on student debt]When he was running for president in 2007, Biden advocated for a tax credit for college students and a marginal increase in the size of individual Pell Grant awards—tinkering around the edges of solving a brewing mess as America lurched toward a deep recession. From 2006 to 2011, college enrollment grew by 3 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau; at the same time, states began to cut back on their higher-education spending. On average, by 2018, states were spending 13 percent less per student than they were in 2008.Historically, when states look to cut their budgets, higher education is one of the first sectors to feel the blade. Polling shows that the majority of Americans agree that a college degree pays off. But college, unlike K–12 schooling, is not universal, and a majority of Republicans believe that investment in higher education benefits graduates more than anyone else. So lawmakers have been willing to make students shoulder a greater share of the burden. But this shift leaves those with the fewest resources to pay for college—and those whose families earn a little too much to qualify for Pell Grants—taking on significant debt.The shift flies in the face of the Framers’ view of higher education, though. “There is nothing which can better deserve your patronage than the promotion of science and literature,” George Washington, an early proponent of the idea of a national university, said in his first address before Congress, in 1790. “Knowledge is in every country the surest basis of public happiness.” Washington, James Madison, Benjamin Rush, and others believed that colleges might be a place where Americans could build a national identity—a place where they could, for lack of better words, become good citizens.In that spirit, the federal government provided massive investments in the nation’s colleges, albeit inequitably—through the Morrill Act, which formed the backbone of state higher-education systems as we know them; the GI Bill; and the Pell Grant program—which directly subsidize students’ expenses. But in the past half century, radical investments in higher-education access have dried up. Now a political divide has opened up: Conservative lawmakers—whose voters are more likely not to have attended college—have grown not only suspicious of but in some cases openly hostile toward the enterprise.[Read: America is divided by education]Meanwhile, 77 percent of Democrats believe that the government should subsidize college education. “We want our young people to realize that they can have a good future,” Senator Chuck Schumer said in April. “One of the best, very best, top-of-the-list ways to do it is by canceling student debt.” He wanted the president to be ambitious and called for giving borrowers $50,000 in relief—“even going higher after that.” A month into his administration, though, Biden shot down the idea of $50,000, to the chagrin of relief advocates. “Canceling just $10,000 of debt is like pouring a bucket of ice water on a forest fire,” the NAACP’s Derrick Johnson and Wisdom Cole argued today. “It hardly achieves anything—only making a mere dent in the problem.”The administration is coupling its announcement with a redesign of payment plans that allows borrowers to cap their monthly loan payments at 5 percent of their discretionary income. But the basic problem remains: Young Americans of modest means can no longer afford to attend their state university by getting a part-time job and taking out a small loan. For millions of students, borrowing thousands of dollars has become the key to paying for an undergraduate degree. Biden’s plan will give graduates—and those who have taken out loans but not finished school—some relief, but the need to overhaul a system reliant on debt remains as urgent as ever.",

        "description": "The transition from Monkeypox Inoculation Plan A to Monkeypox Inoculation Plan B has been a smashing success—at least, if you ask federal officials. Just a few weeks ago, the U.S. had nowhere near enough of the Jynneos vaccine to doubly dose even a quarter of the Americans at highest risk of monkeypox, roughly 1.6 million men who have sex with men. Now that the administration has asked that every dose of Jynneos be split into five and delivered a different way, between the layers of the skin, the party line has changed. “Everyone that wants to get vaccinated within that group is going to have an opportunity to get vaccinated” by September’s end, Robert Fenton, the White House’s monkeypox czar, said on a podcast last week.But this new strategy of intradermal dosing “is a gamble,” says Caitlin Rivers, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins, and its weaknesses are already beginning to show. It may be high time to start acting on a fallback plan for our fallback plan, should Plan B’s high-stakes wager not pay off.[Read: America’s new monkeypox strategy rests on a single study]The Plan Cs on the table aren’t very palatable—which is probably why they’re Plan Cs. One option, largely dismissed early on, could entail turning to ACAM2000, a hypereffective smallpox shot, with sometimes dangerous side effects, that the U.S. has stockpiled in spades. Already, three jurisdictions, including the state of California, have ordered more than 800 doses of ACAM from the government, according to Timothy Granholm, a spokesperson for HHS.Simply anticipating the possibility of Plan B’s failure might count as atypical for modern American public health—getting ahead of the virus du jour, rather than taking a reactive stance, says Stella Safo, an HIV physician in New York. Too often in the past few years, the institutions of public health have observed rather than acted, allowing SARS-CoV-2, and now monkeypox, to run roughshod over the American populace. “It would be really nice to not be saying, ‘Let’s wait and see,’” Safo told me. ACAM2000 may not be the country’s best or safest option for curtailing monkeypox, but the risk of not considering it may soon outweigh the risks of the shot itself.There’s a world in which the U.S. didn’t even need a Monkeypox Inoculation Plan B. Had U.S. leaders been willing to invest resources in heading off the pathogen, by offering aid to countries where the virus has been endemic for decades or by focusing earlier this year on tests, treatments, vaccines, and public communications, maybe America’s original immunization plan—using the full, subcutaneous Jynneos dose—would have been all the nation needed on the injection front.That didn’t happen, and instead the country adopted intradermal delivery, without real clarity on how well such doses might guard against infection, transmission, or disease. The notion that intradermal shots will work as hoped rests on a “chain of assumptions,” says John Beigel, an immunologist at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, several of which may not hold during a large, fast-spreading outbreak that’s tightly linked to sex—a poorly studied form of monkeypox transmission. Jynneos’s original approval was based on an antibody analogue of protection, rather than efficacy against bona fide illness. And the FDA’s authorization of intradermal shots rests on a single study, which didn’t directly check the vaccine’s ability to stave off disease, either. The study also enrolled only healthy adults, most of them white—a poor reflection of the population now being hit. It’s a “big leap” to build a nationwide vaccine campaign on just those results, says Sri Edupuganti, a vaccinologist at Emory University and one of the study’s authors. (Beigel is now designing a clinical trial that will reevaluate the intradermal route among participants more relevant to the current outbreak. He and his team will also test one-tenth intradermal doses, which could further stretch supply.)[Read: America should have been able to handle monkeypox]The intradermal plan has logistical challenges, too. Administering in-skin shots requires extra training and special needles, burdening already stressed staff, especially in low-resource regions. Several jurisdictions are struggling to extract more than three or four doses from some vials, rather than the government’s promised five—a shortchanging of those hoping to increase their stocks by a clean 400 percent. Plus, some bottle caps are breaking before all the doses are withdrawn. Intradermal vaccination can also come with grating side effects, including redness and swelling that can stick around for days, potentially deterring people from returning for the essential second shot.Fenton, from the White House, noted in a press briefing last week that the switch to intradermal “increased our supplies significantly without compromising safety or effectiveness.” But that assertion seems “disingenuous at best,” says Gregg Gonsalves, an epidemiologist and AIDS activist at Yale’s School of Public Health. Even the CEO of Bavarian Nordic, the vaccine’s manufacturer, criticized the FDA’s pivot as too hasty. (The FDA attempted to counter the company’s criticisms.)Meanwhile, demand may continue to grow, especially if the epidemic starts to concentrate less among men who have sex with men. “The longer the outbreak lasts, the longer you have for jumping to other populations,” Gonsalves told me. College campuses, reopening now, “seem like the most obvious next stop.” And “if this gets into other networks,” says Ina Park, a sexual-health expert at UC San Francisco, Plan B “just won’t be enough.”Equity, too, is becoming an issue. “If we lived in a world where we had plenty of vaccine, you would go with subcutaneous,” Beigel told me. But in North Carolina, for instance, where 70 percent of monkeypox cases have been among Black men, some two-thirds of the subcutaneous shots administered before August 8 went to people who are white; similar skews have been noted in New York City. Now “Black and brown gay men are really angry,” says Kenyon Farrow, a writer and public-health activist based in Ohio. “They watched white gay men get full doses … and now they feel like they are getting less of a dose.” Farrow has pushed for everyone to get at least one subcutaneous shot—a strategy that advocates in New York City also back—but the Biden administration seems set on moving all jurisdictions onto the intradermal route.Mapping out yet another vaccination strategy won’t address all of these problems. (And no matter what, the administration should keep ordering more Jynneos, stat.) But the forecast for fall is murky. And should the present situation worsen, a fresh tactic could give the U.S. a head start—something the country hasn’t had on the public-health playing field in a while.Already, some experts are mulling the nuclear option: ACAM2000, the smallpox shot that the government has been hoarding to counter a potential bioterrorism attack. Doses of the vaccine are available by the many millions, and thought to be both effective and durable. It’s also, Edupuganti told me, “one of the vaccines with the highest amount of adverse reactions,” occasionally triggering side effects as serious as heart inflammation. The shot contains a replicating virus, and shouldn’t be taken by immunocompromised people, including many of those who are living with HIV. And just about everyone who gets the shot sprouts an oozy lesion at the injection site that can pass the vaccine virus to others. Against something like smallpox—a far more contagious virus that killed up to 30 percent of its victims—ACAM2000 would be “a no-brainer,” says Rafi Ahmed, a vaccinologist at Emory University. With monkeypox, though, Johns Hopkins’s Rivers told me, the risk-benefit calculation “is really hazy.”[Read: What should worry most Americans about our monkeypox response]It’s not time to trot out ACAM yet, Safo, the New York physician, told me. But maybe autumn will bring many more cases. Maybe monkeypox’s symptoms could grow more severe. Maybe the virus will start to surge in new populations. Maybe intradermal Jynneos will fall short in effectiveness or safety. In any case, containment with the current tools isn’t a guarantee. “If things do get out of control,” Ahmed told me, “you want to have some ACAM stocks ready to go.” No clear, perfect threshold can yet denote “out of control.” Still, a trend toward a worse outbreak would inch the country closer to tapping into its ACAM2000 supply, Park told me: “I don’t think we have another choice.” Which means that the FDA and CDC should probably start poring over the ACAM data now, Rivers said.  Resorting to ACAM2000 will also put the onus on officials to explain to the public what they’re getting into. If some are balking at intradermal shots, people further back in line could reasonably wonder why they’ve been stuck with a less-safe vaccine, Farrow pointed out. There could be a middle ground worth testing in a clinical trial: one shot of Jynneos, via either administration route, followed by a dose of ACAM2000, says Stephen Goldstein, a virologist at the University of Utah. One 2019 study hints that this shot, chaser approach could shrink infectious lesions, as well as cut down on ACAM2000’s side effects, while still offering an immunological boost—though that trial used two subcutaneous Jynneos doses first. In any case, the government would do well to pursue more options, even enroll people in trials comparing the different vaccines, Gonsalves told me. And transparency is tantamount. “Back in the days of AIDS,” he said, “many of us were saying, as new drugs were coming online, we wanted access and answers” about the options at hand. Right now, the nation’s short on both.That “we’re even having to ask these questions about ACAM,” Farrow told me, is a sobering reminder that “we didn’t get our shit together” early on. Instead, the U.S. has backed itself into having to reckon with its appetite for risk. Being too cautious with vaccines could allow the outbreak to further balloon; being too reckless with shots could compromise public trust. The administration firmly contends that Jynneos remains “the best available option,” according to Granholm, the HHS spokesman. (That said, ACAM2000 “is available upon request,” he told me.)\r\nSuch a position may feel like the safe one—it potentially sidesteps the gnarliness of ACAM. But perhaps it’s actually dicier, because it’s not properly preparative. “We can’t just say intradermal is going to solve all of our problems,” Park told me. Although the hope is that the country’s ACAM supply can stay stashed away, we need to be ready to use it, and quickly, should the need arise. If the country once again waits until “we’re in a pinch” to act, Rivers told me, “it’s going to be too late.”",

        "description": "One year ago this month, Twitter permanently suspended a 340,000-follower account for “repeated violations of our COVID-19 misinformation rules.” The owner of that account, the former New York Times reporter and vaccine skeptic Alex Berenson, responded with a lawsuit demanding reinstatement. Suffice to say that few observers thought he had any chance of coming out on top. One lawyer went through the complaint page by page on Twitter and concluded that Berenson had hired a “band of incompetent knock-off muppet lawyers” to present a doomed case.Then, somehow, the muppet lawyers won. Earlier this summer, Twitter put Berenson’s account back online, noting that “the parties have come to a mutually acceptable resolution.” Berenson wasted little time in calling out mainstream media for failing to cover the “pathbreaking settlement” that led to his return. “I mean, imagine being @dkthomp right about now,” he wrote triumphantly, in reference to my colleague Derek Thompson, who last year dubbed Berenson “the pandemic’s wrongest man.” Now he’s bent on being acknowledged as the victim of the pandemic’s wrongest ban.Whatever the merits of Berenson’s case, and of the specific tweet that led to his suspension, the outcome is significant. For years, people who have been booted off Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, and other platforms have tried to sue to get back on, and for years, most of their cases were dismissed. Eric Goldman, a law professor at Santa Clara University School of Law, analyzed 62 such decisions for an August 2021 paper and found that the internet companies had won “essentially all” of them. When he read about Berenson’s lawsuit, he told me, his first impression was that “it was doomed to fail just like the dozens of others that have also failed.”Berenson's victory was not based on his argument that his ban was a violation of the First Amendment; the judge rejected this claim. Instead, his success seems to have hinged on promises made to him by a high-level Twitter employee. “The points you’re raising should not be an issue at all,” the company’s then–vice president of global communications assured Berenson at one point, according to the complaint. The lawsuit says the same executive later told Berenson that his name had “never come up in the discussions” about Twitter’s COVID-19 misinformation policies. Goldman believes that the court’s decision to allow a claim based on that correspondence prompted Twitter to settle. Internet-service executives have always been instructed by lawyers not to talk with people about their individual accounts and not to make any promises about what might happen, Goldman said, “for reasons that should now be obvious.”This was not the end of the drama, though. Last week, Berenson published a Substack post that included screenshots of a conversation on Twitter’s internal Slack messaging system from April 2021, obtained during the course of the lawsuit. The images show employees discussing a recent White House meeting at which members of the Biden administration were said to have posed a “really tough question about why Alex Berenson hasn’t been kicked off from the platform,” as one Slack message put it. Another alleges that Andy Slavitt, who was at the time a senior adviser to Joe Biden on the administration’s COVID-19 response, specifically mentioned a “data viz that had showed [Berenson] was the epicenter of disinfo.” Berenson has since declared that he will sue the Biden administration for infringing upon his free speech by compelling Twitter to take action against his account.Once again, legal experts say that his case is unlikely to succeed. Berenson faces a “very high bar” in proving that a private company behaved as a state actor, Evelyn Douek, an Atlantic contributor and assistant professor at Stanford Law School, told me. According to both her and Goldman, the Slack messages that Berenson published don’t amount to proof that the government pressured Twitter to remove Berenson’s account. But Douek is generally perturbed by the evidence of informal pressure by government officials to constrain speech. “It does strike me as unusual,” she said. “It’s certainly unusual to get records of it.”Andy Slavitt told me that he did participate in a meeting with Twitter but doesn’t recall bringing up Berenson by name. “Twitter sets its own policies, and I wanted to understand them, whether they’re good or bad,” he said. I asked him about an MIT data visualization, widely circulated around that time, that described an “anti-maskers network” with Berenson as an “anchor.” Had he brought up that data-viz in the meeting? He said it was possible: “I don’t doubt it, because we tried to use examples.” But he denied having asked Twitter to get rid of Berenson, with whom he claimed to have only passing familiarity. “I think his name was in a magazine article,” he said. “I don’t remember anything else about him.”I reached out to Berenson to request an interview, but he refused to answer questions about his legal fight with Twitter, and the settlement that came out of it. “If you want to have a real conversation that ends in a piece that discusses Derek’s piece as well as my case, we can do so,” he responded, once again referring to my colleague, “but I expect that will be impossible for you.”Content moderation is messy by its nature. Health- or science-content moderation can be even more chaotic. Like other social platforms, Twitter tried to implement new policies at the start of the pandemic that could be applied to conversations about a rapidly shifting set of best practices for public health. Twitter’s “COVID-19 misleading information policy” specifically considers in violation any “claim of fact” that is “demonstrably false or misleading” and “likely to impact public safety or cause serious harm.” But those definitions have proved tricky.Consider the final tweet from Berenson before he was kicked off Twitter last year, which made the following statements about COVID-19 vaccination: “It doesn’t stop infection. Or transmission. Don’t think of it as a vaccine. Think of it - at best - as a therapeutic with a limited window of efficacy and terrible side effect profile that must be dosed IN ADVANCE OF ILLNESS. And we want to mandate it? Insanity.” The first two statements in the tweet are factually accurate. The third wouldn’t seem to qualify as a “claim of fact.” The fourth, with its reference to a “terrible side effect profile,” is at least tendentious and arguably misleading, but the overall point of the tweet is to express disdain for vaccine mandates. How, exactly, did this tweet factor into Berenson’s removal from the site? A spokesperson for the company would provide me only with the same statement it had given out in July: “Upon further review,” the statement said, “Twitter acknowledges Mr. Berenson’s Tweets should not have led to his suspension at that time.”[Read: Joe Rogan’s show may be dumb. But is it actually deadly?]Stephanie Alice Baker, a sociologist at City, University of London, has taken issue with the concept of “harm” as it’s used in health-misinformation policies on Twitter and Facebook. Scientific consensus and official recommendations have changed over the course of the pandemic, she argues, citing the changing early advice on face masks, as well as the retraction of prominent papers in The Lancet and The New England Journal of Medicine about the safety of various medications used by COVID-19 patients. “Part of the issue with predicating content moderation policies on the concept of harm at the start of the pandemic is that scientific understanding of harm was uncertain and evolving,” Baker told me recently via email. “Harm is not a neutral concept,” she added. “What is considered harmful is highly contingent on partisan issues and politics.”In the meantime, the mere existence of these policies serves as fodder for a culture war over platforms’ efforts to mitigate harmful speech—and Berenson’s victory has been good for morale among those who believe that they’ve been censored. One of the lawyers who represented him, James R. Lawrence III, has been posting about his other clients, including the Rhode Island doctor Andrew Bostom and the former combat medic Daniel Kotzin, both of whom were kicked off Twitter for violating COVID-misinformation policies. “Science is not about the truth revealed by technocrats; it’s about discussion,” Adam Candeub, a Michigan lawyer who advised President Donald Trump on his efforts to counter alleged anti-Republican bias on social media, told me. Candeub has filed lawsuits on behalf of banned Twitter users but has never found success like Berenson and Lawrence’s. “It worked for them; thank God it did,” he said.The next round of lawsuits may go nowhere, but they still can play a role in a growing ecosystem of “aggrieved influencers,” for whom claims of being censored by the platforms are themselves a form of clout. Goldman told me that this issue is only getting hotter. New efforts to regulate social media at the state level could enable far more legal action, with higher odds of success. If laws like those that have been passed in Florida and Texas were to stand up in court, everything will change, Goldman said. “We will see a massive tsunami of litigation that dwarfs what we’ve seen today.”",

        "description": "Sign up for Derek’s newsletter here.America’s students are going back to school this month. According to many media sources, districts won’t have nearly enough teachers to greet them. The Washington Post has warned of a “catastrophic teacher shortage.” ABC World News Tonight called it a new “growing crisis,” and Rebecca Pringle, the president of the National Education Association, called it a “five-alarm” fire. The Wall Street Journal warned of a “dog-eat-dog” scramble to hire underqualified instructors, and results from a national survey found a surge of teachers planning to quit or retire early.For several weeks, I watched this Great American Teacher Shortage narrative bloom across the media landscape. Because of my reporting for my abundance-agenda series, I was predisposed to believe it was real. The U.S. is rife with shortages, including of infant formula and monkeypox vaccines. But I was also skeptical, because so many public-education controversies—see: the debates over remote schooling, the proper way to teach American history, and controversial laws regarding how teachers can discuss sex ed—are plastered with ideology.When I spoke with education researchers and writers to figure out what was really going on, a more complex narrative emerged. In parts of the country, schools are struggling to hire staff. But they are mostly the same districts that have been struggling for years to fill the same positions, such as substitute and special-ed roles. In the big picture, the new and catastrophic national teacher shortage is neither newly catastrophic nor, in any meaningful sense, national. Under one interpretation of the murky data, the country might even have a teacher surplus on its hands, because so many parents have pulled their children out of public schools since the pandemic began.American teachers and American schools absolutely do have real problems that deserve our attention.Teacher vacancies exist, and they are concentrated in specific states, districts, and positions. Many rural areas and the Deep South are experiencing shortages. Some high-poverty districts have struggled for decades to hire enough teachers. High teacher turnover is especially a problem in child care and special education. A recent study in Louisiana found that one-third of the state’s child-care centers lose more than half of their teachers every year. A 2022 government survey found that the vacancy rate for special-ed teachers is more than four times higher than that for physical-education instructors.Exhausted, underpaid, and stressed out, America’s teachers seem to be in a state of psychological and financial crisis. By some estimates, public-school teachers are the most “burned out” workers in America. The pandemic made things worse; some surveys show a big increase in the share of teachers who say they want to quit. Indeed, managing an elementary-school classroom via Zoom five days a week sounds to me like one of the lower rings of hell.So, if the question is whether some districts are struggling to hire enough teachers, or whether some specific occupations have shortages, or even whether many teachers are feeling crummy about their work, the answer is clearly yes. These things are all happening. But most of these things have been happening for a long time.“There has not been a mass exodus of teachers across the country,” Heather Schwartz, a senior policy researcher at the Rand Corporation, told me. Chad Aldeman, who writes about education finance at Edunomics Lab, agrees. “The public narrative has gotten way ahead of the data and is even misleading in most cases,” he told me.The single most consistent message I heard from people I spoke with for this article: America’s national teacher shortage is dubious, but America’s education-data shortage is dire. “To date, there is little firm evidence to support claims of an unprecedented crisis,” Matt Barnum wrote on the education-news site Chalkbeat.Comprehensive national data on teacher-turnover rates (the share of teachers who quit each year) and national-vacancy rates (the share of open teacher positions that aren’t filled) are simply not available, or don’t go back far enough to tell us whether this year is different. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics tracks employment in the category of “local government education.” But researchers told me that this category blends teachers, school administrators, cafeteria workers, and bus drivers, among other occupations.More than a year ago, Matthew Kraft, an associate professor of education at Brown University, started to collect data for a paper on the education labor market during COVID-19. It was meant to be a review of the dreaded teacher shortage that so many educators had warned about. But the more Kraft read, the more he realized that he couldn’t make any definitive conclusions. “We had to walk back the entire first version of the paper because of the weakness of the existing data,” he told me.The data that we have don’t suggest anything approaching a “catastrophic” shortage. Data obtained by Barnum from five states and 19 large U.S. school districts, including in New York City and Houston, show that teacher-turnover rates haven’t actually increased despite more teachers threatening to quit. As for those polls of teachers who say they plan to quit en masse? Researchers told me that for every three teachers telling pollsters that they plan to quit in the next year, only one actually leaves their job. Teacher burnout might become a mental-health crisis in the near future, but to conflate it with an acute teacher shortage right now is neither accurate nor helpful.“I think we’ve actually gained classroom teachers in the last year, because of new hiring after the federal stimulus bills,” said Aldeman, the education-finance writer. Federal pandemic funds have given schools tens of billions of dollars to hire additional staff, including classroom instructors, teaching assistants, and bus drivers. For example, New Mexico has directed $37 million of its federal relief money to hire 500 educational assistants, as Education Week reported. When those positions go unfilled, they’re counted as additional vacancies. “There might be a shortage in the sense that a lot of new positions are going unfilled,” Schwartz told me. But is it useful to use the term shortage when, compared with staff numbers before the pandemic, more teachers might be employed in America’s public schools right now than in 2019?In fact, the clearest nationwide story isn’t a sharp drop in the number of public-school teachers. It’s a sharp drop in public-school student enrollment.Across the country, certain states—including Iowa and Texas—are hiring more teachers even as their enrollment numbers decline. “It’s super weird to be having a national conversation around teacher shortages while schools are adding teachers and losing students,” Aldeman tweeted last week. He pointed me to data from the National Center for Education Statistics, which project that the number of public-school students will decline every year for the rest of the decade. NCES anticipates that by 2030, fewer kindergartners will be enrolled in public school than in any year since 1998.Enrollment has plummeted so quickly in some school districts that it’s thrown school funding into chaos. Washington State’s Issaquah School District, just outside Seattle, faces a nearly $40 million shortfall this year, as thousands of students have left the district since the pandemic’s start. In New York City, K–12 enrollment dropped nearly 10 percent since COVID, and officials are expecting 30,000 fewer students this fall than last. The reasons are diverse: Some parents are frustrated by curricula that they see as too political; some parents don’t like the school-lottery system; and others have simply decided that tutors and homeschooling are better options.“I’m not confident about the education data, but I think we’ll eventually discover that public-school enrollment declined in the 2022–2023 school year even as districts hired more teachers than they had before the pandemic,” Aldeman told me. “If the student ratio goes down, it’ll be very hard to call that situation a ‘teacher shortage.’”With so many reasons to doubt the narrative of a national teacher shortage, why are news organizations running with this story?One cynical answer is that news media carry a negativity-bias hammer and tend to see the world as a bunch of negative-news nails. When you’re facing a murky narrative with conflicting data, communicating the message “This is a total catastrophe!” is easier than “Well, this is confusing, and a lot of things seem to be happening at once.”An even more cynical answer is that most ideologues have something to gain from the teacher-shortage narrative. Conservatives might thrill to a story about struggling school districts that have gone all “woke” on their students. Liberals would like more sympathy for public employees who share their political goals. And COVID-policy critics can point to public-school crises as evidence that the U.S. education system bungled its remote-school policy for children who faced little threat from COVID. (I tend to agree with that opinion.) The inclination to politicize a national education story might be especially strong given the renewed attention from both parties on school politics—Florida’s sex-ed law, debates about learning loss, and the proper way to teach American history. The teacher-shortage catastrophe simply proved “too good to check.”A more generous explanation is that the teacher-staffing story is pretty damn confusing. In some districts, there are too many students for the staff. In other districts, there aren’t enough students for the budget. One district might be struggling to find English teachers, while another district might only be struggling to find substitute ESL teachers. Thinking about these as equivalent phenomena is nonsensical. But many news reports might be doing just that, in part because the government doesn’t provide any clear historical record on total teacher vacancies. Oversimple narratives can surge in a vacuum of clear information.\r\nWant to discuss more?

        "description": "Late summer so often feels like a season of returning, to all sorts of places: home after months away; school to measure up for another year; an annual vacation spot, where, if beach reads are to be believed, an awkward childhood best friend has magically transformed into a semi-available bombshell with a dark secret. But it’s not only those beachy books that send characters back to familiar places, and it’s not just summer that sparks return.When writers bring us back to a location that they’ve already visited, they’re employing a useful narrative tool. The contrast with unchanging environments is a clear way to illustrate how a protagonist changes over the years. But it can also be a subtler measuring stick of how secrets simmer, or of how painful, powerful forces such as racial injustice or economic inequality can grind characters down over time. The books below show how a setting can reveal the depth of those tensions, and how people respond to their circumstances at different periods in life—for better or worse.\r\nGrove\r\nCrooked Hallelujah, by Kelli Jo FordIn Ford’s woven family story about four generations of Cherokee women, a young mother named Justine uproots her daughter, Reney, from the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma and heads across the Red River to Bonita, Texas. She’s following a kind but callow horseman named Pitch—and a need for independence. From there, Reney and Justine move back and forth between the two places. They’re pulled home by family and an ache for familiar landscapes; they’re pushed out by frustration at Justine’s mother’s religious hard lines, or by the lack of jobs and choices on the reservation; the right place is never quite clear. The book moves from the ’70s to the near future, shifting perspectives as it goes. In simple, detail-studded prose, Ford weaves stories of abuse, heartbreak, and the untold histories that shape the actions of people who are tough and tender, trying the best they can. In the end, when Reney has to help Justine make a near-impossible choice about whether to stay in Texas in the face of calamity, her decision shows how a place can pull generations of people together, and how we often embody our mother’s traits, even if we don’t want to.[Read: Moving back home isn’t just a fallback plan]\r\nPenguin Vitae\r\nTo the Lighthouse, by Virginia WoolfWoolf’s novel about the Ramsay family and their guests at their summer house in the Hebrides is famous for its modernist narrative style, which cycles through a shifting chorus of the characters’ thoughts and senses. It’s an account of two largely uneventful days, spaced 10 years apart. The action comes from Woolf’s focus on the characters’ bubbling streams of consciousness, which clue readers in to the ways that the guests perceive, and misperceive, themselves and one another. For example, on the first night, Mr. Ramsay is irrevocably miffed when the visiting poet, Augustus Carmichael, asks for a second bowl of soup; another guest falls a little bit in love with Mrs. Ramsay when she pays him some cursory attention, not realizing that she’s just being polite. When the story returns to the house 10 years later, after the First World War, Woolf digs into how those types of ossified connections play out. Back in a place that exposes their old feelings, two of the teenage Ramsay children struggle to connect with their father, in part because of their assumptions about how he regards them. When one of the returning guests, Lily Briscoe, thinks back on the first summer, she realizes just how invented her assumptions about other people can be. “Not a word of it was true,” she thinks. “She had made it up; but it was what she knew them by all the same.”\r\nAnchor\r\nSag Harbor, by Colson WhiteheadEach summer that Benji, the close-to-autobiographical narrator of Sag Harbor, and his friends return to the beach, they “just became more of ourselves,” he observes. “Where were we the next summer? A few inches closer to it.” The teenage cohort in Whitehead’s novel about the titular Black oceanside community are trying to figure out how to be, as Benji says, “black boys with beach houses.” They’re feeling out the margins of race and class and social pecking order while also trying to figure out the pressures in their own homes and friendships. What really makes the book—and makes it so fun to read—is Whitehead’s sense for the rhythms of teenage speech and the details that pivot between goofy and gutting, such as the BB that gets lodged near Benji’s eye during an ill-conceived shoot-out. The BB is emblematic of youthful recklessness, but it also foreshadows what happens to some of those Black boys. The repeated summers at Sag, an almost-fantasyland with minimal parental supervision, are steps toward figuring out who they want to be, and they offer models for who they could become. At a Labor Day barbecue, most notably, Benji sees people who could easily be him as a child and others who could be his older self—his past and his potential futures.[Read: Before you can write a good plot, you need to write a good place]\r\nLittle, Brown and Company\r\nCirce, by Madeline MillerWhen Circe, the daughter of Helios, is banished to the island of Aiaia for defying Zeus and showing herself to be a witch, it seems like she’ll be a solitary exile forever. But in Circe, Miller’s novel that retells The Odyssey, she finds that her island can also be a waypoint for visitors—and some, such as Odysseus, return multiple times because of her appeal. Miller’s book casts the witch as a complex protagonist instead of the one-dimensional villain she is commonly portrayed as, and it centers on the relationship between Circe and Odysseus, unraveling the connections that come from it—such as the fate of their child, Telegonus, and that of Odysseus’s wife and son, Penelope and Telemachus, who all make their way back to the island. On Aiaia, they all have to face hard choices fated by the gods—and decide if they want to confront their destinies head-on. Miller has written two books that rework Greek legends; her other is The Song of Achilles, a retelling of the Iliad. By reweaving those foundational stories and giving us Circe’s perspective on growth and change over generations, she eventually tells a story about advocating for the choices you want, even if it doesn’t seem easy.\r\nBantam\r\nSummer Sisters, by Judy BlumeIf you are a woman of a certain age, it’s possible that Blume taught you something through her young-adult books about how complicated sex, friendship, and growing up can be. She notches up the complexity and the emotional resonance in Summer Sisters, her adult novel about Caitlin and Vix, two friends who spend every teenage summer at Caitlin’s family house on Martha’s Vineyard. It’s where they grow up, together and alone. At first, it’s a haven for their shared independence, and some of Blume’s most evocative scenes display the weirdness of their friendship and habits. But during their visits in adulthood, the island becomes a marker of how much they’ve moved away from each other. Blume, with the same clarity that she used to write about first periods and bullying, digs into that all-consuming rawness of early relationships where you feel like the other person is a part of you. When they both choose to come back to the Vineyard, Caitlin and Vix have to face the ways that betrayal will shape their friendship forever.[Read: The case for moving back to your hometown]\r\nLittle, Brown and Company\r\nBrideshead Revisited, by Evelyn WaughOh, you wanted complicated male relationships too? When Charles Ryder shows up at Oxford and falls in with Sebastian Flyte, the alcoholic son of a high-society Catholic family, he makes a connection that will end up shaping all of his biggest life choices. The book opens with Ryder, an army officer, stationed at the Flyte family home, Brideshead, which has been requisitioned during the Second World War. From there, it shoots back in time to the beginning of his relationship with the place and details his subsequent visits, where we learn about his relationship with Sebastian, Sebastian’s sister Julia, and the way their complicated family history and religion will intertwine with his own. He loves them both, even though he struggles to understand the guilt and obligation they feel around Catholicism and how those feelings drive them away from him. In a section that describes Charles’s last visit to Brideshead before the war, we finally see why he can never break through to the Flytes and why coming back to the house is so painful.\r\nPicador\r\nHome, by Marilynne RobinsonThe most obvious return is to where you grew up, and in Home, Jack and Glory Boughton, two of the moralistic Reverend Boughton’s children, have both returned to Gilead, Iowa, for different, desperate reasons. Glory, who has come to care for her ailing father after an embarrassing failed engagement, feels like she’s in her own nightmare: “The one where all the rest of you go off and begin your lives and I am left in an empty house full of ridiculous furniture and unreadable books, waiting for someone to notice,” she says to her brother. Jack, the prodigal son, is home after two decades away and a long stint in prison. He’s anguished and heartbroken, battling alcoholism; he doesn’t have anywhere else to go and is “right back where I started,” he admits to Glory. He wants to figure out if he can redeem himself, a question he brings up to his father and his father’s best friend, Ames. It’s not easy, particularly because he, his father, and Ames must battle through decades of distrust and differing views on morality to reach healing. As their father gets closer to death, and Jack and Glory both try to figure out their futures, Robinson leans into that idea of redemption, and how hard it might be to get there. As Glory asks toward the end, “Home. What kinder place could there be on earth, and why did it seem to them all like exile?”​​When you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

        "description": "Sign up for The Weekly Planet, Robinson Meyer’s newsletter about living through climate change, here.All carrots, no sticks. That is the story of the Inflation Reduction Act. Since the law was unveiled last month, savvy commentators have noted that its policies consist almost entirely of “carrots,” incentives meant to encourage companies to decarbonize, with very few “sticks,” policies meant to punish them for using fossil fuels or emitting carbon. (Just so we’re clear: This analogy is meant to invoke a stubborn donkey that, Looney Tunes–style, is craning to reach a carrot hanging in front of its face while its driver whacks its behind with a stick.)Indeed, although the IRA includes dozens of new benefits, it creates only one new penalty for pollution: the methane-emissions fee, which will charge oil and gas companies at least $900 for every ton of methane that they leak into the atmosphere.However you feel about the IRA, it probably has something to do with this fact. While some climate activists have fretted that the law does not punish fossil-fuel companies enough, centrists have argued that its complicated industrial policy would have been better as a simple carbon tax. But just about everyone has recognized that this all-carrots, no-sticks aspect is why the law passed in the first place. It’s a big part of why Senator Joe Manchin, who has criticized and even directed a lawsuit against the Environmental Protection Agency during his political career, could champion the IRA.But this pat formulation overlooks something important. While it’s true that the IRA itself consists almost only of carrots, that is not true of the broader structure of American climate law. There is, in fact, a big “stick” for tackling carbon pollution already on the books in the United States, as well as an agency tasked with wielding that stick. I’m talking about the Clean Air Act and the EPA. And the IRA, by design, strengthens the government’s ability to wield that stick.It does this in at least two ways. The first is that the IRA confirms that carbon dioxide is a type of air pollution covered by the Clean Air Act, as initially reported by The New York Times earlier this week.This has broader consequences than it might seem. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled in Massachusetts v. EPA that carbon dioxide counted as an air pollutant, and that, if the EPA decided that CO2 harmed human health and the environment, it could regulate CO2 under the Clean Air Act. That ruling—and the EPA’s official determination, a few years later, that CO2 is dangerous—has anchored the agency’s climate regulations on cars and trucks, and its proposed rules for the power grid.But then in June, the Court circumscribed some of the EPA’s authority over the power grid. Conservative justices have harped on the fact that Congress has never clearly delegated the power to regulate greenhouse gases to the EPA.Now it has. The IRA repeatedly defines greenhouse gas as a form of air pollution. It amends several sections of the Clean Air Act to define “greenhouse gas” as encompassing “the air pollutants carbon dioxide, hydrofluorocarbons, methane, nitrous oxide, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride.” In another section, it grants money under the Clean Air Act for any project that “reduces or avoids greenhouse gas emissions and other forms of air pollution.”Congress has now clearly spoken: Carbon dioxide is a form of air pollution. And though this will not undo this year’s ruling, it buttresses the EPA’s underlying legal authority to regulate climate pollution.But that change is not the only—or even the most important—way that the IRA strengthens the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases. The law will also allow the EPA to pass much stricter rules than it could have previously.The reason has to do with a quirk of American law. Since the 1980s, every major proposed regulation has had to show that it passes a cost-benefit analysis demonstrating that its benefits to the economy as a whole exceed its costs. In the EPA’s case, that means that the cost of complying with a regulation can’t exceed the benefit to society of cleaner air or water. Over the years, this has turned out not to be much of an impediment to the EPA, because even small amounts of air pollution are massively damaging to public health, so preventing any air pollution has very high benefits.But the IRA’s many carrot-like policies, such as its clean-electricity subsidies and carbon-capture incentives, would functionally lower these limitations on the EPA even more by skewing the cost-benefit analysis in the agency’s favor.That will happen in two ways. First, the IRA’s economy-wide tax credits and subsidies will reduce the costs that companies face in complying with broad EPA rules that encourage wind, solar, or electric-vehicle adoption. Second, the IRA contains new grants that will allow the EPA to subsidize the cost of compliance directly by writing checks or issuing loans to oil and gas firms and other regulated companies so that they can meet the terms of the rules. This works in the EPA’s favor because the cost-benefit analysis looks only at the effect of the regulation itself; it does not include any funding from Congress that makes achieving that regulation more feasible. Both of these moves will lower the costs of regulation, allowing the EPA to pass much more expansive rules.This effect is important, but it was not accounted for in the law’s projected 40 percent reduction of U.S. carbon emissions. That was not a mistake—the modelers design their studies to look at what the new law alone will do, and so they assume zero further EPA action—but it means that the IRA’s emissions-cutting power could very well exceed what the models suggest today.The whole point of the IRA is that it brings down the cost of clean energy. It makes renewables cheaper, it makes nuclear power cheaper, and, as I wrote last week, it even makes the technologies that we’ll need to fight climate change in the 2030s cheaper. So far, most commentary on the law has focused on the immediate effects of that shift, and on how the law’s new incentives will reduce emissions simply by driving turnover in the energy system. But in the weeks and years to come, the secondary effects could become more important. Now that the IRA has passed, it will be easier for states and cities to pursue aggressive climate policy, and it will be simpler for companies to cut their emissions faster than would otherwise be economical.That’s why looking at the modeled emissions effects of the IRA—something that, to be clear, I did in this newsletter—is a little silly. The IRA isn’t like an EPA regulation that will modestly bend the curve of U.S. emissions. Instead, it catapults the country into a whole new landscape where the economics of every other climate action are different.We thought the IRA was doling out carrots. It was actually planting an entirely new garden.",

        "description": "Gavin Newsom, the Democratic governor of California, has made a striking choice of which public fights to pick. Since 2019, he has been in charge of America’s most populous state—one that confronts severe water, energy, and housing shortages; growing homeless encampments in multiple cities; rising homicide counts; failing schools; perpetually gridlocked traffic; and infamously bad public transportation. In a poll earlier this year from UC Berkeley and the Los Angeles Times, a majority of voters said that California is headed in the wrong direction.Nevertheless, he has been devoting much of his attention to publicly heaping scorn on conservatives around the country. As a Californian, I struggle to imagine a bigger waste of time than the way Newsom has been spending his: “I just joined Trump’s Truth Social,” Newsom announced in June. “Going to be on there calling out Republican lies.” He’s the governor of a disaster-prone state with 39 million residents, and he’s bragging about trolling MAGA sycophants on an off-brand Twitter? This summer, he has bought ads attacking Ron DeSantis and Greg Abbott, the Republican governors of Florida and Texas (where getting attacked by Californians helps you).Newsom’s behavior is the product of perverse incentives. Excelling in leadership at the state level means waging and winning risky, politically inconvenient fights that do little to raise a governor’s national profile. A far easier way to attract attention and ingratiate yourself to Democratic power brokers is by picking culture-war fights with enemies of convenience—that is to say, people whom most of your fellow partisans loathe—no matter how tenuously connected those fights might be to politics or policy in the place you’re supposed to govern. Many Democrats rightly scoff at Trump-era conservatives who care more about owning the libs than serving their constituents. But Newsom likewise seems to think that, in today’s political environment, the best way to improve his national prospects is to mock and irritate the other side. And for better or worse, he may be correct.[Read: The Democrats’ new spokesman in the culture wars]Despite California’s evident dysfunction, Newsom is expected to breeze to reelection this November. He has enjoyed all the advantages that a Democratic governor hoping to turn around or transform the Golden State could reasonably want. His party controls every statewide office, a supermajority of the legislature, and most cities. The state has a budget surplus. And the initiative process allows Newsom to appeal directly to the people if state lawmakers reject any changes that he might propose. Perhaps no elected Democrat in any state is less likely to see their agenda thwarted by Republicans.Spared a tough reelection fight by a California GOP too incompetent to nominate viable challengers, Newsom could have focused his reelection campaign on promoting any ambitious agenda of his choosing. Instead, Newsom shifted his attention to Texas and Florida, as if California has everything figured out and the nation need only follow its approach. Of course, no one looking at the state from the outside—and noting its high taxes, high cost of living, and poor infrastructure and state services—sees a model worth emulating.Yet many in the press view Newsom’s approach as politically prudent. His “attention-grabbing tactics” have “launched the leader of the most-populous state into the conversation about potential Democratic presidential nominees should Joe Biden not run again,” Bloomberg reports. Politico’s “California Playbook” argues that “whether Newsom is cracking the presidential door or promoting California progressivism is almost beside the point. The fundamentals are the same. Newsom has long sought to extol California’s agenda—and his—by contrasting it with that of populous red states … It elevates Newsom’s profile and helps him influence the national conversation.”Admittedly, Newsom’s behavior of late has arguably improved his chances of at least snagging the type of Cabinet appointment that new presidents give to partisan allies without any domain expertise, and in a Democratic presidential-primary contest, there’s always at least a lane for someone perceived as a happy warrior. Back in the aughts, when Rush Limbaugh’s bombastic bloviating dominated talk radio, a certain sort of Democrat thought, We on the left need one of him. Today, a similar sort of Democrat has the same thought when watching DeSantis, who has used his governorship to trigger as many liberal tears as possible. But the people who are most driven by negative partisanship are terrible judges of who will win general elections. Most Americans don’t want a hard-line left-winger or right-winger to be president, and many find the sadistic delight partisans take in political combat to be weird and off-putting. That’s why Joe Biden, not Donald Trump, is now president.Even if Newsom’s recent antics do persuade Democrats to nominate him for the White House in 2024—he insists he doesn’t want to run while acting as if he does—making him the party’s standard-bearer would be risky in a general election for two reasons. First, the “look at what the right wing is doing” diversions won’t be enough against a talented opponent who redirects attention to his record in California and forces him to answer for the state’s most jaw-droppingly dysfunctional features. Although Newsom can point to some small improvements here and there, none are on the scale of the state’s many challenges—or on the scale one might expect given his party’s supermajority control of the legislature. Second, Newsom’s approach to exploiting negative polarization is especially alienating, just as Hillary Clinton’s was in 2016, in that it essentially labels large swaths of America as deplorables.For example, earlier this month, Newsom—perhaps inspired by DeSantis’s efforts to punish Disney for speaking up in the culture wars—wrote an open letter insinuating that movie studios should avoid states that fail to protect abortion and LGBTQ rights. “Over the last several years, the legislatures of states like Georgia and Oklahoma have waged a cruel assault on essential rights,” Newsom declared in the letter, which he posted on Twitter and published as an ad in the movie-industry publication Variety. “Today more than ever, you have a responsibility to take stock of your values––and those of your employees––when doing business in those states … So to those in power to make decisions about where to film, where to hire, where to open new offices, we in California say: Walk the walk.”In this instance, Newsom’s stance is at least conceivably beneficial to his constituents. I personally would prefer that Hollywood spend its dollars in California, where I live, than in Georgia. But recall that Joe Biden won Georgia in 2020. A Democratic presidential nominee on record arguing that corporations cannot ethically do business or hire people there will have a lot more trouble winning that state. In recent presidential elections, Democrats have been more and more competitive in Texas—which Newsom recently described on Twitter, alongside a dozen or so other states that still have sodomy laws on their books, as “hateful.”In the 2004 speech that catapulted Barack Obama to national prominence, the future president, who won Florida, Indiana, Iowa, North Carolina, and Ohio at least once, said this about the states he was gearing up to contest:\r\nThere is not a liberal America and a conservative America; there is the United States of America. There is not a Black America and a white America and Latino America and Asian America; there’s the United States of America. The pundits like to slice and dice our country into red states and blue states; red states for Republicans, blue states for Democrats. But I’ve got news for them … We are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the United States of America.\r\n[From the September 2004 issue: The natural]That’s how Democrats succeed—by trying to win over people in all states, not by suggesting that some states are properly shunned and boycotted by their moral betters in Hollywood. Bill Clinton, Obama, and Biden all understood that. So do Bernie Sanders, Cory Booker, Amy Klobuchar, and many others. Newsom’s current approach is perfect if MSNBC needs a voice to please its progressive base, but elevating him in politics would be fraught for Democrats. As for the ongoing partisan-warrior schtick, I have nothing in general against, say, Twitter spats with the governor of Alabama. I reject her values too. But as a Californian dismayed by my beloved state’s problems, it’s not how I want my governor, of all people, to spend his time.",

        "title": "Why Alaska’s Wildfire Season Was So Unusual",
        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/alaska-2022-wildfire-season-lightning/671212/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "America’s 2022 wildfire season is off to a relatively calm start, with one big exception: Alaska. Right now, the country overall sits above its 10-year average for annual acres burned, but more than half of that is from the 3 million acres that were scorched earlier this summer in the northernmost state.  To some degree, that’s not unusual. Fire season typically starts and ends earlier in Alaska than in the Lower 48, kicking off in late May and running through July. (Although who really knows what constitutes fire season for the continental U.S. anymore? Colorado logged its most destructive fire on record in the final days of December 2021.)Despite the state’s icy reputation, hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of acres typically roast each year. Alaska, it’s worth remembering, is very, very big. Enormously big. And ecologically diverse. The majority of the state is classified as boreal forest (very cold forest), which is evolutionarily designed to burn (and does so not uncommonly). This past fire season ranks just seventh in terms of total acres burned.What’s most concerning to Rick Thoman, an Alaska climate specialist at the International Arctic Research Center, is not how much burned, but what parts of the state burned. “We would not be talking if interior Alaska had burned 1.4 million acres,” he told me earlier this month. But “for southwest Alaska, there is absolutely nothing like this.”[Caroline Mimbs Nyce: The world needs to start planning for the fire age]If you stick out your thumb like you’re hitchhiking, then turn it upside down and stick out your pointer finger, your hand will be vaguely the shape of the state of Alaska. The southwest is the area between your thumb and pointer finger. This region isn’t just boreal forest. It’s also home to tundra—at times bone-chillingly cold and wet areas where trees don’t grow, even in summer. This specific tundra is wetland tundra, which sits on top of a layer of permafrost. And this summer, that tundra burned. This isn’t without historical precedent; the area’s tundra does burn infrequently. But certainly not like this—not at this rate. Southwest Alaska’s season was also big in non-tundra areas. In the Bristol Bay region, more area burned this summer (mostly in boreal forest) than had burned there in the entire time from 1950 to 2021 combined, Thoman said.  “It gets your attention to see those things happening and especially when they happen in ways that are really without precedent, at least in our modern experience,” Jeremy Littell, a research ecologist at the Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center, told me.One tundra fire came within just miles of the remote city of St. Mary’s, though no one was evacuated. Fires in other parts of the state did force evacuations. (Think evacuating communities in the American West is tricky? Try evacuating a town reachable only by plane.) More broadly, because the state is sparsely populated, wildfires don’t need to be fought with the same urgency as when they threaten structures or human lives. A lot of the time, they’re allowed to burn through. The damage is still being tallied, but for all 3 million acres burned, only two homes have been recorded as lost so far, Sam Harrel, an information officer with the Alaska Division of Forestry and Fire Protection, told me. However, that doesn’t mean Alaskans were spared from the negative side effects of fire. When that much burns, “you are putting a lot of burnt plant material in the air—a lot,” Thoman explained, noting that the air quality had suffered from the smoke.At this point, the worst is probably over for Alaska, which has started to see those late summer rains and earlier nights. But fire season is now in full swing in the rest of the country. What does Alaska’s unusually intense fire season mean for the Lower 48?[From the October 2021 issue: The battle of High Hill]Not much, experts told me. The two seasons aren’t correlated. Sometimes they line up; sometimes they don’t. Littell noted that in recent years they have tended to pull in opposite directions—a big fire year in Alaska would be a small year in the Lower 48—but not in a statistically sound or predictive way, meaning we can’t make forecasts based on it. And climate change further complicates things, Littell added.Generally speaking, the two areas’ respective weather patterns aren’t connected, and fuel loads are different, Scott Rupp, a professor at the University of Alaska at Fairbanks and the deputy director of the International Arctic Research Center, told me. Besides, no matter the conditions, fire tends to be caused by humans and lightning—two hard-to-predict variables.Even if the seasons don’t correlate, they are linked in one big way: States share firefighting resources. Sometimes the same people manning the lines on the Alaskan tundra are the people who later defend the forests of California. This system used to work quite well, Thoman said. “Crews could come up here to help when needed early in the season, and Alaska crews could go down south when things wrapped up here,” he told me. “The problem is, in the Lower 48, the wildfire season is getting longer.” As warming temperatures cause more overlap between regional fire seasons, the country’s shared resources could be spread thin—especially in a bad fire year.Carrie Bilbao, a representative for the National Interagency Fire Center in Idaho, confirms that the agency did send crews from the Lower 48 up to help fight Alaskan fires this summer. “But now that they’re getting the rains and they’re slowing down, they’re releasing those resources to the south,” she told me. One challenging scenario for the country would be big fires in multiple geographic areas threatening communities—as happened in 2020, when a lightning storm ignited several fires in Northern California all at once. (The smoke from these events memorably turned San Francisco skies orange for a day.)Right now, that’s not a worry. NIFC measures national preparedness levels on a scale of one to five. A one means that the country is seeing very little wildfire and that very few firefighters are out there, working away to control a blaze. On the opposite end, a five means that dozens of fires are burning—and some big ones, at that—and that at least 14,000 firefighters are actively deployed trying to contain them. Right now, America is sitting calmly at level three. “Usually, by this time, we’re at four or five,” Bilbao said earlier this month (though, she notes, we never got above a three in 2019).[Caroline Mimbs Nyce: One developer’s case for building in a high-risk fire zone]Jim Wallmann, a meteorologist for the NIFC’s Predictive Services—the group tasked with putting out seven-day and three-month fire outlooks—told me that the Lower 48’s fire season will probably peak in the next two to three weeks. “We’re not expecting Armageddon or anything like that,” he said. “We are going to be busy. But then things will gradually start to wind down.”Ever the anxious California resident, I asked him at what point we (or really, I) can stop holding our (my) breath—and feel comfortable that the country is on pace for a pretty normal fire year. “We’re pretty close,” he said, adding that the next week will be crucial. Both lightning and high temperatures are forecasted. But fuels—the stuff on the ground that the fire actually burns—are in better shape this year than they have been for the past two years because of early-season rain. “If we get really bad, it’s going to be short-duration,” he explained.All that’s left to do is wait—and hope that, unlike with Alaska, we can remember this year’s fire season in the Lower 48 as an ordinary one. In a time of constantly broken fire precedents, that’s about the best we can expect.",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/newsletters/archive/2022/08/how-early-2000s-pop-culture-changed-sex/671217/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "This is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.The feminist writer and activist Ellen Willis is best known for defining the idea of pro-sex feminism in the 1980s. But only a little while later, Willis noticed that women’s liberated sexuality had turned out to be, as she put it, “often depressingly shallow, exploitative, and joyless.”The Atlantic culture writer Sophie Gilbert contemplated Willis’s legacy in her recent review of Bad Sex, a new book by the writer Nona Willis Aronowitz—who also happens to be Willis’s daughter. I called Sophie to chat about some of the bigger ideas her article touched on.But first, here are three new stories from The Atlantic.\r\n\tCat owners can (almost) all agree on one thing.\r\n\tAmerica’s fire sale: Get some free speech while you can.\r\n\tMeme stock’s big bet on Bed Bath &amp; Beyond\r\n‘This Colored Everything’Isabel: You write that “somehow, we let the thoughtful and charged sex positivity espoused by Ellen Willis and her peers curdle into the practice of sex as conspicuous, often unsatisfying, consumption.” What happened?Sophie: In the ’60s and ’70s, Willis argued, the sexual revolution happened, but in the way of eliminating obstacles to sex. In 1973, Roe v. Wade was decided. Contraception for married couples was legalized during the ’60s and for unmarried people in 1972. The idea that women could have casual sex was becoming more socially acceptable than it had been at any point during the 20th century. For women, there weren’t as many obstacles to sex as there had been before, and there weren’t as many punishments for having sex as there had been.But at the same time, what that meant for many women—and they talked about this in various consciousness-raising groups and feminist circles—was that there had become more pressure to have sex, and the sex they were having wasn’t necessarily good or pleasurable.Isabel: It sounds like step one of the sexual revolution was to remove those obstacles and destigmatize sex for women, but then step two—how to have a sex life that is actually empowering and joyful and comfortable—got lost.Sophie: One of the words I’ve been thinking about is intimacy. Intimacy doesn’t have to mean having sex only in a relationship, but concepts like intimacy, trust, and vulnerability, are, for lots of people, crucial components of a good sex life. I think they’re components that got lost along the way, because we were prioritizing things like quantity over quality, empowerment over slightly less buzzword-y terms.Isabel: Something that has been called the “sexual counterrevolution” has popped up lately, particularly among Generation Z. Can you explain what that movement is?Sophie: We’re seeing Gen Z come of age after Millennials dominated the culture, and they’re kind of disgusted by us. There’s a lot of talk about how cringe it is to just hook up with all these millions of guys and feel nothing and boast about it all over the internet. I find the tone of it really fascinating. But it makes complete sense that a generation reared among really ubiquitous and often really ugly online porn would want to place itself in opposition to that and explore other avenues.Isabel: As a Millennial, what were the pop-culture forces that shaped how you thought about sex growing up?Sophie: I’m such a clichéd old-lennial, because for me it was absolutely Sex and the City. I think we really saw it as a road map more than we should have, given that it was a show about women in their 30s not written by a woman. But it was this massively influential thing because it had this explanatory context. Here’s the anal-sex episode; here’s the having-sex-outside-of-a-relationship episode. Every chapter of it felt informative.More generally, I think one of the most influential cultural products of that time was American Pie, which came out in 1999. A part of the plot is the hero hooking up with a woman who doesn’t know that she’s being taped, and the video of their encounter is being broadcast to the whole town. When you think about that now you’re like, Oh my God, this colored everything.Isabel: Have you come across any positive pop-culture portrayals of sexual intimacy, either growing up or more recently?Sophie: There are lots of sex-positive works on TV right now, and I think those are great. The show Sex Education on Netflix is not just sex positive, but relentlessly sex positive.I do think that, as a culture, we are starved for explorations of intimacy. I’ve theorized that part of why the author Sally Rooney is so popular is how well she writes intimacy—the idea that you can have the most profound, intimate sexual interactions with someone else, and they don’t have to be within fixed parameters. That’s also why I found the TV adaptation of Rooney’s novel Normal People so compelling; you had this gorgeous, intimate scene of someone losing her virginity, and everything was a negotiation—Is this okay; is this okay?—but it wasn’t unsexy. If we’re talking about how you absorb road maps from culture of what your love and sex lives can and should look like, that was a really stunning one.Isabel: Before we move on from pop culture, I have to ask about Game of Thrones and the new prequel series. How does Game of Thrones—an immensely popular series with troubling sexual dynamics—and its world fit in with what we’ve been talking about?Sophie: This is a tricky one, because sex in Game of Thrones was always messily tangled up with other things, and in House of the Dragon it’s even more so. Without spoiling too much, House of the Dragon is a prequel that follows the Targaryen dynasty more than 150 years before the events of Game of Thrones. The Targaryens, notoriously, practiced incest as a royal prerogative to protect the “purity” of the bloodline. So although the series has been touting its moral superiority over GoT in the sense that you don’t have the same titillating or wanton portrayals of sexual violence, it’s impossible in House of the Dragon to separate sex from power. I don’t think intimacy gets much of a look-in, and vulnerability even less so.Isabel: At one point in the piece you ask: “How do we even try to make bad sex better?” What do you see as a possible path forward?Sophie: Whenever you engage in anything with other people, you have a basic human duty of care toward them. That’s partly what’s gotten lost. It doesn’t mean that care is marriage, or even dinner. That sounds really glib. But it’s care on an emotional, humane level.

        "description": "Ah, the sounds of late summer. Pass a pool, and hear the happy yelps of kids splashing around. Sit outside at night, and bask in the soothing buzz of cicadas hidden in the trees. Open the internet, and hear the terrifying howling of outer space.Thank NASA for that last one. The space agency recently shared a clip online of sound coming from a cluster of galaxies about 250 million light-years from Earth. NASA, always eager to show off its capacity to produce cosmic wonder, presented the audio enthusiastically, as if to say, Wow, check out this cool thing! And although the transformation of space phenomena into something detectable by our human ears certainly seems like an exciting exercise, the reality is—well, have a listen.The noise sounds like a ghostly wail, or the horror-movie music just before a jump scare, or, as several people have pointed out, the cries of countless souls trapped in eternal darkness. Just nothing good; less awe-ful, and more awful. Does space really sound this scary?The answer is, sort of. And there is a perfectly horror-free explanation for it. Some parts of space are full of hot gas, including the medium between the distant, sparkly galaxies huddled together. In 2002, when a NASA space telescope named Chandra studied the Perseus cluster, it detected wavelike movements in the gas, propagating outward like ripples in water. The ripples, scientists determined, were produced by the supermassive black hole in the cluster’s central galaxy. When the black hole sucks in cosmic material, it burps some out—explosive behavior that pushes around the gas nearby. The resulting waves, astronomers concluded, were sound waves, with a frequency much too deep for any of us to hear.It wasn’t until recently that Kimberly Arcand, Chandra’s visualization scientist, decided to shift those impossibly low cosmic notes into the audible range. She wanted the public, and particularly those who are blind or have reduced vision, to be able to experience the wonder of the Perseus cluster with senses besides sight. Arcand told me she was inspired by Wanda Díaz-Merced, a blind astrophysicist who developed a program to convert sunlight into sound so that she could hear a solar eclipse sweeping across the United States in 2017. Arcand and her team extracted the sound data from Chandra’s observations and then, with some mathematical work and sound editing, brought them into the range of human hearing, a couple hundred quadrillion times higher than the original frequency. The result: a spooky, cosmic wail.Arcand and her team at Chandra have previously made a variety of celestial images into music through a process known as sonification, but those projects were based on light, not sound. Consider the glittering, star-filled center of our Milky Way galaxy. To hear it, scientists assigned different sonic features to the cosmic material in a snapshot of the galaxy. Stellar stuff at the top of the image corresponds to higher pitches; the brightest bits play at top volume. Short notes represent stars, and a drawn-out hum indicates clouds of gas and dust. The image features observations in multiple wavelengths, which scientists used to make a more beautiful song: xylophone for X-rays, violin for optical light, piano for infrared.  The melody of our galactic center sounds lovely, peaceful. Most of the sonifications in Chandra’s library do too, even the clips that lack instrumental elements and feature only a jumble of notes. They are nothing like the primal scream of the Perseus cluster, which the Chandra team released in May this year. “The Perseus one is perhaps the most evocative because it is actually based on sound waves,” Arcand said. It’s more objective, which makes the noise feel a bit more real. At the same time, the cosmic wail wouldn’t sound exactly like this if you could hang out in the Perseus galaxy cluster with a helmet and superpowered hearing. The spooky audio is a combination of the sound waves emanating from the central galaxy in different directions, not a single scream in time. Still, “this is as close as we know how to get,” she said.When I asked Arcand what she thought about the sound freaking people out, she cracked up. “I just feel bad,” she said. Arcand grew up singing in choirs, and for her, the Perseus audio is musical, like a dramatic tune from an emotional, sweeping Hans Zimmer track. She has worked on the Chandra mission for more than two decades, and being so intimately familiar with the data, she was unlikely to be spooked by it, even when it sounds like, you know, that. “I didn’t hear anything scary in it,” she said, but “I totally understand that other people have a different perspective.” Scientists and sound engineers could certainly edit the clip to make it less creepy, mixing in some chimes or nice harp chords. But this is space putting on a little performance, and we may as well experience it as the artist intended.",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/books/archive/2022/08/reading-rushdie-iraq/671207/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "In the spring of 1989, a 21-year-old Iraqi university student named Ali came home and made a shocking discovery: On the living-room table of his family’s home was a copy of The Satanic Verses. A friend of Ali’s father had smuggled Salman Rushdie’s controversial book from London, removing its distinctive blue cover and hiding it in his luggage. This was like finding a bomb.Ali, a shy and curious young man with a passion for reading, was thrilled to be holding such a forbidden object. Ayatollah Khomeini had recently issued his notorious fatwa condemning Rushdie to death, and protests by Muslims were erupting around the world against what they claimed was an intolerable insult to their faith. Crowds gathered in public squares to burn the book; bookstores were being firebombed. Ali’s father, a relatively liberal man, had taken a risk just by letting a copy enter his home.Ali, who left Iraq more than a decade ago, told me recently that he could still remember the intense excitement he felt on first touching the pages. But The Satanic Verses was no easy novel. Ali had studied English for years, but Rushdie’s language was sophisticated and inventive, so much so that reading it required great mental effort and frequent recourse to the Oxford English Dictionary, which he kept beside him. He took notes as he went, partly out of habit and partly because his father’s friend wanted the book back in a week. When he finished it, he was exhausted.What Ali remembers most is a feeling of admiration for the depth of Rushdie’s knowledge and the richness of his imagination. Rushdie had used religious names and narratives like scraps of cloth and woven them together, past and present, into a bizarre, multicolored garment. It was clear enough that Rushdie was deliberately provoking Islamic sensibilities with his overlapping of sacred and profane. But Ali—a practicing Muslim at the time—was not offended. It seemed to him that Rushdie’s intention was not to spit in the face of believers but to create stories that teased and fused the cultural narratives of East and West. The book’s broader message, as far as he could understand it, seemed true to Ali: “that good and bad mingle. They fight each other at times, but they can’t always be easily separated.”[Read: Salman Rushdie and the cult of offense]Ali may have been exactly the kind of reader Rushdie most hoped for, someone who would be simultaneously challenged and inspired by his fictions. Sadly, The Satanic Verses had something like the opposite effect for much of the world, a hardening of perspectives. The outcry set a pattern that has been repeated with depressing regularity in the decades since, a kind of passion play that entrenches resentments on every side. Some sacrilegious image or comment or artwork made in Copenhagen or London is discovered and then rebroadcast in Cairo or Tehran. Threats are issued, protests ensue, people die.It is tempting to see these outbreaks as an unavoidable feature of globalization—a measure of the gap between a secularized society, where the idea of blasphemy is a joke, and a more traditional one, where it remains a powerful taboo enshrined in law. But the conflicts are often amplified by some opportunistic cleric or politician looking for excuses to stir up anger and throw red meat to his—it is always men—political or religious base. These demagogues are enabled, to some extent, by the relative absence of wide-ranging readers like my friend Ali in the Middle East. Go into a library or bookstore in that part of the world, and you will see just how limited the offerings are.They may not know it, but the people of the Middle East are surrounded by homegrown provocateurs more dangerous than Rushdie. During the years I lived in Baghdad, a book began making the rounds among the country’s shrunken elite: The Personality of Muhammad or the Elucidation of the Holy Enigma, by the Iraqi scholar and poet Maruf al Rusafi. The book presents a demythologized reading of Muhammad’s life and work, arguing that he was a great political and military leader, but nothing more. Rusafi’s book was written in the early 20th century. If it were published today, the author would likely need an army of bodyguards.There are many other examples. The medieval Persian poet Abu Nuwas wrote poems about wine drinking and sex with both men and women; he often invokes Quranic imagery in an ironic way that would seem scandalous today. But no one has issued any fatwas against these writers. A bronze statue of Rusafi has stood unmolested by a bridge in Baghdad for decades, outlasting several wars and invasions. As for Abu Nuwas, he is revered (though not much read) to this day in Iraq. One of Baghdad’s most beloved and beautiful streets, along the Tigris river, is named for him. When Abu Nuwas died in the year 814, the reigning caliph declared “God’s curse on anyone who has insulted him.”[Read: All because Salman Rushdie wrote a book]Soon after I met Ali, one of the deadliest of the blasphemy crises broke out, its trigger a set of cartoons published in Denmark in 2005 that depicted the Prophet Muhammad. We were working in the Baghdad bureau of The New York Times, I as a reporter, and he as a news editor. Ali is an instinctively gentle, kind man—it is one of the first things you notice about him—and he was horrified by the violence of the protests. But he was also upset by the way the controversy was being framed in the Western press. He felt that there was an absolutism about free speech that worsened the problem. I remember him asking me if it wouldn’t be possible to carve out some kind of religious exception to free speech, to avoid conflicts like this one.I got the sense that Ali was groping for a balance between his own Muslim upbringing and the more secular perspectives he’d been exposed to as an adult. It wasn’t easy. The years after the Rushdie fatwa had brought a series of wars and disasters that sharpened the sense of a collision between East and West: the Gulf War of 1990–91, the rise of al-Qaeda, the September 11 attacks, the 2003 invasion of Iraq.In the years after our conversation about the Danish cartoons, Iraq descended into civil war. Ali reluctantly joined the wave of refugees fleeing the country. He was luckier than most; with his superb education and wide network of friends, he reached the United States and got a job teaching at one of the country’s best universities. He was not oblivious to the irony that the collapse of his country had given him a better life—in many respects—than he could have led in Iraq.Ali remained an admirer of Salman Rushdie. About a decade ago, he went to a public reading, and was disappointed to find that the novelist would appear only by video link because of the ongoing danger to his life. During the isolation that came with the pandemic in 2020, Ali told me, he paid for a subscription to an online writing course that featured Rushdie. “I watched him for hours,” he said.Over the years, Ali’s perspective on freedom of speech changed. He came to feel that “words can only be fought with words,” as he told me. He resented the arrogance of religious figures from any culture who value their sensibilities more than human lives. He also felt embarrassed at the way Arab and Islamic publishers censor and bowdlerize their own literary tradition. He told me how he had bought a copy of One Thousand and One Nights, the great medieval folktale collection, during a trip to Mosul with his aunt when he was 9 years old. He didn’t understand the sexual references in the stories, and when he asked his parents, they just smiled and told him to keep reading. Today, Ali said, it would probably be hard to find such an uncensored version in an Arab bookstore. Many contemporary authors who write on sensitive subjects see their books banned.  In a sense, the attempt on Rushdie’s life marked a bookend for Ali. He had first been challenged to think beyond the Islamic orthodoxy of his childhood by reading The Satanic Verses. Now, reading the Arab media’s coverage of the attack, he was sickened and enraged to see some people praising the would-be killer and calling him a hero. The entire 33-year campaign against Rushdie, he felt, was motivated not by genuine religious feeling but by cynical political agendas and sectarian grievances. He had become a full-fledged believer in freedom of speech, and a defender of Rushdie and others like him.But as Ali’s views shifted, he found himself noticing a curious irony: Many of the people around him in the West were moving in the opposite direction. At the university where he now teaches, strenuous efforts are being made to respect students’ beliefs and sensitivities, to avoid offense. Speakers who might upset students are less likely to be invited. The goals are progressive, but the methods feel reminiscent to him of theocrats from the world he thought he had left behind.  “It is strange,” Ali told me. “Nowadays, if you want to criticize Jesus, that’s okay. But if you criticize Muhammad, well—this might be a problem. Because people will say you’re offending the Muslims.”So they will. The same demands for “respect” will come from other believers, sacred or secular. Rushdie’s own insistence on the right to blaspheme has always been ecumenical. “If you’re offended,” he once said, “it’s your problem.”",

        "description": "On the list of perfect pet parents, Mikel Delgado, a professional feline-behavior consultant, probably ranks high. The Ph.D. expert in animal cognition spends half an hour each evening playing with her three torbie cats, Ruby, Coriander, and Professor Scribbles. She’s trained them to take pills in gelatin capsules, just in case they eventually need meds. She even commissioned a screened-in backyard catio so that the girls can safely venture outside. Delgado would do anything for her cats—well, almost anything. “Guilty as charged,” Delgado told me. “I do not brush my cats’ teeth.”To be fair, most cat owners don’t—probably because they’re well aware that it’s weird, if not downright terrifying, to stick one’s fingers inside an ornery cat’s mouth. Reliable stats are scarce, but informal surveys suggest that less than 5 percent of owners give their cats the dental scrub-a-dub-dub—an estimate that the vets I spoke with endorse. “I’m always very shocked if someone says they brush their cat’s teeth,” says Anson Tsugawa, a veterinary dentist in California. When Steve Valeika, a vet in North Carolina, suggests the practice to his clients, many of them “look at me like I’ve totally lost it,” he told me. (This is where I out myself as one of the loons: My cats, Calvin and Hobbes, get their teeth brushed thrice weekly.)There certainly is an element of absurdity to all of this. Lions, after all, aren’t skulking the savannas for Oral-Bs. But our pets don’t share the diets and lifestyles of their wild counterparts, and their teeth are quite susceptible to the buildup of bacteria that can eventually invade the gums to trigger prolonged, painful disease. Studies suggest that most domestic cats older than four end up developing some sort of gum affliction; several experts told me that the rates of periodontal disease in household felines can exceed 80 percent. Left untreated, these ailments can cost a cat one or more teeth, or even spread its effects throughout the body, potentially compromising organs such as the kidneys, liver, and heart.To stave off kitty gum disease, veterinary guidelines and professionals generally recommend that owners clean their cats’ chompers daily, ideally for at least a minute, hitting every tooth. “That’s the gold standard,” says Santiago Peralta, a veterinary dentist at Cornell University. Even a gap of two or three days can leave enough time for tartar to cement, Jeanne Perrone, a veterinary-dentistry trainer in Florida, told me. But brushing feline teeth is also really, really, really hard. Most cats aren’t keen on having things shoved into their mouth, especially not bristly, sludge-covered sticks. (Dogs don’t always love cleanings either, but they’re at least used to engaging their owners with their mouths.) My old cat, Luna, was once so desperate to escape a brushing that she shrieked in my face, then peed all over the floor.[Read: Why we think cats are psychopaths]A niche industry has sprouted to ease the ordeal for hygiene-conscious humans: poultry-flavored toothpastes, cat-size toothbrushes, silicone scrubbers that fit on fingers. Sometimes the gear helps; when Chin-Sun Lee, a New Orleans–based writer, purchased malt-flavored toothpaste for her cat, Tuesday, he went bonkers for the stuff. Every morning, he comes trotting over just so he can lick the brush. Krissy Lyon, a neuroscientist at the Salk Institute, told me that one of her cats, Cocchi, is so crazy for his toothpaste that she and her partner have to “restrain him or lock him in a different room” while they’re brushing the teeth of their other cat, Noma.\r\nTuesday (left) and Calvin (right) getting their teeth brushed. (Courtesy of Chin-Sun Lee and Katherine J. Wu)\r\nBut tasty toothpaste isn’t a sufficient lure for all. Valeika, who extols the virtues of feline oral health, admitted that even his own cat, Boocat, doesn’t reap the benefits of his brushing expertise. He “tried hard-core for a couple weeks” when he adopted her seven years ago. But Boocat was too feisty to stand for such a thing. “She can be a real terror,” Valeika told me. “We once saw her chase a bear out of our yard.”Maybe Boocat is picking up on how odd the whole toothbrushing ritual can be. Even most American people weren’t regularly scrubbing their dentition until around the time of World War II. Vet dentistry, which borrowed principles from its human analogue, “is a relatively new discipline,” Peralta told me. “Thirty years ago, nobody was even thinking about dog or cat teeth.” Nor was it all that long ago that people across the country routinely let their pets sleep outside, eat only table scraps, and run hog wild through the streets. Now pets have become overly pampered, their accessories Gooped. Experts told me that they’ve seen all kinds of snake-oil hacks that purport to functionally replace feline toothbrushing—sprays, gels, toys, water additives, even calls to rub cat teeth with coconut oil. A lot of these products end up just cosmetically whitening teeth, temporarily freshening breath, or accomplishing nothing at all. If a super-simple, once-a-month magic bullet for dental hygiene existed, Tsugawa told me, “we’d be doing it for our own teeth.”There are probably a lot of un-toothbrushed cats out there who could be s-l-o-w-l-y taught to accept the process and maybe even enjoy it. Mary Berg, the president of Beyond the Crown Veterinary Education, told me that one of her colleagues trained her pet to relish the process so much that “she could just say ‘Brusha brusha brusha’ and the cat would come running.” But getting to that point can require weeks or months of conditioning. Berg recommends taking it day by day, introducing cats first to the toothpaste, then to getting one or two teeth touched, and on and on until they’re comfy with the whole set—always “with lots of praise and reward afterward,” she said. And that’s all before “you introduce that scary plastic thing.”[Read: An offbeat approach to bonding with cats]That’s a big ask for many owners, especially those who went the cat route because of the creatures’ rep for being low-maintenance. The consequences of skipping toothbrushing are also subtle because they don’t directly affect humans, Delgado told me. Miss a nail trimming, and the couch might pay the price. But cat teeth aren’t often glimpsed.\r\nBoocat, defender of the realm (Courtesy of Steve Valeika)\r\nThe potential downsides of brushing, meanwhile, can be screamingly clear. On cat forums and Twitter, the cat-toothbrushing-phobic joke about losing their fingers. But what a lot of people are really afraid of sacrificing is their cat’s love. Broken trust can mar the relationship between owner and pet, Perrone said; people simply can’t communicate to skittish animals that this act of apparent torture is for their own good. Some cats never learn to deal. Even among veterinary experts, toothbrushing rituals are rare. Peralta and his wife just try to clear the bar of “at least once a week” with their own cat, Kit Kat; Berg and Perrone don’t brush their felines’ teeth at all. (Tsugawa does not currently own a cat, but he wasn’t a brusher when he did.)I’m no pro, but I feel a bit torn too. I never took the time to teach Calvin and Hobbes to see toothbrushing as a treat, and they can get pretty grumpy during the ritual itself. Valeika, the North Carolina vet, told me that seeing Boocat’s horrified reactions was the main thing that prompted him to quit the brush. “She would hate it if we were always doing that to her,” he said. “She really would just not be our pet anymore.”\r\nFeline-health experts know they’re losing this fight. “A lot of us are not even talking about toothbrushing anymore, because nobody’s doing it,” Berg said. Luckily, a few well-vetted alternatives to toothbrushing do exist. Berg and Delgado use specialty kibble that can cut down on plaque, and Perrone’s cat, Noriko, is into Greenies dental treats—both options that many pets may be more receptive to. Scientifically, nothing beats bona fide brushing. But realistically, this young art may already be obsolete. The best interventions, Delgado told me, will be the ones that people actually use. “If someone in my profession doesn’t brush their pet’s teeth,” Berg said, “I can’t blame anybody else.”",

        "link": "https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2022/08/bed-bath-beyond-stock-wallstreetbets-reddit/671210/?utm_source=feed",
        "description": "Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is a struggling home-goods retailer whose underlying business is so bad that stories about the company carry headlines like “Bed Bath &amp; Beyond’s Big Dilemma: Can It Survive?” But for most of August, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond was also one of the hottest stocks on Wall Street, rising almost 500 percent in a matter of weeks. And that strange divergence happened for just one reason: Meme-stock mania made a sudden and unexpected return.You probably remember meme-stock mania from early 2021, when hordes of retail investors—many of them communicating with one another via social media and Reddit message boards—bought up the stocks of struggling companies such as GameStop, AMC, and, yes, Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, sending them soaring to unimaginable heights. (At its peak, GameStop had gone from little more than $1 to $80 a share.) The frenzy faded and, in the big market sell-off in 2022, interest in these companies waned. But then, as the overall market perked up in July, the interest in meme stocks improbably returned—and for no company was that more true than Bed Bath &amp; Beyond, which is also known on Wall Street by its Nasdaq abbreviation, BBBY.At the end of July, BBBY’s stock was trading at roughly $5 a share. By mid-August, it was heading toward $30 a share. This wasn’t because investors got good news about the company’s business. In fact, all the news about the business has been terrible. Just last week the company hired a restructuring specialist, which suggests that bankruptcy may be in its future.[James Surowiecki: How crypto disappeared into thin air]What happened to drive the stock up? Traders on the Reddit message board r/wallstreetbets started to talk about the stock more in early August, and the share price began to rise day after day. That got more retail investors to buy, driving the price up further. Bed Bath &amp; Beyond is also one of the most heavily shorted stocks on Wall Street, so as the stock rose, some short sellers repurchased shares to cover their bets. That made the stock price rise more, which encouraged yet more retail investors to pile in, which drove up the price, and so on. All through this, retail traders were talking to one another about why it made sense to buy BBBY, and exhorting one another to hold the stock and not sell it, to have, in Reddit-trader parlance, “diamond hands.”What’s mysterious, though, is what got the ball rolling in the first place. Many news stories on the subject mention that a big investor named Ryan Cohen, who had been a key player in GameStop’s rise, had taken a big stake in Bed Bath &amp; Beyond and was agitating for changes. But Cohen revealed that stake in March, so this can’t explain why the stock took off in August.However it may have started, the strategy of piling into BBBY worked great for meme-stock investors. Until it didn’t.Last Wednesday, news broke that Cohen had filed papers with the SEC saying that he planned to divest himself of his entire stake in the company. The next day brought news of another filing, which showed that Cohen had sold all his shares.[Justin Speak: What GameStop has to do with the parable of the rich fool]That broke the fever and sent the stock tumbling. BBBY is now trading below $10 a share, down about 66 percent from this year’s high. And lots of the retail investors who bought on the way up have lost a ton of money.We’ve seen this story before. It’s virtually identical to what happened to GameStop and AMC and, indeed, BBBY itself earlier. But what is still important to note is how bizarre this market behavior is, and how it upends conventional ideas of the way the stock market is supposed to work. In theory, stock prices reflect the collective intelligence of the market, assembled through the independent buy-or-sell decisions of investors, and a company’s stock price represents the market’s best guess as to the true long-term value of its business. So the stock price of a company is not supposed to quadruple on no news. But in the world of meme-stock investing, none of these rules apply.For meme-stock investors, investing is not about evaluating the true worth of a company. Instead, it’s about trying to create a critical mass of transactions to game the system, working with others to orchestrate short squeezes, inflate stock prices, and then, ideally, get out in time.This approach to the stock market has more in common with the stock pools of the early 20th century, when investors would work together to rig stock prices and pump and dump stocks. But whereas those stock pools were run by a small number of investors who usually knew one another, today crowds of small investors are working together virtually to, in their minds, turn a rigged system against itself.In its reliance on conspiratorial thinking, populist sentiment, and convictions that the whole system is corrupt, meme-stock investing is a movement of its time (with obvious overlaps with crypto, anti-vax thinking, and Trumpism). And it has certainly made plenty of people rich. But what Bed Bath &amp; Beyond’s plummet over the past few days underscores is just how fragile and risky meme-stock investing is.",

        "description": "The Twins have signed veteran outfielder Billy Hamilton to a minor league contract, according to multiple reporters (including The Athletic&#8217;s Dan Hayes).  Hamilton elected to become a free agent earlier this month, rejecting an outright assignment to the Marlins&#8217; Triple-A team.\nMinnesota becomes the 11th different big league organization of Hamilton&#8217;s 10-year MLB career, and he has been action at the big league level with seven of those teams.  Hamilton&#8217;s stint in Miami lasted 20 games and consisted of 15 plate appearances, as the Marlins mostly used him as a pinch-runner and late-game defensive replacement.\nIt&#8217;s safe to assume that Hamilton will be utilized in similar fashion with the Twins if he reaches their active roster, and the 31-year-old will at least provide some center field depth now that Byron Buxton has been placed on the 10-day injured list.  Hamilton&#8217;s lack of hitting has turned him into a bench player in recent years, but he still brings plenty of his signature speed and excellent defense, making him a sought-after player by multiple teams.\nOutfelders Buxton, Kyle Garlick, Trevor Larnach, Alex Kirilloff, and Royce Lewis are all on Minnesota&#8217;s IL, with Garlick perhaps only a few days away from a return and Kirilloff and Lewis both already done for the season.  Max Kepler, Nick Gordon, Jake Cave, Gilberto Celestino, and utilityman Tim Beckham comprise the Twins&#8217; outfield options on the active roster.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA team of researchers has developed a contact lens that can collect tear samples from the eyes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn a laboratory setting, the lens detected compounds that could potentially indicate the presence of cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe breakthrough could help with early diagnosis, an important factor in fighting cancer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA team of researchers may have found a way to detect cancer through a pair of special contact lenses – a medical breakthrough that could help with early diagnosis.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn the U.S., there were more than 1.7 million new cancer cases reported in 2019, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention. The same year, nearly 600,000 people died from cancer. Early diagnosis could help patients get the treatment they need before the cancer progresses to a severe stage – and that could soon come in the form of contact lenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a paper published in Advanced Functional Materials, scientists describe how they made a contact lens with built-in microchambers that collect tears and other fluids. The samples are then analyzed for exosomes, secreted by cells that can be indicators for diseases like cancer. If exosomes are present, they bind to specific antibodies embedded in the contact lens and turn the area red.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe team tested the lens in various liquid solutions, including cell cultures and human tears. They found that the lenses can consistently detect exosomes. The technology can also differentiate exosome surface proteins that are thought to be cancer biomarkers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExosomes can be found throughout the body, but other common tests like blood and saliva tests may contain components that could complicate detection. Other areas of cancer research focus on exosomes in blood samples, which may not necessarily be transferrable to studying exosomes in tears.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis high-tech contact lens could be a simpler way to look for exosomes related to cancer and other diseases. It has the potential to be faster and less invasive for patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is pretty exciting compared to the other current techniques in this field,” says study author Yangzhi Zhu, who is a biomedical engineer at the Terasaki Institute for Biomedical Innovation, to Inverse.&nbsp;",

        "description": "President Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke Thursday about a new $3 billion security assistance package for Ukraine, and the two leaders also demanded Russia relinquish control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, according to the White House. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe phone call took place a day after the White House announced the $2.98 billion assistance package for Ukraine, dovetailing with the country’s Independence Day. The package is the latest tranche of support to help Kyiv fight off the continuing Russian attack.  \n\n\n\nBiden “congratulated Ukraine on its Independence Day and expressed his admiration for the people of Ukraine, who have inspired the world as they defended their country’s sovereignty over the past six months,” according to a White House readout of the phone call.  \n\n\n\n“The two leaders also called for Russia to return full control of the&nbsp;Zaporizhzhya&nbsp;Nuclear Power Plant to Ukraine and for International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to the plant,” the readout said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRussia has controlled the Zaporizhzhya plant since early on in the war. But fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces has intensified around the nuclear plant, raising concerns about the potential for a disastrous mishap.  \n\n\n\nThe plant, which is the largest in Europe, was temporarily disconnected from the power grid on Thursday as a result of fires that broke out around lines connecting it to the grid. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nInternational inspectors from the IAEA are seeking access to the plant. \n\n\n\nEarlier Thursday, French President Emmanuel Macron met with IAEA Director General Rafael Grossi and reiterated support for sending agency experts to the plant “as quickly as possible,” according to a readout from the Elysée. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a tweet, Zelensky said that he thanked Biden on Thursday for the “unwavering” U.S. security and financial support for Ukraine amid the Russian war, which passed the six-month mark on Wednesday. He did not specifically mention the Zaporizhzhya&nbsp;plant. &nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We discussed Ukraine’s further steps on our path to the victory over the aggressor and importance of holding Russia accountable for war crimes,” Zelensky said. &nbsp;",

        "description": "Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg got a first-hand look at a $12 million project to improve a busy corridor on Lake Street in Minneapolis that&#x27;s adding new turn lanes, bus only lanes, and upgrades to accommodate people with disabilities.&quot;They are building for the future,” Buttigieg said of the program funded by the $1 trillion infrastructure funding package signed into law by President Joe Biden last year.“Better transit is a great example of what we can do with these funds,” Buttigieg said. “I just want to make clear these investments are a direct result of the advocacy and the support of the senators from Minnesota and so many House members and of course, the leadership of the president of the United States.”Buttigieg has been to several states this week to promote Biden administration spending initiatives, including the Inflation Reduction Act, which was enacted last week without any Republican support.Minnesota Republicans were critical of what they called Buttigieg’s “photo-ops.”“Inflation is crippling our economy, crime is out of control, and the Democrats just passed yet another massive tax-and-spend spree that will only make these problems worse,” said Republican Party of Minnesota spokesperson Nick Majerus. “Gov. Tim Walz’s allies in the Biden Administration can try to prop him up all they want, but Minnesotans know they are less safe and prosperous thanks to the Democrats’ failed policies.”During a stop at the Minnesota State Fair, Buttigieg said Democrats need to make Americans more aware of the importance of recent government investments. &quot;We don&#x27;t have any trouble getting people to agree that these investments are good investments,” Buttigieg said. “The bigger challenge, I think, is just making sure that people see just how much we&#x27;re doing and how much benefit it&#x27;s bringing.”",

        "link": "https://chromeunboxed.com/google-sheets-named-functions",
        "description": "The Google Workspace blog announced a new Sheets feature that allows you to create custom functions that can be reused across files. The functionality, called &#8220;Named Functions,&#8221; is similar to Named Ranges in which you can select a specific range of cells and give them a unique name to reference them by in a formula.\n\n\n\nNamed functions can be imported from existing Sheets files, allowing for more flexibility when using complex formulas and ultimately simplifying the process. The feature builds upon the recent intelligent corrections and formula suggestions enhancements in Google Sheets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create a new Named Functions in Sheets, go to Data &gt; Named functions &gt; Add new function &gt; enter details &gt; Next &gt; Create. Once the custom function has been created, you can then enter it into a Sheet&#8217;s cell to use it. Note that Named Functions that are created in a file are available only within that file and will need to be imported into the new file in order to use it. You can do this by selecting Data &gt; Named functions &gt; import function &gt; and picking the function you want. In addition, the below new formulas are now available in Sheets to make your formulas even more powerful:\n\n\n\n&#x2022; LAMBDA: Creates and returns a custom function, given a set of names and a formula_expression which uses them. The formula_expression can be calculated by calling the returned function with as many values as the names declared.&#x2022; Lambda Helper Functions &#8211; MAP, REDUCE, BYROW, BYCOL, SCAN, MAKEARRAY: Advanced array-operating functions which accept a reusable lambda as an argument along with an input array(s).&#x2022; XLOOKUP: Returns the values in the result range based on the position where a match was found in the lookup range. If no match is found, it returns the closest match.&#x2022; XMATCH: Returns the relative position of an item in an array or range that matches a specified value. XMATCH supports enhanced match and search functionality and allows wildcard matches with a question mark (?) or asterisk (*).\n\n\n\nThese changes will have no Admin impact and began rolling out yesterday, August 24th. Rapid and Scheduled Release domains will start to see the new feature show up gradually for up to two weeks. The below Google Workspace tiers are eligible:\n\n\n\nAvailability&#x2022; Available to: Google Workspace Essentials, Business Starter, Business Standard, Business Plus, Enterprise Essentials, Enterprise Standard, Enterprise Plus, Education Fundamentals, Education Plus customers, and users with personal Google Accounts&#x2022; Not available to: Frontline, Nonprofits, as well as legacy G Suite Basic and Business customers\n\n\n\nIt&#8217;s great to see these new features being made available to users with personal accounts, not just corporate users. I can see myself using Named Functions if I&#8217;m reusing the same formula repeatedly, even for simple Sheets like a budget or an invoice. I hope this is a trend that continues.\n\n\n\n\nNewsletter Signup\n\n\n\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\nEach New Post\nDeals\nDaily Digest\nWeekly Digest\nGaming\nPromos &amp; Giveaways",

        "description": "Red Sox left-hander James Paxton has been diagnosed with a Grade 2 tear in his left lat muscle and will be shut down for the season, manager Alex Cora informed reporters (including Pete Abraham of the Boston Globe). It&#8217;ll go down as a completely lost season for the left-hander, who hasn&#8217;t pitched in a big league game since April 2021.\nPaxton has dealt with numerous injuries throughout his career. He&#8217;s spent time on the IL in every year since 2014, including an extended absence for a left lat strain that season. Paxton has also been plagued by hand, forearm, chest, knee and elbow concerns. The arm injuries, in particular, have proven problematic over the past few years. The southpaw missed most of the shortened 2020 campaign trying to rehab from a flexor strain in his forearm. While he avoided undergoing surgery at the time, he blew out in the second inning of his first start the following year and required Tommy John surgery.\nThat procedure ended Paxton&#8217;s reunion tour with the Mariners last year before it got far off the ground, but the Red Sox nevertheless signed him to a $10MM guarantee this past offseason. That rather complex arrangement paid him a $6MM salary for this season and contained a pair of successive $13MM club options &#8212; essentially a two-year, $26MM deal &#8212; for the Sox to decide upon in conjunction this winter. If the team declines the options, Paxton would receive a $4MM player option for 2023 alone.\nOn the heels of a third straight injury-wrecked season, there&#8217;s essentially no chance the Red Sox commit $13MM salaries for the upcoming two years. It seems likely that Paxton will accept his $4MM option, although there&#8217;s at least a small possibility he foregoes that figure in search of an incentive-laden pact on the open market. If Paxton declines the player option, the Sox would&#8217;ve committed him $6MM for no return on their investment.\nThat&#8217;s not to say it was an entirely illogical bet for chief baseball officer Chaim Bloom and his staff to take last winter. At the time of Paxton&#8217;s signing in December, the club anticipated he&#8217;d contribute for the second half and a possible playoff push. Despite a minor delay as he dealt with elbow soreness in May, he indeed seemed on track to get on the mound for the season&#8217;s final month. Paxton had ramped up a throwing program and begun a rehab assignment last Thursday, but he faced just two batters before suffering the lat injury.\nIt has now been three years since Paxton was healthy, but he was an effective starter for the Yankees during his last extended stretch of action. He made 29 appearances in 2019, tossing 150 2/3 frames with a 3.82 ERA and an excellent 29.4% strikeout rate. A trio of teams (New York, Seattle and Boston) have taken successive shots to see if he can replicate that well above-average production in the years since then, but the series of injuries has unfortunately kept that from happening.\nBoston is facing a fair bit of potential turnover in the rotation this offseason. Paxton has the aforementioned dual team/player options, while Nathan Eovaldi, Michael Wacha and Rich Hill will all be free agents. Chris Sale is under contract through 2024 but coming off another injury-plagued season of his own. Aside from Nick Pivetta &#8212; whose 4.24 ERA this season is a career-low &#8212; there isn&#8217;t much rotation certainty moving forward. Bloom and his staff will have their work cut out for them in overhauling much of that group, regardless of whether Paxton elects to return.",

        "description": "Reigning NL MVP Bryce Harper will return to the Phillies&#8217; active roster prior to their game with the Pirates on Friday, Philadelphia manager Rob Thomson told reporters (including MLB.com&#8217;s Todd Zelecki).  The initial plan for Harper&#8217;s minor league rehab assignment planned for activation from the 60-day injured list on Monday, but Harper will instead return a bit earlier, as suggested by MLB Network&#8217;s Jon Morosi earlier today.\nThe Phillies first placed Harper on the 10-day IL due to his fractured left thumb back on June 26, so he&#8217;ll end up missing only slightly beyond the 60-day minimum.  Harper has been making steady progress with his recovery ever since undergoing thumb surgery, and he will now again get to contribute to a Phillies team that has become one of baseball&#8217;s hottest teams.\nThe firing of Joe Girardi and Thomson&#8217;s installation as interim manager was the obvious turning point in Philadelphia&#8217;s season, as the Phils went 22-29 under Girardi and are currently 47-26 under Thomson.  Not even losing one of the sport&#8217;s best hitters slowed down the Phillies, since they have a 31-20 record since Harper was sidelined.\nHarper&#8217;s thumb was broken by a Blake Snell pitch on June 25, interrupting an unusual but still highly successful season for the 29-year-old.  Due to a small UCL tear in his right elbow, Harper hasn&#8217;t played a game in the field since April 16, but his bat hasn&#8217;t been impacted by his new role as a full-time DH.  Harper has 21 home runs and a .318/.385/.599 slash line over his first 275 plate appearances, with that .985 OPS standing as the fourth-highest of Harper&#8217;s career.\n2022 will go down as another Harper season cut short by injury, but that will be a footnote if he is able to help the Phillies reach their first postseason since 2011.  Philadelphia holds the second NL wild card slot, well back of the Braves for the first wild card but with a 3.5-game cushion over the Brewers (the top team outside the playoff picture).",

(AP Photo/John Bazemore, File)\n\n\n\nWelcome to The Hill’s Campaign Report, tracking all things related to the 2022 midterm elections. You can expect this newsletter in your inbox every Tuesday and Thursday leading up to November's election.   \n\n\n\nEmail us tips and feedback: Max Greenwood (mgreenwood@thehill.com), Julia Manchester (jmanchester@thehill.com), and Caroline Vakil (cvakil@thehill.com).&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSomeone forward this newsletter to you? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\nPrimaries give way to a general election sprint\n\n\n\nThe 2022 midterm campaign sprint is just beginning.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;primaries in New York and Florida&nbsp;this week were among the last of the year’s big nominating contests. While there are a handful of primaries left —&nbsp;including in New Hampshire, where Republican voters will choose their nominee to take on Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.) —&nbsp;the general election matchups are mostly set.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo recap the primaries,&nbsp;Republicans&nbsp;saw high-profile, and often bitter, matchups between former President Trump’s endorsed candidates and other hopefuls, some of whom cast themselves as Trump loyalists and others who hewed more toward traditional conservatism. In the end, Trump’s candidates mostly came out on top. In the Senate primaries in Ohio, Pennsylvania, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada, GOP voters sided with the former president and handed his endorsees the nominations.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump’s influence over Republican voters was also on display in races where GOP members of Congress who voted last year to impeach him were seeking renomination. Of the six who did not retire and sought reelection this year, only two survived their primaries. In one of the most notable races, Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), one of Trump’s most ardent Republican critics,&nbsp;lost in a landslide&nbsp;to Harriet Hageman, whom the former president endorsed last fall.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDemocrats, meanwhile, saw an easier path through primary season, especially in key Senate races. In Ohio, Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) largely coasted through his nominating contest. The same was in North Carolina and Florida. Still, it wasn’t all easy for Democrats. The party saw debates between its left and center over which candidates were best suited to win in November, while there are still questions about just how closely Democratic hopefuls should tie themselves to President Biden.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat’s next?&nbsp;Expect a brutal and expensive general election campaign season. Republicans need to pick up only five seats in the House and just one in the Senate to recapture control of Congress, and they believe that they have the political winds at their backs.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Democrats are also heading into the fall more hopeful than they were just a couple months ago that the November elections won’t be an absolute wipeout. The party is starting to get optimistic about keeping the Senate, benefiting from solid recruits that are outraising their Republican rivals in key swing states.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd while holding the House this year is still unlikely for Democrats, a series of strong special election performances in recent weeks has buoyed the party’s hopes that the political tides may be turning in their favor. \n\n\n\nStudent debt plan a curveball for vulnerable Dems\n\n\n\nBiden’s announcement on Wednesday that the government would forgive $10,000 in student loans for borrowers making less than $125,000 a year — and $20,000 for Pell Grant recipients — spurred largely predictable reactions from progressive Democrats and Republicans.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRepublican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called the move “Biden’s bailout for the wealthy.” Progressives praised the move but some said the forgiveness wasn’t enough. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Biden’s latest move on student loan debt forgiveness could put one group in an awkward position: vulnerable Democrats, who need to appeal to both voters thrilled with the loan relief and those concerned about its effects on inflation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Campaign Committee (NRCC) sought to tie Democratic Virginia Reps. Abigail Spanberger, Elaine Luria and Jennifer Wexton to the administration’s move.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Will Elaine Luria, Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton condemn this irresponsible plan that will make inflation even worse?” an NRCC press release asked.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill caught up with Spanberger on Tuesday shortly after news of Biden’s impending broke.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“One of the things I think we need to be talking about is the overall expense related to higher education,” Spanberger said. “While there’s many opinions about loan forgiveness, how much it should be, how much it shouldn’t be, minimums, maximums, all of the rest, the bottom line is that we continue to see education prices go up year by year at really exorbitant rates.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOther center left Democrats have echoed this sentiment, arguing that the message needs to be about tackling education institution’s role in the cost of higher education.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The Biden administration is taking this action, it’s not being voted on by the front-liners who have to win in these districts,” said Lanae Erickson, senior vice president for social policy, education, and politics at the center left think tank Third Way. “But they can talk about the fact that this has to be the beginning, not the end, and that we need to reform our higher education system so we’re not back here again in five years because this cannot be an every five years problem.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Julia Manchester has more on how Democrats facing tough reelection bids are reacting to news of Biden’s announcement.  \n\n\n\nPOLL WATCH\n\n\n\nA new Emerson College Polling survey out on Thursday shows Pennsylvania Senate candidate John Fetterman holding a 4 percentage point leader over Republican challenger Mehmet Oz. In the survey, 48 percent of Pennsylvania voters polled said they would vote for Fetterman compared to 44 percent for Oz. When asked about whom voters would back for governor in the state, 47 percent said Democratic candidate Josh Shapiro compared to 44 percent for Republican Doug Mastriano. The latter polling falls within the margin of error, which is plus or minus 3 percentage points. \n\n\n\nAD WATCH\n\n\n\nTexas gubernatorial candidate Beto O’Rourke is seizing on the issue of abortion in his first TV ads and targeting his opponent Gov. Greg Abbot (R) over the issue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“From this day forward, August 25th, women all across Texas are no longer free to make decisions about our own body. No longer free to choose if a pregnancy is right for us. Or our families,” different women through the campaign TV narrate in&nbsp;one of the ads. “Not even in cases of rape or incest. And women will die because of it. All because of Greg Abbott’s abortion law. It’s too extreme. So I’m voting for Beto, who will give women our freedom back.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ad comes on the same day that Texas abortion ban becomes effective in the state and on the heels of a recent special election in New York’s 19th Congressional District. Democratic candidate Pat Ryan, who focused more on abortion, won against Republican Marc Molinaro, who honed in on the economy. The special election has been viewed as a bellwether of Democrats’ performance ahead of November and how the issue of abortion resonates with voters over issues like inflation or the economy.  \n\n\n\nOP-EDS FROM THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL\n\n\n\nDemocrats are on a roll: Here’s how to ride the wave to November, by political strategist Donna BrazileThe media myth of Democratic momentum, by Hill columnist Joe Concha\n\n\n\nThat’s it for today.

But just protecting that information alone at this stage is really important, because they haven't made a decision as to whether to charge this case or not. And so you need to protect that person in case they're going to be a witness in a grand jury, and then maybe ultimately at a trial,” McQuade said in an interview ahead of the decision from Reinhart.\n\n\n\n“But the other reason is search warrant affidavits are not disclosed at this stage. And if it happens in this case, then in the future, other targets are going to point to this and say, ‘I want my search warrant affidavit unsealed too.’ And it is in the long run going to have an adverse impact on the way the Justice Department and the FBI conduct investigations. If you think that your affidavit is going to get turned over, witnesses are not going to cooperate.”\n\n\n\nTrump did not oppose the release of the warrant and has called for the release of the affidavit, all the while slamming the probe as a political witch hunt.\n\n\n\nHe’s separately filed a suit seeking to block the FBI probe while asking the court to appoint a third party that would review all evidence collected during the search.\n\n\n\nUpdated at 4:27 p.m.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/energy-environment/3615803-next-up-bidens-energy-crisis/",
        "description": "We’ve had Biden’s inflation and Biden’s recession; now we face Biden’s energy crisis. It didn’t have to be this way.\n\n\n\nTwenty million Americans are behind on their utility bills, according to the National Energy Assistance Directors Association.\n\n\n\nWho is surprised? Even as real wages tumbled 3.6 percent over the past year, electricity prices increased 16 percent, squeezing consumers. Unhappily, things are about to get worse.\n\n\n\nNatural gas, used to create power and to heat almost half of America’s homes, is trading at prices nearly double those of last year, and the winter heating season promises to bring even higher prices.\n\n\n\nThe price of natural gas today is the highest since 2008, before the fracking revolution unleashed almost unlimited gas deposits trapped in tight formations that were previously inaccessible. \n\n\n\nWhy should the United States suffer a giant increase in costs if we have so much gas? In part, because President Biden pledged this year to double our exports of liquified natural gas (LNG), which means less natural gas available to American consumers.\n\n\n\nBiden made that grand gesture to help our allies, who are increasingly cut off from Russian oil and gas because of the war in Ukraine. But he made that promise to send more U.S. natural gas overseas even though the price was already soaring and inventories were low.\n\n\n\nBiden apparently did not discuss the plan with industry leaders, who were caught off guard by the announcement. One executive was quoted in the New York Times saying, “I have no idea how they are going to do this…”\n\n\n\nIt’s unlikely Biden does either. We are not shocked. The Biden White House has virtually no real-world, private-sector experience or expertise. It imagines that creating new energy resources can be done overnight, by waving a magic wand.\n\n\n\nThe truth is, we have at least a 100 years’ supply of natural gas; tragically, we do not have the political will to produce it. Climate ideologues, including those directing policy in the Biden White House, are bent on prematurely and recklessly standing in the way of drilling and producing the oil and natural gas we need even as we transition to renewable fuels.\n\n\n\nThe White House has slow-walked oil and gas leasing and the approval of drilling permits. In addition, it is leaning on banks, pressuring them not to lend to fossil fuel suppliers and pressuring investment firms not to buy their stocks.\n\n\n\nIt is madness. While Biden is happy to beg Saudi Arabia for more oil, he refuses to meet with energy producers here at home to discuss what it would take to bring on extra production.\n\n\n\nInstead, he blames high gasoline prices (and will soon blame high natural gas prices) on a greedy industry, or on Russian President Vladimir Putin; he’ll do anything but admit that his policies have helped drive energy prices sky-high.\n\n\n\nBiden takes credit for driving down gasoline prices, and it is true that releasing 1 million barrels of oil per day from our Strategic Petroleum Reserve has helped. But the real reason that gasoline prices have come down in recent weeks is that demand from two key markets has fallen. China’s economy is faltering and oil imports into that country have tumbled to the lowest level in four years. China is the world’s biggest importer of oil, which is a global commodity. When demand falls there or anywhere in the world, the price comes down.\n\n\n\nDemand has also dropped here in the U.S. As the price of gasoline soared to an all-time high above $5 per gallon, families canceled their summer road trips and stayed home. The White House insists we are not in recession, but when the economy is contracting and demand for basics like gasoline declines, it sure smells like a recession.\n\n\n\nNow we are at that time of year when attention shifts from gasoline to natural gas. Demand for natural gas will climb as we approach the winter months; prices, already at 14-year highs, will climb too.\n\n\n\nDemand and supply are out of balance because the industry has backed off drilling in the wake of hostility from the White House, for sure, but also because of misguided efforts in various states to ban fracking and block pipeline construction. It’s all about appeasing the climate warriors.\n\n\n\nIn 2014, then-Gov. Andrew Cuomo proudly banned fracking in New York State, to the applause of liberal media outlets like the New York Times, which acknowledged that the state has “significant” natural gas resources trapped in the Marcellus Shale formation.\n\n\n\nThe Times noted the move contradicted Cuomo’s pledge to help economically-depressed upstate regions, where those resources lie, but would “help repair his ties to his party’s left wing.”\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, New Yorkers in counties near the border with Pennsylvania were deprived of the income and jobs from the fracking boom that allowed their neighbors to thrive.\n\n\n\nCuomo didn’t just ban fracking. In 2016 he also blocked construction of a key pipeline meant to deliver natural gas to several existing pipelines in New England. Consequently, other local gas projects were dropped. The upshot was that on a cold day this past January, the New England grid was obtaining 20 percent of its electricity from oil and coal, which typically contribute less than 1 percent of the region’s power.\n\n\n\nThese dirtier fuels were dragged into service because New England’s natural gas system was operating at less than 30 percent of available capacity. The region cannot access gas elsewhere in the country, thanks to a shortage of pipeline capacity.\n\n\n\nRemember that using natural gas creates only about half the emissions of competing oil; it is a relatively climate-friendly fuel that has helped the United States lower carbon emissions more than any other developed country. Ergo, blocking the use of natural gas is harming the environment, not helping it.\n\n\n\nDemocrats, including Joe Biden, risk everything for meaningless climate gestures like blocking pipelines and preventing oil and gas drilling. This winter, as utility bills go through the roof, American consumers will pay the price.  \n\n\n\nLiz Peek is a former partner of major bracket Wall Street firm Wertheim &amp; Company.

        "description": "By Leo Babauta\n\n\n\nYou might know that I’m a fan of simplicity and minimalism — but for me, it’s not just about having less stuff or even doing less.\n\n\n\nFor me, it’s a way of moving through the world with lightness. Not lightly tiptoeing around trying not to make an impact, but with lightness in my heart.\n\n\n\nMoving lightly through life is like hiking up a mountain not weighed down by burden, but with a spring in your step. It’s the feeling of joy of facing a brand new day, instead of the heaviness we might feel if we’re dreading things.\n\n\n\nMoving lightly is taking on your work with a feeling of empowerment and peace. It’s the leap in your heart when you reconnect with a friend who you love.\n\n\n\nIt’s how a child romps around in a field of flowers, or splashes triumphantly in a mud puddle.\n\n\n\nWe pile our worries and complaints on top of ourselves until we’re weighed down.\n\n\n\nWe avoid and procrastinate, or push ourselves to do stuff we don’t want to do, and carry the weight of all of that. We try to create systems of control, ways to manage the chaos of life, so that we don’t have to step into the unknown.\n\n\n\nWhat if we let go of all of that, and simply moved through life with an open heart? With a feeling of play, of joy, of being willing to splash in the mud and make a mess? With a feeling of wonder at the abundance of life?\n\n\n\nWhat would be different if you did your work this way? If you connected with others, collaborated with others, loved others, in this way?\n\n\n\nWhat would it be like to romp through your day in this lighthearted way?\n\n\n\n&#8212;\n\n\n\nBy the way, I am hosting a 2-call workshop next week (Aug. 30 &amp; Sept. 2) called the Freedom of Lightweight Adventure &#8230; in this workshop, I&#8217;ll be talking about:\n\n\n\nHow to travel light&nbsp;The best gear for traveling light&nbsp;&nbsp;Tips for working while traveling while staying focused and free of stressHow to create organized but fun adventures with your family and friends while traveling\n\n\n\nYou can ask questions of me and a guest expert (my good friend Tynan, on Sept. 2), basically anything you want to ask me!\n\n\n\nCheck it out &amp; sign up here: The Freedom of Lightweight Adventure\nThe post Moving Lightly Through the World appeared first on zen habits.",

        "description": "Enlarge / Scientists have found that tattoo ink ingredient labels are often inaccurate, and some inks contain nanoscale particles that could harm human cells. (credit: Kymberlie Dozois Photography/Getty Images)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScientists at Binghamton University (State University of New York) have analyzed nearly 100 different tattoo inks and found that the manufacturers' ingredient labels (when used) are often inaccurate and that many inks contain small particles at the nanoscale that could be harmful to human cells. They presented their findings at this week's meeting of the American Chemical Society (ACS) in Chicago.\nAccording to principal investigator John Swierk, a chemist at Binghamton, the project initially started when his group became interested in tattoos as tools for medical diagnostics. This shifted to an interest in tattoo laser removal, specifically how laser light causes tattoos to fade. \"We realized we didn't understand a lot about the interaction between light and tattoos,\" Swierk said during a press briefing at the ACS meeting. \"My group studies how light can drive chemical reactions, so it was a natural fit.\"\nThat meant learning more about the chemical composition of tattoo inks, which is also not well understood. One reason for this significant gap in scientific understanding is that in the US, at least, manufacturers of tattoo inks aren't required to disclose the ingredients, and even when they do, there is no real oversight of whether those disclosures are correct, per Swierk.Read 7 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "A judge on Thursday ordered the Justice Department to make public a redacted version of the affidavit it relied on when federal agents searched the Florida estate of former President Donald Trump to look for classified documents.The directive from U.S. Magistrate Judge Bruce Reinhart came hours after federal law enforcement submitted under seal the portions of the affidavit that they want to keep secret as their investigation moves forward.The judge said the department must file its redacted version by noon Friday. The redactions proposed by the department are likely to be extensive, so it&#x27;s not clear how much new information about the investigation will be revealed.Reinhart had given the department until Thursday at noon to propose to him the redactions to the affidavit it wanted to make before any portion of it was released to the public. But he acknowledged Monday that it was possible that the redactions, or blacked-out portions, would be so extensive as to leave the public version of the document without any meaningful information.The affidavit is likely to contain key information about the FBI&#x27;s basis for executing a search warrant at Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach on Aug. 8. Documents already made public as part of the investigation show that the FBI retrieved from the property 11 sets of classified documents, including information marked at the top secret level.The documents also showed that the FBI was investigating the “willful retention of national defense information,” the concealment or removal of government records and obstruction of a federal investigation.Multiple news media organizations, including The Associated Press, argued in court last week for the disclosure of the affidavit, citing the extraordinary public interest in the federal search of a former president&#x27;s home. Trump and some of his supporters have also encouraged the document&#x27;s release.The media coalition responded to Thursday&#x27;s filing by asking the judge to unseal portions of the department&#x27;s brief and to direct the government, “going forward,&quot; to file publicly a redacted version of any sealed document it submits. The groups noted that significant information about the investigation is already public.“At a minimum, any portions of the Brief that recite those facts about the investigation, without revealing additional ones not yet publicly available — in addition to any other portions that pose no threat to the investigation — should be unsealed,” the news organizations wrote.They added, “If and when additional facts come to light and are confirmed to be accurate, or certain facts no longer pose a threat to the investigation for any other reason, there is no justification for maintaining them under seal either.”The Justice Department has opposed the release, saying the disclosure risks compromising an ongoing criminal investigation, revealing information about witnesses and divulging investigative techniques.Reinhart has said that though he was sensitive to the department&#x27;s concerns, he was not inclined to keep the entire document sealed and directed officials to submit to him redactions of the document reflecting the information it wants to keep secret.",

        "description": "LONDON — Liz Truss said “the jury is out” on whether French President Emmanuel Macron is Britain’s “friend or foe” at a Conservative leadership campaign event Thursday.\n\n\n\nThe hot favorite to become Britain’s new prime minister next month vowed to judge Macron by his “deeds not words” in her cross-Channel dealings as leader.\n\n\n\nHer comments will only add further tensions to the stormy Anglo-French relationship, which has suffered badly since Britain voted to leave the EU in 2016.\n\n\n\nMacron has endured a difficult relationship with the current outgoing U.K. prime minister, Boris Johnson, while Truss has been heavily criticized in EU capitals for her plans to rewrite parts of the Brexit divorce deal related to trade in Northern Ireland.\n\n\n\nAsked directly at a hustings event in Norfolk, England Thursday evening whether Macron was &#8220;friend or foe,&#8221; Truss replied: &#8220;The jury is out. But if I become PM, I&#8217;ll hold him to deeds not words.&#8221;\n\n\n\nTruss’ leadership rival, former U.K. Chancellor Rishi Sunak, described Macron as a “friend.”\n\n\n\nTruss is widely expected to win the Conservative leadership contest when the result is announced on September 5, becoming the U.K.’s third female prime minister the following day.",

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA federal court on Thursday upheld an injunction that has blocked the enforcement of an Arkansas law banning gender-affirming care for minors for more than a year.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in its ruling said the lower district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing the injunction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA judge in October will decide whether to permanently block the law, which prohibits doctors in the state from providing treatments like puberty blockers and hormones to patients under 18.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA federal court has upheld an injunction temporarily blocking an Arkansas law banning gender-affirming health care for transgender youth under 18, ruling that a lower court did not abuse its power in granting the injunction.\n\n\n\nThe 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday ruled the preliminary injunction that has blocked the enforcement of Arkansas’ “Save Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act” for more than a year will remain in place until an ongoing legal battle over its constitutionality is settled.\n\n\n\nThe measure, passed by the legislature in March 2021, prohibits doctors in the state from providing or recommending gender-affirming medical care including puberty blockers and hormones to minors. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) vetoed the bill, also referred to as Act 626, last year, calling it a \"vast government overreach.”\n\n\n\nState lawmakers introduced the measure last February, arguing that Arkansas has a “compelling government interest in protecting the health and safety of its citizens, especially vulnerable children.”\n\n\n\nHutchinson’s veto was quickly overridden by the legislature, but the law was blocked by a district court judge before it could take effect. Lawyers for the state appealed that decision, arguing that District Court Judge James M. Moody Jr. had abused the court’s discretion in issuing the injunction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, the higher court ruled the judge had not. The court also affirmed arguments made by plaintiffs in the case that transgender youth will suffer “irreparable harm” absent a preliminary injunction and enforcing the law would prohibit “medical treatment that conforms with the recognized standard of care.”\n\n\n\n“The district court did not err in concluding Act 626 is not substantially related to Arkansas’s interests in protecting children from experimental medical treatment and regulating medical ethics,” Thursday’s ruling states.\n\n\n\nThe decision stems from a 2021 lawsuit filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of four transgender minors, their parents and two Arkansas physicians who argued the law violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment and discriminates on the basis of sex.\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department echoed that argument in a statement of interest in the case last year, claiming that Arkansas was discriminating against transgender youth by prohibiting them from accessing “medically necessary care.”\n\n\n\nA trial has been set for October, where a judge will decide whether to permanently block the law.\n\n\n\nDuring oral arguments in June, Chase Strangio, deputy director for Transgender Justice at the ACLU’s LGBTQ &amp; HIV Project, said lifting the injunction would create unnecessary anxiety and uncertainty for families with transgender children.\n\n\n\n“People are relying on this treatment,” he said at the time. “Because of the injunction, the plaintiffs have been able to receive the medical care that they need. If the injunction were lifted now, the families would have to leave their homes, their communities, their jobs, and travel to another state, just to potentially return at a point when the final order would be issued.”\n\n\n\nStrangio also referenced testimony from Michele Hutchinson, a doctor who’s a plaintiff in the case, that multiple transgender youth had attempted suicide following the passage of Act 626 in the House.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, Holly Dickson, the ACLU of Arkansas’ executive director, said the court’s ruling to uphold the injunction affirms that “no child should be denied medical care they need.”\n\n\n\n“We are relieved for trans youth,” she said in a statement. “Transgender people deserve the right to live healthy lives without fear and discrimination. It’s time for the Arkansas Legislature to protect trans kids, not target them.”\n\n\n\nRepublican Attorney General Leslie Rutledge, one of the defendants in the case, will ask the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals to review the ruling, spokesperson Amanda Priest said Thursday.\n\n\n\n“The Attorney General is extremely disappointed in today’s dangerously wrong decision,” she said.\n\n\n\nMajor medical organizations including the American Medical Association and American Academy of Pediatrics say they support access to gender-affirming health care for transgender young people.",

        "description": "To help central IT teams develop digital skills and get excited to learn new technology, Google Cloud created a free training competition, the Cloud Hero Cup. Designed to help teams learn new technology, the Cloud Hero Cup is a gamified learning competition between university IT teams that uses Google Cloud Skills Boost to test and expand their knowledge of Google Cloud . By the end, IT professionals learn valuable Google Cloud skills that can help institutions improve their cloud environment, support the needs of their faculty, and better serve their learners.   Upskilling to Help Institutions on their Digital Journey  Central IT teams, including CTOs, are looking to better understand the technological shifts that come with a digital journey, such as moving to cloud computing, harnessing data, and using predictive analytics. In addition, many teams are exploring how machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) can be leveraged to help automate tasks associated with core institutional priorities like management decisions, personalized admissions, student support, research and scholarships. To boost their cloud computing skills, a Google Cloud authorized training partner delivers the three-hour session and begins with a brief presentation, followed by a cross-university competition that leverages hands-on labs in Google Cloud Skills Boost. At the conclusion of the event, the winning team is presented with the “Cloud Hero Cup,” which moves from winning school to winning school. Every participant receives 30 days of free access to Google Cloud Skills Boost to complete the associated Google Cloud Skill badge and other Google Cloud training. Skill badges are shareable credentials that recognize your ability to solve real-world problems with cloud knowledge. Inaugural Cloud Hero Cup CompetitionOn June 24th, 2022, over 40 Central IT staff from the University of California, Riverside; University of California, Santa Barbara; and San Diego State University competed in the inaugural Cloud Hero Cup. This year, the InfraSkills and Kubernetes skills games were chosen to be included in the challenge to teach learners foundational level skills. Both games helped participants learn how to access the Google Cloud console, practice key skills for developing scalable applications to solve common institutional challenges. Congratulations, UC Riverside The Cloud Hero Cup was presented to University of California, Riverside on July 29th (see photo below), as the inaugural winner. Mike Kennedy, UC Riverside Chief Technology Officer explained, “This was a great event for UC Riverside to be involved in and added a fun element to the upskilling we are all doing to meet our digital transformation goals. I’m really proud of the team!”Throughout the Cloud Hero game, Google Cloud tasks were used to help expand each participant’s knowledge of the Google Cloud console. By the end of the game, each player earned two skill badges: \"Create and Manage Cloud Resources Skill Badge\" and \"Deploy to Kubernetes in Google Cloud Skill Badge.”From left to right: Matt Gunkel (CIO); Peter Wong (Lead Sys Engr); Jeremy Fischer (Assc Dir Sys Eng); Mike Kennedy (CTO)We are beginning to form another competition with a new slate of schools. To learn more about the Cloud Hero Cup or if your school is interested in participating, please email cloudherocup@google.com.",

        "description": "Photo by Joe Sargent/Getty Images\n    \n\n  The Pirates will play all 29 other MLB teams in 2023 The 2023 MLB schedule is going to be awesome.\nThe quality of play on the field at PNC Park may vary and either be similar to 2022 or improved, but the visitors will pack a different punch more frequently than ever.\nMLB released each team’s 162-game schedule Wednesday with the highlight being the most obvious pleasure to baseball fanatics: less division games and more against the opposing league.\nFor the first time in modern MLB history, all 30 teams will play each other during the course of the season.\nDivision competition will be decreased from 76 to 52 games, or 19 games to 13 against a club’s four division opponents. The total adds up to a balanced 26 home and away games spreading between teams.\nIn short, as a result, the Pirates will now have the opportunity to play the likes of Mike Trout, Shohei Ohtani, Aaron Judge, Vlad Guerrero Jr, Julio Rodriguez, Jose Altuve, and others on a yearly basis.\nIt balances out the schedule similar to the NBA and NHL, especially with baseball playing and additional 80 games.\nThe idea to play each team every season is a design way overdue and exciting for baseball. It just makes too much sense.\nDoes playing the St. Louis Cardinals, Milwaukee Brewers, Chicago Cubs, and Cincinnati Reds less make division competition less intense? It could make it more important to beat those other clubs with less opportunities in route to a division title.\n\n\nA look at '23.— Pittsburgh Pirates (@Pirates) August 24, 2022\n\n\n\nTeams across the National and American Leagues will experience new venues on a more consistent basis and showcase the games top talent.\nIt provides Trout and Ohtani the chance to play more often on the east coast and in the midwest in earlier time slots than late-night west coast baseball. This could help to grow the game to new heights and engage a young generation willing to cling on to baseball. \nExcitement will fill PNC Park in 2023 when the Chicago White Sox are in town for the home opener, the Toronto Blue Jays and Cleveland Guardians are in town, as well as a second-straight year playing the New York Yankees. The Bucs will celebrate Clemente Day on September 15 to begin a three-game set against New York.\nSo fasten your seat belt and enjoy the ride. 2022 still has plenty of baseball left to offer, but a new era is on its way. Like the early reviews of the schedule, the Pirates hope their fortunes could be as action packed and eye opening as the release of dates on a calendar to fill an action-packed summer at the ballpark.",

        "description": "Google in a letter to lawmakers on Thursday said it would clearly identify facilities that provide abortions to ensure people seeking the procedure are not misled by anti-abortion clinics.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMark Isakowitz, the vice president for government affairs and public policy for the U.S. and Canada at Google, said in a letter to Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) and Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) that the company will include labels like “Provides abortions” and “Does not provide abortions” that the company has verified at the top of advertisement search results.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe change could help prevent women from seeking the procedure at clinics that oppose abortion or crisis pregnancy centers, which work to convince people against having the procedure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe announcement comes in response to a letter Warner, Slotkin and other members of Congress sent to the CEO of Google in June to urge him to prevent misleading abortion search results. \n\n\n\nThe lawmakers said in the letter that 37 percent of Google Maps results and 11 percent of search results for “abortion clinics near me” and “abortion pill” in states with abortion trigger bans were for anti-abortion clinics.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA Google spokesperson told The Hill that the company has been working for months to find more useful ways to display results that show the specific services that businesses offer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson said the update that Google is introducing will help users find locations that offer the services they search for or broaden their results so they can see more options. The company will confirm that certain places provide a service through regularly calling them directly and collaborating with “authoritative” data sources.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“When people turn to Google to find local information, we aim to help them easily explore the range of places available so they can determine which are most helpful to them,” the spokesperson said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe updates will affect how Google shows search results and maps to give people additional context about what they are viewing, according to a Google spokesperson.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe company will include the note \"Might not provide abortions\" when it is unable to verify information.\n\n\n\nGoogle will also allow users to expand their search radius if the most relevant results are not nearby.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWarner said in a release that the changes are not about restricting speech but providing results that accurately address a search.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I welcome the changes that Google has announced today so that women seeking abortion services aren’t directed&nbsp;towards fake clinics that traffic in misinformation and don’t provide comprehensive health services,” he said.",

        "description": "The midterm elections are a tale of two chambers.\n\n\n\nThe findings of a new national survey by NBC News illustrate the challenge Democrats face in the House and the possibilities it enjoys in the Senate as the party tries to maintain its slim majority in both houses of Congress.\n\n\n\nThree out of every four registered voters feel the country is heading in the wrong direction. Two of three voters believe the nation is in an economic recession and most people think the country’s best days are behind it. It’s hardly surprising that under these circumstances President Biden’s approval rating is underwater. But Democrats persist despite the obstacles with the help of GOP missteps.\n\n\n\nThis toxic environment certainly dampens Democratic prospects for Democratic control of the U.S. of Representatives. Political forecasting website FiveThrityEight.com gives the party only a 22 percent chance of hanging onto the lower chamber.  But FiveThirtyEight gives Democrats a whopping 63 percent odds of maintaining its Senate majority.\n\n\n\nWhy is there such a big difference between the forecasts for the House and the Senate? Why are Republican hopes for taking the House so high and so low for the Senate?\n\n\n\nThe answer is simple. House races reflect national trends while Senate races are more judgements on the qualities of individual candidates.\n\n\n\nHouse incumbents operate in anonymity. Voters, especially people who live in large metropolitan areas know little about the people who represent them in the U.S. House of Representatives. Most House members in large metropolitan areas get little attention from the news media. The visibility for challengers is even worse.\n\n\n\nThis information vacuum forces voters to rely on factors that are internal and personal like their feelings about the state of the nation. It’s much easier for people to answer questions about the nation’s direction than it is for them to reflect on the quality of their seemingly anonymous representation in the lower chamber of Congress.\n\n\n\nThe dynamic in U.S. Senate races is completely different. Voters know much more about the incumbent and the challenger. Senate incumbents get on TV frequently over the course of their six-year terms and even their challengers receive media attention during election year. Senate voters choose between the candidates while House voters rely on whether they are in a good or bad mood.\n\n\n\nThese are the best of times and worst of times for Republicans. Voters are in a sour mood, which gives the GOP an opportunity to take control of the House. However, the party has failed to field quality candidates for the Senate, which is the reason for its troubles there.\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) recently expressed doubt about Republican chances to gain control of the upper chamber. He cited “candidate quality” as the reason for his pessimism. He’s right about that. Republicans have fielded untested celebrity candidates in three key Senate races that could make or break the contest for control.\n\n\n\nThe three candidates, Mehmet Oz in Pennsylvania, Herschel Walker in Georgia and J.D. Vance in Ohio have made rookie mistakes. The GOP urge to nominate celebrity candidates without any political experience in wake of former President Trump has clouded the party’s efforts to take control of the Senate. Prospects that were so very bright just a few short months ago.\n\n\n\nTrump’s celebrity campaign worked against a battle scared veteran of the political wars like Hillary Clinton. But the three celebrity GOP candidates seem in over their heads and face Democratic candidates who are not establishment candidates like Clinton, the former First Lady and secretary of State.\n\n\n\nVance's opponent, Rep. Tim Ryan (R-Ohio) once challenged Nancy Pelosi for House Speaker. Walker’s competition, Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) is a Baptist preacher and pastor who was a first-time candidate in 2020. Facing off against Oz, Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman of is truly a maverick candidate with a funky personality and wardrobe that screams “I’m not a politician.”\n\n\n\nWhile the GOP claim on a Senate majority looks shaky, the party is poised to win the House. But Republican prospects for a sweeping majority in the lower chamber have evaporated.\n\n\n\nThe Democratic victory in the special election in New York’s 19th Congressional district on Tuesday demonstrates that abortion rights is a potent issue for Democratic hopefuls in bellwether suburban constituencies.\n\n\n\nFor every action, there is a reaction. Republican prospects started to darken the day the U.S. Supreme Court nullified Roe vs. Wade and ended abortion rights for millions of American women. The GOP once had a big edge in partisan enthusiasm, but the new NBC poll indicates that Democratic voters are now as excited about the midterms as their Republican counterparts.\n\n\n\nThe NBC poll has another stunning finding that should strike fear into the hearts of Republican strategists. The threat to democracy has replaced concern about the economy as the big-ticket issue concern for the voting public. As gas prices decrease and Trump’s legal liability increases, the big headline on election night could be: GOP snatches defeat from the jaws of victory.\n\n\n\nBrad Bannon&nbsp;is a Democratic pollster and CEO of Bannon Communications Research.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/opinion/international/3615384-the-afghanistan-anniversary-ended-with-silence-and-inaction/",
        "description": "It has been more than a year since I realized the government of Afghanistan was about to collapse. During the first week of August 2021, I kept scrolling in disbelief as the Taliban started taking over major cities that were previous strongholds of the Western-backed government. Meanwhile, messages from those inside the country who feared being targeted by the Taliban poured in, fearing the absolute worst.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA year later, those messages haven’t stopped. While the Taliban&nbsp;rendered women second-class citizens,&nbsp;closed girls’ schools&nbsp;and&nbsp;ethnically cleansed&nbsp;parts of the country, millions cling to hope from&nbsp;broken promises&nbsp;made by the U.S. Afghanistan’s youth, who were once encouraged by the U.S. to break glass ceilings in a conservative society, are losing the hope President Biden gave them when he&nbsp;declared&nbsp;last year, “there is a home for you in the United States if you so choose, and we will stand with you just as you stood with us.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, the one-year anniversary of the withdrawal has come to pass with a serious lack of public attention and accountability. While the entire world was witness to the shameful debacle last August, there have been no public congressional hearings on what transpired and no government official has resigned due to the failures.\n\n\n\nThe occupation is over, but in the aftermath of its 20-year ordeal, America seems eager to pretend Afghanistan has ceased to exist when it’s indeed responsible.\n\n\n\nThe rushed withdrawal and abandonment of those&nbsp;desperate&nbsp;to flee the country is not the only mistake the U.S. has made since last year. We’ve pursued economic warfare on the Taliban with zero consideration for the collateral damage it has inflicted on regular Afghans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe United States’ seizure of sovereign Afghan assets, hard-hitting sanctions and abrupt end to foreign aid has led to the world’s most dire humanitarian disaster, leading more than half the country to the brink of&nbsp;famine. Afghans seeking evacuation now not only live in fear of arbitrary arrest or execution from the Taliban, but they are also jobless and going hungry. Many others, especially young women and girls, mention suicide if no help reaches them soon.\n\n\n\nThe&nbsp;double standard&nbsp;between how the U.S. treated Afghans and Ukrainians is tough to swallow. While the White House created a special parole program for Ukrainians with a&nbsp;free-to-use online portal&nbsp;that will allow 100,000 Ukranianians to enter the country, Afghans who stood alongside America’s two-decade military occupation despite the risk of Taliban retribution were not given the same treatment. A&nbsp;recent report by Reveal&nbsp;exposes government data that points to a racist immigration system: Out of 66,000 humanitarian parole applications, the government approved only 123 while collecting roughly $20 million in fees.\n\n\n\nDespite all this, it is not too late for America to live up to its moral obligation and promises to the Afghan people.\n\n\n\nFirst, the Biden administration must ensure that at-risk Afghans who got left behind are allowed to seek refuge in the United States. It can do so by establishing an Afghan parole program, which it historically has done for Vietnamese, Kosovar, Iraqi Kurds and other refugees from areas where the United States has been involved militarily. Many Afghans remain in Afghanistan or a third country, such as Albania, awaiting processing of their special immigrant visa (SIV) or priority-2 applications. The administration, once and for all, should stop making excuses for bureaucratic delays and ensure Afghans find a dignified welcome in the United States.\n\n\n\nSecond, Congress and the administration must fulfill one of its promises by passing the&nbsp;Afghan Adjustment Act&nbsp;with no excuse or delay so that President Biden can sign it into law. This bipartisan piece of legislation, which has support from both Democrats and Republicans in both the Senate and the House, would allow newly arrived Afghans to have a pathway to permanent protections inside this country. The asylum process is expensive, traumatic and deeply burdensome; many did not have the chance to bring all their documents in their quest to be evacuated and find safety.\n\n\n\nThird, there must be a renewed focus on welcoming Afghan refugees with dignity. Thousands of newly arrived Afghans continue to live in&nbsp;temporary housing&nbsp;such as hotels, motels and Airbnbs, with the prospect of finding affordable housing for them increasingly daunting in an inflationary economy. Countless others are unable to access healthcare, given America’s confusing and shallow social safety net. Community organizations are overwhelmed while inaction by the federal and state governments is failing new arrivals.\n\n\n\nWhile the chaotic airport scenes at Kabul airport last summer have ended, Afghans are still in need of refuge and safety. President Biden ran on a campaign of welcoming refugees and made solemn promises to Afghans in need of refuge ahead of the withdrawal. Millions of Afghans’ lives have been upended at the hands of the United States, both through its unfulfilled promises and the humanitarian crisis it is partially responsible for.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAfghans are no strangers to being betrayed, forgotten, or abandoned, and recent history is rife with examples of the world doing exactly that. But America made a promise and must live up to it. Otherwise, the calamity that will unfold will be America’s responsibility. Time is running out.\n\n\n\nArash Azizzada is the co-founder and co-director of&nbsp;Afghans For A Better Tomorrow. He is a writer, photographer and community organizer in the Afghan diaspora.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/3615973-pentagon-lays-out-plan-to-reduce-civilian-deaths-in-us-combat-operations/",
        "description": "The Pentagon on Thursday released a long-awaited plan aimed at reducing civilian casualties caused by U.S. military operations and proposed a better way to report and respond to incidents when they occur.  \n\n\n\nThe 36-page Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan, approved by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin earlier this week, directs sweeping changes in military planning, training, doctrine and policy for all future conflicts, the Pentagon’s top spokesperson Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters. \n\n\n\nThe idea is to install at all operational levels people “who are trained to have an understanding of civilian harm, the aspects of civilian harm mitigation, and operational planning,” at the start of any mission, Ryder said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe military’s Civilian Protection Center of Excellence will serve as the hub “that will provide expertise at a centralized location, but then that will be dispersed throughout the Department of Defense,” to include some estimated 150-plus individuals that will have special training on the matter, he added. \n\n\n\nAhead of the report’s release, a senior Defense official told reporters the Pentagon envisions an eventual situation where those who are experts in the civilian environment “are sitting next to the operators, the threat-focused intel folks, the lawyers, as they are really developing whether it’s an individual operation or a campaign, and building in this component of civilian harm throughout the overall process.” \n\n\n\nThe plan, which contains 11 major objectives, is meant to be “systemic” and “implementable immediately,” and is expected to cost “tens of millions of dollars” per year to execute,&nbsp;the official said. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe document comes&nbsp;nearly a year after a botched Aug. 29 attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed 10 people, including seven children, causing public outcry and significant scrutiny over U.S. drone strikes.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat deadly blunder, coupled with a November investigation by The New York Times detailing a U.S. airstrike that killed 70 civilians, prompted Austin in January to order the Defense Department to develop a civilian harm mitigation “action plan.” \n\n\n\nThe New York Times reported allegations that top officers and civilian officials tried to hide the casualties in the drone strike. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a memo included in the plan, Austin said the protection of civilians is both a “strategic priority” and a “moral imperative.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We will ensure that we are well prepared to prevent, mitigate and respond to civilian harm in current and future conflicts,” Austin wrote, calling the changes “both ambitious and necessary.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe plan notably does not include any guidance or changes to punishment, should an individual or multiple people inaccurately or inappropriately order a strike that kills civilians.  \n\n\n\nThe Pentagon did not punish any individuals related to the Kabul strike, as it found that those involved had followed the correct procedures.  ",

        "description": "The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mishandled up to 1 in 3 veterans’ claims relating to water contamination at Camp LeJeune, according to a report released Thursday by the department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG). \n\n\n\nSome 1 million people may have been exposed to contaminated water at the training facility between August 1953 and December 1987, according to the OIG report. OIG investigators found that the department prematurely denied more than 17,000 of the claims before sending the claimants' letters asking for further documentation of exposure.  \n\n\n\nIn another 2,300 cases, the department recorded incorrect effective dates for benefit eligibility, according to the report. Not all the mishandled cases would necessarily have resulted in benefit payouts, but veterans were underpaid by at least $13.8 million over a four-year period due to failure to assign the earliest effective date, according to the watchdog.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe contaminants in question are associated with a number of medical conditions and complications, including kidney cancer, liver cancer, Parkinson’s disease and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The VA has also expanded eligibility for disability payments to people who have a different condition than the eight listed that they can prove is connected to exposure to contaminated water.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The OIG found that errors were less likely to occur at the Louisville Regional Office, which processes most Camp Lejeune-related claims; staff from other VA regional offices lacked experience processing these claims,” the report states. The watchdog recommended the Veterans Benefits Administration either develop a plan to reduce the processing errors at regional offices or centralize Camp Lejeune-related claims at the Louisville office.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEarlier this month, President Biden signed the Promise to Address Comprehensive Toxics Act, which included $300 billion for benefits for veterans exposed to burn pits but also includes a provision allowing lawsuits against the federal government in connection with exposure to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "description": "Sen. Marsha Blackburn (R-Tenn.) on Thursday became the latest lawmaker to visit Taiwan, landing on the self-governing island after a string of visits by Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and other U.S. officials that has heightened tensions with China.\n\n\n\nThe visit by Blackburn, a member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, is likely to further anger Beijing, which views Taiwan as part of its territory and wants to reunify the mainland with the democratic island.\n\n\n\n“Taiwan is our strongest partner in the Indo-Pacific Region,” Blackburn said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Regular high-level visits to Taipei are long-standing U.S. policy,” she added. “I will not be bullied by Communist China into turning my back on the island.”\n\n\n\nPelosi led a delegation to Taiwan earlier this month, becoming the highest-ranking U.S. official to visit the island in 25 years. China responded by conducting military drills for multiple days near the island after she left.\n\n\n\nBlackburn applauded Pelosi's visit alongside 25 other Republican senators.\n\n\n\nA five-member delegation of lawmakers visited the Taiwan days later, prompting China to once again launch military drills following their visit.\n\n\n\nDouglas Hsu, the director-general for North American affairs in Taiwan’s foreign ministry, greeted Blackburn at the airport. Blackburn arrived in Taiwan after stops in Fiji, the Solomon Islands and Papua New Guinea.\n\n\n\nBlackburn will meet with Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen on Friday and will depart on Saturday, Taiwan’s Central News Agency reported.\n\n\n\n“It’s time we focus on rewarding Taiwan’s commitment to democratic values and ensure they have the necessary resources to combat Communist China and the New Axis of Evil,” Blackburn tweeted after landing on the island.\n\n\n\nUnder the longstanding “One China” policy, the United States acknowledges — though does not endorse — Beijing’s claim to the island while it also vows to honor the Taiwan Relations Act, which commits the U.S. to providing Taiwan with the means to defend itself.",

        "description": "This show originally aired on August 9, 2018.\nThe Shostakovich story — man and music in the apocalypse of world war and Cold War — seems to get more frightfully irresistible with every remembrance, every new CD in the Boston Symphony’s Grammy winning series. With Stravinsky and Prokofiev in the trio of Russia’s 20th century immortals, Shostakovich was the one who stayed on the home ground of his music, and paid the price. This is a story of where music comes from, what it means, and who owns it. In the Soviet Union, it is a personal duel between composer and tyrant; of Stalin himself bullying Shostakovich on the telephone, and of the shy, twitchy-nervous but indomitable composer writing unmistakably in musical notation when Stalin was gone: “you’re dead, and I am alive.” \n\nThe fourth of Dmitri Shostakovich’s 15 symphonies marks a low point in a tortured life. Just as clearly it marks a rallying point of courage, start of a recovery in artistic fortunes, still rising this summer of 2018 — four decades into a composer’s immortality. It is this fourth symphony from 1936 that Joseph Stalin ordered not to be performed. Pravda delivered the death threat, mocking Shostakovich’s sound as grunts and hoots — “muddle not music,” said the editorial headline. \n\nSo Shostakovich 4 was never played in Russia till 1960, after Stalin had died, after Shostakovich had been browbeaten into joining the Communist Party. It’s on the BSO’s Tanglewood program next Friday night, August 17. And like every turn in the long Shostakovich surge, Andris Nelsons’ take on the Fourth Symphony has the air of an event around it, of revelation. We’ve been listening in on rehearsals, and engaging the Maestro on Shostakovich since March.\nWe&#8217;re joined by the Shostakovich biographer Elizabeth Wilson, the writer Tobin Anderson, and the BSO violinist Valeria Kuchment.",

        "description": "LIV Golf, the controversial golf tour backed by Saudi Arabia, has registered to lobby, according to a Thursday filing. Hobart Hallaway &amp; Quayle Ventures — the firm of former Rep. Benjamin Quayle (R-Ariz.) — noted it would lobby on “education and issues related to the game of professional golf in the United States and abroad” along with “protecting the rights of professional golfers to play when and where they choose.” Quayle, who lost a primary campaign in 2012 after redistricting and revelations of his involvement with the raunchy controversial website DirtyScottsdale.com, and Rashid Hallaway, a former legislative assistant to former Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.), will work on the account. Quayle, son of former vice president Dan Quayle, is the latest Washington insider to ingratiate itself with LIV Golf, despite allegations of “sportwashing.” Ari Fleischer, former press secretary under President George W. Bush, has done public relations for the tour. Former President Donald Trump’s Bedminster, N.J., golf club hosted the tour in July, and Trump National Doral will do the same in October. “HHQ Ventures is proud to advocate on LIV Golf’s behalf and is aligned with its mission to modernize and grow the game of golf on a global basis,\" Hallaway said in a statement, referring additional questions to LIV Golf. Although LIV Golf is backed by the Saudi’s Public Investment Fund, the registration was not filed with the Department of Justice under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. Instead, it was filed under the Lobbying Disclosure Act, which requires more lenient disclosures around lobbying activities. The PGA Tour has been on a campaign of its own against LIV Golf, its key rival. Last quarter, the PGA Tour paid law firm DLA Piper $120,000 to lobby on “Saudi Golf League proposals,” among other topics, according to a filing. The Tour has also suspended players who joined LIV Golf, and the Department of Justice has reportedly launched an antitrust inquiry into its actions. “LIV’s priority as a startup is delivering an innovative and entertaining product to fans,” LIV Golf spokesperson Jonathan Grella said in a statement. “In light of the PGA Tour’s anticompetitive behavior, we have accelerated our plans to educate policymakers on LIV’s business model and mission to grow the game of golf.” A spokesman for the PGA Tour declined to comment. POLITICO reported earlier this month that the PR giant Edelman helped to launch LIV Golf, although it never registered that work with the Department of Justice. The firm argued that it did not need to register on the tour’s behalf.",

The attorney general’s press office declined to comment on whether a decision has been made about next steps.&#8221;\n&#8220;James might first offer Trump and the Trump Organization a settlement deal, though his history suggests there’s little chance he’d accept. The AG’s next move would likely be a massive civil lawsuit. The case would presumably center on allegations that Trump and his company falsely raised or lowered the valuation of real estate holdings in order to obtain loans or reduce tax bills.&#8221;",

        "description": "Senate Democrats are coming off a summertime high, clinching legislation on everything from climate to gun safety as their candidates outpolled and outraised Republicans in key battlegrounds. Now comes the post-Labor Day GOP surge. The Senate Leadership Fund, a Republican super PAC aligned with Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, is set to narrow the financial disparities currently holding his party back in its bid to retake the Senate. The super PAC has more than $160 million in advertising on the books for the post-Labor Day crunch, according to AdImpact — just the beginning of a cash blitz that's poised to blunt the financial edge that Democratic candidates have enjoyed for 18 months.  It’s a repeat in the making of 2020, when the GOP PAC notched blockbuster fundraising down the stretch and rained down ads on Senate Democratic candidates that helped avert a complete Republican collapse, though the chamber still narrowly flipped. And Democrats expect this year's polls to tighten enough to make every race a nail-biter. “These are all going to be dogfights for the final couple months,” said former Democratic Senate Campaign Committee adviser Justin Barasky. “Republican money is coming. We always knew it was going to, because it always does. Doesn’t mean it’s easy to deal with, but it’s not unexpected.” To an extent, Democrats set their own high expectations off what they see as weak GOP candidates, an improving political climate and a surprisingly productive legislative summer. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer channeled those good vibes in an interview earlier this month: “I think we’re going to pick up seats,” he said, adding that voters “see the Republicans as MAGA Republicans, far to the right. And now we’ve shown that we can actually get something done.” Still, with a GOP storm coming in, the Senate Democratic campaign arm is prodding its candidates to keep outpacing their Republican opponents in individual fundraising. Candidates themselves get better ad rates than super PACs, which means Democrats’ best bet to blunt the McConnell-backed group is continued big numbers from senators like Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.) and Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.). DSCC spokesperson David Bergstein said the committee views this fall's core races as “margin of error” contests, despite polls showing Kelly and Pennsylvania’s John Fetterman up double digits. Bergstein added that the committee knows “each of our battleground races is going to be very competitive, that the spending disparity across the Senate map is going to tighten.” “Republicans have put themselves in an extremely difficult position, heading into the final months of the election, but we're under no delusions that they will have significant resources to spend,” Bergstein said. “We're going to need to be prepared for our campaigns to be able to continue to have an extremely strong paid media presence when this Republican wave of spending comes.” For the moment, Democratic incumbents are holding their own despite President Joe Biden’s low approval ratings in Georgia, Arizona, Nevada and New Hampshire. In addition, the party's Senate candidates are threatening to pick up seats in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania while possibly marching even deeper into GOP territory. That happened thanks to Democratic candidates who spent early and often to stay afloat during a choppy last few months, prompting the National Republican Senatorial Committee to spend $42 million. Chris Hartline, a spokesperson for the NRSC, said his organization spent early “to define the Democrats and their radical agenda. Democrats have spent tens of millions in every state on the map, only to be in exactly the same weak position they were in a year ago.” The NRSC now has $23 million on hand after that blitz, about $30 million less than the DSCC. The McConnell-backed super PAC is set to now carry the brunt of the party’s spending in the final weeks. “Congratulations to Democrats for spending the summer blanketing the airwaves,” said Senate Leadership Fund spokesperson Jack Pandol. This fall, he added, “SLF and Republican candidates will be furiously litigating Democratic Senate candidates’ lockstep support of the toxic Biden agenda.” Right now the biggest GOP advantages are in Democratic reach states that Republicans need to take off the board. Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan is running close enough against GOP nominee J.D. Vance to elicit a $28 million intervention by SLF that will end up swamping the Democrat by nearly $10 million after Labor Day, based on current reservations. Cheri Beasley is closing ground against Rep. Ted Budd (R-N.C.), although Republicans are currently slated to outspend Democrats in North Carolina by more than $25 million in the after-Labor Day period, almost entirely due to the GOP super PAC. Due in large part to the PAC's $28 million in fall reservations in Pennsylvania, Republicans may be able to keep pace there with Fetterman, a prolific fundraiser, and his Democratic allies. GOP nominee Mehmet Oz has been trailing in every public poll and needs all the help he can get, with the Republican PAC adding three extra weeks of summer ad buys to help stanch the bleeding. And while there are fewer polls in Wisconsin, its incumbent GOP Sen. Ron Johnson is trailing early against Democratic Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes. As things stand, GOP groups are slated to slightly outspend Democratic groups this fall in the Badger State. The Schumer-aligned Senate Majority PAC, meanwhile, is also upping its spending as the map gels. The group initially reserved $106 million in the key battlegrounds of Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, then added $27 million in additional reservations. The Schumer-backed PAC also began spending this summer in North Carolina ahead of Republicans’ massive reservation there, though it has not reserved ad time there after Labor Day, according to AdImpact. Veronica Yoo, a spokesperson for Senate Majority PAC, said her group is \"committed to making sure that Democrats have the resources\" they need. “The fact that Mitch McConnell, the Senate Leadership Fund and their right-wing allies are being forced to shell out tens of millions of dollars on defense is a testament to the strength of our Democratic candidates,” Yoo said. Even the Republican super PAC, which can take unlimited donations, is unable to keep up in Nevada and Arizona, where Democratic groups and candidates currently have reservations outpacing the GOP by a two-to-one margin at the moment. SLF has not yet made a commitment in New Hampshire, giving Democrats an advantage there of more than $10 million. And in Georgia, Democrats have an early spending edge in the race between Warnock and GOP nominee Herschel Walker, a former football star anointed by former President Donald Trump who has struggled on the trail. Warnock had about $15 million more on hand than Walker at the end of the last reporting period, enough for him to spend $3 million per week from his own campaign on ads down the stretch. The McConnell-backed super PAC is spending $5 million a week in Georgia, part of a $39 million fall spending strategy there. Republicans only have to net one seat to win back the Senate, which many in the party say is still achievable even as they grimace over some candidates’ performances. Both parties have also sought to expand the midterm map beyond the core six battleground states; Barasky said GOP-held Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, plus Democratic-held Colorado, will all be fiercely competitive as GOP candidates up their game in the final weeks. “There’s been enough alarms sounded on the Republican side about the money,” Barasky added. “I can only assume they’re going to improve. In a lot of cases, they don’t need to because they can rely on the millions they have in outside money.”",

Meadows was an active participant in Trump’s effort to press state officials in Georgia to help “find” enough votes to put Trump ahead of Joe Biden in the state. Meadows traveled to Georgia for an unannounced visit during recount efforts there, and he joined Trump on a phone call with Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger where Trump pressed the state officials to help reverse the outcome. “[T]he Special Purpose Grand Jury’s investigation has revealed that the Witness was involved in setting up the call,” the DA indicated in the filing. The DA’s decision to seek Meadows’ testimony shows the investigation has reached Trump’s door. Already the grand jury has sought testimony from the attorneys and congressional allies who supported and helped devise Trump’s strategy to subvert the election. It’s one of several expansive criminal probes that have become an acute threat to Trump, including the unfolding investigation of highly classified information housed at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and the federal grand jury probe of Trump allies’ efforts to disrupt the transfer of power. Several of those allies, including attorney Kenneth Chesebro and Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), are fighting subpoenas to testify to the grand jury. An attorney for Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp argued Thursday in Fulton County Superior Court to quash a subpoena for his testimony. Trump ally Rudy Giuliani appeared last week for a closed-door interview. It’s unclear whether he asserted any privileges. He was recently informed that he has become a target of Willis’ investigation. Sixteen Republican Party leaders and activists who signed certificates falsely claiming to be presidential electors from Georgia are also targets of the probe. Others who have been subpoenaed to appear include Trump attorneys John Eastman and Cleta Mitchell, as well as Rep. Jody Hice (R-Ga.). Powell helped lead a team of outside lawyers to mount challenges to the election results in various states, and she helped drive false claims about foreign interference and vote-flipping. Waldron was an ally in that effort. Both have been figures of interest to the Jan. 6 select committee investigating the attack on the Capitol. “[Powell] possesses unique knowledge concerning relevant communications between [herself], former President Donald Trump, the Trump Campaign, and other known and unknown individuals involved in the multi-state, coordinated efforts to influence the results of the November 2020 elections in Georgia and elsewhere,” Willis wrote in the filing seeking Powell’s testimony.",

        "description": "What if we told you America has an electoral system where politicians got to choose their voters? You’d probably think we had it backwards, since what we were taught in school about basic American democracy was that every citizen has one vote to choose who represents us. The sad truth is that because of a practice called gerrymandering, politicians and political parties have more influence on who gets to represent us than we the voters do.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFollowing the U.S. Census, which happens every ten years, states redraw their congressional and state legislative voting maps in a process called redistricting. Gerrymandering occurs when political parties are in control of this process. Democrats and Republicans have every incentive to draw district lines that give their political party an advantage in elections for the next decade.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGerrymandering is one of the root causes of our dysfunctional politics. By minimizing the number of competitive districts, elections are decided in primaries. As a result, Americans have fewer choices, and candidates become more and more extreme. Gerrymandering affects all American voters, but it’s especially bad for voters in non-majority demographic groups.\n\n\n\nAs our politics has become more partisan and extreme, so has gerrymandering. This past redistricting cycle, both political parties gerrymandered to the greatest extent possible. Recently, New York’s Court of Appeals rejected maps drawn by Democrats that tilted the district map lines heavily in their favor. Similarly, the Ohio Supreme Court rejected maps drawn by Republicans that advantaged Republicans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRampant gerrymandering continues to happen because it’s legal in most states. There are a couple key strategies politicians use to draw map lines that maximize the votes for candidates of their party and ensure their opponents get as few as possible. One is packing — drawing lines that put as many of their opponent’s registered party members as possible into one district; and cracking — breaking voters of the other party into as many different districts as possible to dilute their vote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGerrymandering violates the basic premise that each state and congressional district ought to represent all the people who live there. When successful, the party that draws the lines can more or less guarantee they’ll hold onto power for the next ten years.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSo, who wins and loses?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPoliticians, party bosses and lobbyists win. The rest of us — the whole country — loses. Because gerrymandering essentially guarantees “safe” seats for a party, our elected representatives have far less incentive to represent all the people in their districts and the collective interest. The less energy that has to be expended to listen to every voter, the more time can be dedicated to the party base and to the lobbyists and special interest groups who contribute to their campaigns. This distorted process serves to increase destructive political polarization and creates gridlock in our legislatures.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat can be done?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFirst, we must go back to basics and set commonsense redistricting guidelines. Districts should be as compact and competitive as possible, while attempting to keep communities together.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSecond, we need to take the power to draw districts away from self-interested partisan legislators and put it in the hands of independent commissions. These commissions work best when they have complete transparency, their members come from across the political spectrum, and they abide by strict criteria to ensure fair and accurate representation for all voters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIndependent redistricting commissions work. Seven states currently use independent commissions to draw congressional and state districts, while two other states use them for state level districts only. This approach has proven to be even handed and tends to avoid the extended time required to fight the process in court or have a judge appoint an impartial mapmaker to draw the lines of constituency.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThird, as citizens, we need to be more involved in our communities. We need to support local efforts to require citizen engagement in the redistricting process, and demand answers to problems we all share, regardless of political affiliation. Each of us has preferred policy solutions, but we all have an interest in making our government work rather than letting politicians rig it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStates are in charge of drawing district lines, not the federal government. That means we can fix this process problem without passing a federal law. We can pass local initiatives ourselves in the states and communities we live in that gives everyone in the neighborhoods the opportunity to be heard.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf we want a fair electoral system, we must insist on the adoption of these reforms.&nbsp;The best way to ensure a fair distribution of power is to build sufficient public momentum that voters cannot be ignored. Call or write your elected representatives and demand reform. Together, we can end gerrymandering.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Honorable Sean O’Keefe is the 69th Secretary of the Navy, university professor, and co-chair of Count Every Hero, a group of veterans and citizens dedicated to protecting democracy, fighting corruption, and reforming our electoral system.",

A bill to boost the domestic semiconductor industry also passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGas prices have steadily declined, an indication of inflation potentially easing. Biden also announced a successful counterterrorism operation that killed al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahiri in Afghanistan earlier this month. \n\n\n\nThe uptick in Biden’s approval among voting-age Americans comes at a critical moment as Democrats embark on the final two months of campaigning before the midterm elections.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere has been a widespread belief that Republicans are likely to win control of at least the House and potentially the Senate, but Biden’s improving poll numbers are likely to offer some new hope to Democrats.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe president is preparing to promote his accomplishments on the road. The White House on Thursday announcing plans for Biden to travel to Ohio on Sept. 9 to attend the groundbreaking of a new Intel semiconductor facility in Ohio.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden will also appear at a Democratic National Committee fundraiser and rally on Thursday evening to discuss his accomplishments as he seeks to draw a contrast with Republicans.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "description": "A judge on Thursday again blocked a trigger law banning abortion in North Dakota as he weighs arguments from the state&#x27;s lone abortion clinic that the law violates the state constitution.Burleigh County District Judge Bruce Romanick granted the motion for a preliminary injunction as part of a lawsuit brought by the Red River Women&#x27;s Clinic in Fargo.The ban was set to take effect Friday. The clinic already moved its services a short distance to neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota, where abortion remains legal, even as it seeks to block the North Dakota law.Romanick said he was not ruling on the probability of the clinic winning the lawsuit, rather that more time is needed to make a proper judgment. He said that even though the clinic has moved its operations to Minnesota, the statute would also affect doctors and hospitals, making the decision to delay “still pertinent and appropriate,” the judge said.Clinic attorney Tom Dickson told The Associated Press that his team was “gratified” by the ruling.“The right of women to make the decisions affecting their personal autonomy should be guaranteed by the North Dakota Constitution,” Dickson said.The lawsuit argues that the state constitution&#x27;s guarantees of rights to life, liberty, safety and happiness effectively guarantee a right to abortion.It&#x27;s the second time that Romanick has put the trigger ban on hold. He ruled last month that Attorney General Drew Wrigley was premature in setting a July 28 closing date and issued a temporary restraining order that effectively gave the clinic time to move to Moorhead without a gap in services.Wrigley did not immediately respond to a request for comment.The Legislature passed the law in 2007 to kick in if the U.S. Supreme Court ever overturned its 1973 Roe v. Wade ruling that established nationwide abortion rights. The high court did so in June.The law would make abortion illegal except in cases of rape or incest or when the life of the mother is in danger — any of which would have to be proven in court. Otherwise, a doctor who performs an abortion would face a felony.",

        "description": "For this year’s Minnesota State Fair, MPR’s All Things Considered will be featuring a series called “Infrequently Asked Questions.” MPR News reporters will try to answer fair questions you didn&#x27;t know you had.You may have seen MPR News&#x27; Tim Nelson on Twitter this week, posting video from the Minnesota State Fairgrounds of the stocking of the DNR fish pond with the state’s native species. You may have also seen MPR newscaster Phil Picardi asking him the not-so-obvious question: What happens to the fish AFTER the fair? Well, fair veteran that he is, Tim had anticipated that very inquiry, and actually asked the state Department of Natural Resources about the post-fair fish. Tim was stationed next to the fish pond on Thursday — opening day at the fair — when MPR News host Tom Crann called to find out what he learned.So, let’s actually tackle this in chronological order: How do the fish get to the state fair? Are there people out fishing for them? Are they hatched for the fair?Well, as you know, fish stories are long and legendary, and the fair fish are no exception. The truth is: they truly are “fair fish.” Some of them have been to the fair more than you or I have. I talked to TJ DeBates, the east metro fisheries supervisor for the DNR, as they were stocking the pond, and he said they’re a very specialized collection. Spectators watch fish swim in the Minnesota Department of Natural Resources fish pond at the Minnesota State Fair.Ben Hovland | MPR News“They literally live in a pond, close to our office, for most of their lives. Except for the two weeks we’re at the fair,” DeBates said.They have a dedicated water control structure there, and the DNR staff gradually lower the top of it as the fair approaches, until the pond is shallow enough that it&#x27;s easy to net the fish. They line up a bunch of pickups with big tanks in the back and drive them right to the fair.Do they need acclimation, or treated water, or anything like that? The pond at the fair is actually very clear well water. It doesn’t come from a lake or river. It doesn’t get treated or cleaned. You could probably drink it at some point — it is fish-ready. It also comes out of the ground quite cool, a little over 50 degrees. That’s a little cooler than most fish are used to in the summer, and that actually slows down their metabolism, which means they don’t eat as much — although the DNR stocks the pond with minnows occasionally to make sure the fish have a snack available. The Minnesota DNR fish pond at the Minnesota State Fair, as seen on Thursday.Ben Hovland | MPR NewsSo they swim around kind of lazily, and look at the fairgoers for two weeks, gobble up some minnows, then what? Are they released? Well, if you think about the DNR’s drumbeat of messages, about biosecurity and preventing the spread of invasive species, they can’t really let them go. They’ve all been swimming together for weeks and swapping potential pathogens and whatnot. So, they can’t ever return to the wild. Again, here’s the DNR&#x27;s TJ DeBates.“We put them all into our pond, close to our office, and they kind of go to their little retirement community until it’s show time next year,” he said.Kao Thao is the DNR naturalist at Fort Snelling State Park and offered talks about the fish at the agency’s State Fair pond for curious fairgoers on the opening day of the fair.Tim Nelson | MPR NewsSo he’s saying that these fish make an annual trip to the fair, like the rest of Minnesota? A lot of them do. But for some it is a one-way trip. DeBates says if you hang around at night and hear lots of splashing — well, let’s just say it’s a fish-eat-fish kind of situation there outside the DNR building, and some of them fall on the prey side of the predator-prey equation. But he says some of these fish have been at the fair longer than you or I.“A lot of the bigger fish, especially the sturgeon, I think that has been in our pond ... since the late ’80s. They’re a long-lived fish,” DeBates said. “They can live up to over 100 years old. Between the sturgeon and the paddlefish, they have been around since the time of the dinosaurs. So they’re very long-lived and they’re repeat offenders when they come here.” That means the sturgeon has literally been swimming around in this pond since the Reagan administration. Fairgoers may want to keep that in mind as they watch these fish swim around — and maybe consider them a little more respectfully, as elders, perhaps.",

        "description": "Truss remained loath to ‘bung money’ at those struggling to afford spiralling bills, Sunak said millions may be forced into destitution Liz Truss has doubled down on her reluctance to “bung more money” at those who will struggle to afford spiralling energy costs this winter while Rishi Sunak said millions may be forced into destitution without extra support, as the pair clashed at the penultimate hustings of the Conservative leadership race.With energy regulator Ofgem expected to raise the price cap to £3,500 a year from October for the average dual-fuel tariff, Truss warned the issue of spiralling fuel costs was not a short-term one. “If people think this problem is going to be over in six months they are not right. This is a long term problem,” she told the audience in Norfolk. Continue reading...",

With Erik ten Hag departed after five seasons that yielded a number of notable European results, Ajax are something of an unknown quantity under Alfred Schreuder, who managed Hoffenheim and was an assistant at Ajax and Barcelona before overseeing the end of last season at Club Brugge. He plays the familiar high-pressing Ajax style of football, but has to deal with the exodus of Lisandro Martínez, André Onana, Sébastien Haller, Noussair Mazraoui and Ryan Gravenberch, with Antony perhaps soon to join them. Napoli, buoyed by the Georgian wonderkid Khvicha Kvaratskhelia , always represents a difficult trip, and the atmosphere at Rangers, back in the group stages after 12 years, is unlikely to be any less fervent.

        "description": "A set of solar panels will soon be afloat in two key California canals — in a bid to both reduce evaporation and provide power to the state’s electricity grid.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe $20 million Project Nexus, funded by the state, is deploying solar panels in two canals about 100 miles inland from San Francisco, according to Reuters.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe first of the two pilot projects is a 500-foot span of a canal in Hickman, while the second is a mile-long straightaway in nearby Ceres, Reuters reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf eventually scaled up, the initiative could save billions of gallons of otherwise evaporated water while providing electricity to millions of homes, according to Reuters.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nLining the canals with solar panels would also eliminate the need to use other land for such purposes, as well as reduce aquatic weed and algae growth, University of California Merced project scientist Brandi McKuin told Reuters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe project is based on a similar venture in the west Indian state of Gujarat, but is the first of its kind in the U.S., according to Reuters. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to Equilibrium, a newsletter that tracks the growing global battle over the future of sustainability. We're Saul Elbein and Sharon Udasin. Send us tips and feedback. A friend forward this newsletter to you? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\nToday we’ll start with new findings on Mars by NASA’s Perseverance rover, followed by a look at why Texas’s head oil regulator is crowing about his state’s war on “woke capital.” Then we’ll see why deadly heat might be here to stay. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRover reveals water-altered rocks on Mars  \n\n\n\nNASA’s Perseverance rover has spent the past year collecting Martian rock samples — an endeavor that could provide long-awaited answers about the planet’s geological history.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd while scientists will have to wait a decade for the arrival of those samples back to Earth, they are already making some key discoveries by means of the rover.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSurprise discovery: A surprise finding, presented in a study in Science on Thursday, was the presence of “igneous cumulate rocks,” the authors explained.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat are those? Such rocks form by the cooling of molten magma, according to the scientists.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey’re the best type of rocks for precise age determination.&nbsp;&nbsp;The rocks also show evidence of having been altered by water.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nProbing past life: “From a sampling perspective, this is huge,” co-lead author David Shuster, a professor of earth and planetary science at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe evidence of water alteration is something that scientists “are very excited about,” added Shuster.&nbsp;&nbsp;This finding, he continued, could provide insight into the environment that “could potentially have supported life at some point.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhere did Perseverance find the rocks? The rover explored four sites on the floor of the Jezero Crater, just north of the Martian equator, according to the study.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJezero was an ideal target because it contained what appeared to be a river delta that formed inside a lake bed.&nbsp;Such a landscape could provide insight into how long ago water flowed on the planet’s surface.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat specifics can the rocks reveal? “One great value of the igneous rocks we collected is that they will tell us about when the lake was present in Jezero,” co-lead author Kenneth Farley, a geochemist at Caltech, said in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis knowledge, Farley continued, will help scientists address some major questions:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhen was the planet’s climate conducive to lakes and rivers on its surface?&nbsp;&nbsp;When did Mars develop the very cold and dry conditions that exist today?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA decade of anticipation: While some of this research can occur remotely, precise calculations as to when geological layers formed can only be revealed by lab analysis on Earth, the authors acknowledged.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut that will involve very long-distance shipping.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe European Space Agency’s “Earth Return Orbiter” and NASA’s “Sample Retrieval Lander” will carry the samples back to Earth, and have respective launch dates of Fall 2027 and Summer 2028, according to NASA.  The samples are expected to arrive on Earth in 2033, the agency confirmed. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTexas oil regulator joins war against ESG  \n\n\n\nTexas’s leading oil and gas regulator on Thursday applauded a new push by the state against companies deemed environmental, social and governance (ESG) “extremists” like BlackRock and UBS.\n\n\n\nWhile these companies have continued to inject billions into fossil fuel development,&nbsp;the Texas Railroad Commission accused them of attempts to starve the industry of capital.&nbsp;It's the latest attack on an investment strategy that Republican leaders increasingly tar as financially irresponsible and politically motivated.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCalling on reinforcements: “I’m thrilled to see my conservative colleagues join the defense against ‘woke’ Wall Street bankers,” Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Wayne Christian said in the statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Rally the troops: Here in Texas is where we will draw the line against ESG’s detrimental impact on oil and gas,” he added. \n\n\n\nCatching up: Christian’s statement is part of a larger state campaign against banks that the Republican leadership accuses of boycotting oil and gas.\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, State Comptroller Glenn Hegar banned state and local entities from doing business with 10 banks that the state accused of boycotting oil and gas, the Texas Tribune reported.&nbsp;That’s part of a larger Republican move against ESG, which statewide party members portray in militaristic terms as a threat to fossil fuels, as The Hill reported over the weekend.\n\n\n\n“I am leading the charge on this, but there is an army behind me,” West Virginia State Treasurer Riley Moore told The Hill.  \n\n\n\nFalling on deaf ears: Texas’s ban is “not a fact-based judgment,” a BlackRock spokesperson told the Tribune.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“BlackRock does not boycott fossil fuels — investing over $100 billion in Texas energy companies on behalf of our clients proves that,” the spokesperson added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo read the full story, please click here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeadly heat to surge by 2100: study  \n\n\n\nMuch of the world will face an uptick in deadly heat waves by the end of the century, even if countries manage to meet their agreed-upon emission reduction goals, a new study has found. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nWidespread heat: Such heat events will be three to 10 times more common in 2100 than they are today in the U.S., Western Europe, China and Japan, according to the study, published in Communications Earth &amp; Environment on Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd that’s regardless of efforts to keep global warming below 2 degrees Celsius(3.6 degrees Fahrenheit).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGlobal commitments may not be enough: As part of the Paris climate agreement — signed at the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference — participating countries agreed to adhere to the 2-degree Celsius limit. \n\n\n\nTo improve their chance of success, each nation submitted its own climate action plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions.&nbsp;&nbsp;But the authors of Thursday’s study fear that these efforts will be insufficient to minimize an increase in temperatures.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRarities could become the norm: “The record-breaking heat events of recent summers will become much more common in places like North America and Europe,” lead author Lucas Vargas Zeppetello, a doctoral student at the University of Washington at the time of the study, said in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“For many places close to the equator, by 2100 more than half the year will be a challenge to work outside,” added Zeppetello, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at Harvard University.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExtreme danger: Zeppetello and his colleagues evaluated projections for the future “heat index” — a combination of air temperature and humidity that measures the impact of heat on the human body.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA “dangerous” heat index is defined by the National Weather Service as103 degrees Fahrenheit.&nbsp;&nbsp;An “extremely dangerous” heat index is 124 degrees Fahrenheit and is considered unsafe to humans for any amount of time.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy 2053, conditions above 125 Fahrenheit will be at least occasionally present in over 1,000 U.S. counties, The Hill reported earlier this month.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTropics, equator at greatest risk: Looking toward the tropics, the authors found that even if countries met their Paris agreement commitments, these regions could see their “dangerous” days double — covering half the year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd in worst-case circumstances — in which emissions remain unchecked until 2100 — “extremely dangerous” conditions could become common near the equator, particularly in in sub-Saharan Africa and India, the authors determined.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo read the full story, please click here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAustralia’s Black Summer fires fortified ozone hole \n\n\n\nAustralia’s massive 2020 Black Summer bushfire, prolonged a spinning hole in the ozone above Antarctica  a new study has found.  \n\n\n\nThe blazes around New Years 2020 were particularly large, giving birth to what the report described as a massive smoke infused thunderstorm. \n\n\n\nLike an eruption: The study, published in Scientific Reports on Thursday, showed how the massive fires taking place under climate change can grow to the scale of meteorologically significant events.  \n\n\n\nSuch growth can influence weather and atmospheric phenomenon far from the site of the fires.&nbsp;One such storm created a vortex that maintained shape for two months, helping inject, nearly a million tons of soot and other particulate into the stratosphere&nbsp;The last such soot-caused warming event was the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHeating air, killing ozone: But the fires also had a contradictory, cooling impact — which helped give new strength to an old environmental threat.   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBUSHFIRES BRING BACK BLAST FROM THE PAST \n\n\n\nThe chemicals released by fire — like those emitted by volcanos — are also destructive to the ozone layer, which shields the earth from solar radiation, the scientists noted.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ozone layer is a high-altitude belt marked by higher than usual presence of ozone, or triads of oxygen atoms fused together.&nbsp;An unusual and strangely stable “hole” in the ozone above Antarctica reached near record proportions in the period before the fires — and stuck around unusually long after them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat Antarctic \"hole\" is the same one that aroused alarm in the 1980s, leading to the banning of the refrigerant chemicals chlorofluorocarbons under the 1987 Montreal Protocol, according to NASA’s Earth Observatory.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe hole is actually an area of lower ozone concentrations above Antarctica.&nbsp;The layer is not expected to fully recover until 2041.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBy 2021, the hole had grown to larger than average — reaching the size of North America, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEnd result: The study released Thursday argues that the bushfires were responsible for that growth, as they disrupted a complex relationship between high altitude ozone layers and the polar vortex.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe breakdown of ozone by chemicals that the bushfires released helped keep the existing ozone hole in place longer than usual.    To read the full story, please click here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThursday Threats\n\n\n\nPakistan’s “epic” flood disaster impacts tens of millions, wolf pups carry the weight of their species’ survival in the wild and how climate change cranked up the damage from Hurricane Harvey. \n\n\n\nThirty million impacted by Pakistan’s record monsoon&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPakistan’s climate change minister said the country’s record monsoon rains have affected more than 30 million people in just a few weeks and put the country’s south “underwater,” Reuters reported. Minister Sherry Rehman called the flooding “a climate-induced humanitarian disaster of epic proportions,” according to Reuters.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMexican wolves survival may rest on a few tiny pups&nbsp;\n\n\n\nConservation groups transported Mexican wolf pups from their birthplace in the El Paso Zoo to a new home with a wild pack in the mountains — part of an attempt to keep the critically endangered population from vanishing, The Washington Post reported. “Rarely is conservation so hands-on,” a zoo veterinarian said, rubbing one of the pups with a wet cotton ball to encourage her to urinate. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nClimate change worsened Hurricane Harvey’s damage, with disproportionate effects&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWithout the impacts of climate change, 50-percent fewer homes in Houston’s Harris County would have been flooded by Hurricane Harvey in 2017, according to a study in Nature Communications. The research, from Louisiana State University and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, also found patterns of racial and economic disparities among those most affected. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease visit The Hill’s Sustainability section online for the web version of this newsletter and more stories.

        "description": "Actor Ben Savage is running for a seat on the city council in West Hollywood, Calif., saying he wants to “restore faith” in local government with “reasonable, innovative and compassionate” solutions to the city’s problems.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSavage, who starred as Cory Matthews on the ABC sitcom “Boy Meets World” from 1993 to 2000, says on his campaign website that he is an 18-year resident of the city, as well as a union member and concerned citizen who wants to produce results for West Hollywood. \n\n\n\n“We need to increase and expand access to all the great opportunities West Hollywood affords, by ensuring that&nbsp;every member of the community has the tools they need to succeed,” he said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSavage’s website states that his priorities include enhancing community safety by providing law enforcement with the resources they need to protect community members while increasing funding for community safety partners like health services and clinical case workers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe said he wants to fight to support renters’ rights to keep them in their homes despite rising prices and to expand housing services that the city offers.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“West Hollywood is known all over the world as a warm and supportive city,” the website states. “We value diversity and community above all. But as housing costs rise, we are failing to live up to those values.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSavage also emphasized that he is not part of “the political machine” and does not have an interest in serving interest groups. He said the city needs new leaders to tackle the issues it is facing.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSavage reportedly has some prior experience in the political realm, as he interned for former Sen. Arlen Specter (D) of Pennsylvania in 2003 while studying political science at Stanford University. \n\n\n\nSavage’s campaign did not immediately return a request from The Hill for further comment.",

        "link": "https://thehill.com/policy/energy-environment/3616030-california-approves-2035-sales-ban-for-gas-cars/",
        "description": "The California Air Resources Board voted on Thursday to ban the sale of gas-powered cars starting in 2035.\n\n\n\nThe state’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule would ratchet up the proportion of electric or non-emitting cars required to be sold in the state annually, until new sales must be 100 percent electric starting in 2035. \n\n\n\nThe rule is expected to have impacts beyond California’s borders, as other states can also adopt the standards. Officials from New York, Oregon, Washington state and Rhode Island told CNN that they plan to adopt California’s rule.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe measure is aimed at both limiting the state’s contribution to climate change, and also bettering public health by exposing fewer people to pollution like smog.\n\n\n\n“California now has a groundbreaking, world-leading plan to achieve 100 percent zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035. It’s ambitious, it’s innovative, it’s the action we must take if we’re serious about leaving this planet better off for future generations,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said in a statement shared with The Hill.\n\n\n\nThe Air Resources Board found that battery-electric vehicles are likely to be about even cost-wise with gas-powered vehicles by 2030, and estimated that by 2035, consumers are likely to save $7,900 in maintenance and operational costs over the first 10 years of electric vehicle ownership. \n\n\n\nJohn Bozzella, president of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, an auto industry trade group, told The Hill Wednesday that it’s not clear whether the targets are realistic.\n\n\n\n“Whether or not these requirements are realistic or achievable is directly linked to external factors like inflation, charging and fuel infrastructure, supply chains, labor, critical mineral availability and pricing, and the ongoing semiconductor shortage,” he said\n\n\n\nThe ban was also criticized by many high-profile conservatives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Ridiculous! Banning gasoline-powered vehicles will hurt all Americans,” tweeted Texas Gov. Greg Abbott (R). “No wonder so many people from California have moved to the Lone Star State.”",

Hints in speeches, leaks, and early access to reporters at major publications all pave the way for the eventual confirmation. But on Thursday, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) dropped a big one that seemed to take everyone by surprise. Starting in 2026, any scientific publication that receives federal funding will need to be openly accessible on the day it's published.\nThe move has the potential to further shake up the scientific publishing industry, which has already adopted preprint archives, similar mandates from other funding organizations, and greatly expanded access to publications during the pandemic.\nThe change was announced by Alondra Nelson, acting head of the OSTP (a permanent director is in the process of Senate confirmation). The formal policy is laid out in an accompanying memorandum.Read 10 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "description": "A Hennepin County jury found Jerry Westrom guilty Thursday in the 1993 murder of Jeanne Ann Childs. The jury deliberated for approximately two hours following closing arguments by the prosecution and defense attorneys.Betty Eakman, Jeanne Childs&#x27; mother, expressed relief after jurors convicted Jerry Westrom, 56, of fatally stabbing Childs in 1993. Matt Sepic | MPR NewsInvestigators reopened the cold case and the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension sent old DNA samples to forensic genealogists that eventually implicated Westrom. The 56-year-old from Isanti, Minn., was charged with first-degree premeditated murder of Childs, who was stabbed more than five dozen times in the apartment in the Horn Towers complex she used for sex work.In his 90-minute closing argument, Assistant Hennepin County Attorney Darren Borg said forensic evidence introduced during the week-long trial proves that Westrom left his footprints in Childs&#x27; blood near her body, and that semen in Childs’ bed and bathroom belonged to Westrom.Jurors had the option of convicting Westrom of second-degree murder, but Borg said the defendant’s actions were premeditated, and he urged the five women and seven men to find Westrom guilty of the more serious charge.“What else are you intending to do to another human being when you cut, stab, and slice them 65 times?” Borg asked. Describing the crime in graphic detail, Borg said Childs suffered a stab wound to her chest that broke her breastbone and destroyed her heart, and in a “gratuitous parting shot,” the attacker slashed her abdomen even after inflicting fatal wounds. The case lay dormant for decades until Bureau of Criminal Apprehension investigators processed crime scene evidence for DNA and sent it to forensic genealogists who have access to millions of samples sent in by people interested in tracing their family history. Former FBI Special Agent Chris Boeckers testified Tuesday about getting a call from a genealogist at MyHeritage.com who reported getting a “fabulous match.”Boeckers said the company connected the crime scene DNA to Westrom and his brother, but because the profile belonged to a person with brown eyes, which Westrom has, investigators soon ruled out his younger sibling. Jerry Arnold WestromCourtesy of Hennepin County Sheriff&#x27;s OfficeTo get a contemporary sample of Westrom’s DNA, Boeckers described how he and the late Minneapolis Police Sgt. Chris Karakostas followed Westrom for three weeks in early 2019, including to several college hockey games in which his daughter played. Their patience paid off at an ice arena in suburban Milwaukee. After eating food from a concession stand, Westrom wiped his mouth with a napkin and tossed it in a wastebasket. A child with a half-finished slurpee was headed for the same trash can, so Boeckers moved quickly to retrieve the napkin. According to prosecutors, BCA investigators matched the DNA left on a shirt, washcloth, and blanket in 1993 to the sample the detectives collected nearly 26 years later.In their closing argument, defense attorneys Steve Meshbesher and Andrew Tyler tried to dismantle the government’s case. They noted that DNA evidence from several other people found in Childs’ apartment was never identified, and that the state did not produce evidence indicating when Westrom left his DNA there. “When were those deposited?” Tyler asked. “An hour before she was murdered? A day before she was murdered? A week before she was murdered? We don’t know.” Tyler also questioned another key piece of the state’s evidence, bloody footprints in Childs’ bedroom that investigators linked to Westrom. Tyler said a fingerprint expert who testified for the government disagreed with Minneapolis police and was unable to identify three of the four footprints left at the scene.Ever since prosecutors charged Westrom in 2019, defense attorneys argued that many men visited Childs’ apartment and any could have been her killer. In court documents, Meshbesher listed five possible alternative perpetrators, but Judge Juan Hoyos allowed the defense to mention only one of them, Arthur Gray, to jurors. Gray, who’s deceased, lived in the apartment with Childs. Meshbesher reminded jurors that a DNA from hair found on Childs’ hand matched Gray’s DNA.“Somebody sick, pathological murdered her,” Meshbesher said while pointing to his client. “That guy isn’t the guy.”Westrom faces an automatic sentence of life in prison without the possibility of parole.",

        "description": "The Phillies placed starter Zack Wheeler on the 15-day injured list, retroactive to August 22, with tendinitis in his right forearm. Bailey Falter is expected to start tomorrow in his place.\nAside from a brief stay on the COVID list in May, Wheeler has remained on the active roster since signing with Philadelphia heading into the 2020 season. While any mention of forearm discomfort for a pitcher is eyebrow-raising, the Phils don&#8217;t seem particularly concerned. President of baseball operations Dave Dombrowski told reporters that Wheeler was willing to pitch through the issue, but the club is hopeful that by skipping two starts, he can put it in the rearview mirror (via Alex Coffey of the Philadelphia Inquirer and Todd Zolecki of MLB.com).\nLast year&#8217;s NL Cy Young runner-up, Wheeler has remained a pivotal part of the starting five this season. Through 23 starts, he owns a 3.07 ERA with a 26.7% strikeout rate. The right-hander&#8217;s production isn&#8217;t quite at the level it was last year, but he ranks among the top 30 hurlers (minimum 100 innings) in ERA and strikeout percentage. Any downturn in performance is essentially attributable to this month, as Wheeler has a 4.44 ERA over his past four starts after carrying a 2.77 mark into August.\nFalter seems likely to plug the rotation gap for a couple turns through the rotation, with the hope that Wheeler returns at full strength for the season&#8217;s final month. The Phillies have been one of baseball&#8217;s hottest teams, and they carry a 69-55 record into play tonight. Philadelphia is in possession of the second Wild Card spot in the National League, holding a 3 1/2 game cushion over the Brewers (with the Padres in between the two clubs).",

        "description": "We&#8217;ve slowly come around to a given that Joe Biden is very unpopular but that in the peculiar politics of 2022 it simply doesn&#8217;t matter. A few weeks ago I told a friend that I expected Biden&#8217;s approval numbers to surge from just under 40% to about 45% after the mini-BBB (aka, Inflation Reduction Act) passed. After that, I told this person it was less clear. Why? A lot of Biden&#8217;s unpopularity was tied Democratic partisans who were pissed off that he wasn&#8217;t successful enough as a Democrat. That&#8217;s how you can have Biden flatlining while Democrats are doing pretty well on the generic ballot poll and in lots of Senate races. Pass the mini-BBB, pass the CHIPS bill, get some good news on economic outlook and you can expect his support among Democrats to rise fairly quickly. It&#8217;s low-hanging fruit.",

        "description": "The Department of Treasury and the Israeli Ministry of Finance announced on Thursday a bilateral agreement formalizing and enhancing the cybersecurity partnership between the countries. \n\n\n\nThe agreement follows Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo’s visit to Israel last fall, when he established a bilateral partnership geared towards protecting the financial sector from cyberattacks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOn his trip, Adeyemo also launched a bilateral cyber task force with Israel to combat ransomware threats against the financial industry.\n\n\n\nIn the agreement, both nations pledged to share information related to cyber threats targeting the financial sector, train staff in the cybersecurity field, and conduct cross-border cybersecurity exercises.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This partnership has already resulted in the sharing of real time cyber threat data to prevent the spread of ransomware and other cyberattacks from impacting the U.S. financial sector,” Adeyemo said in a statement on Thursday. \n\n\n\nThe agreement also follows President Biden’s trip to the Middle East last month, during which he pledged to expand and strengthen cyber cooperation with Israel and Saudi Arabia. Experts saw the move as a response to the rising digital threat from Iran — a common adversary of all three countries. \n\n\n\nThough not yet at the level of Israel, Iran has proven capable of launching an array of cyberattacks, ranging from website defacement and distributed denial-of-service attacks to ransomware and cyber espionage, experts said.\n\n\n\nIsraeli officials announced in June that it plans to build a “cyber dome,” a national defense system intended to fight against Iranian digital attacks.\n\n\n\n“Iran has become our dominant rival in cyber,” the head of Israel’s National Cyber Directorate, Gaby Portnoy, said during a conference in Tel Aviv. “We see them, we know how they work, and we are there.”\n\n\n\nIsrael, however, is also facing criticism in the cyber realm. Israeli spyware firm NSO Group has been accused of selling its spyware to governments who use the tool to spy on dissidents, political rivals, journalists and human right activists. \n\n\n\nThe backlash, which included being blacklisted by the U.S. Department of Commerce,&nbsp;forced the company to restructure, replacing its CEO and laying off about 13 percent of its workforce.",

        "description": "Updated: Aug. 26 | Published: Aug. 25The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission this week approved site permits and related transmission routes for the Big Bend Wind and Red Rock Solar projects in southwest Minnesota. It will be the state’s largest hybrid renewable energy project.When complete the sites will produce about 300 megawatts of windpower and up to 60 megawatts of solar generation. The project will install 55 turbines at the Big Bend wind project and solar panels on more than 480 acres on nearby land for the Red Rock solar project. The PUC also approved a permit for an 18-mile transmission line to connect to the power grid. The projects will be built in Cottonwood, Martin, and Watonwan counties. The project, which was proposed back in 2017, worked its way through the regulatory process. However, concerns were raised by stakeholders, such as Lower Sioux Indian Community, Upper Sioux Indian Community and the Minnesota Historical Society, about the proximity of wind turbines to Jeffers Petroglyphs in Comfrey, Minn. A carving of a hand is revealed with distilled water at Jeffers Petroglyphs in Comfrey, Minn., on Tuesday, March 30, 2021.Evan Frost | MPR NewsThe site is home to an estimated 5,000 sacred rock carvings made over the span of 7,000 years on an outcropping of Sioux quartzite. Today, it’s still an active site of prayer and ceremony for many Native American people.The Lower Sioux Indian Community, the Upper Sioux Indian Community, and the Minnesota Historical Society were able to reach a settlement agreement addressing concerns about the visual impacts to the site, which allowed the project to proceed. “We’re excited to receive all the applicable permits, via a unanimous vote of the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission,” Apex Clean Energy wrote in a statement. “We are especially thankful to the tribe for their coordination with the project in finding a mutually acceptable solution for bringing this important project to southern Minnesota.”The company stated the Big Bend Wind and Red Rock Solar projects would generate enough to power about 138,000 homes and “hundreds of millions of dollars in local investment, tens of millions of dollars in local tax revenue, and hundreds of jobs during construction.”Robert Larsen, president of Lower Sioux Indian Community, said the agreement reached was a compromise and the best outcome possible.“For centuries, tribal interests in protecting their homes, their people, their histories, and their ways of life have been set aside for pursuit of progress,” Larsen said. “Railroads, agriculture, mineral development, industrialization, trade — each has carried this moniker and each has come at great cost to tribes across the country. Lower Sioux is no stranger to this history.&quot;Robert Larsen, tribal chairman of Lower Sioux Indian Community.Hannah Yang | MPR News FileLarsen added that this was one of the first times that he felt the PUC heard tribal voices in a project’s planning process. He hopes it’ll be a model for future engagement with other companies seeking to advance energy projects in the area.“This commission has taken a bold step in deviating from the status quo. Throughout these proceedings, it has fostered sovereign-to-sovereign cooperation by encouraging to engage and by deferring to them,&quot; Larsen said. &quot;This Commission has created space for tribal interests in the pursuit of progress and the result is an unprecedented settlement, while by no means perfect, is an acceptable compromise for Lower Sioux that allows for a viable project, while mitigating its impacts.”Kevin Maijala, senior director of learning initiatives at the Minnesota Historical Society, said  having stakeholders involved earlier in the regulatory process helped strike a balance with supporting renewable energy projects and protecting historic and cultural sites in the state.Under the settlement reached in September 2021 Apex Clean Energy agreed to modify the  wind-turbine layout so almost none of the turbines will stand within 7 miles of the Petroglyphs. The agreement allows up to two turbines 6.5 miles from the site.Apex Clean Energy also will not apply for additional permits to develop wind turbines within 8 miles of the petroglyphs. “This is a good example of how historic preservation and protection of cultural resources can happen in collaboration both with Indigenous communities, as well as companies that are looking to create a project or do something in an area near some of our best resources,” Maijala said. “That collaboration is a big part of the story. It’s not unique, but it’s not very common either.”Maijala added while visitors may still see wind turbines far in the distance, the agreement uses a preservation tactic that mitigates the impact as much as possible. Signage will be added to the historic site to explain the projects.“From the visitor experience, it’ll be a little part of the landscape,” Maijala said. “But, it’ll also be a part of the interpretation, as we talk about the changing world around us and how this is an example of a good preservation tactic that we use by working with tribes and working with a company, Big Bend, to make sure we get the least impact possible.”In a release PUC Commission Chair Katie Sieben said the permitting, processing and dialogue held with communities was “very encouraging.”“The Public Utilities Commission is called on to make difficult decisions and community members feel heard, respected, and part of the process,” Sieban said. “It is rewarding to know that the Commission created a space for all voices to come together to help pave the way for the building of the largest hybrid project in the state.”",

        "description": "Exuberant over a string of recent legislative victories, and launching his midterm campaigning in earnest, President Joe Biden swaggered into Maryland on Thursday and excoriated his predecessor’s philosophy as “semi-fascism,” in what constituted an unusually pointed and highly charged denunciation of Republicans. “What we’re seeing now is either the beginning or the death knell of extreme MAGA philosophy,” Biden told Democratic donors in the Washington suburb of Rockville. Calling out those he labeled as “extreme” Republicans, Biden said: “It’s not just Trump, it’s the entire philosophy that underpins the — I’m going to say something, it’s like semi-fascism.” Later, at a national Democratic Party event before a few thousand people packed into a nearby high school gym, Biden added: “I respect conservative Republicans. I don’t respect these MAGA Republicans.” “There are not many real Republicans anymore,” Biden added. No president in recent memory has had a better month of August, lifting the mood inside the White House and injecting fresh hope across the party ahead of what long looked like a bleak midterm election. In recent weeks, Democrats have passed a slew of marquee bills filled with deliverables that Biden ticked through in his speeches. The president painted the last year-plus as something of an American comeback — and a recovery from the depths of the pandemic and economic turmoil: “We’ve come a long way,” he said. And after a recent stretch of self-isolation as he recovered from Covid, Biden appeared to relish the opportunity to close out the night by wading into the audience and spending several minutes grinning for selfies. Republicans called the president’s comment about fascism “despicable,” with a spokesperson for the GOP saying Americans are still “suffering” from high inflation. For Biden, spending the evening in a blue state with few competitive elections pointed to the careful calculation the White House faces in deploying him over the next 75 days. While the president’s approval numbers have ticked up of late, he still hovers around the low- to mid-40s, and many Democrats remain reluctant to appear with him. Onstage in Rockville, Biden highlighted his administration’s recent cancellation of student loan debt, as well as Democrats’ ongoing fight for abortion rights. He listed other campaign promises yet unfulfilled, including universal pre-K. At one point, he presided over a slideshow presentation that highlighted the plan of Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), the head of the Republican Party’s Senate campaign arm, to sunset federal programs every five years. Biden said that includes Medicare and Social Security. “The MAGA Republicans don’t just threaten our personal rights and economic security,” the president said. “They’re a threat to our very democracy. They refuse to accept the will of the people. They embrace political violence. They don’t believe in democracy.” Wading into the impact of his climate and health care legislation, Biden said that “the survival of our planet is on the ballot.” If Republicans win control of Congress, he noted, “it won’t matter where you live: Women won’t have the right to choose anywhere. Anywhere.” Earlier, he criticized the impact the Trump administration had on the United States’ stature in global politics, referring to Russian President Vladmir Putin’s recent aggression in Ukraine. “I underestimated how much damage the previous four years had done in terms of America’s reputation in the world,” Biden said. Biden’s rally brought in more than 3,600 people in a gym and two overflow rooms. The Democratic National Committee has reported record midterm fundraising for this point in the year, at $255 million for this cycle and $92 million for the year.",

        "description": "We’ve long known that Congress, an unwieldy institution subject to local and special-interest influence, often produces sloppy and ill-considered legislation. Well, move over sausage-making. It turns out that presidential diktat is just as prone to arbitrary and poorly-designed policy, at least judging by President Joe Biden’s unilateral move to implement a massive program of student-loan forgiveness of up to $20,000. What the policy lacks in fairness and coherence, it makes up for in dubious constitutionality. The legal analysis justifying it owes much to the sentiment of Teddy Roosevelt’s long-suffering attorney general Philander Knox. Asked for his opinion on one impending matter, he replied, “Ah, Mr. President, why have such a beautiful action marred by any taint of legality?” If our constitutional system is going to retain its vitality over the long term, the legality of presidential actions must — obviously — be an indispensable threshold question. Biden’s student loan forgiveness flagrantly fails it. It’s always a good sign that a president is exceeding his lawful authority if he spent a long time saying — or acting like — he knew he didn’t have the authority in question. Initially, Biden wanted Congress to pass debt forgiveness — understandably. Congress controls the purse strings and created the student loan programs in the first place. Prior to the last few years, when an influential sub-set of progressives including Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) began pushing the idea, no one would have imagined that the president could wave a magic debt-forgiveness wand. Just last year, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi poured scorn on this notion. “People think that the President of the United States has the power for debt forgiveness,” she said. “He does not. He can postpone. He can delay. But he does not have that power. That has to be an act of Congress.” “The President can’t do it,” she continued, quite categorically. “So that’s not even a discussion.” Actually, the search for some whisper of a justification was on, and the Biden administration has purported to find one in the 2003 HEROES Act. That legislation gives the secretary of education the authority to waive or modify rules related to student financial assistance during a war or other military operation or national emergency. The secretary can act “as may be necessary to ensure that affected individuals are not placed in a worse position financially in relation to that financial assistance because of their status as affected individuals.” It is telling that when Congress passed this act nearly 20 years ago after the 9/11 attacks and George W. Bush signed it into law, no one thought Washington had created the predicate for a sweeping imposition of debt forgiveness by the executive branch. The act passed the Republican House 421-1 and the Republican Senate by unanimous consent, not the usual legislative path for measures allowing for a student-debt jubilee. Who are the “affected individuals” under the HEROES Act? It is clear they are not supposed to be the entire population. As a summary of the legislation at Congress.gov notes, they are active-duty military personnel, National Guard troops, someone residing in a disaster area or someone who “suffered direct economic hardship as a direct result of a war or other military action or national emergency.” Congress was clearly seeking to hold harmless the Marine with student loans who might in the years ahead be spending significant time overseas in combat zones. The war or national emergency that Biden is using as a justification for his forgiveness is the pandemic. There is no doubt that it has caused considerable hardship and disruption. It simply can’t be true that everyone covered by the Biden program was a loser from the pandemic, though. What with the cascade of spending from Washington amounting to trillions of dollars, including direct checks and supplemental unemployment benefits, some people were better off during the pandemic. And what about students whose parents worked as executives for the big winners during the pandemic, say, Moderna, Netflix or Zoom? Their families might have experienced windfalls. If there’s no effort to distinguish winners from losers, then there’s no real effect to abide by the HEROEs act. Plus, the beneficiaries aren’t being prevented from finding themselves in a worse position, as the text of the legislation states; they are affirmatively being put in a better position. Furthermore, what justification is there under the HEROES act for having a completely arbitrary income cap of $125,000 for individuals and $250,000 for couples? Did no one making $125,001 suffer direct harm from the pandemic? If the Biden forgiveness ever goes up to the Supreme Court, it would run afoul of the Court’s admonition that Congress doesn’t hide “elephants in mouseholes,” or create massive changes via small, vague changes in the law. According to the Biden team, an overwhelming bipartisan majority in Congress wrestled a bull elephant — executive authority to forgive all student debt — into the tiniest of spaces without anyone knowing or even noticing itself. In sum, the legal justification for Biden’s move is so brazenly pretextual that it might make even Saul Goodman blush. Still, Biden’s gamble here could succeed. There is real doubt that anyone could establish direct harm from the policy sufficient to have standing in court to challenge it. Even if a party did get standing, the Biden forgiveness will have served its political purpose if it survives through the midterms and, even better, through 2024. Acting without obvious legal authority in the hopes that as a technical legal matter no one will be able to stop you isn’t a good way to govern. President Biden should leave the sausage-making to Congress, where it properly belongs.",

It was executed to perfection. Dias and Laporte, hardly the quickest or best on the turn, were hassled by Zaha, who scored the opener and caused the latter to be sent off in the first half. Then, after the break, Zaha’s slick footwork led to Conor Gallagher’s second for Palace. Can they do it again? Sure. Especially after Newcastle gave Pep Guardiola’s champions a hounding in last Sunday’s 3-3 thriller to suggest they are not quite at their finest.

Now she’s back with a new duet with John – and calling the shots in the studio• Read the Guardian review of Hold Me CloserThis July, in a small basement studio in Beverly Hills surrounded by candles, coloured lights, keyboards and her new husband, Britney Spears rebooted her music career. Six years since her last album, and nine months since she was freed from the conservatorship that had ruled her life for 13 years, she was at the home studio of producer Andrew Watt, recording her parts for Hold Me Closer – a duet with Elton John which mashes up perhaps his defining hit, 1971’s Tiny Dancer, with his 1992 song The One (and a dash of 1976’s Don’t Go Breaking My Heart).Spears arrived with her vocals warmed up and determined ideas about her contribution, and nailed the performance in less than two hours. “She sang fantastically,” says John from his house in the south of France. “Everyone was saying they don’t think she can sing any more. But I said, she was brilliant when she started so I think she can. And she did it, and I was so thrilled with what she did.” Continue reading...",

Last year the Dua Lipa-assisted Cold Heart fused Rocket Man, Sacrifice, Kiss the Bride and Where’s the Shoorah? Here, it’s Tiny Dancer mixed with The One and a dash of Don’t Go Breaking My Heart. Still, Hold Me Closer skips along nicely, a chunky bassline gliding through the song like a train of sequin-clad revellers at a 70s roller-disco. There are even some jazzy piano flourishes at the end for the Bösendorfer fetishists.But this is no ordinary streaming-friendly curio from a legend looking to fluff their back catalogue. Marking the return of Britney Spears on her first recording since the termination of her almost 14-year conservatorship last year, it comes tinged with something close to bittersweet; an example of what could have been if Spears’ megawatt pop-superstar shine hadn’t been dimmed all those years ago.

        "description": "While polarization remains fierce, the 117th Congress is nevertheless notching up more bipartisan cooperation than headlines might have you believe, eking out common ground on issues including gun control, infrastructure, and the strengthening of domestic supply chains for critical semiconductor chips.&nbsp;Upgrading digital infrastructure should be another area that nets wide bipartisan support.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGovernments across Europe, North America, and Asia have been fiercely debating how to sustainably fund costly new digital infrastructure networks to ensure their populations enjoy widespread internet access and unlock the full potential of 5G connectivity. It’s hard to overstate the importance of expanding access to digital infrastructure – without sustainable funding plans millions could become underconnected and left behind.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGetting massive technology companies to contribute to digital infrastructure roll outs and development could provide an answer, and recently both the US and the European Union have put these firms on notice.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe latest debate is over the fate of the FCC’s The Universal Service Fund (USF), a roughly $8 billion a year funding vehicle that ensures broadband infrastructure to underserved populations, which is facing financial untenability. Some of its programs include Connect America, which expands broadband networks to Americans living in rural geographies, Lifeline which helps subsidize phone and internet bills for low-income households, and E-Rate which provides heavily discounted internet access for deserving schools and libraries. Unfortunately, the vehicle’s funding mechanisms are outdated and unsustainable, and they hurt consumers at a time of spiraling inflation,&nbsp;jeopardizing the feasibility of these critical and popular programs.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBroadly speaking, the USF is funded by a tax on telecommunication companies, a significant portion of which is typically passed on to the consumer. While the mandate of USF has expanded to address the challenges of the internet age, its funding sources have not. This antiquated system draws from telephone revenue, a revenue base that has shrunk from a peak of $80 billion in the early 2000s to less than $30 billion today. This has directly hurt consumers as the customer contribution rate to pay for this tax has risen from 11 percent in 2007 to over 23 percent today.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTaxing horseshoes to pay for highways&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s ridiculous to levy a tax on phone companies (and their customers) to fund broadband programs. Further, this regressive tax acutely impacts landline phone subscribers, who are disproportionately older Americans. FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr said it well when he described the funding mechanism of USF akin to “taxing horseshoes to pay for highways”.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo the government’s credit, Congress has begun to consider new sources of funding for the USF program. In May, the Funding Affordable Internet with Reliable Contributions (FAIR) Act, successfully passed through the Senate Commerce Committee with bipartisan support. The FAIR Act will require studying the feasibility of expanding funding sources, notably “edge” technology companies who account for the vast majority of the world’s web traffic.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCongress should consider Big Tech as a primary candidate for new USF funding sources. Meta, Alphabet, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Netflix accounted for over 56 percent of all global data traffic last year. Further, and more directly related to traditional beneficiaries of USF programs, an in-depth study of rural broad brand providers spotlighted that just five video streaming entertainment providers—Netflix, YouTube, Amazon Prime, Disney+/Hulu and Microsoft Xbox, collectively the “Big Streamers”—drive 75 percent of total network traffic. With the advent of the metaverse, and its data intense applications, big technology companies' share of traffic will only increase — and with that, their revenues.  \n\n\n\nEnsuring tech companies contribute to broadband infrastructure development isn’t unique to the U.S. and has precedent in other countries. Europe in particular is eager to get Big Tech to contribute, perhaps in the form of direct payments to telecom operators. European investment per capita in 5G rollout is significantly lower than in the U.S. (€94.8 compared to €147.9 per year), and only 62 percent of Europeans can connect to 5G networks, compared with over 93 percent of Americans. Further, Europe’s telecoms sector is under more strain than its American counterpart and lacks the same private investment opportunities. As recession looms in Europe, this contribution could be critical to the resilience of European telecom networks and enable providers to eschew risky but lower-cost equipment providers like Huawei and deploy the infrastructure improvements necessary for unlocking widespread economic growth. Such actions will allow Europe to at least attempt to keep pace with their American counterparts. \n\n\n\nEchoing the U.S. debate, Europe’s internal market commissioner Thierry Breton put it best when he said that “The rules in place for twenty years are running out of steam, and operators no longer have the right return on their investments”, and that legislation to correct the imbalance will be rolled out by the end of the year. Providing ubiquitous and affordable access to future communication networks should be a priority for every government. It is a bipartisan matter that touches equity, economic prosperity, and national security. Big technology firms who benefit the most from these networks should contribute to ensure their promise of a better future comes to fruition.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMatthew Weinberg is a Partner at Max Ventures, an early-stage venture capital firm based in New York City.

        "description": "The Department of Defense on Thursday released a much-anticipated plan aimed at reducing civilian casualties caused by U.S. military operations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWe’ll talk about the plan. Plus, a federal judge said he’ll release the affidavit that convinced him to approve a warrant to search former President Trump’s Florida home.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is Defense &amp; National Security, your nightly guide to the latest developments at the Pentagon, on Capitol Hill and beyond. For The Hill, I’m Jordan Williams. A friend forward this newsletter to you? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPentagon lays out long-awaited civilian harm plan \n\n\n\nThe Pentagon on Thursday released a long-awaited plan aimed at reducing civilian casualties caused by U.S. military operations and proposed a better way to report and respond to incidents should they occur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 36-page Civilian Harm Mitigation and Response Action Plan, approved by Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin earlier this week, directs sweeping changes in military planning, training, doctrine and policy for all future conflicts, the Pentagon’s top spokesperson Brig. Gen. Patrick Ryder told reporters.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nInside the plan: The idea is to install at all operational levels people “who are trained to have an understanding of civilian harm, the aspects of civilian harm mitigation, and operational planning,” at the start of any mission, Ryder said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe military’s Center of Excellence will serve as the hub “that will provide expertise at a centralized location, but then that will be dispersed throughout the Department of Defense,” to include some estimated 150-plus individuals that will have special training on the matter, he added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat’s not in the plan? The plan notably does not include any guidance or changes as to punishment should an individual or multiple people inaccurately or inappropriately order a strike that kills civilians.   \n\n\n\nThe Pentagon did not punish any individuals related to the Kabul strike as it found that those involved had followed the correct procedures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhere the issue came from: The document comes nearly a year after a botched Aug. 29, 2021 attack in Kabul, Afghanistan, killed 10 people, including seven children, causing public outcry and significant scrutiny over U.S. drone strikes.  \n\n\n\nThat deadly blunder, coupled with a November investigation by The New York Times detailing a U.S. airstrike that killed 70 civilians, prompted Austin in January to order the Defense Department to develop a civilian harm mitigation “action plan.” The New York Times reported allegations that top officers and civilian officials tried to hide the casualties in the drone strike.   \n\n\n\nA ‘moral imperative:’ In a memo included in the plan, Austin said the protection of civilians is both a “strategic priority” and a “moral imperative.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We will ensure that we are well prepared to prevent, mitigate and respond to civilian harm in current and future conflicts,” Austin wrote, calling the changes “both ambitious and necessary.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the full story here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge to release redacted FBI Mar-a-Lago affidavit \n\n\n\nA federal magistrate judge on Thursday said he would release a redacted version of the affidavit that convinced him to approve a warrant to search former President Trump’s Florida home.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Justice Department is ordered to file a public version of its redacted document by noon Friday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nGood cause to redact: The decision from Judge Bruce Reinhart comes after he ordered the Justice Department to propose redactions to a document whose full release they argued would compromise their ongoing investigation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I find that the Government has met its burden of showing a compelling reason/good cause to seal portions of the Affidavit,” Reinhart wrote, noting that it could reveal both the identities of witnesses, law enforcement agents, and uncharged parties as well as the investigation’s strategy, direction, scope. \n\n\n\nThe ‘least onerous alternative:’ Reinhart’s Thursday ruling offers little insight into what the public may glean from the release, but he ultimately decided it was “the least onerous alternative to sealing the entire affidavit.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat we already know: The Justice Department previously unsealed portions of the warrant related to the search of Mar-a-Lago earlier this month, indicated that the government seized 11 different sets of classified materials, along with other information about Trump’s decision to pardon ally Roger Stone.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe warrant also indicated that Trump was under investigation for a possible violation of the Espionage Act, as well as two other statutes: one that bars concealing, removing and mutilating government documents, and another that prohibits similar actions when done “with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence [an] investigation.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the story here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden, Zelensky discuss concerns over nuclear plant \n\n\n\nPresident Biden and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky spoke Thursday about a new $3 billion security assistance package for Ukraine, and the two leaders also demanded Russia relinquish control of the Zaporizhzhya nuclear power plant, according to the White House.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWho controls the plant? Russia has controlled the Zaporizhzhya plant since early on in the war. But fighting between Russian and Ukrainian forces has intensified around the nuclear plant, raising concerns about the potential for a disastrous mishap.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe plant, which is the largest in Europe, was temporarily disconnected from the power grid on Thursday as a result of fires that broke out around lines connecting it to the grid.&nbsp;&nbsp;International inspectors from the IAEA are seeking access to the plant.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n‘Return full control:’ Biden “congratulated Ukraine on its Independence Day and expressed his admiration for the people of Ukraine, who have inspired the world as they defended their country’s sovereignty over the past six months,” according to a White House readout of the phone call.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The two leaders also called for Russia to return full control of the Zaporizhzhya Nuclear Power Plant to Ukraine and for International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) access to the plant,” the readout said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat else was discussed? In a tweet, Zelensky said that he thanked Biden on Thursday for the “unwavering” U.S. security and financial support for Ukraine amid the Russian war, which passed the six-month mark on Wednesday. He did not specifically mention the Zaporizhzhya plant.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We discussed Ukraine’s further steps on our path to the victory over the aggressor and importance of holding Russia accountable for war crimes,” Zelensky said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead the story here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS forces strike Iran-affiliated militants   \n\n\n\nU.S. forces struck at Iran-affiliated militants after rocket attacks on bases in northeastern Syria left three American troops injured, the military said Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIn a statement, U.S. Central Command (CENTCOM) said American forces struck at the militants with AH-64 Apache attack helicopters, AC-130 gunships and M777 artillery following attacks on Mission Support Site Conoco and Mission Support Site Green Village.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFour “enemy fighters” were killed, and seven enemy rocket launchers were destroyed, the statement added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We will respond appropriately and proportionally to attacks on our servicemembers,” CENTCOM commander Michael Kurilla said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“No group will strike at our troops with impunity.

        "description": "It’s a good day to be an American gaming enthusiast. Sony just announced plans to bump up the price of the PlayStation 5 in almost all global markets, but not the U.S.\n\n\n\nIn health care news, the Biden administration, seemingly bolstered by recent court rulings on the state level, has vowed to take further action to protect abortion access.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelcome to Overnight Health Care, where we’re following the latest moves on policy and news affecting your health. For The Hill, we’re Peter Sullivan, Nathaniel Weixel and Joseph Choi. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBiden vows more abortion action after state rulings \n\n\n\nThe White House on Thursday hailed a ruling by a federal judge in Idaho late Wednesday that temporarily halted part of the state’s abortion ban from taking effect, while vowing further action to safeguard access to abortions in emergency situations.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Yesterday, a federal Idaho district court determined that women in Idaho will continue to receive life-saving and health-preserving emergency care — including abortion care,”&nbsp;White House press secretary&nbsp;Karine Jean-Pierre&nbsp;said in a statement. “This ruling will prevent serious harm to women in Idaho.” &nbsp;&nbsp;The ruling was a major win for the Biden administration. But it came just hours after a court in Texas had the exact opposite ruling.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSplit screen: The White House sharply criticized an&nbsp;earlier ruling in Texas&nbsp;blocking guidance issued by the Biden administration requiring doctors to offer care to pregnant people in emergencies, including abortions, even if it conflicts with state law. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe guidance was released by the Department of Health and Human Services in July.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat’s next? “Americans across the country and of all backgrounds agree that women should have the right to make their own personal health care decisions and to receive life-saving medical care, without interference from politicians, and the President will continue to take action to protect women’s access to lifesaving health care,” Jean-Pierre said Thursday. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJean-Pierre did not specify what further actions President Biden could take. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJudge blocks part of Idaho’s abortion ban\n\n\n\nA federal judge late Wednesday temporarily blocked Idaho’s abortion ban from taking effect during medical emergencies, ruling that it conflicts with federal law.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nU.S. District Judge B. Lynn Winmill wrote that the state’s near total ban on abortion violates the federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, a law that requires providers to offer medically stabilizing treatment in an emergency, even if that care is an abortion.&nbsp;&nbsp;Much of the abortion ban will take effect Thursday, but the state will not be allowed to prosecute anyone who is performing an abortion in an emergency medical situation while the lawsuit from the Justice Department is argued.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPartial victory: The lawsuit marked the Biden administration’s most aggressive action on preserving abortion access ever since the Supreme Court overturnedRoe v. Wade.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House touted the ruling as a win, even though the rest of the law was still allowed to take effect.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnder the ban, abortion is illegal&nbsp;even in the case of a medical emergency or complication,&nbsp;with exceptions&nbsp;for rape, incest and saving the life of the mother, and Idaho doctors could be criminally prosecuted for performing the procedure.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIdaho was one of three states, alongside Tennessee and Texas, with “trigger laws” that went into effect on Thursday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCOURT UPHOLDS INJUNCTION BLOCKING GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE BAN\n\n\n\nA federal court has upheld an injunction temporarily blocking an Arkansas law banning gender-affirming health care for transgender youth under 18, ruling that a lower court did not abuse its power in granting the injunction.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals on Thursday ruled the preliminary injunction that has blocked the enforcement of Arkansas’ “Save Adolescents from Experimentation (SAFE) Act” for more than a year will remain in place until an ongoing legal battle over its constitutionality is settled.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow we got here:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe measure, passed by the legislature in March 2021, prohibits doctors in the state from providing or recommending gender-affirming medical care including puberty blockers and hormones to minors. Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson (R) vetoed the bill, also referred to as Act 626, last year, calling it a “vast government overreach.” Hutchinson’s veto was quickly overridden by the legislature, but the law was blocked by a district court judge before it could take effect. Lawyers for the state appealed that decision, arguing that District Court Judge James M. Moody Jr. had abused the court’s discretion in issuing the injunction. \n\n\n\nOn Thursday, the higher court ruled the judge had not. The court also affirmed arguments made by plaintiffs in the case that transgender youth will suffer “irreparable harm” absent a preliminary injunction and enforcing the law would prohibit “medical treatment that conforms with the recognized standard of care.”\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPFIZER’S RSV VAX CANDIDATE SAFE, EFFECTIVE IN OLDER ADULTS\n\n\n\nPfizer announced that their new RSV vaccine candidate is more than 85 percent effective in preventing severe lower respiratory tract illness in older adults, according to a statement on&nbsp;the company’s website. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey define severe illness as three or more symptoms. The vaccine candidate is more than 66 percent effective at preventing illness overall, defined as two or more symptoms. The company tested this vaccine candidate in about 37,000 people ages 60 and older and are looking to recruit a total of 40,000.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRespiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, is a group of viruses that cause cold-like symptoms, including runny nose, coughing and sneezing. When it causes severe illness, it can lead to bronchiolitis (inflammation in the small airways in the lungs) or pneumonia (infection in the lungs), in children under the age of 1, according to the&nbsp;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere are a few companies working on RSV vaccine candidates, and Pfizer in particular has announced results from their phase 3 clinical trials of their version called RSVpreF.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe potential impact: Worldwide, RSV is suggested to be the reason for hospitalizations of 336,000 older adults each year, resulting in 14,000 deaths, according to a study from 2020.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFauci compares monkeypox outbreak to HIV epidemic\n\n\n\nThe White House’s chief medical adviser Anthony Fauci advised against making the same assumptions about the current monkeypox outbreak that were made during the early days of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nFauci and H. Clifford Lane, deputy director for clinical research and special projects at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID),&nbsp;published a piece&nbsp;in the New England Journal of Medicine on Thursday in which they reflected on the similarities between the monkeypox outbreak and the HIV/AIDS epidemic, which both men spent much of their careers studying.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe two researchers noted the obvious similarities, namely that most monkeypox cases have so far been detected among men who have sex with men. While the main mode of transmission for monkeypox is believed to be through prolonged skin-to-skin contact, they observed that some early data has suggested sexual transmission may play a role in the spread of the virus.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDon’t assume: “Given how little we know about the epidemiologic characteristics of the current outbreak, it is prudent to heed an observation made during the first year of the HIV/AIDS pandemic: ‘… any assumption that it will remain restricted to a particular segment of our society is truly an assumption without a scientific basis,'” Fauci and Lane wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTheir recommendations:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTo better understand the virus, the two infectious disease specialists called for further studies and surveys as well as continued surveillance of new cases.&nbsp;“Thus, the challenge to the public health and research communities during this time of emergency response is to ensure the efficient and equitable availability and distribution of existing countermeasures to those in need of them while at the same time conducting the rigorous studies needed to define what the clinical efficacy may be, understand any potential safety concerns, and guide proper utilization,” they wrote.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\n‘So much more to do’: A hospital system’s campaign to confront racism — and resistance to change — makes early strides (Stat) WHO: Monkeypox cases drop 21%, reversing month-long increase (AP) Buyer’s remorse could be creeping in for GOP on abortion (Washington Post) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTATE BY STATE\n\n\n\nTexans who perform abortions now face up to life in prison, $100,000 fine (Texas Tribune) D.C. schools expand covid vaccine mandate, unlike most other districts (Washington Post) Health officials: Three Ga. children with monkeypox caught it at home (The Atlanta Journal-Constitution) Minnesota set to become “abortion access island” in the Midwest, but for whom?

        "description": "Story at a glance\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Oklahoma English teacher resigned from her post Wednesday as the result of a state law banning critical race theory.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe teacher, Summer Boismier, was told along with other instructors in Norman Public Schools to cover books that were deemed inappropriate under the state law.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn response, Boismier covered the books and labeled them with a QR code that would connect students to the Brooklyn Public Library’s “Books Unbanned” program.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAn Oklahoma teacher said she was forced to resign over a state law banning books.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt the beginning of the school year, Summer Boismier, 34, was an English teacher at Norman High School located just south of Oklahoma City.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoismier told CNN that before the start of the school year, English teachers in the Norman Public Schools district were instructed to review books in the classroom libraries to check which titles might “elicit challenges” to a state law banning the instruction of critical race theory.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmerica is changing faster than ever! Add Changing America to your Facebook or Twitter feed to stay on top of the news.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTeachers were told to box up books or turn them around so that the spines faced the inside of classroom bookshelves, and away from student’s eyes, or to cover them up, Boismier told the outlet.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoismier decided to cover the books with butcher paper, labeling them as “Books the State Doesn’t Want You to Read” and placing a QR code on the covers that would connect students to the Brooklyn Public Library.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUnderneath the QR code she wrote, “Definitely don’t scan this!”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOnce there, students could sign up for a library card and take advantage of the library’s “Books Unbanned” program.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nEarlier this year, the Brooklyn Public Library announced that it would offer digital library cards to students between the ages of 13 and 21 across the country in response to the over 700 pieces of legislation introduced or passed banning or censoring classroom materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA concerned parent reached out to the school district about Boismier and a “potential issue regarding Oklahoma HB 1775,” Norman Public Schools spokesperson Wes Moody said in an email to Changing America.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMoody added that the concern centered on Boismier’s decision to use the class time and the classroom to make personal and political statements.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Like many educators, the teacher has concerns regarding censorship and book removal by the Oklahoma state legislature. However, as educators it is our goal to teach students to think critically, not to tell them what to think,” said Moody in the statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoismier told CNN that school district officials said the label and QR code made the books seem forbidden and that they didn’t want students to be encouraged to do anything illegal.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe English teacher added that she was put on administrative leave and during a Tuesday meeting she was scolded by administrators for making a political statement during class time.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMoody denied that Boismier was at any point suspended or put on administrative leave.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoismier told CNN she was told to return to the classroom on Wednesday but instead she resigned, the outlet reported.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBoismier hasn’t responded to questions from Changing America.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSince 2021, dozens of states have introduced or passed legislation controlling the instruction of critical race theory, or the idea that the country’s social institutions like the education system, criminal justice system, health care system and housing market are “laced with racism” and have rules, laws or regulations that have racism embedded in them, according to the Brookings Institute.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut Oklahoma’s law is particularly harsh. Under the legislation, teachers who are caught instructing critical race theory could lose their license.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Brooklyn Public Library stands firmly against censorship and for the principles of intellectual freedom—the right of every individual to seek and receive information from all points of view without restriction. Limiting access or providing one-sided information is a threat to democracy itself and we cannot sit idly by while books rejected by a few are removed from library shelves for all,” a library spokesperson said in a statement.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We invite young people ages 13 to 21, from every state in the nation, to apply for a digital library available through our Books Unbanned program at http://bklynlibrary.org/books-unbanned.”&nbsp;",

        "description": "President Biden on Thursday likened the “MAGA” wing of the GOP to fascism, leaning into his midterm campaign strategy to paint Republicans as extreme.\n\n\n\n“What we’re seeing now is either the beginning or the death knell of an extreme MAGA philosophy. It’s not just Trump, it’s the entire philosophy that underpins the — I’m going to say something, it’s like semi-fascism,” he said at a fundraising event hosted by the Democratic National Committee (DNC) in Bethesda, Md.\n\n\n\nThe White House has said Biden, while campaigning for Democrats ahead of November, will aim to paint Republicans as stewards of special interests who are pursuing an “extreme MAGA agenda that costs families,” seeking to tie them to former President Trump's “Make American Great Again” slogan.\n\n\n\nThe event in Maryland was the first formal pre-midterm event for Biden, who is expected to fan out across the county to tout his agenda. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre previewed the president’s remarks earlier on Thursday and said he would display “the choice before Americans.”\n\n\n\nBiden, at the event, mentioned the Supreme Court decision to overturn Roe v. Wade, as well as the potential for Republicans to work towards overturning marriage equality or repealing the Affordable Care Act.\n\n\n\n“This is not your father’s Republican Party. This is a different deal,” he said. “Our team has to show up and quite frankly vote, just simply vote.”\n\n\n\nHe also targeted Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.), the head of the GOP's Senate campaign arm, for his tax plan that Biden has consistently criticized. The White House has sought to tie congressional Republicans to the plan, but other lawmakers have either distanced themselves from the plan or declined to embrace it.\n\n\n\n“Rick Scott, who heads up the ultra MAGA agenda for Republicans … he thinks everyone in America should pay taxes,” Biden said on Thursday.\n\n\n\nScott's plan says that “all Americans should pay some income tax to have skin in the game, even if a small amount,” which the White House has bashed as a move to require everyone to pay taxes.\n\n\n\nThe fundraising event had about 100 attendees and raised $1 million for the DNC and the Democratic Grassroots Victory Fund, according to a DNC official.\n\n\n\nFollowing the event, Biden attended a rally at Richard Montgomery High School in Rockville, Md. \n\n\n\nBiden is expected to head to pivotal swing states in the next couple of weeks to continue his pre-midterm tour. On Tuesday, he will go to Pennsylvania for an event focused on crime prevention and then he will travel to Ohio on Sept. 9 for an event focused on American manufacturing.",

        "description": "We break down whether President Biden’s plan to ease financial pressure on American households could make the problem worse. We’ll also look at a better-than-expected economic growth report for the second quarter and a looming ban on buying gas-powered cars.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut first, Biden’s approval rating just hit the best level in more than a year.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWelcome to On The Money, your nightly guide to everything affecting your bills, bank account and bottom line. For The Hill, we’re Sylvan Lane, Aris Folley and Karl Evers-Hillstrom. Someone forward you this newsletter? Subscribe here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHow will Biden’s student loan plan affect inflation? \n\n\n\nPresident Biden announced on Wednesday an executive order to cancel at least $10,000 in federal student debt per borrower and extend a payment freeze through the end of the year.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe plan has come under fire from some high-profile economists, including former Obama economic advisers Jason Furman and Larry Summers, who said that it will fan the flames of the nation’s 40-year high inflation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts are divided over the inflationary effects of Biden's plan. Most agree, however, that even if student loan relief does lead to higher prices, the change will be marginal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts don’t believe it will ignite a surge of consumer spending akin to previous rounds of stimulus checks doled out during the height of the pandemic.&nbsp;They note that the total forgiveness will only make up a small fraction of total spending, and many borrowers may use the additional economic freedom to pay down other debts.&nbsp;Economists added that the resumption of loan payments next year will likely cause a pullback in spending that would sap momentum from rising prices.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nStill, some prominent economists are concerned that the plan might spell bad news for future borrowers, arguing that it could prompt colleges to hike prices in anticipation of future debt cancellations.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nKarl and Sylvan have more here.\n\n\n\nCheck out more excellent coverage on the student debt situation from The Hill:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden’s student loan plan is leaving Black borrowers wanting more Student loan forgiveness could ease women’s debt burdens Vulnerable Democrats are gearing up to fend off attacks over student debt \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLOAN EXPECTATIONS \n\n\n\nWhite House won’t give price tag for student loan plan&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House is declining to give a price tag for President Biden’s decision to forgive student loan debts for millions of Americans amid attacks by Republicans that the plan will add to the deficit and increase inflation.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhite House officials have spent the 24 hours since the forgiveness plan was announced skirting questions about its costs.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Well, that remains to be determined, and it will be a function of what percentage of eligible borrowers actually take up this opportunity,” domestic policy adviser Susan Rice, who helped lead the student loan forgiveness initiative, told reporters on Wednesday.&nbsp;“I think it depends on the numbers. Like, you know, unfortunately — and we’re here to encourage as many people to take it up as possible — if 43 million borrowers take it up, that’ll be different than if 50 percent of those 43 million take it up,” she added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Thursday also declined to offer a specific estimate.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“All of this when it comes to cost will also depend on how many of the loans canceled were actually expected to be repaid. It will depend on how many borrowers actually take up this opportunity before we have a real sense,” she said.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Brett Samuels has more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGIVE ME A SECOND \n\n\n\nUS economy shrunk at slower pace in second quarter, new estimate shows&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe U.S. economy shrunk at a slower pace between April and June than the federal government initially calculated, according to revised data released Thursday by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe BEA said U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) fell at an annualized rate of 0.6 percent during the second quarter of 2022. That’s down 0.3 percentage points from the 0.9 percent decline the agency estimated in July.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe BEA issues three estimates of each quarter’s change in GDP to incorporate new and revised data.&nbsp;&nbsp;The agency said the second quarter dip in economic activity was less severe than first believed after looking at broader, more complete data on consumer spending and private inventory investments.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSylvan explains what this means for recession fears here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSURPASSING GAS\n\n\n\nCalifornia approves 2035 sales ban for gas cars&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe California Air Resources Board voted on Thursday to ban the sale of gas-powered cars starting in 2035.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule would ratchet up the proportion of electric or non-emitting cars required to be sold in the state annually, until they must be 100 percent electric starting in 2035.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe rule is expected to have impacts beyond California’s borders, as other states can also adopt the standards. Officials from New York, Oregon, Washington state and Rhode Island told CNN that they plan to adopt California’s rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Hill’s Rachel Frazin has more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGood to Know\n\n\n\nTexas’s leading oil and gas regulator on Thursday cheered the state government’s push against environmental, social and governance investing (ESG) “extremists” like BlackRock and UBS.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“I’m thrilled to see my conservative colleagues join the defense against ‘woke’ Wall Street bankers,” Texas Railroad Commission Chairman Wayne Christian said in the statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere’s what else we have our eye on:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nD.C. Attorney General Karl Racine (D) filed a notice of appeal Thursday to revive the antitrust case against Amazon that a judge dismissed earlier this year.  Ransomware attacks rose 47 percent from June to July, with the majority of attacks targeting the industrials sector, according to a report released on Thursday by cybersecurity firm NCC Group.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat’s it for today.

(credit: Getty | Justin Sullivan)  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA garden-variety herbal remedy led to the abrupt and untimely death of Lori McClintock, the 61-year-old wife of US Rep. Tom McClintock (R-Calif.), according to a report from Kaiser Health News, which recently obtained documents from the coroner, the autopsy reports, as well as the amended death certificate.\nTom McClintock, who represents a district in Northern California, found his wife unresponsive at their home in Elk Grove on December 15, 2021, after he returned from Washington, DC. The coroner's report indicated that she had complained of an \"upset stomach\" the day before her death, but McClintock said that his wife was otherwise fine. He said she was \"counting down the days to Christmas,\" wrapping presents, planning a family Christmas, and had recently joined a gym.\nAccording to the coroner's documents, Lori McClintock's death resulted from \"adverse effects of white mulberry leaf ingestion.\" Ingestion of the tree leaves caused gastroenteritis (inflammation of the stomach and intestines) that led to dehydration, which caused her death. The coroner's documents noted that McClintock's body had elevated levels of nitrogen, sodium, and creatinine, which independent pathologists confirmed to KHN were signs of dehydration. The cause of death listed on her death certificate was updated from \"pending\" to an accident.Read 6 remaining paragraphs | Comments",

        "link": "https://www.politico.com/news/2022/08/25/biden-canceling-student-debt-00053826",
        "description": "For months after he had entered office, President Joe Biden had punted on his campaign promise of forgiving up to $10,000 in student loans. And as the debate over what to do lingered, aides began to take steps to try and manage internal deliberations. Student loans were regularly in the top five issues in the correspondence that the White House received from Americans each week, according to a person familiar with an internal report. And White House officials at some point last year told the team handling that correspondence to simply stop selecting so many letters for Biden to review because he hadn’t made up his mind on the issue, according to a person briefed on the interaction. As the president kept putting off a decision on canceling student loans, however, the prospect of restarting loans for millions of Americans continued to come to a head. His administration had been routinely extending a moratorium on student loan payments put in place at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. But at one point last fall, officials began to prepare seriously for resuming payments for tens of millions of Americans and they were prepared to do so without any decision on canceling debt, people familiar with the discussions said. An explosive December meeting with outside activists ensued and a last-ditch reprieve was formalized, in which the moratorium was extended. On Wednesday, Biden finally signed off on his highly anticipated student loan assistance package. The plan will deliver hundreds of billions of dollars of relief to tens of millions of borrowers and transform the federal government’s student loan program. It will also extend the moratorium a final time, until Dec. 31, 2022, after which Biden vowed he would require borrowers to resume paying their loans.   The process by which the president came to this policy was contentious and often confusing, filled with high stakes negotiations, pleas from outside stakeholders, internal disagreements, and last-ditch lobbying efforts from key Democratic lawmakers. And in many ways, it grew to echo the governing style that has defined Biden’s tenure in elected office: deliberativeness that can frustrate those around him, a policy platform that seeks consensus, but a late-lean toward progressivism that ends up surprising his liberal critics. Biden entered the presidency deeply skeptical of the idea of writing off large chunks of student loan debt. He questioned publicly whether he had the authority to do it, and he ruled out emphatically the $50,000 amount of loan forgiveness many progressives aggressively were pushing. From Day One, a coalition of activists, advocacy groups, labor unions and racial justice organizations waged a pressure campaign to move him on the matter. “You're not going to get everything that you're looking for, but you must push for as much as possible,” said Derrick Johnson, president of the NAACP and among the most vocal proponents of debt cancellation in regular communication with the White House. Johnson was among those proponents of debt cancellation who agonized over the administration’s indecision on the issue. The White House extended the pause on student loan payments and interest — which began under the Trump administration — on four occasions, each time without an answer on the bigger question of broad-based relief. But while outside advocates fretted, advisers who were internally pushing for broader cancellation believed time was on their side. They viewed the repeated extensions of the payment pause as helpful for keeping the issue alive and active on the president’s docket. Several people familiar with the discussions also said that drawing out the decision toward closer to the election helped amplify the political pressure on the White House to grant more generous relief to borrowers. “We needed time to make a deliberate decision versus a gut reaction,” said one administration official who worked on the issue. Still, there were hurdles. The conversations within the administration seemed to circle endlessly around many of the same complex legal, political and economic issues surrounding loan forgiveness, several people familiar with the deliberations said. One person familiar with the administration’s thinking said that Biden was committed to making good on his campaign promise to cancel $10,000 of debt but that he drew a red line on the need to target the relief to borrowers who needed it the most — and away from higher-earning borrowers who did not. White House discussions for months were centered around how Biden could cancel $10,000 of debt for various populations of borrowers. White House advisers considered a wide range of permutations for income limitations and targeted relief for individual groups of borrowers, such as public service workers, according to people familiar with the discussions. Other discussions focused on whether to target relief only to borrowers with undergraduate debt, rather than include graduate borrowers, those people said. Officials also examined whether to treat debt accrued by borrowers at public universities differently than loans taken out to attend private schools. Administration officials also considered ways to provide as much benefit to lower-wealth borrowers as possible, and viewed Pell grant benefits, which are already means-tested to low- and middle-income borrowers, as a good proxy. POLITICO reported last month that the Education Department was studying the idea of providing additional relief to borrowers who had ever received a Pell grant. But the $20,000 amount was kept closely held by advisers at the White House until this week.   As the talks dragged on, the back-and-forth between the administration and outside groups grew tense at times. Groups complained that the administration wasn’t being responsive to their outreach. But a major strategy among advocates “was to never close doors and to show the administration that when they do good things that help people with student debt they’ll get cheered for it,” said Mike Pierce, executive director of the Student Borrower Protection Center. He pointed to the growing momentum from the Biden administration for canceling billions of dollars of loans by expanding existing programs for borrowers who work in public service, students defrauded by their college and individuals who become severely disabled. The tide began to turn toward significant debt relief at the beginning of the year, several people familiar with the discussion said. By that time, Biden administration attorneys within the White House and Justice Department had largely resolved the issue of whether they believed canceling $10,000 of debt for borrowers was, generally speaking, an option legally available to the president, according to a person familiar with the administration’s thinking.  The policy debate was also moving forward. Susan Rice, the president’s top domestic policy adviser who some activists saw as an impediment to relief earlier on in the administration, came around to the idea of taking action on broad-based debt cancellation, according to a White House adviser and a person familiar with the deliberations. Rice’s full-fledged support for significant loan forgiveness — with income limits — helped drive the decision-making internally and ultimately get it over the finish line with the president who trusts her, those people said.  In a statement, White House chief of staff Ron Klain said, \"The President and his senior policy directors on this decision – Susan Rice and Brian Deese – were strong supporters of taking action from the start.” An Oval Office meeting in May between Biden and that trio of senators — Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) , and Sen. Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.) — brought another turning point, according to several people familiar with the deliberations. “That’s where it became clear he would do something, and then it was about pushing on the details,” said a Democratic aide familiar with the discussions. Administration officials after the meeting began discussing debt cancellation more seriously and trading proposals for how to structure the program within the parameters Biden set, including the requirement for some type of income limit. Schumer would go on to say that he called the White House “50 to 100 times” on the issue, adding that he spoke to Biden as late as the night before the announcement. Over the late spring and summer, the pressure from major labor unions and Hill Democrats intensified. Members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus lobbied Biden to cancel debt until finally, this past week, Biden began to make up his mind. As parts of the administration’s plan began to leak, Johnson fired off one of his last public warning shots. Simply canceling $10,000 of debt for some borrowers was woefully insufficient, he warned. “If the rumors are true, we’ve got a problem,” he said in a statement. Privately, Johnson spoke with senior White House officials on Wednesday morning before the formal announcement, as well as the two days prior amid a frenzied, last-minute push to finalize the plan. Ultimately, Biden announced that he was canceling $20,000 of debt for 27 million student loan borrowers who also received Pell grants, which won the NAACP’s praise. Most of the other 43 million federal student loan borrowers will qualify for $10,000 of relief. The president gave an address announcing the details back at the White House. It was Rice who got to take the turn addressing it directly with reporters. Biden was “clear from the campaign that he was prepared to relieve up to $10,000 in broad-based cancellation,” she told them. “He listened and consulted and studied.” Alex Thompson and Anna Gronewold contributed to this report.",

        "description": "An internal government watchdog has found that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) prematurely denied thousands of claims related to water contamination at the Camp Lejeune military base.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, California has approved a ban on gas-powered cars, and Utah is suing the Biden administration over restored boundaries for national monuments. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThis is Overnight Energy &amp; Environment, your source for the latest news focused on energy, the environment and beyond. For The Hill, we’re Rachel Frazin and Zack Budryk. Subscribe here.\n\n\n\nThousands of victims’ claims mishandled: watchdog\n\n\n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) mishandled up to 1 in 3 veterans’ claims relating to water contamination at Camp Lejeune, according to a report released Thursday by the department’s Office of Inspector General (OIG).\n\n\n\nSome 1 million people may have been exposed to contaminated water at the training facility between August 1953 and December 1987, according to the OIG report. OIG investigators found that the department prematurely denied more than 17,000 of the claims before sending the claimants’ letters asking for further documentation of exposure.In another 2,300 cases, the department recorded incorrect effective dates for benefit eligibility, according to the report. Not all the mishandled cases would necessarily have resulted in benefit payouts, but veterans were underpaid by at least $13.8 million over a four-year period due to failure to assign the earliest effective date, according to the watchdog.\n\n\n\nThe big problem:&nbsp;The contaminants in question are associated with a number of medical conditions and complications, including kidney cancer, liver cancer, Parkinson’s disease and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma. The VA has also expanded eligibility for disability payments to people who have a different condition than the eight listed that they can prove is connected to exposure to contaminated water.\n\n\n\n“The OIG found that errors were less likely to occur at the Louisville Regional Office, which processes most Camp Lejeune-related claims; staff from other VA regional offices lacked experience processing these claims,” the report states.\n\n\n\nThe watchdog recommended the Veterans Benefits Administration either develop a plan to reduce the processing errors at regional offices or centralize Camp Lejeune-related claims at the Louisville office. &nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.\n\n\n\nCalifornia approves 2035 sales ban for gas cars \n\n\n\nThe California Air Resources Board voted on Thursday to ban the sale of gas-powered cars starting in 2035.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe state’s Advanced Clean Cars II rule would ratchet up the proportion of electric or non-emitting cars required to be sold in the state annually, until new sales must be 100 percent electric starting in 2035.The rule is expected to have impacts beyond California’s borders, as other states can also adopt the standards. Officials from New York, Oregon, Washington state and Rhode Island&nbsp;told CNN&nbsp;that they plan to adopt California’s rule.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe measure is aimed at both limiting the state’s contribution to climate change and bettering public health by exposing fewer people to pollution like smog.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“California now has a groundbreaking, world-leading plan to achieve 100 percent zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035. It’s ambitious, it’s innovative, it’s the action we must take if we’re serious about leaving this planet better off for future generations,” California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said in a statement shared with The Hill.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Air Resources Board found that battery-electric vehicles are likely to be about even cost-wise with gas-powered vehicles by 2030, and it estimated that by 2035, consumers are likely to save $7,900 in maintenance and operational costs over the first 10 years of electric vehicle ownership.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the rule here.  \n\n\n\nUTAH SUES BIDEN OVER MONUMENT BOUNDARIES\n\n\n\nThe state of Utah is suing the Biden administration over its decision to restore the size of two national monuments that were shrunk by then-President Trump.\n\n\n\nThe size of the Grand Staircase-Escalante and Bears Ears monuments, both located in Utah, were cut by nearly half and about 85 percent, respectively, during the Trump administration.&nbsp;These monuments were initially designated under the Clinton and Obama administrations.\n\n\n\nIn deciding to restore the monuments’ original sizes, Biden invoked tribal rights, calling Bears Ears “a place of healing … a place of reverence, a sacred homeland to hundreds of generations of native peoples.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut, the state of Utah and two of its counties argued in court that the monuments are too big and a violation of the Antiquities Act, which gives presidents the right to protect historic landmarks and other areas of significance.&nbsp; &nbsp;\n\n\n\nThey specifically argued that Biden’s move was not compatible with the part of the law that says parcels put aside for protections “shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd they said that Biden’s move would “stifle local economic activity, impact local culture and tradition, lock up potentially critical minerals, destroy jobs, and impose exasperating and costly burdens on local and state governments.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more about the lawsuit here.\n\n\n\nWHAT WE'RE READING\n\n\n\nThe EPA Just Quietly Got Stronger (The Atlantic)Texas grid avoids summer blackouts with $1 billion in extra spending (Reuters) Pace of Climate Change Sends Economists Back to Drawing Board (The New York Times)Dinosaur tracks from 113 million years ago uncovered due to severe drought conditions at Dinosaur Valley State Park (CNN)Appalachian, Indigenous pipeline foes say climate deal ‘left us to burn’ (The Washington Post)\n\n\n\nICYMI\n\n\n\nDeadly heat to surge by 2100, even with emissions reductions: studyHow wildfires made the ozone hole worseFires burning nearly twice as much forest as 20 years ago: study International nuclear agency getting wider powers to probe attacks on Ukraine power plant \n\n\n\nThat’s it for today, thanks for reading.

Yvette Clarke (D-N.Y.), chair of a cybersecurity subcommittee, are demanding that Twitter respond to allegations from a whistleblower about major security deficiencies that the Democrats said could pose national security threats.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Democrats sent a letter to Twitter CEO Parag Agrawal on Thursday asking for details about security flaws identified in whistleblower Peiter Zatko’s complaint, and about action Twitter took in response to warnings raised by Zatko during his time at Twitter or after his departure.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThompson and Clarke underscored the need for Twitter to take proactive steps to protect users with the upcoming midterm elections around the corner, calling it an “inflection point” for American democracy.&nbsp;&nbsp;“Twitter plays a unique role in our information and political ecosystems. Security flaws that put users’ sensitive personal data within easy reach of a hacker looking to take control of a high-profile account or a foreign dictator looking for information on dissidents are nothing short of a threat to national security,”&nbsp;they wrote.&nbsp;“If substantiated, the whistleblower allegations demonstrate a pattern of willful disregard for the personal data of Twitter users and the integrity of the platform.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSpyware firm restructures amid backlash  \n\n\n\nThe embattled Israeli spyware firm NSO Group is replacing its CEO and cutting13 percent of its workforce as it tries to recover from being blacklisted by the U.S. government.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nExperts say the longtime industry leader has become a “cautionary tale,” after allowing its flagship Pegasus spyware to become a high-profile threat to global security and human rights, with media outlets worldwide detailing how governments were abusing its tools.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe company’s restructuring is likely tied to the Department of Commerce’s decision last fall to add the company to its entities list — effectively blacklisting it — and the recent failure of its acquisition deal with U.S. defense contractor L3Harris, experts added.  \n\n\n\n“Being put on the entities list was killing the company,” said James Lewis, a senior vice president and director with the strategic technologies program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS, ISRAEL ENTERS CYBER PARTNERSHIP  \n\n\n\nThe Department of Treasury and the Israeli Ministry of Finance&nbsp;announced&nbsp;on Thursday a bilateral agreement formalizing and enhancing the cybersecurity partnership between the countries.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe agreement follows Deputy Secretary of the Treasury Wally Adeyemo’s visit to Israel last fall, when he established a bilateral partnership geared toward protecting the financial sector from cyberattacks. \n\n\n\nIn the agreement, both nations pledged to share information related to cyber threats targeting the financial sector, train staff in the cybersecurity field, and conduct cross-border cybersecurity exercises.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRANSOMWARE CASES SURGED 47% IN JULY&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRansomware attacks rose 47 percent from June to July, with the majority of attacks targeting the industrials sector,&nbsp;according to a&nbsp;report&nbsp;released on Thursday by cybersecurity firm NCC Group.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPrevious reports conducted by the firm indicated that ransomware cases had declined in the spring but soon picked up again, with attacks increasing from 135 in June to 198 in July.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This month’s [report] has revealed some major changes within the ransomware threat scene compared to June, as ransomware attacks are once again on the up,” said Matt Hull, global head of threat intelligence at NCC Group, in a statement.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAccording to the report, the rise in ransomware attacks comes as several new threat actors emerge, including Lockbit 3.0, Hiveleaks and BlackBasts, which have been associated with the Conti ransomware group —&nbsp;a Russia-based hacker group.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGoogle to identify abortion clinics  \n\n\n\nGoogle in a letter to lawmakers on Thursday said it would clearly identify facilities that provide abortions to ensure people seeking the procedure are not misled by anti-abortion clinics.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMark Isakowitz, the vice president for government affairs and public policy for the U.S. and Canada at Google, said in a letter to Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.) andRep. Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.) that the company will include labels like “Provides abortions” and “Does not provide abortions” that the company has verified at the top of advertisement search results.\n\n\n\nRead more here. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPLATFORMS REMOVED ‘PRO-WESTERN’ NARRATIVES \n\n\n\nFacebook and Twitter took down two overlapping sets of accounts over the past two months for promoting “pro-Western narratives” in the Middle East and Central Asia, according to&nbsp;a report&nbsp;released Wednesday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe social media analytics firm Graphika reported that Twitter and Meta, the company that owns Facebook, took down the accounts over a “series of covert campaigns” over a period of five years.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwitter said the accounts violated its policies on “platform manipulation and spam,” and Meta said it conducted “coordinated inauthentic behavior.” The platforms provided portions of the accounts’ activity to Graphika and the Stanford Internet Observatory.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This activity represents the most extensive case of a covert influence operation advancing pro-Western narratives that has been publicly documented to date,” Jack Stubbs, vice president of intelligence at Graphika, told&nbsp;The Wall Street Journal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRead more here.  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDC PUSHES TO REVIVE AMAZON ANTITRUST CASE \n\n\n\nD.C.

It accuses Amazon of using anticompetitive practices by keeping third-party sellers from offering lower-cost proxies for products elsewhere.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA judge dismissed the case in March in an oral ruling.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We’re appealing the lower court’s decision because District consumers deserve a fair marketplace that promotes competition, innovation, and choice,” Racine said in a statement. “And we’re filing this appeal because the antitrust laws and the facts are on our side—and on the side of District residents.

        "link": "https://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/3616157-judge-puts-north-dakotas-abortion-ban-on-hold-again/",
        "description": "A state court has blocked North Dakota’s trigger abortion ban, which would prohibit most abortions in the state, as it was set to go into effect on Friday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJudge Bruce Romanick ruled Thursday that the state law, which bans the procedure unless it is necessary to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape or incest, should remain on hold while legal battles proceed. \n\n\n\nRomanick agreed with the plaintiffs’ arguments that the ban going into effect on Friday could cause irreparable injury to women across the state and harm to interested parties. The ruling states that the purpose of a preliminary injunction, which it issued Thursday, is to maintain the status quo, and not restricting abortions as the law outlines follows the status quo.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe original dispute over the law comes from whether North Dakota Attorney General Drew Wrigley (R) correctly interpreted the language of the law to take the steps necessary to implement it. The law states that the ban would go into effect on the 30th day after “the attorney general certifies to the legislative council the issuance of the judgment in any decision of the United States Supreme Court which, in whole or in part, restores states authority to prohibit abortion.” \n\n\n\nWrigley certified that the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade on June 28, a few days after the ruling was announced, but the plaintiffs argued that he needed to wait 25 days after the opinion came out for the court’s official judgement to be settled.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRomanick initially blocked the law late last month as the plaintiffs pursued their litigation. He said in his ruling at the time that the Supreme Court could alter its original judgment in that time period, although it is rare, and render its original ruling moot. \n\n\n\nWrigley told The Hill in an interview at the time that he complied with the ruling by recertifying the Supreme Court’s ruling after the official judgment was released, and the law would next take effect on Friday, Aug. 26.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRed River Women’s Clinic, one of the plaintiffs and the last abortion clinic that was operating in North Dakota, has since moved across the border to neighboring Minnesota.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe court did not rule on the probability of the plaintiffs succeeding on the merits of their arguments.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe ruling comes on the same day that three trigger bans went into effect in Idaho, Tennessee and Texas. More than a dozen states have moved to ban or severely restrict abortion since Roe was overturned.",

Or was this the anticipated timeline?&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMC:&nbsp;Some Cabinet members have made trips related to the promotion of the Biden agenda — Interior Secretary&nbsp;Deb Haaland, for instance, recently swung through California to promote the bipartisan infrastructure law — but we haven’t seen much of President Biden since he signed the Inflation Reduction Act into law primarily because he’s been on his summer vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThat will change with [the] big pre-midterm event tonight. Biden is scheduled to headline a&nbsp;Democratic National Committee&nbsp;rally in Maryland, where he’ll promote his agenda and offer a preview of his message in this last two-month stretch before the midterms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNotedDC:&nbsp;Is President Biden expected to actively campaign for many individual candidates this fall or do you get the sense that some are shying away because of his polling? [Catch up on this issue&nbsp;with this story&nbsp;from The Hill’s&nbsp;Brett Samuels&nbsp;and&nbsp;Alex Gangitino.]&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMC:&nbsp;I think the president will get out there on the trail, and the White House has made clear he wants to interact more with people throughout the country. When it comes to Democratic candidates being willing to appear with him, it’s a bit of a mixed bag.\n\n\n\nThere are plenty who have embraced the president — Florida Democratic gubernatorial nominee Charlie Crist is one who praised Biden in recent days and said he would welcome the president to campaign in Florida. But others in tough races have seemed to try to create more distance. The president has racked up some significant legislative wins and his poll numbers seem to be turning around for the better, so that could change some candidates’ perspectives. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWelcome to&nbsp;NotedDC: Your guide to politics, policy and people of consequence in D.C.

He has the ability to do this, and he should show he cares about this issue to the people who elected him.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhere things stand:&nbsp;Seventeen states have banned or drastically restricted abortion access to date: Alabama, Arizona, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Oklahoma, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas and Utah.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPresidential action:&nbsp;Biden has signed two executive orders on abortion rights since the Supreme Court overturned the landmark Roe v. Wade decision earlier this summer. White House press secretary&nbsp;Karine Jean-Pierre&nbsp;said Thursday that the administration will take further action but didn't elaborate. Biden hasn't ruled out a public health emergency.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Americans across the country and of all backgrounds agree that women should have the right to make their own personal health care decisions and to receive life-saving medical care, without interference from politicians, and the President will continue to take action to protect women’s access to lifesaving health care,” Jean-Pierre said Thursday.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nUntil then, the demonstrators will keep showing up.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“We need to protect people,\" Kuhns said. “Joe Biden and Congress can show they stand with us and they deserve our votes.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“What we want to see is action,\" she added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSeveral Democratic lawmakers also have penned letters to Biden urging him to declare an emergency.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhat a health emergency declaration would mean: Declaring an emergency would provide more flexibility for the federal government. In the case of abortion access, it could be wielded to provide federal resources to make it easier for people to travel to other states to terminate pregnancies if the procedure is banned in their own state. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRUMP-MCCONNELL FEUD ESCALATES\n\n\n\nFormer&nbsp;President Trump’s rhetoric against Senate Minority Leader&nbsp;Mitch McConnell&nbsp;is escalating, putting on display the growing divide between the two GOP factions.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTrump has been on a tear against McConnell after the Kentucky Republican criticized the quality of this year’s GOP Senate candidates —&nbsp;many of whom Trump endorsed or even hand-picked — now calling for McConnell&nbsp;to be booted from his post as minority leader.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBetween the lines:&nbsp;McConnell has not rushed to Trump’s side following the FBI’s search of his Florida estate, unlike House GOP Leader&nbsp;Kevin McCarthy&nbsp;(Calif.), showcasing the splintering of the party. If Trump runs again in 2024, it’s unlikely McConnell would be a strong supporter, though he has indicated he would vote for whomever becomes the Republican nominee.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nNearing midterms:&nbsp;McConnell hasn’t shown enthusiasm for many of Trump’s endorsed Senate candidates, including&nbsp;Mehmet Oz&nbsp;in Pennsylvania,&nbsp;Herschel Walker&nbsp;in Georgia and&nbsp;Blake Masters&nbsp;in Arizona, all of whom are lagging in the polls.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut&nbsp;as our colleagues Mike Lills and Emily Brooks reported Thursday,&nbsp;House Republicans will land closer to Trump’s views next year since many of those poised to win in November have embraced the former president. If the GOP takes control of the House, it will make legislating much more difficult for&nbsp;President Biden&nbsp;and more moderate factions of the GOP.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe feud, which kicked into high gear following the attack at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, is also turning personal after&nbsp;Trump attacked McConnell’s wife,&nbsp;Elaine Chao, who served as the secretary of Transportation in his Cabinet.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“He should spend more time (and money!) helping them get elected, and less time helping his crazy wife and family get rich on China,” Trump wrote on Truth Social, referring to how Chao previously used her department staff to help her family business, which does business in China.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMcConnell, not responding to the attack, seems reluctant to give more attention to Trump.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nRemember: Trump has used this playbook to attack other opponents within his party before, such as when he retweeted an unflattering photo of Heidi Cruz, the wife of Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), as the two battled it out for the GOP presidential nomination in 2016.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe White House’s latest staff shakeup\n\n\n\nAs the Biden administration prepares for the last stretch before midterms, the press team got shifted around, once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOur colleague Brett Samuels reports&nbsp;on the trio of changes:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOlivia Dalton&nbsp;will serve as principal deputy press secretary, previously serving as a spokesperson for the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.Kate Berner&nbsp;will be promoted to principal deputy communications director from her previous role as deputy communications director.Herbie Ziskend&nbsp;will fill Berner’s former post as deputy communications director, previously seving in&nbsp;Vice President Harris’s&nbsp;office.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhy these changes are significant: “The new staff members cap off months of changes within the White House communications operation that started in May with the departure of former press secretary Jen Psaki. Since then, roughly a half dozen press staffers have departed the White House, most of them for other jobs in the administration,” Samuels said. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWho is helping Dems campaign?\n\n\n\nFormer&nbsp;President Obama&nbsp;will appear at a fundraiser in September to help Democrats in their fight to keep control of Congress.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOur colleague Caroline Vakil&nbsp;obtained a copy of the invite. Here are the deets:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe will join Sen.&nbsp;Gary Peters&nbsp;(Mich.), the chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, in a conversation in New York on Sept. 8.General reception is&nbsp;$25,000 per person&nbsp;while a VIP reception and&nbsp;photo line is $50,000.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd California Gov.&nbsp;Gavin Newsom&nbsp;threw $100,000 behind&nbsp;Rep.&nbsp;Charlie Crist&nbsp;(D) in his bid to oust Florida Gov.&nbsp;Ron DeSantis&nbsp;(R).&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIt’s a new level in the Newsom-DeSantis feud. In July, Newsom launched an ad targeting DeSantis and other GOP lawmakers for legislation targeting LGBTQ and voting rights, abortion and critical race theory. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFIRST IN THE HILL — GOP GOES AFTER SEN. PATTY MURRAY\n\n\n\nWashington Sen.&nbsp;Patty Murray&nbsp;(D) is being hit by a six-figure digital ad buy over the issue of crime, our colleague Julia Manchester&nbsp;scooped on Thursday.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Republican group Winning for Women Action Fund is boosting Murray’s Republican opponent Tiffany Smiley in the ad, casting Murray as “turning her back on law enforcement.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAnd what’s more telling of&nbsp;how Republicans will deflect Democrats’ abortion attacks, Smiley&nbsp;launched another ad&nbsp;Thursday painting herself as less extreme on the issue.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Patty Murray has spent millions to paint me as an extremist. I’m pro-life, but I oppose a federal abortion ban,” Smiley says in the ad.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Cook Political Report ranks the race as “solid Democrat.” \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTime to celebrate the pups!\n\n\n\nIf you don’t spoil your dogs enough already, Friday is&nbsp;National Dog Day, so get the treats ready!&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHere’s the top five dog breeds in the District,&nbsp;according to TOP Agency:&nbsp;\n\n\n\nYorkshire TerrierBeagleMuttLabrador RetrieverPit Bull \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStay with TheHill.com for the latest and recommend NotedDC to others: thehill.com/noted.

        "description": "Sen.&nbsp;Mike Lee&nbsp;(R-Utah) said Thursday that he plans to debate Independent Senate candidate&nbsp;Evan McMullin&nbsp;as the two vie for the Utah seat in November's general election.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"I'm glad that you finally committed to debate me, Mike. Utahns deserve a chance to hear from both of us. Our campaign met the deadline—the ball is in your court now,\" McMullin&nbsp;wrote&nbsp;on Twitter, referring to a Monday&nbsp;deadline he said was set by the state's Debate Commission.\n\n\n\nLee&nbsp;defeated his Republican challengers in the GOP primary for the seat earlier this year and has been&nbsp;leading McMullin in some&nbsp;polling, but the sitting senator and the Independent challenger have yet to go head-to-head in debate.\n\n\n\nAs&nbsp;reported&nbsp;in local outlet KUTV, in the lead-up to the primary Lee&nbsp;attended&nbsp;a Utah GOP-sponsored debate but&nbsp;skipped&nbsp;one hosted by the nonpartisan Utah Debate Commission, where an empty podium stood on the debate stage in his place.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n\"I look forward to debating Evan McMullin on the important issues facing our country. My team has been working with the Debate Commission to secure a date, and I can assure you we will come up with a time that works,\" Lee wrote on Twitter on Thursday when McMullin confronted him about the Debate Commission's deadline. \n\n\n\nIndependent McMullin, who made a third-party bid for the presidency in 2016, was&nbsp;backed&nbsp;by Utah Democrats earlier this year in a rare move aimed at ousting the Republican incumbent.\n\n\n\nLee, endorsed by former President Trump, has held the Senate seat since 2011. The Hill has reached out to Lee's campaign and the Utah Debate Commission for comment.\n\n\n\nLee is \"slow-walking debate negotiations\" in the face of \"a neck-and-neck reelection challenge\" from McMullin, a spokesperson for McMullin's campaign told The Hill in a statement. \n\n\n\nThe nonpartisan Cook Political Report last week changed its rating for the&nbsp;Utah Senate race from \"Solid R\" to \"Likely R.\" Sabato’s Crystal Ball, the election handicapper from the University of Virginia’s Center for Politics, amended its \"Safe Republican\" rating to \"Likely Republican\" after the June primaries.",

Is that fair? What do you think?” Biden said after his remarks announcing the plan.\n\n\n\n The debt relief move&nbsp;has garnered praise from Democrats, while Republicans&nbsp;have criticized the economics. \n\n\n\nThe White House Twitter account has created a thread below its response to Greene's criticism, with similar responses to other Congressional critics of the student loan debt announcement. The congressmen whose PPP loan amounts were revealed include Reps. Vern Buchanan (R-Fla.), Markwayne Mullin (R-Okla.), Kevin Hern (R-Okla.), Mike Kelly (R-Pa.) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.).",

        "description": "Traffic moves on Interstate 880 in Oakland, Calif., Tuesday, Aug. 16, 2022. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu)Jeff Chiu/APUpdated August 25, 2022 at 4:58 PM ETLOS ANGELES — California air regulators voted Thursday on a historic plan to address climate change and harmful pollution by moving the nation&#x27;s largest auto market away from the internal combustion engine.The regulation will phase out the sale of new gasoline-powered cars, trucks and SUVs in the nation&#x27;s most-populous state, culminating in a total ban of new sales of the vehicles by 2035. The ban will not prevent people from using gas-powered vehicles or apply to the used car market, but California officials say it will dramatically cut the state&#x27;s climate-warming emissions and famously dirty air by speeding the transition to electric vehicles. &quot;California now has a groundbreaking, world-leading plan to achieve 100% zero-emission vehicle sales by 2035,&quot; said the state&#x27;s governor, Gavin Newsom. &quot;It&#x27;s ambitious, it&#x27;s innovative, it&#x27;s the action we must take if we&#x27;re serious about leaving the planet better off for future generations.&quot; The regulation, which was approved by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) in a Thursday vote, could have massive repercussions for the country&#x27;s auto-manufacturing industry and the broader fight against climate change. Transportation is the largest source of climate-warming greenhouse gas emissions in the country, and scientists have said in increasingly dire language that drastic cuts to those emissions are crucial to providing a livable future on the planet.  President Joe Biden has set a goal of making half of the nation&#x27;s new sales zero-emission by 2030. The recently enacted Inflation Reduction Act aims to move consumers that way by providing tax credits to people looking to buy new or used electric vehicles, but there are so many caveats — on everything from the buyers&#x27; income level to which models can qualify — that many electric vehicles may not be eligible for the benefit. Auto industry analysts say the unprecedented move by California could help push the auto market to achieving that goal. Thirteen other states, including Oregon, New York and Colorado, typically follow California&#x27;s auto emissions standards, which are already the most stringent in the country. Washington Gov. Jay Inslee announced Wednesday that his state will set a similar goal of banning new gas-powered car sales by 2035. &quot;I think, for automakers, they will probably look at this and think this is kind of what they&#x27;re going to target for most of the country,&quot; said Jessica Caldwell, the executive director of insight at the car data company Edmunds.Auto makers want uniformity, Caldwell said. They don&#x27;t want to be selling one type of car in one state and others in another. But the transition to electric vehicles, which have been on the market for decades, has been slow. Electric vehicles account for just 5.6 percent of new-car sales between April and July, according to the latest quarterly report from Cox Automotive, an industry consulting firm. That was a record pace, the report noted, spurred by high gas prices, but supply issues remain. Reaching 100 percent emission-free new vehicle sales by 2035 will be &quot;extremely challenging,&quot; said John Bozzella, president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents large automakers. &quot;Whether or not these requirements are realistic or achievable is directly linked to external factors like inflation, charging and fuel infrastructure, supply chains, labor, critical mineral availability and pricing, and the ongoing semiconductor shortage,&quot; he said in a statement. &quot;These are complex, intertwined and global issues well beyond the control of either CARB or the auto industry.&quot;  A nationwide shift to electric vehicles would have major health benefits beyond its impacts on global climate change. More than 4-in-10 Americans live with unhealthy air, according to the American Lung Association. And research finds that the negative effects are disproportionately borne by people of color, regardless of income. A report by the American Lung Association earlier this year found that a nationwide shift to zero-emission vehicles by 2035, as California is seeking, would generate more than $1.2 trillion in public health benefits between 2020 and 2050 and avoid up to 110,000 premature deaths.

        "description": "The Mariners brought back veteran southpaw Tommy Milone on a minor league contract this week, according to his transactions log at MLB.com. Seattle released him on trade deadline day to clear space on the 40-man roster for their acquisitions.\nMilone was on the 15-day injured list at the time, having sustained a cervical muscle strain in the preceding days. The 35-year-old has not yet been assigned to an affiliate, so he&#8217;s yet to make an appearance since his most recent big league outing on July 29. That was the final of seven MLB outings during his run in the majors with Seattle. Milone worked 16 2/3 innings as a long reliever, posting a 5.40 ERA with six walks, five strikeouts and four home runs allowed.\nThat&#8217;s obviously not a great showing, but Milone excelled over seven starts with Triple-A Tacoma early in the year. He posted a minuscule 1.13 ERA through 32 frames, punching out 24.8% of opponents against a tidy 6.8% walk percentage. He&#8217;ll presumably return to that role with the Rainiers at some point as a rotation/long relief depth option.\nDespite being one of the game&#8217;s softest throwers, Milone has continued to attract interest from myriad teams into his mid-30&#8217;s. He&#8217;s reached the big leagues in each of the past 12 years, working as a strike-throwing swing option of late. He&#8217;ll look to work his way back to the bigs with Seattle before the end of the season.",

        "description": "Fully knitted-out\n\nSeen in a lovely wool shop in Riga.\n\nQuote of the Day\n\n&#8220;In so far as the family as an institution turns women into darling little slaves and men into their chief providers and unweaned dependents, the problem of a satisfactory marriage remains incapable of a purely private solution.&#8221;\n\n\nC. Wright Mills in The Sociological Imagination, one of my favourite books.\n\n\nMusical alternative to the morning’s radio news\nMark Knopfler &amp; James Taylor | Sailing to Philadelphia\nLink\nThanks to Kai Green for the suggestion.\n\nLong Read of the Day\nHalf a Billion in Bitcoin, Lost in the Dump\nTerrific New Yorker story by D. T. Max about how to lose half a billion dollars.\n\nIn a cluttered desk drawer, he found two small hard drives. One, he knew, was blank. The other held files from an old Dell gaming laptop, including e-mails, music that he’d downloaded, and duplicates of family photographs. He’d removed the drive a few years earlier, after he’d spilled lemonade on the computer’s keyboard. Howells grabbed the unwanted hard drive and threw it into a black garbage bag.\nLater, when the couple slid into bed, Howells asked Hafina, who dropped off their kids at day care each morning, if she would mind taking the trash to the dump also. He remembers her declining, saying, “It’s not my fucking job—it’s your job.” Howells conceded the point. As his head hit the pillow, he recalls, he made a mental note to remove the hard drive from the bag. “I’m a systems engineer,” he said. “I’ve never thrown a hard drive in the bin. It’s just a bad idea.”\nThe next day, Hafina got up early and took the garbage to the landfill after all. Howells remembers waking upon her return, at around nine. “Ah, did you take the bag to the tip?” he asked. He told himself, “Oh, fuck—she’s chucked it,” but he was still groggy, and he soon fell back asleep&#8230;.\n\nRead on and wonder&#8230;\n\nBritain sets out roadmap for self driving vehicle usage by 2025\nFrom Reuters…\n\nLONDON, Aug 19 (Reuters) &#8211; Britain said on Friday it wanted a widespread rollout of self-driving vehicles on roads by 2025, announcing plans for new laws and 100 million pounds ($119.09 million) of funding.\nThe government said it wanted to take advantage of the emerging market for autonomous vehicles, which it valued at 42 billion pounds and estimated could create 38,000 new jobs.\n”We want the UK to be at the forefront of developing and using this fantastic technology, and that is why we are investing millions in vital research into safety and setting the legislation to ensure we gain the full benefits that this technology promises,&#8221; Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said…\n\nThis from the government of a country which is unable to fix the potholes in its roads.\nI’ve filed it under Magical Thinking.\n\nMy commonplace booklet\n“The country’s agents stamped on the backside will carry the honour of the guarantee in their country.”\n\nAkai tape-recorder guarantee\n\n…\n“WERY STRONK BIER”\n\nBar notice on a ferry in Finland\n\n(Both from Derek Winston’s French Widow in Every Room, published by Unwin in 1987 and a constant source of joy for this blogger.)\n\nThis Blog is also available as a daily email.

Others have said any effect is likely to be more marginal.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhile Republicans are using inflation to hammer the White House, the criticism that the plan could raise inflation is also coming from at least some political allies to Biden.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJason Furman, a Harvard professor and former top economic adviser to President Obama, said Wednesday that it is “reckless” to pour “roughly half [a] trillion dollars of gasoline on the inflationary fire that is already burning.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House argued any risk on inflation will be mitigated by the fact that while it is&nbsp;extending the years-long payment pause on federal student loans through Dec. 31, the pause will end in January 2023. Officials argued that the combination of restarting loan payments while providing some relief will basically zero out any inflationary effect.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe pause has long been seen as a program that could be adding to inflation, though other stimulus programs and the fact that consumers saved money during the pandemic are likely bigger factors.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s pretty clear that the pause in student loan repayment has probably been a little bit inflationary, that’s money that would have been drawn down from the economy and has stayed in peoples’ pockets,” said Kevin Miller, Bipartisan Policy Center associate director for higher education policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWill colleges raise tuition in response?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMany observers have questioned whether colleges will raise tuition in response to the Biden move, under the rationale that more forgiveness could be on the way.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It creates this problem of once you have forgiven or have canceled loans, just broadly … that sets a precedent and it gives people going forward an expectation and a reasonable argument,” said&nbsp;Neal McCluskey, policy analyst at the CATO Institution.&nbsp;“If people don’t think their loans will ever have to be repaid or repaid in full, they have incentive to take out more loans.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nOthers doubt it will have an immediate or&nbsp;substantial impact on tuition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“Most schools are basically multilevel organizations,” said Dalié Jiménez, director of the student loan law initiative at the University of California Irvine. “The process of setting tuition prices, there are just so many inputs that I don’t know that it would have any kind of immediate effect on average or overall.”&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe Department of Education will be “vigilant” and “laser-focused” with bad actors, according to officials, and plans to publish&nbsp;an annual “watch list”&nbsp;of institutions&nbsp;with the worst debt levels as a way to hold accountable colleges that have contributed to the student debt crisis.\n\n\n\nWill this stand up to court challenges?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nCourt challenges to Biden’s effort are expected, though their precise nature is a bit of a mystery.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Thursday that the White House is confident in its legal authority and that the steps will hold up in court.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe legal authority the White House has pointed to is through the 2003 HEROES Act, which gives the Secretary of Education authority to take certain actions believed to be necessary to ensure a borrower is not placed in a worse position financially due to a national emergency, like the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMcCluskey said it’s far from clear those holding student debt were made worse off during the pandemic. &nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“College graduates were sort of the most insulated from the negative impacts of the pandemic and the associated economic problems that went with it and lockdown because they were most able to continue working,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“They have been made much better off regarding their loans as they have been frozen,” he added.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMcCluskey&nbsp;also raised the issue that Biden is “essentially appropriating money,” which is a power that belongs to Congress. But, he noted, the Democratic-controlled Congress is not likely to challenge that.\n\n\n\n“To say loans, which is money from the government that has to returned, now doesn’t have to be returned, that turns the loan into a grant,” he said.\n\n\n\nDemocratic Rep. Chris Pappas (N.H.) said on Wednesday that the decision “sidesteps Congress and our oversight and fiscal responsibilities.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWho is in and out in terms of eligibility?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe policy appears to leave out a very small number of borrowers— estimated to be about 5 percent of those who have loans.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe program caps eligibility for the program by income level; $125,000 for a single person and $250,000 for couples.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nIf everyone who is eligible claims the relief, 43 million federal student loan borrowers will benefit and nearly 90 percent of the benefits will go to borrowers earning less than $75,000, according to the White House.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWho pays for it?&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTaxpayers will pick up the bill for the program, though it isn’t clear how much the price tag will be and the White House has skirted questions on the issue.\n\n\n\nReporters pressed Jean-Pierre for a cost estimate at the White House briefing on Thursday and she leaned on saying it’s unclear how many borrowers will take up the offer.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe White House has insisted the loan forgiveness will be fully paid for because of other policies it says Biden has taken to reduce the deficit.\n\n\n\nRepublicans are going on the attack, raising political issues that aren’t going away.\n\n\n\nSen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) said the plan is a “scheme” that “forces blue-collar workers to subsidize white-collar graduate students.”&nbsp;He and other Republicans have also argued the plan will help wealthy people, given the income levels are capped at $125,00 and $250,000.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSenate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) called the decision a “wildly unfair distribution” of wealth in favor of higher-earning Americans and a “slap in the face” to those in the workforce who made sacrifices to pay off their debt.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHow the arguments on both sides resonate with blue collar workers — a demographic Democrats worry they could lose to the GOP in the midterms — will be closely watched in November.\n\n\n\nBiden is betting enough people will support the forgiveness, particular in minority communities, to ward off political hits from the GOP.",

        "description": "The Department of the Interior on Thursday announced a $560 million grant to 24 states to start plugging up and reclaiming abandoned oil and gas wells.\n\n\n\nThe Interior department estimates there are more than 10,000 of the so-called orphan wells across those 24 states that leak methane, significantly polluting communities and recreation spaces and contributing to climate change.\n\n\n\nThe funding to plug up the wells comes from President Biden's historic infrastructure package passed last year. The law includes $4.7 billion specifically to address the orphan wells. Thursday's funding is part of a phase one investment of &nbsp;$1.15 billion.\n\n\n\nInterior Secretary Deb Haaland said the infrastructure law \"is enabling us to confront long-standing environmental injustices by making a historic investment to plug orphaned wells throughout the country.\"\n\n\n\n\"At the Department of the Interior, we are working on multiple fronts to clean up these sites as quickly as we can by investing in efforts on federal lands and partnering with states and Tribes to leave no community behind,\" Haaland said in a statement.\n\n\n\nInterior officials say there are more than 129,000 abandoned oil and gas wells across the country, so the effort to plug them up in 24 states is just one step in the Biden administration's larger goal of halting those methane leaks on the continental U.S.\n\n\n\nSome of those 24 states have a large number of orphan wells. Kentucky, for example, is estimated to have up to 1,200 of them, while Kansas has more than 2,300 wells and Oklahoma has about 1,196.\n\n\n\nAs part of Thursday's grant, six states, including California, Mississippi and West Virginia, will begin measuring methane emissions at wells they plug up and remediate. \n\n\n\nTwelve states, including Kansas, New Mexico and Ohio, will prioritize plugging up wells in disadvantaged communities.\n\n\n\nThe Department of the Interior announced the phase one investment in January, the same month officials warned the U.S. has double the amount of abandoned oil and gas wells than previously thought.\n\n\n\nThe department also announced a $33 million package in May to plug up 277 wells on national lands.\n\n\n\nThe Biden administration has focused much of its attention on tackling climate change, including through the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act this month, which has allocated $369 billion for clean energy projects.\n\n\n\nMethane is 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat in the atmosphere and significantly accelerates climate change once released.",

        "description": "Debbie Harry and Clem Burke, 14th Street, New York City, circa 1976.Courtesy of Chris SteinBy the early 1970s, the Greenwich Village folk scene had faded, and a new sound was wafting up from the street. New York Dolls frontman David Johansen says it found a home just north of Bleecker Street and east of Washington Square. &quot;I was friends with Eric Emerson, who had a band called Magic Tramps, and he said that he was going to do a gig at this new place, Mercer Arts Center, and would my band want to come and open for him?&quot;By the summer of 1972, that gig turned into a weekly engagement, with the Dolls sharing the stage with guests including Jayne (then performing as Wayne) County and Ruby and the Rednecks. &quot;A scene started kind of coming around us,&quot; Johansen explains. &quot;And it was beautiful, a lot of people who would see each other on the street, and this gave them a chance to be in the same kind of place.&quot;Friday: Blondie joins NPR Music&#x27;s Listening PartyAt the time, Chris Stein was a student at the School of Visual Arts. He saw the Dolls perform at Mercer Arts and befriended Emerson, who became his roommate and sometime bandmate. Debbie Harry performed in a band called the Stilettos that featured three female vocalists and a male backing band, eventually including Stein on guitar.In August of 1973, Mercer Arts literally collapsed. But a few months later, CBGB opened blocks away, and that&#x27;s where Stein and Harry&#x27;s new band Blondie played its first gig in the spring of 1974. Roberta Bayley remembers working the door: &quot;I would say for the first year of Blondie, you know, they were kind of looked at, quite frankly, as the band least likely to succeed. Everybody liked the people in the band, but they hadn&#x27;t coalesced as a group really until [drummer] Clem Burke joined, then he brought in [bassist] Gary Valentine.&quot;Bayley started taking photos of the bands that played at CBGB and soon became the chief photographer of a new magazine called Punk, named as much for an attitude as an emerging music scene. Blondie added Jimmy Destri on keys and got signed to a small label called Private Stock. The band&#x27;s self-titled 1976 debut album featured &#x27;60s pop sounds, such as girl groups and surf rock, filtered through a prism of glitter and grit. Blondie&#x27;s look matched that sound. The guys wore shades, thrift store suits and skinny ties. Debbie Harry bleached her hair but let her dark roots show — putting a downtown spin on old Hollywood glam. &quot;I was very fascinated by these women that had this kind of glowing image on film,&quot; Harry explains. &quot;It seemed like something that I could do.&quot;Despite these nods to the past, Blondie was always looking ahead, reinterpreting a vast catalog of influences. After parting ways with Private Stock and signing with Chrysalis Records in 1977, the band released its sophomore album Plastic Letters and toured extensively to promote it. Blondie&#x27;s gender-flipping cover of the 1963 doo-wop novelty song &quot;Denise&quot; by Randy &amp; the Rainbows yielded a No. 2 hit on the British charts. But Chris Stein says American audiences were slower to warm to music that was neither strictly punk nor pop. &quot;When we first went to the U.K. and everybody started flinging themselves around, it was kind of enlightening because in New York it just wasn&#x27;t happening yet.&quot;So for Blondie&#x27;s next effort, producer Mike Chapman worked the band hard, squeezing hits from its eclectic influences as he had done for others such as Sweet and Suzi Quatro. As they were wrapping up their recording sessions, Stein and Harry shared a song with a funky groove that they had started sketching as early as 1974 — sometimes called &quot;Once I Had a Love&quot; and other times simply &quot;The Disco Song.&quot; Jimmy Destri&#x27;s idea to bring in a Roland CompuRhythm CR-78 drum machine gave the song an entirely new vibe. Tucked away on the B-side of the 1978 album Parallel Lines, &quot;Heart of Glass&quot; became Blondie&#x27;s first American No.1 hit. Mike Chapman and Debbie Harry in the studio during the recording of Parallel Lines.Courtesy of Roberta BayleyDespite some pushback from the anti-disco crowd, the album spawned several other singles. Blondie became a global sensation with plenty of fans back home, such as Gretchen Green, then a stage manager at the La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club. Green was in the midst of a divorce when she and her 3-year-old daughter moved from the suburbs to a sprawling loft around the corner from CBGB. She says there was very little furniture, but she did have skates and her daughter had a scooter. They also had a turntable, she recalls. &quot;So we put on Blondie and we would just carry on like we were at a roller-skating rink!&quot;Blondie put out three more studio records before taking an extended hiatus in 1982, each reflecting the adventurous spirit that had defined the band since its inception. Among its highest charting efforts was the 1980 single &quot;Rapture,&quot; which combined new wave, disco, hip-hop and rap. Stein and Harry had been introduced to the emerging hip-hop scene in 1978 by Fab 5 Freddy. He&#x27;s featured in the now iconic music video for the song, which also includes cameos from visual artists Lee Quiñones and Jean-Michel Basquiat, and choreographer William Barnes, who appears as the top-hatted &quot;man from Mars&quot; referenced in the song&#x27;s lyrics. After Blondie re-formed in the late 1990s, the band scored a hit with the power pop single &quot;Maria.&quot; Following its 2006 induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame, Blondie&#x27;s 2017 album Pollinator introduced a new generation of fans to its music, with collaborations from artists including Charli XCX and Dev Hynes. Now, as the band works on its next studio album, it&#x27;s also dropping Against The Odds: 1974-1982, a massive archival box set including unreleased music, ephemera and track-by-track commentary. A paperback edition of Debbie Harry&#x27;s 2019 memoir Face It is planned for fall, and Chris Stein, who&#x27;s already published two photo books, says he&#x27;ll release his memoir in 2023. \nThough Blondie&#x27;s lineup has changed over the years, to date the band has sold more than 40 million records worldwide, making it the most commercially successful export of New York&#x27;s 1970s underground scene. Roberta Bayley says what ultimately set the band apart was its open musical mind: &quot;They didn&#x27;t have rules for their sound. They were willing to experiment.&quot;\nCopyright 2022 NPR.

But a string of Democrats in tight races across the country want little to do with it,&#8221; NBC News reports.\n&#8220;That’s because the president may have just handed Republicans a new line of attack at a moment when Democrats were strengthening their positions in swing states and signs were emerging that the party could stave off what was to have been a GOP sweep in the midterm elections, campaign officials, party members, pollsters and national strategists in both parties say.&#8221;\n&#8220;Republicans are betting there will be a backlash against debt forgiveness in states or districts where college attainment is low.&#8221;",

From a purely pragmatic standpoint, thighs are more amenable to different cooking methods and – at around half the price of breasts – they’re the more wallet-friendly option, costing about $8.50 a kilo at supermarkets. To lock in moisture, always brine your chicken, says Will Tang of Melbourne’s Korr Jee Chicken. This is true of a whole bird or a single piece. Continue reading...",

        "description": "Chipotle workers in Lansing, Mich., overwhelmingly voted to become the first store in the restaurant chain to formally unionize on Thursday.\n\n\n\nEmployees voted 11-3 to unionize with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters for better pay, work hours and relationships with management. \n\n\n\nThe election was administered and tallied by the National Labor Relations Board after a petition was filed last month.\n\n\n\nSamantha Smith, 18, who has worked at the store for more than two years, said the successful unionization effort was an \"amazing moment\" for the 21-member team at the Michigan restaurant.\n\n\n\n\"We set out to show that our generation can make substantial change in this world and improve our working conditions by taking action collectively,\" Smith said in a statement. \"What this vote shows is that workers are going to keep taking the fight to big corporations like Chipotle and demand the working conditions we deserve.”\n\n\n\nIn a statement,&nbsp;Laurie Schalow, the chief corporate affairs officer at Chipotle, told The Hill she was&nbsp;“disappointed that the employees at our Lansing, MI restaurant chose to have a third party speak on their behalf because we continue to believe that working directly together is best for our employees.”\n\n\n\n\"At Chipotle, our employees are our greatest asset, and we are committed to listening to their needs and continuing to improve upon their workplace experience,\" Schalow said. \"Chipotle is proud to offer our employees industry-leading benefits such as competitive wages, debt-free degrees, tuition reimbursement up to $5,250 per year, health benefits and quarterly bonuses for all employees.\"\n\n\n\nThe success comes a month after Chipotle closed down a location in Augusta, Maine, which had formed an independent union but did not officially unionize with the National Labor Relations Board before corporate shuttered the store over low staffing concerns.\n\n\n\nService workers have rallied around unions or pushed for more rights in a newfound movement that took root during the coronavirus pandemic. \n\n\n\nStarbucks, Apple and Amazon have all seen their first unionization efforts during the pandemic-era shift for employee rights.\n\n\n\nChipotle's Lansing store, the first of the international restaurant chain's 3,000 stores to unionize, joins approximately 1.2 million workers represented by the Teamsters union across the country and about 4,000 workers in Michigan. \n\n\n\nTeamsters President Sean O’Brien said the union is \"fighting for our brothers and sisters at Chipotle to get the rights and workplace protections they deserve.\"\n\n\n\n\"Now is the time for working people in this country to take back what’s theirs. No matter your industry, no matter your age or how intimidating your employer may seem, you too can protect your labor with a union,\" O'Brien said in a statement. \"The revitalization of labor is really just beginning.\"\n\n\n\nHarper McNamara, 19, who has also worked at the Lansing store for more than two years, said the victory&nbsp;finally gives the workers a \"true voice on the job.\"\n\n\n\n\"I am so proud of all those who were involved in this effort, and showed the courage needed to take on a huge corporation,\" he said in a statement.",

        "description": "SACRAMENTO — California moved Thursday to ban the sale of new gas-powered cars and trucks by 2035, a first-in-the-nation mandate the state’s leaders hope will jolt the automotive industry and truly make electric vehicles mainstream. Other states led by Democrats, including New York and Oregon, are expected to swiftly follow California’s lead in a liberal-state push to fight climate change — moves not unlike past mandates on emissions and car safety. California’s determination to force what would amount to a monumental economic and social change reflects both the state’s long history in shaping the country’s auto market with stringent vehicle standards and the dire threat posed by climate change. “It’s ambitious, it’s innovative, it’s the action we must take if we’re serious about leaving this planet better off for future generations,” Gov. Gavin Newsom said in a statement after the California Air Resources Board adopted the requirement. “California will continue to lead the revolution towards our zero-emission transportation future.” The rule, which was formalized nearly two years after Newsom first announced it, will pose a significant challenge. Sales of fully electric vehicles in California, the country’s largest auto market, have made up 16 percent of the total so far in 2022. Industry experts say reaching the new goal will require fixing supply chain issues and building charging stations — and for EV prices to come down. “Whether or not these requirements are realistic or achievable is directly linked to external factors like inflation, charging and fuel infrastructure, supply chains, labor, critical mineral availability and pricing, and the ongoing semiconductor shortage,” said John Bozzella, the president and CEO of the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. Nationwide, fully electric vehicles make up only 6 percent of total new car sales. Still, other states are expected to adopt similar targets.    New Jersey, New York and Massachusetts are among the 17 states that have already made it a practice of adopting California’s tailpipe emission standards, adding up to a third of the country’s auto market. Most of those states are now expected to copy the new electric vehicle requirements over the next months, with some using the rules to add teeth to existing emissions targets. Among the first could be Oregon and Vermont, where regulators have already started drafting rules similar to those endorsed by Newsom. Automakers have long conditioned support for stronger electric vehicle mandates on state governments investing more in charging stations and other necessary infrastructure, as California has done. Some European countries have already set sales quotas for gas-powered vehicles and are further along in converting. Growth in the U.S. has been hampered by factors that include a lack of charging stations, the price of EVs and more recently by supply chain problems that have caused shortages of lithium for batteries and microchips. Automakers just five years ago would have had big problems with California's ban, said Margo Oge, a former top career official in the Environmental Protection Agency’s transportation office. But a combination of continued pressure from European and Chinese authorities and industry investments have prompted a change. \"In the past, I think you would have had a lot of pushback from the car companies. I don't expect that to be the case because many of the car companies — like GM, Ford, Volvo, Daimler, Volkswagen — they're already there,\" said Oge said, a member of Volkswagen's International Sustainability Council. Toyota sent a letter to California this week acknowledging the state’s ability to set the car rules, something California officials characterized as “old foes coming on board.” Other states that have not traditionally followed California may also adopt more EV goals, Oge said, in part because of money available from the recently passed Inflation Reduction Act.  \"[The] IRA is going to provide a lot of incentives to the states, for infrastructure, for manufacturing, for tax incentives,” she said. “So my hope is that other states will follow California.\" As more states adopt California’s rules, and the EV market expands, the federal government will come under increasing pressure to set similar national targets, said Elaine O’Grady, who works on auto policy for an alliance called the Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management. “The more states that adopt California standards, the more likely it is that federal government standards will be closer to California,” O’Grady said. California's rule has some exceptions. Older gas-powered cars could still operate and be sold on the used-vehicle market. In addition, some hybrids that are powered by gas and electricity will also be allowed.  The state will require permission under the federal Clean Air Act to set the requirement of 100 percent non-gas vehicle sales, and it’s unclear how long that process will take. The Biden administration for months has been considering a separate waiver for strengthened tailpipe rules for heavy-duty trucks, with manufacturers complaining that the rule did not give them the required four-year lead time. Such a waiver could also be vulnerable under a future Republican president opposed to the ban. The Trump administration revoked an earlier waiver allowing California to set stronger emissions standards through 2025; litigation had only just begun when the newly arrived Biden administration hit reverse and restored the state’s authority.",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/astros-notes-pressly-verlander-javier.html",
        "description": "The Astros placed closer Ryan Pressly on the 15-day injured list this afternoon, retroactive to August 22, with neck spasms. Righty Seth Martinez was recalled to take the vacated active roster spot. Pressly has been unavailable for the past couple games dealing with stiffness in his neck, and the issue is apparently severe enough it&#8217;ll take him out of commission for at least a couple weeks. The club hasn&#8217;t provided a more specific timetable on his return.\nPressly has excelled again this season, continuing along as one of the sport&#8217;s top late-game relievers. Through 37 2/3 innings on the year, the right-hander owns a 3.11 ERA with an excellent 32.2% strikeout percentage and just a 6.3% walk rate. His 44.2% ground-ball rate is the lowest mark in his four full seasons in Houston, but the two-time All-Star has more than offset that with elite swing-and-miss stuff. He&#8217;s gotten a whiff on 17.1% of his pitches, the 13th-highest rate among 214 relievers with 30+ innings pitched.\nMore out of Houston:\n\nJustin Verlander chatted with Ken Rosenthal of the Athletic earlier this week, discussing his progression back from the Tommy John surgery that wiped out virtually all of his 2020-21 seasons. The future Hall of Famer has put himself firmly in the conversation for a third career Cy Young award, posting an MLB-best 1.87 ERA over 23 starts. Verlander hasn&#8217;t looked at all fazed by his lack of innings over the prior two seasons, as he&#8217;s soaked up 149 frames (the 12th most in MLB). He&#8217;s already surpassed the 130-inning threshold to vest a player option in his deal that could keep him in Houston for $25MM next season. With how well he&#8217;s performed, however, he seems all but certain to forego that provision and retest the open market in search of an annual salary near or above the $43.333MM former teammate Max Scherzer landed from the Mets last offseason. Verlander noted he won&#8217;t be able to make a formal decision on the option until after he sees how he finishes the season, but he unsurprisingly tells Rosenthal that &#8220;if things continue to go the way they are and knock on wood, everything goes the way I think everybody would hope, then I would probably opt out. I’ve pitched pretty damn well.&#8220;\nThere&#8217;s a bit of a shake-up alongside Verlander in the starting staff, as skipper Dusty Baker told reporters the club will move from the six-man rotation they&#8217;d been deploying to a five-man staff for now (via Danielle Lerner of the Houston Chronicle). Righty Cristian Javier will be the odd man out, at least temporarily. Baker indicated the team would skip the 25-year-old&#8217;s scheduled start this weekend, with Javier available out of the bullpen instead. It&#8217;s not out of the question they eventually go back to the six-man staff, but with off days scheduled for next Monday and Thursday, there&#8217;s room for the club to consolidate the rotation for the time being. Javier&#8217;s return to the bullpen certainly isn&#8217;t an indictment of his performance. Through 112 1/3 frames, he owns a sterling 2.88 ERA with a 32.4% strikeout rate. Still, with a top five of Verlander, Lance McCullers Jr., Framber Valdez, Luis Garcia and José Urquidy, the Astros have enviable depth (although Garcia has struggled of late). Javier&#8217;s willingness to work as a multi-inning relief weapon as needed could forecast his potential role in the postseason, as he has far more recent bullpen experience than any of the other top rotation options on staff.",

        "description": "Catherine Perez-Shakdam is a research fellow at the Henry Jackson Society.\n\n\n\nIn its grand pursuit of control and ideological dominance, it looks as though the Islamic Republic of Iran is willing to commit the abominable. And their current weapon of choice? Water.\n\n\n\nLocated on the eastern edge of the Fertile Crescent, a historically verdant region stretching across the Middle East, the southwestern province of Khuzestan — or Ahwaz as locals prefer to call it — has been reduced to a desert. Where rivers once ran wild and abundant, irrigating fields of wheat, corn and rice stretching as far as the eye could see, riverbeds now stand barren. But the region’s riches aren’t limited to its vast arable lands and waterways, it also accounts for 16 percent of Iran’s GDP — second only to Tehran’s province — and is also home to 90 percent of the country’s oil resources, as well as 20 percent of its gas reserves.\n\n\n\nHere, the proverbial writing has been plastered on every wall for some time now. With its majority Sunni Arab population, Khuzestan, which happens to share a border with both Iraq and Kuwait, has always been viewed with much distrust by Tehran — an enemy to be placated and, if not, displaced beyond the country’s borders, so that its Shia identity suffers no contention. And now, Iran’s agenda for the region is coming into focus.\n\n\n\nTo put it plainly, Iran is expropriating its own nationals by playing the water access card. Since Ahwaz’s landowners refused to lease their lands to the state, so that it could claim more oil and gas for its coffers and better requisition its riches, Tehran is quite simply opting to drive them out, using thirst as a powerful incentive and seizing large swathes of land. And given the implications of this strategy, its time the West starts paying attention.\n\n\n\nBy rerouting much of the region’s water resources, and feigning mismanagement, the state has essentially engineered an exodus, forcing tens of thousands to abandon their homes and fields — which have now been rendered worthless — all so it can requisition and subcontract them to its main economic partner: China.\n\n\n\nBut it doesn’t stop there.\n\n\n\nIran, we have long been told, suffers from severe water mismanagement. And for several years now, experts have warned against both Tehran’s apathy and its officials’ propensity toward pursuing unsustainable water policies, pushing the nation ever closer toward an environmental precipice.\n\n\n\n A view of a bridge and beneath the remains of Lake Hamrin in Iraq&#8217;s Diyala province | Ahmad Al-Rubaye/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\nIran is endangering the water security and access of millions of its own people, and has done so wittingly, with complete disregard for the welfare of its compatriots. The regime, as it were, is instead catering to grander ambitions, which solely exist within the optics of its theopolitical ideology. And we, the West, ought to come to terms with that.\n\n\n\nIran is running geopolitical circles around us, and more often than not, distracting Western capitals from their real goals and projects, having them fuss over points of diplomacy instead. The incessant back-and-forth surrounding the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action — a deal that imposed curbs on Iran&#8217;s nuclear program in return for the lifting of international sanctions — is a perfect example of this. Whether or not Tehran will return to the negotiating table matters little when we know not what the Ayatollahs have been up to as of late.\n\n\n\nSince the West already appears to have become pawns in Russia’s energy bargain, getting a grip on yet another threat against our strategic interests is an absolute necessity. After all, in the hands of despots, water could become a most potent weapon of mass destabilization.\n\n\n\nFor two decades now — since right around the time the United States decided to dethrone Saddam Hussein — Iran has seen an opportunity it could exploit, playing its newfound closeness to Baghdad as a tactical advantage. By virtue of geography, and the flow of natural resources — oil and water — quite literally, the two countries share common strategic interests. They are the guardians of a fragile ecosystem, which requires a common vision to guarantee sustainability — only, Tehran is in the business of engineered subservience.\n\n\n\nIn Iraq’s water dependence, Iran saw an opportunity it could exploit for regional dominance , a principle it has since been keen to replicate, so it could exert power well outside its borders.\n\n\n\nThe core logic is quite simple: divert and/or restrict water in order to control migration and the political future of any given community, country or even region; and, if need be, threaten to unleash its huddled masses.\n\n\n\nWith millions at risk of displacement, one must ask what such migratory movements could equate to if they were to spill onto neighboring nations— or better yet, if the experiment of water control and rerouting could be replicated elsewhere to leverage power against other nations.\n\n\n\nAll this suddenly brings Iran’s recent activities in the Horn of Africa under a brand new light — which should concern us greatly — as water games in Ethiopia, the birthplace of the river Nile, could have devastating consequences for both Sudan and Egypt, prompting an exodus toward Europe and its neighboring regions.\n\n\n\nWhile migratory movements have proven to be vastly beneficial, spearheading growth and innovation, unfettered mass migration is inherently dangerous and could lead to violent clashes, with communities fighting over dwindling resources, putting world security at great risk.\n\n\n\nDoes anyone still believe Iran wants to play nice?",

        "description": "Jamie Dettmer is opinion editor at POLITICO Europe.\n\n\n\nWars transform nations and people — leaving them, whether victorious or vanquished, “all changed, changed utterly,” as Irish writer W.B. Yeats noted.\n\n\n\nYeats was writing about the armed insurrection against British rule in Ireland during April 1916. The uprising had lasted just six days, but Ireland would never be the same.\n\n\n\nUkraine’s ongoing epic defense of its national identity, territorial integrity and sovereignty has already lasted six months, and there is no end in sight. It has left widespread devastation, with towns and buildings wrecked, families traumatized and uprooted, livelihoods upended and lives lost and mourned.\n\n\n\nBut there’s another transformation underway — and it’s in Ukrainian hearts.\n\n\n\nBeing told endlessly that they don’t exist has led to the understandable Ukrainian reaction of insisting on their existence, and their right to exist as separate from Russia. This is leading them to try and expunge Russian cultural and linguistic influence on their country. But how they do so, and to what degree, is fraught with future danger.\n\n\n\nIn a March 2014 speech marking the annexation of Crimea, Russian President Vladimir Putin had declared that Russians and Ukrainians “are one people. Kiev is the mother of Russian cities. Ancient Rus&#8217; is our common source and we cannot live without each other.”\n\n\n\nBut, although the two nations are ensnared by history, the full-scale war he launched in February has only demonstrated the opposite, and has made it much more difficult for them to live with each other.\n\n\n\nIndeed, for a nation that Putin has argued doesn’t exist, Ukraine has been kicking up a storm, and is now taking the fight well behind military frontlines, brazenly crossing the border into Russia and occupied Crimea, disrupting Russian supply lines and logistics, leaving the Kremlin to fall back on preposterous lies to explain explosions witnessed by vacationing Russians.\n\n\n\nAnd much like American journalists like to write about how the United States “lost” this or that country, no doubt, sometime in the distant future, Russian journalists will be chronicling how Putin “lost” Ukraine.\n\n\n\nIn fact, Putin has not only lost Ukraine, but, worryingly, he has laid the groundwork for a possible long-running ethnic conflict that’s going to make peace even harder to establish and maintain when the war is over.\n\n\n\nThis toxic legacy will cast a long shadow, adding to the historical grievances and wrongs Ukraine has suffered at the hands of Russian leaders, including the Holodomor — the 1930s terror-famine inflicted on the country by Soviet autocrat Joseph Stalin, leaving millions dead.\n\n\n\nNow, on the anvil of Russia’s aggression and barbarity, a much stronger Ukrainian identity is being forged. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy alluded to this in a speech on Wednesday, marking the 31st anniversary of Ukraine’s vote to break with the Soviet Union, saying the country was reborn when Russia invaded on February 24.\n\n\n\nBut Ukrainians’ firmer sense of nationhood and identity, fueled by fury at what is befalling them, risks becoming less inclusive and more Russian-hating. How could it be otherwise?\n\n\n\nA man walks in front of a destroyed building after a Russian missile attack in the town of  Vasylkiv, near Kyiv | Dimitar Dilkoff/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\nUkrainians have been suffering the brutishness of Russian forces, which have not quailed from targeting civilians and their homes. They have pillaged and raped, they have tortured and executed non-combatants, and at every turn, they have belittled and dismissed the Ukrainian national identity.\n\n\n\nHowever, the burgeoning de-Russification in Ukraine is one of the issues that needs a cool-headed examination. The process of removing Russian cultural and linguistic influence from the country is not an easy — or necessarily equitable — thing to do, when around a quarter of Ukrainians still identify as Russian speakers.\n\n\n\nDe-Russification predates the February invasion, and it has often merged with de-communization. For example, the names of cities, villages and streets referring to Soviet history and luminaries fell under a ban approved by Ukraine’s parliament in April 2015. And since 2016, all information on notice boards at railway stations and airports can only be given in Ukrainian and English — and not Russian.\n\n\n\nLocal jurisdictions have also sought to expunge Russian culture before. In 2018, authorities in Lviv introduced a ban on the public use of the Russian-language movies, books and songs until Russian forces had withdrawn from Crimea and the Donbas. The ban was later overturned on human rights grounds and for being unconstitutional.\n\n\n\nIn January, Human Rights Watch also raised concerns about the lack of protections for Russian speakers in a new state language law that entered into force this year. The law requires print media outlets registered in Ukraine to publish only in the Ukrainian language, or to provide an accompanying Ukrainian version, or equivalent in content, volume and method of print, when publishing in another language. But while exceptions were made for other minority languages, such as English and official European Union languages, there were none provided for Russian.\n\n\n\nAnd since the invasion’s onset, this de-Russification has proceeded apace. Villages and towns have changed street names, Soviet-Russian monuments have been dismantled, and Ivano-Frankivsk proudly announced it had become the first city to be utterly free of any Russian-origin place names.\n\n\n\n“We will not have anything Russian left here,” Oleksii Danilov, secretary of the National Security and Defense Council, said in April. A poll published by Rating just a few days earlier had found that 76 percent of Ukrainians backed the renaming of streets and buildings and other structures that were associated with Russia.\n\n\n\nYet, this still leaves a large minority who don&#8217;t; and history has a way of not being denied or canceled.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, in June, the Ukrainian parliament passed a set of new laws banning the distribution of Russian books printed overseas, and the playing or performance of Russian music by post-Soviet era artists, further seeking to distance the country from Russian culture.\n\n\n\nBut through the often tragic twists and turns of Ukraine’s tangled history, and the cultural imperialism of Russian czars and communist autocrats, Ukrainian and Russian culture are inextricably linked and have contributed to each other’s shaping — for good or ill.\n\n\n\nUkraine’s national poet Taras Shevchenko, viewed among the originators of modern Ukrainian literature, is testimony to that. Revered for his nationalistic poems written in Ukrainian, which contributed greatly to the growth of the country’s national consciousness, his poem “The Testament” is lauded as an anthem of national sentiment. But he also wrote poems in the Russian language and kept a private journal in Russian.\n\n\n\nAnd there are risks in rejecting all things Russian. First, it gives fodder to Kremlin propagandists, whipping up anti-Ukrainian feeling both in Russia and among Russian speakers and ethnic Russians in Ukraine. And second, aggressive de-Russification will make it even harder for all Ukrainians, regardless of their traditions and pasts, to reconcile and live together peaceably.\n\n\n\nIn his independence day speech this week, Zelenskyy vowed Kyiv&#8217;s forces will retake Russian-occupied Crimea. But if that day comes, how will Kyiv approach de-Russification? Will it still insist on the use of the Ukrainian language in most aspects of public life on a peninsula where 65 percent of the population are ethnic Russian?\n\n\n\nAs Ukraine goes about trying to win this war, it also needs to think about how it will win the peace.",

        "description": "Photo by Mike Stobe/Getty Images\n    \n\n  Pete Alonso hit a towering home run and Jacob deGrom pitched like Jacob deGrom. On a night where the Braves did not play, the Mets had an opportunity to gain a half game on Atlanta, while kicking off a 10 game homestand against the Colorado Rockies. With Jacob deGrom on the mound, the Mets did just that, winning 3-1.\ndeGrom started off his night in typical Jacob deGrom fashion, retiring the first 13 batters he faced. deGrom displayed his routine brilliance, throwing only 50 pitches in the first 4 innings, as he was cruising towards yet another masterpiece. \nAt the plate, all three of the Mets runs came in the third inning. Their first run came on a Francisco Lindor groundout, giving them the early 1-0 lead. The play was critical as the Rockies failed to turn a double play, allowing the inning to continue. During the very next at bat, Pete Alonso swung on a 3-0 pitch, and hit a massive two-run homer off the facing of the second deck in left field.\ndeGrom ran into some trouble in the top of the fifth inning, allowing an infield single to José Iglesias, the first baserunner of the night, and then a double to Randal Grichuk. However, he was able to retire the next two batters, leaving the inning unscathed.\nIn the sixth inning, deGrom labored yet again, after allowing a solo home run off the bat of Ryan McMahon, he issued his first walk of the night, bringing the tying run to the plate for the Rockies. But after a strikeout and a fielder’s choice, deGrom walked away limiting the damage, his work for the night done. deGrom’s final line was 6 innings pitched on 87 pitches, while allowing one run with 9 strikeouts.\nThe bullpen did the rest of the work on the night, with Seth Lugo working around trouble in the seventh inning to keep the 3-1 lead. Edwin Díaz then made a rare appearance in the eighth inning against the heart of the Rockies’ order, and had a mere mortal performance, allowing one hit and only striking out one batter. In the top of the ninth inning, Adam Ottavino came on for the save and secured a much needed victory for the Mets.\nBox scores\nESPN\nMLB\nWin Probability Added\n  \n        \n      Fangraphs.com\n  \nWhat’s WPA?\nBig Mets winner: Jacob deGrom, +21% WPABig Mets loser: Brett Baty, -9% WPAMets pitchers: +39% WPAMets hitters: +10% WPATeh aw3s0mest play: Pete Alonso’s two-run home run, +17.4% WPATeh sux0rest play: Ryan McMahon’s solo home run in the sixth inning, -7.3% WPA\nSB Nation GameThreads\nAmazin’ Avenue\nPurple Row",

But we’ve chosen a different path forward, the future, unity, hope and optimism.”  \n\n\n\n“We choose to build a better America,” Biden said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe event represented Biden’s largest campaign event this year and took place just more than two months until the midterm elections. Thousands of people were packed into a gymnasium and overflow space at Richard Montgomery High School, where the rally took place.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden spent part of his speech touting his administration’s accomplishments, including the distribution of COVID-19 vaccinations and the job growth the country has seen under his watch. He cheered the decline in gasoline prices over the last several weeks, a sign of surging inflation potentially easing.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe president also discussed recent legislative victories, including a bipartisan law that will sink billions into the domestic semiconductor industry and the sweeping climate and healthcare bill known as the Inflation Reduction Act that Democrats finally got across the finish line earlier this month.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut he spent ample time attacking Republicans, warning that a GOP majority in Congress could move to enact a nationwide abortion ban and assailing Republicans for voting against the climate and health law.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe portrayed Social Security as under threat from Republicans, pointing to a plan offered by Sen. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) that proposed a sunset on all federal legislation after five years. Elements of the plan, which has run into criticism within the GOP, were displayed prominently on screens at the rally.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden returned to the warning about democracy repeatedly, alluding to Trump’s failed attempt to overturn the results of the 2020 election and the violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. Many Republican candidates who Trump has endorsed this election cycle deny the results of the 2020 election.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden made a point to distinguish between what he called “conservative Republicans” and “MAGA Republicans,” citing Maryland’s current Gov. Larry Hogan (R), as an example of the former.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“The MAGA Republicans don’t just threaten our personal rights and economic security. They’re a threat to our very democracy,” Biden said as he wrapped up his remarks. “They refuse to accept the will of the people. They embrace, embrace political violence. They don’t believe in democracy.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“This is why in this moment, those of you that love this country — Democrats, independents, mainstream Republicans — we must be stronger, more determined, and more committed to saving America than the MAGA Republicans are destroying America,” he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHours earlier at a fundraiser in Bethesda, Biden also accused Trump and his allies in the party of espousing a philosophy akin to “semi-fascism.”&nbsp;&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe comments represented perhaps the most forceful rebuke of Republicans to date from Biden, who ran in 2020 as a unifier and who has sought to work across the aisle during his presidency. They signal a sharper tone for Biden as he and other Democrats try to hold on to their narrow majorities in the House and Senate in November.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden appeared at Thursday’s event alongside Maryland Democratic gubernatorial candidate Wes Moore and other Democratic representatives from the state.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBiden has upcoming official trips planned to Pennsylvania and Ohio, both battleground states with critical races for Democrats, and the White House has signaled more plans for travel during the fall months.&nbsp;&nbsp;",

        "description": "This summer, the DLC-SAVA Conservation project at the Duke Lemur Center is leading a Bass Connections project on bicultural sustainability in Madagascar. Two student team members, including Jane Slentz-Kesler, a junior at Macalester College in Minnesota, and Maggie Poulos, a second-year master's student at the Sanford School of Public Policy, recently shared updates on their research in the field.\nJane Slentz-Kesler joined the DLC-SAVA Conservation project after receiving a competitive summer research grant to conduct independent research in Madagascar. In addition to assisting with the social sciences aspects of the project, Jane is exploring the diverse landscape in the communities and agroecosystem to understand more about how local people use the land and how their knowledge about local resources and perspectives on resource management contribute to their land use practices.\nMaggie Poulos is a lead on the social sciences aspects of the project and is examining livelihood strategies of rural communities in the SAVA region and their perspectives on how to successfully manage their resources. She is especially interested in how vanilla agriculture impacts livelihood strategies and potential microfinance interventions to help people save money and get loans to start their agricultural businesses.\nGuarding Vanilla in the Madagascar Countryside\nBy Jane Slentz-Kesler\nWhat an afternoon! It all started when Olina and I were drawing a map, trying to locate different crops and farmlands. We’re a part of the same research team this summer, living in a remote village in Madagascar called Ambodivoara.\nJane Slentz-Kesler (left)\nI’m currently a student at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota, and Olina is a recent graduate from CURSA University, the main university in the SAVA region of Madagascar, but we’re both working with the Duke Lemur Center-SAVA Conservation project this summer. Our research team is especially interested in local livelihoods, namely vanilla cultivation, agroecology and financial security.\nOlina leading the way through the farms and fields\nOlina and I were studying a mountainside collection of crops when a certain stream piqued our interest. Olina has some family in this village, and her brother Velin generously offered to take us on a tour of this stream and the mountainside. Best tour ever!\nOlina and her brother Velin with fruits and sugarcane straight from the fields\nWe crossed the river and walked through the fields, teetering along the tops of rice-field terrace walls and stopping at each different crop so I could take pictures. There were peanuts, soy beans, papaya, carrots, ginger, pineapple, cassava, raffia palms covered in fruit, rice (of course), bananas, lemongrass, a spicy flower that made my mouth feel like it was vibrating, green beans, jackfruit, lychee, coffee, vanilla, sugarcane, some fruit that looked like a big avocado but had a sweet-tart-esque inside, yams and maybe more … you get the idea.\nPapaya tree full of fruit (left) and soy beans that are commonly grown in the cold season (right)\nOlina and Velin were handing me fruits to try left and right, or plucking leaves from a plant that looked like general shrubbery to me and saying “Eat this! Have you tried [this fruit]?” or “What’s the English word for [that fruit]?” I would laugh and explain that we don’t have those in the United States and that I don’t know if there is even an English word for that fruit.\nPeanuts are a staple crop\nThe slope got steeper and we were climbing steps carved straight into the earth. I looked back over my shoulder and saw the beautiful village-scape, nestled in between mountains on all sides. The path thinned ahead of us and I had to put some pep in my step to keep up with Velin. We pushed through weeds (or were they crops?), whipping our ankles and making little paper cuts on our arms, but I was too excited to care, because Velin told us we were going to see vanilla beans!\nJane navigating the narrow paths while carrying a sample of fresh ginger\nWe descended to a little stream with big raffia palms growing straight out of the streambed and picked our way into the shadier, denser forest. I felt a sting on my ankle and squashed a fat mosquito. I looked up and there they were! Snaking around a supporting tree were several “pieds” or “feet” of vanilla.\nA vanilla vine snakes around its support tree\nI don’t know if you’ve ever seen vanilla growing – I know I certainly hadn’t – but it looks nothing like you’d expect. Though it’s an orchid, it looks like a very thick vine, almost like a succulent, and it grows big, flat and heavy leaves. And if you’re lucky, you’ll see a couple of green vanilla beans hanging from the stalk. We were very lucky, as you could have probably guessed from the pictures.\nGreen vanilla beans, almost ready to be harvested and then cured, or sold directly in the market\nVanilla straight from the vine is very green. It takes curing and processing to transform them into the ready-to-use brown vanilla beans that most of us are used to seeing. We’ve heard from many villagers during our research interviews that they would like to receive trainings on vanilla growing and processing to make the crop more lucrative.\nThough vanilla is perhaps the most profitable crop in this region, it can also be quite contentious, even dangerous, to grow. Theft is such a high concern that people build small houses amid their vanilla plots here on the side of the mountain to guard the vanilla throughout the night. One villager told us that the biggest challenge with selling vanilla is how stressful the whole process is. This villager said they don’t even eat sometimes during the pollination season and that there’s nothing that can ease the stress about vanilla growing.\nTemporary shelter made for farmers to stay in their field and guard their vanilla\nOlina humors me as I try to get the perfect shot of a vanilla bean while Velin disappears up into the tops of trees to harvest various fruits, which come raining down. We hike back to our side of the mountain and I gaze down at the village with small smoke columns rising from people’s cooking fires, the terraced rice fields leading up the mountainsides, the forested creeks which are chock-full of fruits and vegetables and the river that winds through all of this landscape.\n\nI’m suddenly hit with a sense of how interconnected it all is. I also feel a little stab of sadness, wondering what will come of this place with so many impending dangers of our rapidly globalizing and warming world. I try to remind myself that all I can do is to be here now and do what I can. And so, I follow Olina and Velin back down the mountain, bubbling with energy and awe, rushing home to all my new friends with my camera full of pictures and my arms full of fruit.\nEmpowering the Vanilla Supply Chain from the Ground Up\n\nBy Maggie Poulos\nWomen sort vanilla beans\nVisiting the warehouse of a vanilla exporting company smells exactly how you’d imagine. Vanilla’s warm and familiar aroma was the first to greet me as I approached the front steps of Madagascar Spice Company (MSC) based in Sambava. Sitting down with Dylan Randriamihaja, the founder and CEO of MSC, I wanted to learn more about the vanilla supply chain.\nAs a part of my project’s social science subteam, I focus on researching vanilla farming and opportunities for alternative livelihoods. Through Duke Lemur Center and SAVA’s regional university CURSA, our team of researchers in Ambodivoara has interviewed vanilla farmers, but now I have the unique opportunity to see the second stop on vanilla’s global journey – vanilla exporting companies.\nVanilla cooperative in Madagascar\nIn 2018, MSC helped found a cooperative of over 2500 vanilla farmers, through which the company now sources all of its vanilla. A major key to the creation of the cooperative lies in organic certification – without a formal entity, such as a cooperative, it’s nearly impossible for an exporting company to retain its organic standards. Kilos and kilos of vanilla beans are in stored rice bags, all sourced from this cooperative. In the photo to the left, they are ready to be weighed and recorded, before the sorting of the beans takes place.\nA group of women have the job of sorting all the vanilla beans that come through the warehouse. The beans have been cured or dried in the sun, until they turned their dark brown color. Beans are sorted a couple of different ways, most importantly, by size and if there are any impurities on the bean. For example, if a bean is split down the middle, it wouldn’t be categorized as a “gourmet bean”.\nIn the photo below, I am holding the finished product – a bundle of gourmet vanilla beans, ready to be boxed and shipped abroad. The bundle is wrapped in a string of raffia, a palm that produces leaves often used for Malagasy weaving. Looking down at my hands, I am reminded of the hard work that has brought this bundle of vanilla beans to this point. But they are not done yet and will soon reach their final destination!\nHolding a bundle of gourmet vanilla beans\nAs I head back to Ambodivoara this week to re-join our village research team, I’m thinking more and more about how local vanilla farmers are the foundation of the global vanilla supply chain. How can the DLC- SAVA Conservation project and CURSA University support the strengthening of this foundation? Can we establish new relationships between these local farmers and vanilla exporting companies in Sambava? With a dual focus on our little village and the rest of the world, our research seeks to empower the vanilla supply chain from the ground – or the bean – up!\nLearn More\nThis is the third of a three-part series of reflections from the Biocultural Sustainability in Madagascar project team. Read part one about their first few weeks in Madagascar and part two about their forest ecology and social science subteams.\nSubmit a proposal for a 2023-2024 Bass Connections project by November 7.\nExplore the Energy &amp; Environment theme to browse additional biodiversity conservation project teams.\nDate:&nbsp;Monday, August 15, 2022 - 12:00amIcon:&nbsp;Theme:&nbsp;Energy and Environment",

        "description": "The multidisciplinary research and conservation team Biocultural Sustainability in Madagascar has been hard at work in the SAVA region. With a team of over 40 researchers, team members have been conducting interviews in local communities and studying lemurs and forest ecology in the COMATSA-Sud protected area. Upon arrival in the region, the team split into two subgroups, with one group camping in the forest reserve for two months and the other living in the local community to experience what Malagasy life is really like. Halfway through their research in Madagascar, the team has shared a few updates.\nThe landscape around the COMATSA-Sud protected area\nBy James Herrera\nSo far, our forest ecology team has observed more than 80 encounters of lemurs, including 10 different species. We’ve also been setting live traps to capture nocturnal lemurs for short-term study, including 12 mouse lemurs and 4 hairy-eared dwarf lemurs. The hairy-eared dwarf lemur is extremely rare throughout its range and very little research has been conducted on this species. Our team has been fortunate enough to observe them regularly during nocturnal surveys and we are among the first to have captured them in the wild. After measuring the animals and giving them individually distinguishing marks, we released them into the forest.\nCamille and assistant Fen Telessy from the regional university take data on germination rates\nOur team member Camille DeSisto (Ph.D. student in Ecology) is studying how lemurs and trees depend on one another: lemurs feed on diverse tree species, while the trees disburse their seeds with the help of lemurs’ ... feces! Camille is gathering seeds from fecal samples and planting them in a tree nursery in the forest. Ten seedlings have already sprouted from the lemur fecal samples. Camille and the local team from the community will continue to monitor these seedlings, and when they’re mature enough, they will be planted in areas that have faced recent deforestation.\nCamille with assistant Chine and coordinator James Herrera in our forest camp\nWhile in the village, our social science team has conducted over 200 interviews to study socioeconomics, farming practices and nutritional health in the region. Maggie Poulos and Bethany Old from the Duke Sanford School of Public Policy are also conducting focus groups and key informant interviews to learn more about microfinance programs, agriculture and the health of mothers and children in Madagascar. Alongside Malagasy researchers Ardhilles and Nestorine, Maggie and Bethany are learning a great deal about the challenges that farmers face, especially concerning food security and nutritional health. We have already found that about 13% of children under five are anemic and require nutritional interventions to improve their health and development.\nMaggie and assistant Candidier translate results of focus groups (left) while Nestorine and her assistants take measurements of hemoglobin levels using non-invasive techniques to quantify anemia prevalence in the community (right)\nMacalester College student Jane Kesler-Slentz, who is also a part of our Bass Connections team, studies how communities use resources in their surrounding landscape, including in the forest. Using participatory approaches, she asks community members to draw maps of the landscape and identify areas of use, why they use them and where illegal activities are occurring in the protected area.\nJane Kesler-Slentz (left) and the local forest managers created resource maps to understand the spatial distribution of landscape features.\nDr JJ Strouse of the Duke School of Medicine also visited our research project and has become a key partner in our study and planned interventions. He was able to observe the setting first-hand and gave excellent feedback on the diverse aspects of our project. Together, we met with local doctors to better understand the local healthcare infrastructure and the obstacles we need to overcome to improve nutritional health in the region. This was a crucial visit, for Dr JJ Strouse is now partnering up with the DLC-SAVA Conservation project to craft grant proposals for further support.\nDr. JJ Strouse (top left) met with the doctors and conservationists with the civil society organization Association Manome Tanana to discuss health challenges and solutions in SAVA.\nA key activity in our project is to train farmers in agroecology techniques. These practices will allow the farms to produce diverse and nutritious food, while providing enough food for the family and creating a surplus for sale. Our workshops involve hands-on skills development on how to amend the low-quality soils with locally available compost materials. Over 60 farmers have already engaged in our workshop and soon we will be collaborating with the farmers to work together and plant gardens with 12 different participants. These participants will be selected based on their interest and desire to improve the agricultural techniques and productivity in the region.\nNew garden beds were prepared and amended with locally-sourced compostable materials to improve soil quality and crop productivity (left) while training participants shared seeds to plant in their new gardens (right).\nEvrard has also joined our team to educate children and adults in the area on the value of the environment for people’s everyday lives. With this combined research and development project, we hope to improve the community’s ability to produce enough food to eat and sell, while also protecting the forest and all the wildlife and ecosystem services it provides.\nIn addition to Duke students and partners in the COMATSA-Sud, our Bass Connections project also includes a Ph.D. student Marie Fleming from the University of California-Davis. She is addressing similar social and ecological questions at another DLC-SAVA Conservation site, the village of Andrapengy and the sacred mountain Ambanitaza. Her project includes producing resource maps of the forests and landscapes that surround the village to understand more about the past, the present and the optimal future of the landscape.\nMarie (left, center back row) with her team at Andrapengy; Marie, Rauchilla and Anicet from the regional university and their resource maps (right).\nLearn More\nThis is the second of a three-part series of reflections from the Biocultural Sustainability in Madagascar project team. Read part one about their first few weeks in Madagascar and part three about their study of local livelihoods in the region.\nSubmit a proposal for a 2023-2024 Bass Connections project by November 7.\nExplore the Energy &amp; Environment theme to find more project teams that work in conservation and biodiversity.\nDate:&nbsp;Sunday, August 14, 2022 - 11:30pmIcon:&nbsp;Theme:&nbsp;Energy and Environment",

In the beginning of our field trip, we also attended the virtual Malagasy Scientist Seminar series with Dr. Sarobidy Rakotoarison, who discussed the key topics of our project, such as equitable conservation policy and environmental justice.\nThe first meeting of the CURSA team in Antalaha (left) and the virtual presentation of Dr. Sarobidy Rakotoarison on equitable conservation policy (right)\nAfter a night in Antalaha, we traveled back to the Sambava office, packed all our gear into a mini-bus and three SUVs and took the long drive to Andapa. There, we enjoyed a group dinner and had a round-table discussion about the goals of our multidimensional project in which everyone could discuss their expectations for team behavior.\nTeam members on the mini-bus (left) and sharing a meal with project partners (right)\nNext, we took a long, bumpy drive on the dirt roads outside of Andapa. After driving for three hours, we arrived in Ambodivoara, the village where we are conducting our research. This village is on the outskirts of a remote protected area called the COMATSA, a corridor that links two other biodiversity parks. We held a town hall-style meeting with the community to explain the goal of our project and ask for their permission to work together both in the village and in the forest.\nOur team met with community members shortly after dawn to discuss the goals of the project and ask permission to work together.\nOur team then divided into two subgroups. The forest ecology team was tasked with preparing over 60 bags to be transported by porters to their forest camp, while the social sciences team began piloting and testing the survey instruments to study different aspects of socioeconomics, demographics, farming and land use practices, food security, diet and nutritional health. \nCamille and Tristan from Duke and Jean Tonné begin their 4+ hour trek to the forest camp\nThe social sciences team also set out to conduct household surveys as well as focus groups and key informant interviews to better understand people’s perceptions regarding microfinance systems, farming practices and market dynamics. Their team was also testing soil quality as it relates to farming productivity and nutritional health. In the meantime, the forest ecology team began their work by setting up the camp, inventorying the gear and measuring and marking the trails they would use to survey for lemurs.\nEsperio, Angele, and Nestorine go over how to test soil quality using Solvita soil respiration equipment (left); the forest camp site (right)\nShortly into the project, our team had spotted over 200 lemurs, including the rare and endangered silky sifaka. At night, we also caught glimpses of the nocturnal lemurs, which are extremely abundant! In addition to lemurs, we also saw so many amazing species, like chameleons and leaf-tailed geckos.\nEdgar and Jean Tonné collect data on lemurs (left), including the silky sifaka (right), one of the most endangered primates in the world.\nBiodiversity of Madagascar\nUnfortunately, people in Madagascar are facing challenges of food insecurity and declining soil fertility, so they often turn to forest resources to meet their needs. Plots of forest are cleared to plant crops because the forest still provides the rich soil needed for productive agriculture. Hardwood trees are also cut to make planks and posts for building materials. \nForest clearing to plant crops and use trees for building materials\nTo better understand this process, our team member Camille is studying how lemurs disperse the seeds of the trees that they use for feeding, as well as how people use these trees and what they know about lemur-tree interactions.\nWe are looking forward to another 6 weeks of research, workshops and development with our Bass Connections team, and we plan to continue our work with the community at Ambodivoara throughout the coming years. The people at Ambodivoara are very excited to have the opportunity to work with us, just as we are excited to assist them in developing sustainable solutions to the challenges they face in their everyday lives.\nSunset in Madagascar\nLearn More\nThis is the first of a three-part series of reflections from the Biocultural Sustainability in Madagascar project team. Read part two about their forest ecology and social science subteams and part three about their study of local livelihoods in the region.\nSubmit a proposal for a 2023-2024 Bass Connections project by November 7.\nExplore the Energy &amp; Environment theme to browse additional biodiversity conservation project teams.\nDate:&nbsp;Sunday, August 14, 2022 - 10:00pmIcon:&nbsp;Theme:&nbsp;Energy and Environment",

        "description": "Kelsey Graywill (front row, left) and her research team\nBy Milena Ozernova ’22\nIt’s 5:00 a.m. and campus is still quiet except for a lone student who hurries through the Chapel Quad, making her way from her sleepy dorm to Duke Medical School located on the other side of campus. Research starts early for Kelsey Graywill, a member of a long-running Bass Connections team whose work designing interventions to improve neurosurgery patient outcomes in Uganda started at the crack of dawn on a corner of campus that only a small fraction of Duke undergraduates get to experience. \n“My phone’s lock screen is still the picture that I took from outside my dorm window on my way to this early Bass Connections meeting,” Graywill reminisced. “That was the first time in my Duke career when I felt like I was really able to do the kind of thing that I wanted, which was very meaningful for me.” She graduated in 2018.\nIf Graywill’s self-designed major titled “Human Creativity: Evolutionary Neuroaesthetics” focused on the intersection of brain science and aesthetics, how did she end up trekking across campus to collaborate on research to improve neurosurgical patient outcomes in Uganda? It turns out, exploring projects and figuring out how they fit together is basically Graywill’s superpower.\nGraywill's self-designed major explored creativity through art and neuroscience (Photo: Duke Arts)\nAfter conducting research in cognitive neuroscience as a first-year student, Graywill began searching for interdisciplinary projects that would enable her to conduct research at the intersection of multiple disciplines and prepare her for medical school. \n“I looked into a few Bass Connections projects and found one that worked on various kinds of health behavior initiatives in a neurosurgery ward at a hospital in Kampala, Uganda,” Graywill said. “This project had so much overlap with work that I wanted to do as a physician. As an undergrad, I thought I was going to have to wait until I’m in medical school to be able to get involved in this kind of research!”\n“Our team was a part of the larger Duke Global Neurosurgery and Neurology (DGNN) group that consists primarily of health care providers at the Duke Hospital and conducts research in partnership with Mulago National Referral Hospital (MNRH) in Kampala,” Graywill explained. \nNeurosurgery ward at the Mulago National Referral Hospital in Kampala\nThe project had three unique but interrelated subteams that helped address mortality rates in the neurosurgery ward in Kampala, with three students working in each group. Graywill’s subteam addressed health, hygiene, behavior and sanitization on the ward, working with their faculty mentor and local partners to collect data, design interventions, execute the initiatives and measure the results. \n“In such a small subteam, we were all very hands-on and involved,” Graywill said.\nWhile team members spent most of their time working intensively within their subteam, all students still had plenty of opportunities to bond with their full team by attending team meetings, listening to guest lectures by practicing physicians, and most importantly, traveling to Mulago Hospital in Uganda to collect data on the ground and test their designed interventions.\n“Every day we would go into the neurosurgery ward to do data collection. For my group, that involved making maps of the places in the ward where we observed different types of health hygiene,” Graywill explained. \nTeam members would map the places where people were washing their hands or where there might have been infection control issues. For instance, many family members acting as caretakers had to live in the neurosurgery ward with the patients and sleep underneath their beds to care for them during the day as a way to reduce the workload of the nurses. Students would observe these interactions and examine how they might affect mortality rates in the ward, either through infection transfer or other hygiene behavior.\nThe premise of the research was to find out why the mortality rate in the neurosurgery ward remained high despite a very successful “twinning” program between Duke Neurosurgery and MNRH that provided the Ugandan surgeons with equipment and training. \n“The underlying issue was the lack of compliance with medication from the patients and inadequate family and caregiver education, especially since the families spent so much time caring for the patients,” Graywill shared. “There were also issues with infections on the ward, so the goal of our team was to address this issue.”\nOne of the interventions students designed was to install hand sanitizer pumps in different places in the ward and measure how people were using them and whether they were sanitizing their hands before or after contacting patients. After a month of data collection, the team came back to Duke and spent the entire academic year analyzing which interventions were most effective in reducing the mortality rates. \nComing from Duke University to Uganda, team members had to carefully navigate the existing power structures and the challenges of conducting research in a foreign country. \nGraywill (left), Professor Anthony Fuller (back row, left) and team members in front of Mulago Hospital\n“There are a lot of ethical considerations that you have to make when you’re partnering with a community to do research,” Graywill explained. “All the students on our team had different interests, which definitely challenged us in terms of our growth as researchers because we had to figure out among each other how we were going to navigate the ethics of doing this kind of research.”\n[While in Uganda], we didn’t do a lot of touristy stuff. A lot of that was because our mentor didn’t believe that if we were going to be there to do work, to do research, we should be going off and using [this experience] to be tourists. He instilled in us the mindset that if we’re here to do work and collaborate, we should not be self-serving.\n\nGraywill’s mentor and team leader Anthony Fuller (assistant professor of neurosurgery) lived with the students when they were in Kampala, often offering helpful advice about working with patients as well as the politics and ethics of community-engaged research. \n“[While in Uganda], we didn’t do a lot of touristy stuff. A lot of that was because our mentor didn’t believe that if we were going to be there to do work, to do research, we should be going off and using [this experience] to be tourists. He instilled in us the mindset that if we’re here to do work and collaborate, we should not be self-serving.”\n“Even now, I’ve reached out to [Professor Fuller] and he’s given me advice on what my next steps for medical school should be,” said Graywill, who did a master’s program at Goldsmiths, University of London, after Duke. “That’s four years since I graduated and five years since I was participating in his Bass Connections project.”\nAccording to Graywill, it isn’t always easy to find a good mentor, so she is grateful that the university tries to help students find and connect with faculty mentors through programs like Bass Connections. \n“Professor Fuller was one of my best mentors, and I’m extremely lucky to have had my project team experience,” Graywill said. “He took a personal interest in each of the students on our team and was an advocate for every single one of us.”\nAkash Patel, Graywill and Sam Sadler in front of their poster in 2017\nIn the end, those early mornings with her research team formed lasting bonds and became a core part of her Duke research experience.\nDuke University senior Milena Ozernova is a Bass Connections communications assistant majoring in political science.

        "description": "Bass Connections and the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy announce a new theme, Health Policy &amp; Innovation, to support interdisciplinary teams of faculty and students in their exploration of solutions to improve health and wellbeing in the United States. \nThe Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy will administer the theme, which will be led by Beth Gifford, associate research professor in the Sanford School of Public Policy and a Duke-Margolis core faculty member.\nBeth Gifford\n“The Bass Connections model facilitates the type of genuine partnerships and applied research necessary to address the complexities of the U.S. healthcare system and translate research into impact,” Gifford said. “I’m honored to be part of this new chapter in the life of the program and in the university’s efforts to improve health while preparing the next generation of public health leaders.”\nThe Health Policy &amp; Innovation theme is supported by an expendable gift from Duke Medical School alumnus Dr. Robert J. Margolis M’71 and Lisa Margolis, and matched by Bass Connections funds. \nBass Connections organizes research opportunities around six broad themes in which Duke has extensive disciplinary and interdisciplinary strengths. The new Health Policy &amp; Innovation theme will build on a robust network of faculty, students and community partners who are committed to examining the root causes of health inequality in the United States and developing new policies, practices and technologies to advance health for all Americans.\nThis theme will also take advantage of a growing partnership between Duke-Margolis and Bass Connections. Over the past two years, Duke-Margolis has supported a range of Bass Connections projects related to U.S. health and healthcare that were proposed through the Bass Connections Open channel, which is designed to support projects not covered by an existing theme. In 2020-2021, Duke-Margolis also partnered with Bass Connections to support the COVID-19 “pop-up” theme, which seeded 13 research projects to investigate the issues and impacts of the pandemic. \nGillian Sanders Schmidler, deputy director of the Duke-Margolis Center for Health Policy, expressed her enthusiasm about the new theme: “Given the growing interest in U.S. health policy research and the history of successful collaboration between Duke-Margolis and Bass Connections, I believe that the Health Policy &amp; Innovation theme is poised to tackle some of the toughest issues facing the U.S. today, and enrich the education and career development of hundreds of students in the process.”\nHow to Get Involved\nBass Connections is now soliciting proposals for 2023-2024 projects. Faculty can propose projects that investigate the current U.S. healthcare system, support the development of evidence-based health policy, foster advancement of new medical technologies, investigate the roots of health disparities and more. Graduate students and staff are also welcome to propose projects in collaboration with at least one faculty member.\n“We are inviting the whole Duke community to rise to the material, political, technological and social challenges that impact public health,” Gifford said.\nThe first cohort of projects selected under the new theme will be announced and opened for student applications in January 2023.\nLearn More\nRead about the Health Policy &amp; Innovation theme.\nSubmit a proposal for a 2023-2024 Bass Connections project by November 7.\nExplore all our interdisciplinary themes and learn more about how faculty and students can get involved.\nDate:&nbsp;Monday, July 25, 2022 - 10:00amIcon:&nbsp;Theme:&nbsp;Health Policy and Innovation",

        "description": "In Spring 2021, Sama Elmahdy ’22 (Global Health and Psychology) and Hadeel Hamoud ’22 (International Comparative Studies and Political Science) received a Bass Connections Student Research Award to examine access to water, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) in Egypt and Sudan amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. Building on the work of the Mapping WASH and COVID-19 in the Middle East and North Africa team, Elmahdy and Hamoud conducted interviews with leading experts in the field, including WASH specialists from the World Bank and the United Nations, and identified major impacts of COVID-19 on provision and capacity of humanitarian services across various populations in the region. The pair went on to present their findings at the 2nd International Conference on Environmental Peacebuilding. Erika Weinthal served as their faculty advisor.\nSama Elmahdy and Hadeel Hamoud after an interview with an expert on water service provision in the MENA.\nBy Sama Elmahdy and Hadeel Hamoud\nWater, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) are intimately connected to human health and security. The COVID-19 pandemic, in particular, has illuminated these linkages in mainstream public discourse. In this project, we analyzed access to WASH in Egypt and Sudan, two of Africa’s largest and most populous countries. \nIn Egypt, about 8.4 million people, mostly in rural areas, lack access to improved sanitation. As of 2015, only 6% of Egyptian villages were being provided with wastewater treatment services. Nevertheless, as of 2014, 92.4% of households had direct access to safe drinking water. \nIn Sudan, rates of access to drinking water vary from 95% of people in Khartoum to 30% in North Darfur, and 11% of child deaths are attributed to poor WASH access. \nProtracted conflicts in the MENA region have led to the collapse and decreased capacity of WASH systems and services, so humanitarian actors have played an increasingly crucial role in filling gaps in supply and service provision. \nDuring the summer of 2021, we investigated the challenges and opportunities for capacity building among international and local humanitarian organizations as they worked to expand access to WASH in the face of COVID-19 in Egypt and Sudan. Our research sought to 1) examine how COVID-19 has affected existing efforts by humanitarian actors to expand the capacities of the WASH sector; 2) illuminate how the pandemic has fostered new interventions; and 3) identify possibilities for building resilience, especially among humanitarian actors serving refugee populations. \nWe took a qualitative approach, interviewing several authors, researchers and actors in the WASH sector to understand the existing interventions in Egypt and Sudan, the impact of COVID-19 on these interventions, organizations’ responses to the crisis and the possibility of new interventions consequent to the pandemic. \nIn order to gain some background information, we interviewed one of the authors of a paper that studied WASH interventions in several Middle Eastern countries. We gained valuable insight into the framing of our own project through this interview and learned important tips to keep in mind while interviewing our participants. We then interviewed the WASH sector coordinator, United Nations Children’s Fund representative, and head of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees WASH program in Sudan as well as the World Bank water division lead in Egypt. \nOur research identified several themes around responses to COVID-19 within the WASH humanitarian sector, including adaptation to increased funding and upscaling WASH response; an integration of existing protocols for other WASH-related illnesses like cholera; innovations to continue providing WASH access while limiting COVID-19’s spread; and adaptations to cultural factors shaping concepts of sanitation and hygiene. We also identified several challenges to the resilience of WASH humanitarian actors, including poor emergency stockpiles, decreased internal capacities due to fear and a lack of knowledge about COVID and misinformation or poor information networks. \nElmahdy, Hamoud and their faculty mentor, Erika Weinthal, presented their research as part of a virtual panel at the 2nd International Conference on Environmental Peacebuilding in February 2022.\nThe Bass Connections Student Research Award supported data collection, transcription and qualitative coding analysis and the materials needed to present at the 2nd International Conference on Environmental Peacebuilding. We are incredibly grateful for the opportunities afforded to us by Bass Connections. In addition to financial support, this program connected us to our research mentor, Erika Weinthal, who was integral to our project. \nOur project enabled us to meet leading figures working at the forefront of WASH efforts in Egypt and Sudan and to gain a more intimate and comprehensive understanding of the work of international NGOs. Overall, this project has inspired us to pursue further research and work within the WASH sector.\nLearn More\nFind out more about the 2020-2021 Mapping WASH and COVID-19 in the Middle East and North Africa project team.\nExplore the work of other teams that addressed challenges related to COVID-19.\nMeet all the recipients of the 2021 Bass Connections Student Research Award, and see who won the award this year.\n\t \nDate:&nbsp;Thursday, June 30, 2022 - 2:45pmIcon:&nbsp;Theme:&nbsp;COVID-19Global Health",

        "description": "In 2013, the first Bass Connections research teams embarked on ambitious projects to tackle real-world challenges ranging from gender inequality in STEM education to children’s mental health to climate policy in the U.S. to rural poverty. Since then, the program has supported nearly 500 interdisciplinary teams and brought together more than 4,000 faculty, students and staff to conduct cutting-edge research spanning dozens of disciplinary fields and world regions.\nIn Spring 2022, the program’s innovative model and wide-ranging impacts were featured on Methodspace, an online research community focused on sharing groundbreaking research methods and programs. Highlighting the ways in which Bass Connections has enabled research that “crosses boundaries,” this series of essays, interviews and testimonials from faculty, staff and students associated with the program demonstrates the exciting array of outcomes produced by the program across its first nine years, including shaping student trajectories, opening new avenues for faculty research and enabling deeper partnerships in the community.\nExplore this series and check out some highlights below!\nShaping Student Trajectories\n“We have found that collaborative, project-based research teams allow undergraduates to explore and deepen their academic interests, form influential new mentoring relationships and develop a range of career-relevant skills. For graduate students, the program provides an opportunity to develop critical experience with complex organization, teamwork and leadership. –Program leaders Edward Balleisen (Vice Provost for Interdisciplinary Studies) and Laura Howes (Director, Bass Connections)\n\n\n\nIn this video, Catherine Grodensky ’25 (Ph.D. in Public Policy), Matthew Ralph ’22 (Statistical Science and Political Science) and Sahil Sandhu ’20 (Program II), speak to Janet Salmons (Methodspace) about their Bass Connections experience.\nFor many students, Bass Connections has been an excellent avenue through which to explore new research fields, consider future career interests and conduct research with real-world impacts. \nFor example, in 2018, Kathleen Burns ’22 (Ph.D. in English) joined the Decisions on Complex Interdisciplinary Problems of Health and Environmental Risk (DECIPHER) team, which brought together faculty and students from law, science, public policy and the humanities to study the history of ozone-depleting chemicals in terms of risk and decision-making. Burns ended up spending multiple years on the team working her way from student researcher to coleader.\n“While I wielded little knowledge of atmospheric chemistry as an English grad student, the interdisciplinary spirit of the project piqued my interest ... If anything, my year learning about ozone depletion has helped shape the topic of my dissertation project more than any other single source at Duke. It revolutionized the way I think about risk, weather, climate – even air conditioning!” –Kathleen Burns, graduate member of the DECIPHER team\n\nFor Sarah Diringer ’16 (Ph.D. in Civil &amp; Environmental Engineering), being on a Bass Connections team helped her recognize the importance of diverse and collaborative teams and strong community partnerships in accomplishing big research goals. Her work on a team studying heavy metal exposure and emerging infectious diseases in the Peruvian Amazon informed her dissertation project as well as her future career path. She now serves as the Water Program Officer at the Pisces Foundation.\n“While I started my career focused narrowly on water systems, working with Bass Connections and the Duke Global Health Institute teams helped me see water as part of an intricate web of people and the environment. One of the most worthwhile parts of my graduate school experience was conducting research in partnership with communities living in Madre de Dios, Peru. From my first trip to the field, it was clear how much we had to learn about the river from communities living on its banks.” –Sarah Diringer, graduate member of the Environmental Epidemiology Research Training in the Peruvian Amazon team\n\n\n\nIn this video, Bill Pan and members of the multiyear Environmental Epidemiology in Latin America team describe their research on chemical exposure and public health in the Peruvian Amazon.\nFor other students, Bass Connections has provided opportunities to examine the creation, implementation and analysis of policy decisions at the local and national levels. \nFor example, recent graduates Sophie Hurewitz ’22 (Neuroscience) and Ainsley Buck ’22 (Neuroscience), spent three years as members of the North Carolina Early Childhood Action Plan team, where they explored and assessed policy designed to improve the developmental and behavioral health of children. Based on their findings, team members drafted community and policy recommendations to the Integrated Care for Kids model, including strengthening both screening processes and referral mechanisms associated with food insecurity and continuing to focus on outreach to historically marginalized populations.\n“My involvement with Bass Connections has inspired me to pursue my interests in child and family policy, health policy and educational policy alongside a medical degree” –Sophie Hurewitz, undergraduate member of the North Carolina Early Childhood Action Plan team\n\nSophie Hurewitz (left) and Ainsley Buck (third from left) at the Academic Pediatric Association Region IV Annual Meeting in February 2020, where their team received the student abstract award for “Measuring and Addressing Social-Emotional Well-Being in Early Childhood.”\nBass Connections projects also expose students to the uncertainties of open-ended research questions and help them cultivate creativity and resilience in the face of individual and group obstacles.\n“Things often don’t go as planned in a research team. In [Bass Connections], students are dealing with IRB [Institutional Review Board] for the first time, or working with new team dynamics. All these things are highly applicable to the real world, both for graduate school and after you graduate.” –Sahil Sandhu, undergraduate cofounder and member of the Help Desk team\n\nIn addition to helping students develop sought-after research skills and competencies, project teams also lead to applied research outputs, including academic publications, grant proposals, policy reports and briefs, archives, oral history collections, databases, software programs and apps, new models of social service provision and even art exhibits.\nFor example, students on the Arts and the Anthropocene team, which explored research questions at the intersection of ocean science and the arts, developed two StoryMaps to explain and illuminate the science of sea level rise and local impacts of sea level rise in North Carolina and created Spectral Seas, an art installation depicting the scale of future sea level rise. Woven out of over 400 plastic bags collected from the Durham community, the tapestry features layers of color representing different sea level rise predictions for 2100 and was installed at Duke’s Nasher Museum of Art. In the future, this installation will travel to museums and community arts sites across North Carolina.\n\n\nThis is an immersive video recording of the Arts and the Anthropocene team’s Spectral Seas installation.\nOpening New Avenues of Research for Faculty \nFor early-career faculty, project teams offer an excellent way to test new research ideas, develop new models of care and build sufficient pilot data for external grant proposals.\nFor example, several engineering professors have organized teams to focus on the challenges of moving technical innovations into use, with some students working on regulatory issues and others on the development of business models. Environmental scientists have built teams that investigate how to use a new technology, like drones, to reshape techniques for monitoring environmental conditions in ecologically fragile or tough-to-reach areas. In the arts and humanities, teams have enabled professors to pursue large-scale digital projects, build oral history collections or mount ambitious public exhibits.\n\n\nIn this video, Janet Bettger (Associate Professor of Orthopaedics), Manoj Mohanan (Associate Professor of Public Policy) and Charlotte Sussman (Professor of English) speak to Janet Salmons (Methodspace) about their Bass Connections experience.\nPrior to leading a Bass Connections team examining the global financial crisis, Joseph A. Smith (senior fellow at Duke Law) was North Carolina’s Commissioner of Banks. He brought his professional and academic expertise as well as an insider’s perspective to his team’s research goals.\n“[This] project allowed me to reflect on the predatory lending debate with the benefit of historical perspective. More importantly, it has allowed me to view the period under study through the eyes of a group of extraordinary young people. I have been especially impressed by key dimensions of the research that the students have undertaken. Our oral history subteams have conducted over 80 interviews with participants in the predatory lending debates from all sides of the issue: advocates, government officials and mortgage industry folks. The interviews have been conducted under university protocols and are always preceded by careful background research and preparation.” –Joseph A. Smith, coleader of the American Predatory Lending and the Global Financial Crisis team\n\nJoseph A. Smith (left) with members of the American Predatory Lending team in 2019\nFor Emily Bernhardt (James B. Duke Distinguished Professor of Biology), Bass Connections served as a gateway to an entirely new research effort for herself and her lab. As the coleader of a multiyear project team studying the impacts of small-scale gold mining on communities and the environment in the Peruvian Amazon, Bernhardt and her team applied tools in biogeochemistry and ecosystem science to an under-researched problem of the Anthropocene. Ultimately, their research has had a tangible impact on the science and policy arena surrounding an important issues at the interface of health and the environment. \n“We are already generating vitally important information to guide management and policy—we are providing the first ever measures of soil and water methyl mercury in Peru—and we are poised to provide far more. [As a result of Bass Connections], we expect to generate several high-profile papers and to have sufficient information to go after a much larger grant to continue and expand upon this research on [mercury] pollution associated with artisanal gold mining in one of the world’s biodiversity hotspots – ​​Peru’s Madre de Dios river” –Emily Bernhardt, coleader of the Impacts of Artisanal Gold Mining in the Peruvian Amazon on Aquatic Ecosystem Biodiversity team\n\nLavanya Vasudevan (Assistant Professor of Community and Family Medicine) also noted that her Bass Connections project opened up new research opportunities in her field. In 2015-16, Vasudevan led a project team that analyzed the uptake of routine childhood vaccination services in Kumasi, Ghana and Roatán, Honduras. Team members traveled to both sites to assess the attitudes and practices affecting vaccine uptake as well as mobile phone ownership and use.\n“For me, the best part about the experience has been the new connections – with students, faculty and community partners, with whom I would otherwise not have had the opportunity to interact. The influx of new ideas and perspectives has been enriching, and it is very exciting to consider the new avenues of research that have opened up as a result” —Lavanya Vasudevan, coleader of the mHealth for Better Routine Immunization Data in Honduras team\n\nMembers of the mHealth for Better Routine Immunization Data in Honduras team with colleagues at a clinic in Roatán, Honduras (Photo: Christina Makarushka)\nErik Wibbels (Robert O. Keohane Professor of Political Science), a leader of a multi-year project team that studied slums in urban India, cited Bass Connections as “the single most significant programmatic innovation during his 13 years at Duke and 21 years as an academic.”\n“I consider Bass Connections to be an exemplar of where both research and teaching are headed – towards collaborative, interdisciplinary applied learning. Leveraging the huge research opportunities this movement portends does require faculty to rethink how they work and teach, but when we do so, there is a lot of fun and productivity to be had” –Erik Wibbels, coleader of the Studying the Real Slums in Bangalore, Patna and Jaipur and Migration and Deportation among Guatemalans in the U.S. and Guatemala teams\n\n\n\nIn this video, undergraduate team members Sarah Zimmermann and Nancy Zhu share their experience on the Real Slums in Bangalore, Patna and Jaipur project team.\nStrengthening the Foundations of Team Research\nThrough annual program evaluations, Bass Connections has accrued a rich set of data that has been used to help set teams up for future success. The program has also drawn on the strength and guidance of its faculty team leaders to share important practices that help make team research both productive and fun.\nErik Wibbels\nFor example, after serving for many as a team leader and chair of the Bass Connections Faculty Advisory Council, Erik Wibbels shared several important practices that have been crucial to team success, including selecting team members with diverse skillsets, setting clear expectations for student effort from the project’s outset and leveraging the social nature of teamwork through regular, engaging team meetings.\n“Selecting a team requires careful attention to the diverse skills that make such teams work,” he noted. While a team leader’s tendency may be to simply select team members who have the strongest academic records, those with the highest GPAs or best technical training might not be the right group for a team’s unique goals.\nHe also noted that each project should include at least one participant who is skilled in overseeing logistics, including what may be seen as unglamorous or quotidian tasks, like taking meeting notes, organizing team travel and ensuring that the faculty are providing clear week-to-week assignments for each student.\nWibbels’s Bass Connections team meeting project partners in Guatemala\nWibbels also emphasized the importance of managing student effort with clear, regular communication. “Unsurprisingly, projects work better when they begin with clear end goals and when the students appreciate the importance of achieving those goals. Students need to have a clear assignment each week that emerges from team-wide effort and faculty-led focus on the baby steps that will get the overall team to a productive end product.”\n\nStudent team member Tara Bansal talks with community leaders in India.\nFinally, Wibbels explained that it is important to recognize that teamwork is an inherently social venture that should include regular group interaction. “Regular meetings provide an opportunity to assess individual efforts, integrate everyone’s work into a broader vision, and ensure that each participant has a clear deliverable to work on for the following week.”\nBass Connections students and faculty leader Emily Klein test a solar device.\nEchoing Wibbel’s advice, Edward Balleisen and Laura Howes also shared five pillars that make up the foundation of every successful interdisciplinary research project. \nCultivate a strong team structure and culture: Teams are complex. Building an effective team requires intentionality. Teams struggle when they neglect to build social bonds, or fail to set clear goals, roles and timelines. We encourage our teams to dedicate time to team building activities, set team ground rules, and use a team charter to get all members of the team on the same page about project goals, individual responsibilities, key resources and timelines.\nExpect initiative but provide scaffolding: Expecting students to take ownership and initiative will empower them to contribute, but given their lack of experience with ambiguous, open-ended inquiry, they will initially need some scaffolding in the form of smaller starter projects and ample mentoring.\nCreate mentorship and leadership opportunities for advanced students: On our teams graduate students (and sometimes postdocs or advanced undergraduate students) often serve as sub-team leads, technical mentors or project managers (helping address team culture and structure as noted above!). Elevating advanced students gives them appropriate challenges, while also providing undergraduate students with an accessible resource, and reducing the load of faculty leaders.\nEngage with clients and partners: While all of our project teams are applied (in that they relate to a real-world issue), just about two-thirds of teams have an external client or partner. These external relationships foster translation of research findings, while also helping students develop new networks and the ability to apply their studies to a concrete setting.\nCreate opportunities for reflection: We encourage all of our teams to deploy regular reflection as a tool for helping students think critically about  their team experience. We also suggest that teams use reflection as one mechanism for grading team-based research.\nScaling the Model in Higher Education\nIn light of the positive impacts documented for the students and faculty participating in the Bass Connections program, there is a strong case for colleges and universities to explore how they might borrow this approach to blending interdisciplinary research, education, and civic engagement. With that forecast in view, Edward Balleisen noted opportunities to link support for interdisciplinary student teams to external funding proposals, as well as university-based curricular structures.\nHe also noted that faculty and students do not need to venture far to find compelling research questions. “Every brick and mortar institution of higher education can draw on the issues confronting their own towns, cities and regions, and so foster community-engaged inquiry without incurring extensive travel costs.”\nBass Connections students at the Duke Campus Farm\nFor example, the long-running Mental Health and the Justice System in Durham County team has partnered with the Sheriff’s office, detention center and local criminal justice and community health organizations to improve the interaction between the criminal justice system and people with mental illness and substance use disorders. By combining health and detention center data, the team has mapped the strong connection between mental health disorders, arrests and recidivism. Their work has resulted in publications, policy proposals and extensive changes in practice within the Durham county justice system. \n\n\nIn this video, Nicole Schramm-Sapyta (Associate Professor of the Practice in the Duke Institute for Brain Sciences), coleader of the Mental Health and the Justice System in Durham County team, shares the team’s research findings and long-running partnerships with the health and criminal justice communities in Durham County.\nAdditionally, the rapid expansion of IT infrastructure to facilitate remote interaction can also be a means of linking student research teams across space. For example, drawing on these strategies, Bass Connections has had teams work with faculty and students at universities as far away as Brazil, Uganda and China.  \nBalleisen noted that “with careful planning and a willingness to reimagine curricular structures ... colleges and universities can bring research-inflected, team-based education to large numbers of their students ... Such a move would depend on a wider recognition that such experiences complement more traditional frameworks of instruction, and that they effectively prepare students to work in diverse teams, conceptualize truly wicked problems, and engage them through creative, interdisciplinary inquiry.”\nBrowse the Full Methodspace Series by Topic\nThe Bass Connections Model\nInterdisciplinary, Collaborative Research: Solving Today’s Challenges While Equipping Future Leaders\nInterdisciplinary Faculty-Student Research\nApplying and Scaling the Model in Higher Education\nResearch Methods and Creative Outputs From Interdisciplinary Teams\nInnovating the Summer Internship: Interdisciplinary Team-Based Humanities Research\nScaling Interdisciplinary, Collaborative Research Within Higher Education\nLearning to Put Research Into Practice\nStudent Impact and Stories\nStudent Perspectives: The Impact of Interdisciplinary, Collaborative Research Opportunities on Student Development\nStudents Share Interdisciplinary Research Experiences\nYears After Graduating, I Still Rely on Skills Gained from Interdisciplinary Research\nFaculty Impact and Insights on Leading Interdisciplinary Research Teams\nFaculty Perspectives: The Impact of Interdisciplinary, Collaborative Research Opportunities on Scholarly Trajectories\nInterdisciplinary Researchers Discuss Faculty-Student Research\nA Practitioner’s View on the Value of Team-Based, Student-Powered Interdisciplinary Research\nLearning by Doing: Building Cross-Disciplinary, Intergenerational Research Teams\nLearn More\nRead stories from students on their Bass Connections experience.\nBrowse faculty perspectives on leading Bass Connections project teams.\nExplore insights from our annual program evaluation.\nDate:&nbsp;Monday, July 18, 2022 - 5:00amIcon:&nbsp;Theme:&nbsp;Brain and SocietyEducation and Human DevelopmentEnergy and EnvironmentGlobal HealthInformation Society and CultureRace and SocietyBass Connections Open",

        "description": "After receiving a Bass Connections Student Research Award in Spring 2021, recent graduates Maddie Paris ’22 (Biology and Environmental Sciences) and Claire Huang ’22 (Master of Environmental Management) put their passion for the environment and science education to a new use, creating a systematic literature review on education and outreach for ocean conservation. Building on the work of the Bass Connections Ocean Evidence Gap Map project team, their work will ultimately serve as a resource to strengthen local partnerships and improve conservation efforts in coastal communities. David Gill served as their faculty mentor.\nClaire Huang (middle) and Maddie Paris (right) with Becca Horan after presenting their project at the People &amp; Nature Symposium\nBy Maddie Paris and Claire Huang \nWhat makes biodiversity and ecosystem conservation efforts successful? \nThis is a pressing question for the field of conservation on a global scale, and ocean conservation is no exception. For example, just last year, the United Nations declared 2021 to 2030 as the Decade of Ocean Science for Sustainable Development. This was also the main question we explored this year through our Bass Connections Student Research Award project. We were especially interested in collecting evidence of how education and outreach can contribute to marine conservation goals. \nOur project was a natural extension of the Bass Connections Ocean Evidence Gap Map project, in which we examined a broad range of conservation interventions, from marine protected areas to fishery management. Building off our project team’s work, we chose to hone in on education and outreach as one of the areas in which there was a noticeable “gap” in the research literature. As students trained in marine ecology, we were both passionate about exploring the ways in which human beings learn about and relate to their environment. \nWith the guidance of Becca Horan (Ph.D. candidate in Marine Science and Conservation), our faculty advisor David Gill (Marine Science and Conservation) and our former Bass Connections team lead Morgan Rudd (MEM ’18), we designed a systematic literature review process from scratch, including developing an extensive “search string” to target the types of papers that would meet our review criteria. This was a completely new experience for both of us and we were able to adapt many of the skills we learned as members of our research team, such as how to screen papers efficiently but accurately and how to organize and manage our time for this meticulous research process. \nThe screening process was daunting, with thousands of potentially relevant papers to process in order to find those that actually evaluated education, outreach or training programs related to marine conservation. But the abstract screening process also raised incredibly interesting questions that led to thought-provoking discussions. Questions like: Does a coral reef virtual reality experience for tourists count as an “educational or conservation intervention” if it might increase their likelihood of donating to a conservation organization? Will a change in knowledge and behavior within a coastal community actually result in better stewardship and desired ecological outcomes? \nWe also engaged in thoughtful conversations about the process of conducting science and the equity dimensions of marine conservation. For instance, our initial analysis showed that most education or training programs were implemented by NGOs or academic organizations external to the actual community or audience they were targeting. As students whose research has largely focused on the environmental realm (i.e., ecological interactions in salt marshes for Maddie and fish population restoration for Claire), it was useful to step back and evaluate the broader social context for our work.  \nOne of the highlights of our Bass Connections experience was presenting our initial findings at the People &amp; Nature Symposium, hosted by the Duke University Program in Ecology. The themes of the conference were focused on place-based research that incorporates people and communities in science, as well as environmental justice. Maddie hopes to eventually pursue a Ph.D., while Claire will continue working at the intersection of conservation science and policy, so communicating the importance of our evidence synthesis work was crucial to our career goals. \nUltimately, learning about how different education and skill-building interventions can change behaviors towards the environment influenced our own perceptions about conservation as well. Our hope is that NGOs, policymakers and conservation practitioners who are actively designing programs to improve conservation outcomes may use our research to inform how they engage communities that rely on coastal resources. \nLearn More\nRead about the 2020-2021 Ocean Evidence Gap Map project team.\nExplore the projects of the other 2021 Student Research Award grantees, including one in which two students examined policy implementation around childhood health and wellbeing in North Carolina.\nTake a look at the winners of the 2022 Bass Connections Student Research Award.\nDate:&nbsp;Monday, June 27, 2022 - 12:30pmIcon:&nbsp;Theme:&nbsp;Energy and Environment",

        "description": "The 9th Street Journal, Duke’s student-written local news site for the Durham community, is seeking a professional editor who can inspire and teach our students about local journalism.\nThe job involves three skills – editing, teaching and mentoring. You’ll work with some of the best students in the nation. Some are new to journalism and still learning what a nut graph is. Others have a couple of years of experience and are ready to examine public records and dig deep. All of them share a strong interest in reporting and writing, and a curiosity about how things work.\nYou’ll help them conceive and shape stories about Durham, its government and the diverse people who live here. The stories will be a mix of news and features, some traditional, some not. In the past three years, we’ve published scoops on a death at the county jail and a botched murder investigation; we’ve run enterprise stories about the shoddy conditions in a public housing project and the debate over police use-of-force. We’ve also written a wide range of features on the people and places that make Durham quirky – an overpass that keeps shaving the roof off of trucks and a bulletin board that told the tale of the COVID lockdown. One of our goals is to encourage our students to venture off-campus and engage in the fast-growing and fast-changing community.\nWorking with the students is the best part of this job. You’ll advise them in their reporting, help them get organized and do a line edit.You also will oversee a student photographer and harness other students’ interest to expand the site’s use of social media, multimedia and data visualizations.\nDepending on your interest and our needs, you could also teach courses for the DeWitt Wallace Center on topics such as Newswriting and Reporting, one of the core classes in Duke’s journalism program. The editor will also work closely with the professor teaching our Advanced Reporting Class, whose students will also contribute stories to the site.\nYou’ll work in the Duke Reporters’ Lab, aka The 9th Street newsroom, in the Sanford building on Duke’s campus. It’s an in-person job that follows the academic calendar. It starts in late August and concludes in early May. (There might be other work that could be added in the summer if you’re interested.)\nThere is some flexibility on hours. It could be 30-40 hours per week depending opportunities for teaching in the classroom.\nIf you’re interested, please contact Bill Adair, Co-Editor of 9th Street and the Knight Professor of the Practice of Journalism and Public Policy – bill.adair@duke.edu\nIf you&#8217;re ready to apply, below are the Duke application links.\nInternal Duke candidates:\n9TH STREET MANAGING EDITOR &#8211; DEWITT WALLACE CTR FOR MEDIA AND DEMOCRACY, SANFORD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY  (143729)\nhttps://performancemanager4.successfactors.com/sf/jobreq?jobId=143729&amp;company=dukeuniverP1\nExternal candidates:\n9TH STREET MANAGING EDITOR &#8211; DEWITT WALLACE CTR FOR MEDIA AND DEMOCRACY, SANFORD SCHOOL OF PUBLIC POLICY  (143729)\nhttps://career4.successfactors.com/sfcareer/jobreqcareer?jobId=143729&amp;company=dukeuniverP1\nThe post We’re looking for a new editor for The 9th Street Journal appeared first on DeWitt Wallace Center.",

        "description": "By Milena Ozernova ’22\nIf the person who sat next to you on your flight yesterday tested positive for COVID-19 today, should you be notified? Would you have to be isolated, and who would provide for your family if you had to miss work?\nMore than two years into the pandemic, the question of whether and how to track those infected with coronavirus remains a challenging one. Contact tracing – notifying people who may have been exposed – can break the chains of viral transmission through the rapid identification and isolation of cases, but what are the implications for our privacy?\nNima Agah\nNima Agah, a Duke Law student interested in technology and ethics, joined a Bass Connections team to study attitudes toward sharing health information and examine North Carolina’s use of contact tracing.\nIn addition to comparing different contract tracing systems in Mexico, the U.K., France, Israel and South Korea, Agah and his fellow team members studied Americans’ attitudes toward sharing health information, in general, focusing on the Black and Latinx communities who have been disproportionately impacted by COVID-19 and have historical reasons to mistrust public institutions. On a local level, the project examined all 100 counties in North Carolina to assess and compare contact tracing policies.\n“The project involved a lot of questions of government trust, people’s trust in medicine, existing regulatory systems, people’s privacy protections or lack of protections, and how they interacted with each other in the middle of a pandemic,” Agah explained.\nThe interdisciplinary mix of law, ethics, technology, public policy and sociology made the project especially appealing, he said. From his personal background, he knew that one’s decision to trust the government largely depended on their community, race, sexuality, income and politics, so it felt important to study all the aspects of the contact tracing practice.\nAgah’s subteam spent the first half of the project designing survey questions related to contact tracing, technology and demographics. Students ironed out their survey design, received Institutional Review Board approval and sent the survey out to different groups of people.\n“We also asked questions related to other factors of people’s demographics, such as politics, sexuality, education level — things that we thought might correlate with different attitudes related to trust,” Agah explained. “Which companies do you trust, which members of the government do you trust with regards to COVID messaging and contact tracing, and even what methods of COVID information and disease control do you prefer? Is it using a contact tracing app, using exposure notifications, or just dealing with people one-on-one and contact tracing?”\nAfter receiving over 1,200 responses to their survey, Agah and his teammates looked for differences between cities versus rural areas when it came to sharing information about COVID-19 and contact tracing. Their research revealed that the primary way for counties to communicate with their citizens was through online dashboards with information about testing, resources and statistics such as deaths, hospitalizations and positive tests. However, students uncovered shortcomings that limited the population’s access to information about contact tracing and privacy.\n“Most counties did not have a specific section [on their dashboard] about privacy,” Agah said. “We actually found an absence of information telling communities publicly whether their information would be private if they worked with a contact tracer. Or, if someone from the county approached them for information, whether their data might go into one of these dashboards. At the same time, we didn’t see anything negative about privacy — we just saw an absence of it. We saw it as something that counties could do better.\"\n\n\nThroughout the pandemic, rapid change was the norm. “It was a quickly evolving situation with different government regulations, different news about the disease and different ways in which scientists, doctors and members of the medical community would think about it,” Agah recalled.\nAs a result, Agah found that the constantly evolving nature of the research problems led to a project that could easily span over his entire graduate career as opposed to just two semesters. Agah noted that there were moments when team members would reach new conclusions and say, “Wow, that’s really interesting, but someone else is going to have to do that!” \nAs a graduate student studying law, Agah found it refreshing to work with students from different backgrounds and compare their work and perspectives. At the same time, Agah was happy to use his specialized knowledge to help other students with legal research or other research aspects that were closely related to his areas of interest. \n“It was nice being able to talk to policy students who are close to law but have a different perspective on it, or students from public health, computer science or politics. Everyone was able to add their own perspective, and it enriched the way I think about things, whether it’s health-related regulation or privacy regulation,” Agah shared. With the input from other students, professors and industry experts, Agah now knows much more about the technology sector and believes that exposure to different disciplines can certainly help students studying law. \nIn the future, Agah plans to work at the intersection of technology, life science and law, where privacy is an ever evolving and dynamic matter. “[This project] was some of my first exposure to privacy law here at Duke, and it’s become a part of the courses that I’ve been taking,” he said. “It showed me another path in terms of practice and subject matter in the law.”. \nTechnology is being heavily scrutinized in the media. People are wondering what’s happening to their data. Is this becoming a currency? Are we being exploited in the ways this is used? Is this beneficial for society? It’s a matter that is deeply implicated in the privacy law and very important in the regulatory space now. We’re looking at potential crackdowns on big tech companies, such as Facebook, Instagram, Google and Amazon. Privacy is a part of this equation and so is the way that these platforms affect people, depending on who they are and the way their data is being interpreted — and the way [tech companies] target people with different information about COVID. There are a lot of good reasons to care about privacy, about government trust and the law, and this project did a great job of picking an area to dive deep into the matter. –Nima Agah\n\nDuke University senior Milena Ozernova is a Bass Connections communications assistant majoring in Political Science.

Gregory Jones was emailed to Divinity School faculty, staff and students Sunday morning.\n\nDear Colleagues:\n\nWe in the Duke Divinity School community join with our Jewish brothers and sisters in mourning the loss of those murdered in the Tree of Life Synagogue in Pittsburgh. We are grieved, and we are also outraged by this horrifying act of violence—especially in a place presumed to be both sacred and a place of safety. We also protest the continuing evil of anti-Semitism, and we call on all people to renounce and repent of hatred in any form.\n\nWe long for the day when there will be no more violence, no more killing. We pray that the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Joseph, the God of Miriam and Deborah, will embrace all those families who lost loved ones in this massacre, and we pray for all those this day who are bewildered by yet one more senseless and pre-meditated act of violence that afflicts our land.\n\nThis day, we also pray that God will empower all of us to undertake the work of tikkun olam, “repairers of the world.” May it be so.\n\nGrace and Peace,\n\nDr. L.

        "description": "Stephen Buckley, a veteran editor and educator who worked at The Washington Post, Tampa Bay Times and the Poynter Institute, has been chosen as one of two new Eugene C. Patterson Professors of the Practice of Journalism and Public Policy at Duke University’s Sanford School of Public Policy.\nBuckley will join the other new Patterson professor, New York Times columnist Frank Bruni, whose appointment was announced Monday. They will begin July 1 in the DeWitt Wallace Center for Media and Democracy, Duke’s hub for journalism education in the Sanford School.\nStephen Buckley\nBuckley, a 1989 Duke graduate in political science, has had a wide-ranging career as a local reporter, foreign correspondent, editor and journalism educator. He is the lead story editor for Global Press Journal, an international news organization that focuses its reporting on undercovered regions.\nBuckley has a unique connection with Patterson, a legendary editor and important voice in the American civil rights movement. As editor of the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times), Patterson allowed Buckley to work as a sportswriter while still in high school. When Buckley returned to the Times as a reporter and then rose to become a senior editor, Patterson, then the editor emeritus of the paper, continued to be an important mentor.\n“It’s really humbling to be able to play a small part in extending Gene Patterson’s legacy,” said Buckley. “It’ll be a thrill to pass along the journalistic values he exemplified – integrity, independence, intellectual honesty, humility, compassion, and courage – to this generation of students as they prepare to help defend our fragile democracy. And to do it at my alma mater, no less, feels like a wonderful gift.”\n“I am thrilled Stephen is returning to Duke and joining our faculty at the Sanford School of Public Policy,” said Dean Judith Kelley. “His connection to Eugene Patterson since his early journalism career brings the endowment full circle, passing on a torch of leadership. Stephen will bring our students a valuable international perspective, one of the hallmarks of the Sanford and Duke experience that he will foster even more. With his global journalism experience and leadership, he will help train future journalists at Duke to go into the world and make a difference.”\n“I had the great fortune of working with Stephen when he was an editor at the Tampa Bay Times,” said Bill Adair, director of the DeWitt Wallace Center. “He was one of the smartest editors I’ve known.”\nAfter graduating from Duke, Buckley began his career as a local reporter for The Post in Washington, D.C. and suburban Maryland. He covered education, courts and the night police beat and then became a foreign correspondent, initially as the Post’s Africa Bureau Chief and then the paper’s first correspondent based in Brazil.\nHe returned to St. Petersburg in 2001 as a national reporter for the Times and then became an editor in charge of national and international coverage before being promoted to managing editor and then publisher of tampabay.com, the paper’s digital site. He moved to the Poynter Institute in 2010 as dean of the faculty. In 2015, he moved to Kenya, where he taught at The Aga Khan University before joining Global Press Journal.\nThe professorship is named for Eugene Patterson, a journalist and civil rights activist. The Patterson Chair, endowed by a gift from the Poynter Fund (now the Tampa Bay Times Fund), honors the former editor-in-chief and chief executive officer of The St. Petersburg Times, whose earlier work as editor of the Atlanta Constitution (now The Atlanta-Journal Constitution) set a benchmark for coverage of the civil rights movement.\nPatterson also served three years as managing editor at The Washington Post. He taught at Duke in the public policy program from 1971 to 1972, served on the university’s board of trustees from 1988 to 1994 and holds an honorary doctorate from Duke, awarded in 1978.\nThis year, Duke announces two Patterson professors, which has precedent. When the Patterson professorship was established at Duke in 1998, it was jointly held by Susan Tifft and Alex S. Jones until Jones departed in 2000 to become the director of the Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University.\n&nbsp;\nThe post Veteran editor and educator Stephen Buckley to join journalism faculty of Duke’s Sanford School of Public Policy appeared first on DeWitt Wallace Center.",

The event was titled “Dear White Christians: So Now What?”\n\nThe Divinity School's Office of Black Church Studies partnered with Duke Chapel and the Center for Reconciliation to launch the Race &amp; Faith Dialogues series in order to encourage consistent community conversations on the intersection of race and the church. The series features junior and mid-career theologians and religious scholars whose work and ministry significantly engage race and other critical social intersections in relationship to the moral and structural transformation of the church, academy, and society.\n\nHarvey's work focuses on encounters of religion and ethics with race, gender, activism, politics, spirituality, justice, and other aspects of social life. Her most recent book is Dear White Christians: For Those Still Longing for Racial Reconciliation. She is also the author of Whiteness and Morality: Pursuing Racial Justice Through Reparations and Sovereignty, and co-editor of Disrupting White Supremacy from Within: White People on What We Need to Do.\n\nThe next Race &amp; Faith Dialogues event will be held Feb. 22, 2016 at 12:30 p.m. in Room 0014 of the Westbrook Building at the school. Derek Hicks, assistant professor of religion and culture at Wake Forest University's School of Divinity, will be the guest lecturer.",

        "description": "Duke Tutoring Programs Back In-Person\n    \n    \n\n\n\nAmeriCorps programs are back in-person after two years of remote engagement\n\n\n\nDuke&#8217;s AmeriCorps-funded early childhood and K-12 tutoring programs will be in-person during the 2022-2023 school year after two years of remote engagement due to the pandemic. The programs include Jumpstart PreK tutoring, American Reads, and America Counts school-based tutoring. Duke College Advising Corps, a high school counseling program returned to in-person last year. Learn more about each program below or visit their program page for details. \n\n\n\nDuke Jumpstart\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuke partners with the national early education organization, Jumpstart, to deliver Jumpstart’s evidence based early literacy curriculum to low income PreK students throughout Durham. Jumpstart is part of the AmeriCorps national network of service. Studies have shown that reading comprehension, and importantly, enjoyment and satisfaction from reading, at the PreK level, is a foundational building block for child development. And implementing in person reading programs and other one on one, in classroom, educational interventions is how Duke’s Jumpstart program best prepares young learners for future success in Kindergarten classrooms and beyond. This fall, Duke Jumpstart cohort members will serve in local classrooms at least 3 times per week over the course of the academic year. These members deliver meaningful educational experiences in the form of Jumpstart sessions to a diverse community of young learners. We could not be more thrilled, and we continue to interview qualified and interested Duke community members who’ll help us deliver this valuable community program while earning a good hourly wage.\n\n\n\nAmerica Reads, America Counts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDuke’s America Reads/America Counts program focuses on the enhancement and enrichment of literacy and math skills of children in Durham. Duke University students who seek to serve youth educational programming apply for the America Reads/America Counts (ARAC) program as either a paid or volunteer tutor. Our ARAC tutors support classroom instruction for at least four hours a week by working with individual and/or small groups of school-aged children in reading, writing, and math. The ARAC program partners with Durham Public Schools, local non-profit organizations, and afterschool programs to help with student growth and development throughout the academic year. The preparation for the ARAC program begins in the summer as Duke students are hired as tutors and continue throughout the semester. ARAC begins the academic year with an Orientation event that provides Duke tutors with workshops related to literacy and math concepts, social/emotional support for children, engagement, and racial equity. The Duke tutors are provided with training, service, and professional development to provide opportunities for supplemental classroom and personal growth and achievement. The America Reads/America Counts tutoring program will begin tutoring in-person with site partners in September 2022. If you would like to know more about the America Reads/America Counts program, please feel free to contact Brie Sanders (brianna.sanders@duke.edu)\n\n\n\nCollege Advising Corps\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCollege Advising Corps at Duke University works to increase the number of low-income, first-generation college, and underrepresented high school students who enter and complete higher education. Even many of the highest-achieving disadvantaged students — young men and women who are well qualified to continue their education beyond high school — do not consider attending a four-year college, and many who say they plan to apply, never do. The national student-to-guidance-counselor ratio of 467:1 means that the average student spends 20 minutes per year talking to his or her counselor. Moreover, low-income and first-generation students are particularly underserved, with many never seeing a college adviser. Every year, Duke Advising Corps members help hundreds of high school seniors make critical decisions about their post-secondary plans. On July 22nd DukeCAC launched its eight program year and started training activities for new Advising Corps Members. Advisers participate in intensive training in July, to ensure they have the necessary technical knowledge and soft skills to be successful as an adviser. By the end of training Advisers will be able to demonstrate knowledge of NC college pathways, timelines and activities. As well as strategies to implement high impact college access program in collaboration with school-based partners. In August Advisers will report to area high schools ready to serve on-site in person five days a week during school hours. If you are interested in learning more about DukeCAC please contact Desmond Gatling (desmond.gatling@duke.edu).\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            Have a question?

        "description": "Thursday, November 12, 2015The Baptist House of Studies at Duke Divinity School and the Baptist General Association of Virginia (BGAV) entered into a mission partnership to share resources and build relationships with a goal of developing healthy and vital congregations and pastors. Baptist House Director Curtis Freeman joined BGAV Executive Secretary John Upton and President Ann Brown in signing the partnership covenant Nov. 10 after it was approved by messengers (representatives from Virginia Baptist churches in the association) at the BGAV’s 192nd annual meeting at the Second Baptist Church in Richmond, Va. The agreement of shared values, mission, and vision will encourage greater collaboration and cooperation between the Divinity School and the BGAV, and its member churches, through field education, leadership development, networking opportunities, and ministry positions. With over 1,400 member congregations in Virginia, numerous other states, and several countries, the BGAV is one of the largest and most diverse denominational bodies within Baptist life. Through its mission and ministry partners, the BGAV is strategically committed to mobilizing Christians to “engage the whole world with the whole gospel.” John Chandler, head of the BGAV-related Spence Leadership Network, which provides programs for mentoring and formation of young church leaders, was enthusiastic about the possibilities of this new relationship. “We are deeply excited about developing our emerging friendship to a more strategic level so that young leaders can express their love for the mission of God by leading within the BGAV mission to advance the Kingdom,” he said. The Baptist House of Studies was established in 1988 for the formation and care of Baptist students at Duke Divinity School. There are 119 Baptist students from across the denominational spectrum currently enrolled in the different degree programs, comprising the second largest denominational body in the school. Freeman said the agreement seeks to make clear that “we regard one another as partners in God’s mission, not competitors in a diminishing market. By committing to walk together we agree to share our gifts and resources, and in so doing to step away from a mindset of scarcity and into a vision of God’s abundance.” Read the Partnership Covenant Mission.  ",

        "description": "Duke Tutoring Programs Back In-Person\n    \n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Duke Office of Durham and Community Affairs&#8217; Educational Technology team is working with SEEDS, a local nonprofit that teaches kids about gardening on using technology to learn.  This summer, the program is showing that a gardening program and Augmented Reality (AI) and animation are both fertile ground for educating young people (and the community) about the importance of locally-grown food. The younger SEEDS campers are creating an animated video showcasing the gardening/education program and the older campers are making augmented reality sites so that people in the neighborhood can learn more about SEEDS and AI. The young students have been working on training an AI system to distinguish between different fruits and vegetables. In the process, they are learning a lot more about plant varieties. The SEEDS educational technology program is a free program for children in Durham. Learn more in the video below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            Have a question?

        "description": "Friday, November 6, 2015By Farr Curlin, M.D.from DIVINITY Magazine\n\n\n\n\nHere is the not-so-secret truth about American health care practitioners: they are exhausted and bewildered. In two different studies, researchers have determined that the burnout rate for both doctors and nurses exceeds the general population, with nearly 50 percent of these medical professionals feeling as though they don’t have the resources to continue their work. Christian medical professionals seem at least as bewildered as everyone else. When I speak with Christian physicians and nurses, I notice confusion in their eyes, fatigue in their postures, and painful longing in their voices. Many are struggling to make sense of their day-to-day work: Why is it worthwhile? What does any of it have to do with what they thought they were called to be and to do as healers? Isn’t there a better way?\n\nThis should strike us as odd. Few human practices, after all, resonate more with Jesus’ ministry than caring for the sick. He used the analogy of a physician offering healing to describe his work (Matthew 9:12; Mark 2:17; Luke 5:31). He also identified himself with those who are sick, telling those who had visited the sick, “Truly I tell you, just as you did it to one of the least of these who are members of my family, you did it to me” (Matthew 25:40). Through his concern for those who were sick and his powerful miracles of healing, Jesus demonstrated the inauguration of his kingdom.\n\nHis early followers startled their pagan neighbors with their practices of caring for the sick and discarded. In late antiquity, Christians formed the first hospitals. In the late middle ages, the church promulgated manuals for laypeople, instructing them how to suffer illness and live faithfully in the face of impending death. Even into the 20th century, the majority of community hospitals in the United States were sponsored by Christian denominations. No wonder, then, that attending to the sick has been considered a paradigmatic Christian vocation. Why, then, are Christian health practitioners now so bewildered? Why do they not readily experience their professional roles as consonant with who God has called them to be, or their work as resonant with what God has invited them to do?\n\nThe Challenge of the Current Health Care Environment\nThe United States has the most technologically advanced and expensive health care system in the world. Yet despite consuming almost 17 percent of the nation’s gross domestic product (GDP), that system has not made Americans any healthier than residents of other economically advanced and politically stable countries. Moreover, as the health care system has grown in scope and power, it steadily has become more complex, technical, and bureaucratic. Inside this system, practitioners increasingly feel like cogs in a vast machine, driven along by faceless forces, harried and prodded and disciplined to chase outcomes that seem far removed from the needs of the particular patients they encounter. No wonder, then, that the burnout rate among both physicians and nurses approaches 50 percent. No wonder that patients are so often distressed by the impersonal and bureaucratized “care” they receive.\n\n\n\n\nThe moral and spiritual bewilderment of Christians working in health care poses a challenge to Duke Divinity School. Our mission is “to engage in spiritually disciplined and academically rigorous education in service and witness to the Triune God in the midst of the church, the academy, and the world,” and we pursue that mission primarily by training pastors and teachers. But as Richard Hays, George Washington Ivey Professor of New Testament, has written, “Wherever the church experiences renewal, it discovers that it does not exist for its own sake; it exists in order to bear witness, in order to be ‘a light to the nations.’ ” With respect to health and medicine, then, our challenge is to form scriptural imagination so that the church might bear witness and embody light in these important domains of contemporary culture.\n\nWe have our work cut out for us. Few Christian health practitioners have received any deep theological formation with respect to their work. Almost two thirds of health professionals in the United States identify themselves as Christian, and most say their religious beliefs influence their practices. They often seek to link their work to Jesus’ healing ministry, yet few Christian medical professionals have learned to think theologically about foundational dynamics that shape American health care. Except where practices cross a bright line of moral impermissibility, Christian practitioners tend to take the structures and practices of medicine for granted.\n\nFor example, Christian health practitioners regularly work with patients and families at the end of life, but few have considered how the Christian tradition of living well in the face of death might inform decisions about how, when, and to what extent we use technology to prolong life. Christian doctors and nurses lament the loss of personal contact and connection with their patients, but few have reflected on how modern medicine tends to treat the body as a machine rather than a person, and the extent to which Christian communities have erroneously embraced this view. Christian practitioners have strong opinions about shifting health care policies, but few have examined how the Christian affirmation that Christ is present in the one who is sick might inform debates about health care reform. Christian health practitioners know that the gospel should matter for how medicine is practiced, but they are not trained to see or to say how.\n\nThis is a problem. This lack of theological formation, combined with the broader social dynamics toward more bureaucratic, instrumentally driven medicine, leaves Christian health practitioners alienated from their work. As a result, many relegate their faith to the personal sphere, thereby abandoning the task of discerning how to faithfully fulfill their professions. They experience distress, and their daily work becomes increasingly disconnected from their original sense of calling and vocation.  They do not know how to describe what is wrong or how to start afresh. Much less are they practiced in turning to the gospel and Christian tradition for guidance.\n\n\n\n\nThis is a problem also for the church, whose members are called to bear witness to the gospel in times of sickness and of health, not only within the halls of institutional medicine. In their book, Reclaiming the Body: Christians and the Faithful Use of Medicine, Joel Shuman D’93, G’98 and Brian Volck state the problem bluntly: “Most North American Christians approach medicine without much consideration of its relation to their theological convictions.” They suggest, as a matter of first importance, that “Christians should should always understand themselves as part of a gathered people, integral parts of a community called the Body of Christ. In other words, we never really go to the doctor alone.” But Christians do go to the doctor alone, in part because their pastors also feel marginalized within health care institutions, unable to exercise authority in guiding and caring for the sick and the faithful to whom they minister.\n\nCultivating a Scriptural Imagination about Health Care\nForming and renewing a theological imagination for health and medicine requires a particular kind of institutional space—one that Duke Divinity School is well-positioned to sustain. Today’s health practitioners receive the great majority of their professional formation within academic medical centers, which overwhelmingly emphasize empirical and instrumental modes of reasoning. Health practitioners have difficulty finding conversation partners for serious, sustained Christian theological engagement with the practices of medicine. They also find it challenging to gain the theological formation they need in churches or in other Christian contexts outside the university. Even faith-based health care institutions tend to divide the professional from the personal, the public from the private. Although many pastors and congregations care deeply about health and illness, churches are often not equipped to provide in-depth theological formation for people who work in the health and medical fields. Duke Divinity School, in contrast, provides a prominent institutional context in which these challenges can be overcome.\n\nFirst, the Divinity School is committed to the practices of the church and to the formation of Christian ministers. Here, we can equip those being trained for the ministry to reclaim their ecclesial authority within the medical context. It is often said that doctors are the priests of the modern West, that when Christians and their clergy enter the hospital, the “real” authority lies with the medical team. The Divinity School can help Christians push back against this distortion—to help Christians understand themselves within the medical context as those whose bodies belong to the Lord. Here, we can explore theologically informed configurations of medicine, at the local level, that can serve as models for faithful and transformative Christian practices of healing and health care.\n\nSecond, the Divinity School is in close proximity to Duke’s world-class medical center, and our faculty includes four physicians as well as many others whose scholarship focuses on the body, health, suffering, illness, and death. We can bring health practitioners and ministerial students together in a context that is directly and deeply responsive to the realities of contemporary health care. Students can connect what they are learning in the classroom with what they have experienced and will experience in their clinical domains.\n\nThird, the Divinity School is an internationally renowned center for theological scholarship and education that is committed to engaging the broader culture with the gospel and historic Christian tradition. Here, we engage the academy and the world as equal participants in ongoing public discourse about our common life, not merely as an enclave of individuals working out our “personal values” in private. Here, we bring together seminarians, clergy, students in the health professions, and practicing clinicians for deep theological study and formation that prepares them to reimagine and reengage their work in the world.\n\nFinally, the Divinity School seeks not simply the transmission of knowledge but formation. Toward that end, formal study occurs within the practices of Christian prayer, worship, and service. In this way, we are all equal participants in a community of theological formation and Christian practice, whether we work in a parish or on a pediatric oncology ward.\n\nIn sum, Duke Divinity School is called to respond to the moral and spiritual bewilderment of Christians working in health care by inviting them to be transformed by the renewing of their minds. Through practices of the Christian tradition, practitioners might gain clarity about the purposes and meaning of their work, about how to attend faithfully to those suffering illness, pain, debility, and death. Through practices of worship and gratitude, they might find encouragement to begin again with joy, seeking creatively to participate in God’s ministry of suffering presence and healing. Through the formation of scriptural imagination, their eyes might be opened to new possibilities and practices that bear witness and bring light to contemporary health and medicine.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n  \n  \n  \n      \n        \n          Read the article.",

Dr. McKissick-Melton is beloved by an entire generation of NCCU students. She co-founded the NCCU-Duke Communication Internship Program and guided at least 250 students through a communications ‘boot camp’ hiring process resulting in the hire of 170 NCCU student interns during the summer months at various Duke departments.  \n\n\n\nDr. McKissick-Melton, who retired in 2022, was an award-winning professor who led the creation of the Mass Communications Department at NCCU and was its first chair. She also spearheaded the creation of a digital media lab in the NCCU communications building that students call “The Mac Lab.”\n\n\n\nSee highlights from the Summer 2022 internship program. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n        \n    \n    \n        \n            Have a question?

        "description": "Monday, November 2, 2015Churches partnering with Duke Divinity School to limit clergy debt have raised more than $70,000 for student scholarships.\n\nThe 55 churches, which are located across the U.S., are part of the school’s “Celebrating God’s Call” program to expand student scholarships. The program asks all Master of Divinity degree students to encourage their home congregations to support them with prayers and financial assistance. (See a list of partner churches (pdf).)\n\nThe program is part of a larger initiative funded by a Lilly Endowment Inc. grant to address economic issues facing future ministers. Personal financial pressures are limiting the ability of seminary graduates to accept calls to Christian ministry and undermining the effectiveness of many clergy members, according to the initiative, which encourages theological schools to work to improve the financial well-being of future pastors.\n\n“Through the grant from the Lilly Endowment, Duke Divinity School is able to focus strategically on the economic challenges facing students and future ministers,” said the Rev. Rhonda Parker, director of field education at the school. “We are especially grateful for churches who partner with us by participating in Celebrating God’s Call. The church’s participation affirms the value of an academically rigorous education for future church leaders.”\n\nThe Divinity School also has a task force that studies clergy and student indebtedness and a \"Mentoring 4 Ministry\" program that offers student workshops on topics that include stewardship and financial management.\n\nIn addition, the “No Debt Challenge” program offered two May 2015 graduates $2,000 transition-to-ministry awards for their efforts to finish school debt-free, bringing a total of four students who have now received transition-to-ministry grants. The program will continue for current students through 2017.",

        "description": "Enjoy tulips and more during your&nbsp;spring visitto Duke Gardens. Photo by Karen Webbink.Easter egg hunts are great fun in your home, but they can create problems in Duke Gardens. We want to remind visitors that Easter egg hunts are not permitted in Duke Gardens, and to offer some fun ways for visitors—particularly youngsters—to celebrate Easter and enjoy all springtime visits together.Why no Easter egg hunts at Duke Gardens?&nbsp;We ask visitors to refrain from egg hunts so that we can keep the fragile plants in this botanic garden safe from excited little hands and feet searching high and low for eggs and candies. We also ask visitors to help protect wildlife, so animals and birds won't try to eat the large number of forgotten eggs and candies later. Many people are unaware that chocolate can be especially harmful to dogs, and we want our visiting dogs to be safe, too. (In related news, please note that dogs are only permitted at Duke Gardens before 10 a.m. or after 5 p.m.&nbsp;More info here.)What to do instead? We'd love to hear your ideas. Here are some of ours:* Play a game of&nbsp;Search with Your Eyes&nbsp;(not hands, please): Kids can have lots of fun looking all over the Gardens for signs of spring, from new buds to colorful blossoms. How many times can they find their favorite color? How about familiar shapes that appear in leaves and flowers? How many circles, triangles or squares can you find? If you visit our information desk before heading out into the Gardens, we'll give you a&nbsp;free Scavenger Hunt&nbsp;for young visitors to follow.*&nbsp;Explore the Discovery Garden&nbsp;to see&nbsp;blueberries, kale, chard,&nbsp;peas, mustard and other yummy foods being grown. For children who've only ever seen these foods on a plate or in a grocery store, seeing where the plants are \"born\" can be fun.&nbsp;Families can also visit the chickens in the Discovery Garden, so children may see where real eggs come from. The produce from this garden benefits local families through partnerships with Healthy Families Durham and the Food Bank of Central and Eastern North Carolina. &nbsp;Please do not pick any part of these plants. We ask that you leave them for others to enjoy and learn from, and for the benefit of our community partners.*&nbsp;Fun activities to print out in advance:&nbsp;Plan your family visit ahead of time with our self-guided family resources.*&nbsp;Bird watch:&nbsp;From a great blue heron to a red-tailed hawk and many other species, lots of birds will be enjoying the spring weather in the Gardens this weekend. How many different birds can you spot? Any you've never seen before? Check out the informational signs at the Asiatic Arboretum Pond or the Bird Viewing Shelter in the Blomquist Garden of Native Plants, and you can write down species names to learn more about when you get home.*&nbsp;Shutterbug Madness:&nbsp;We'd love to see your favorite photos that celebrate spring in Duke Gardens. Please share them on our Facebook page, on Instagram (@sarahpdukegardens or tag #dukegardens) or email them to&nbsp;dukegardensphotos@yahoo.com.*Easter Sunday Service:&nbsp;Join Duke Chapel Sunday for a 6:30 a.m. Easter Sunrise Service on the South Lawn of Duke Gardens. If you're coming for the sunrise service, please don't forget to bring a flashlight to help find your way to the lawn in the morning darkness, and a towel to wipe the dew from your chairs. If it rains, the services will be in Duke Chapel.Thank you for joining us in celebrating spring and protecting the plants and animals that we all love.Sarah P. Duke Gardens&nbsp;creates and nurtures an environment in the heart of&nbsp;Duke University&nbsp;for learning, inspiration and enjoyment through excellence in horticulture and community engagement.

        "description": "An American robin feasts on native holly berries in the Blomquist  Garden.&nbsp;Photo by Cathi Bodineby Katherine HaleWinter is the hardest time of year for wild birds. Just when they  need to eat the most to keep themselves warm, the cold drives the  insects they depend on into hibernation. Even fruit and seed eaters  aren’t safe, with unpredictable bouts of ice, snow and inclement  weather cutting off access to their food sources.Like support stations  at a marathon, backyard feeders bearing sunflower seeds and suet offer  birds a lifeline in stressful times, with quick and easy boosts of the  calories and fat they need to survive. Feeding birds is a safe, easy and fun way to help local wildlife, and it also allows adults and  children alike an up-close-and-personal opportunity to connect with  nature.Feeders aren’t the only way to help birds, of course. Native trees  like dogwoods, hollies and wax myrtles provide welcome bursts of  seasonal color—along with food and shelter for hungry fall migrants and  overwintering residents alike. Withered seed heads of ornamental grasses  and sunflowers can be left up after the frost for foraging juncos and  sparrows. (You can cut them down in the spring to make room for new  foliage or plantings.) Native plants also serve as hosts to caterpillars  and grasshoppers, allowing insectivores like bluebirds and warblers to  thrive. And of course brightly colored flowers are the best way to  draw in nectar-drinking hummingbirds.But the wonderful thing about bird feeders is that they are open to  everyone—no land or garden required. For those who don’t have access to  much outdoor space, or who are waiting for their plants to mature, bird  feeders offer an effective and immediate alternative. As long as you follow a few simple rules—making sure there are bushes or other cover  nearby for birds to shelter in; cleaning the feeders regularly to prevent disease;  and keeping cats and other pets indoors—the only limits are your budget,  imagination and time.What birds frequent your feeders depends on the kind of offerings  you set out. Woodpeckers appreciate suet. Chickadees and cardinals love  black oil sunflower seeds. That said, part of the fun of setting up a  bird feeder is that you never know who might drop by. Visitors to the  Blomquist Garden of Native Plants frequently spy a pair of mallard ducks hanging out  under the feeders, commuting from the pond nearby. Online resources like eBird, iNaturalist and Feeder Watch  provide space for the scientifically inclined to share and document  their findings.Bird feeders in the Blomquist. Photo by K. Julian.The beauty of bird feeders is that they allow you the opportunity to  watch wild birds up close, with a house or windowsill serving as a  blind. Beginning and seasoned naturalists don’t even have to step  outside to see the resulting antics, which speed up as weather  conditions worsen. The result is live-action drama worthy of a reality  show, as the dominant chickadee scolds its flockmates away  from the choicest morsels, or a red-shouldered hawk shows up to try and  snag a feathered meal of its own.If you’d like to try making simple bird-feeders of your own out of  pine cones, lard and other natural materials (no nuts or nut products  involved), join us for our annual Winter Wonderland Festival, on Sunday,  December 8, from 2-4 p.m. at the Doris Duke Center. The family-friendly  festival is free for Duke Gardens members, and $5 per child for  non-members. (Please register in advance at http://duke.is/tZhVcV.) In addition to winter-themed crafts, there will also be  storytelling, cookie decorating, festive music and our resident  snowperson, Snowflake. Hope to see you there!For more plant and nature stories about Duke Gardens, check out the Garden Talk column on our website.&nbsp;",

        "description": "By Katherine HaleOdds are good that many people have never seen anything quite like neolitsea. A smooth-barked evergreen with aromatic leaves and cascades of tiny fall-blooming flowers, neolitsea is worth seeking out. And we’ll have it among many tree options at our Fall Plant Sale.Native to beech-laurel mountainous slopes of China and southern Japan, neolitsea (Neolitsea sericea) is practically unknown in American gardens, but it deserves to be more widely grown. It’s also known as the Japanese silver tree for the color of newly emerged leaflets, which are downy at first before transitioning to reddish-pink and then to a mature green.The trees are dioecious, meaning male and female flowers occur on separate plantings. Mixed-gendered plantings will result in holly-like red berries on female trees for additional winter interest.Neolitsea flourish in the warmth and humidity of southern climates, particularly when planted in a sheltered location to protect it from cold snaps. Like rhododendrons, neolitsea need acidic soil to thrive, and the soil should be well-drained if possible.&nbsp; Trees grow faster in full sun if given adequate water, but they will tolerate light or dappled shade, with an even, rounded shape that will need little in the way of pruning.If you’re in the market for something new and different—something you may never have seen anywhere else— give neolitsea a try. For those willing to branch out and explore the possibilities, it’s a winner.Photos courtesy of Wikimedia Commons.FALL PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, Sept. 28, 2019Time: 8 a.m.-noonMember benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only previews sale and dinner from 5-7 p.m. on Sept. 27, and a full list of plants in advance, plus staff recommendations.&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site.Parking: Free.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

        "link": "https://divinity.duke.edu/news/former-dean-richard-hays-honored",
        "description": "Friday, October 23, 2015Former Duke Divinity School Dean Richard B. Hays was honored on Oct. 23 with a celebration of his deanship and the unveiling of his official portrait. (Watch the video.)\n\nHays, who was installed as the 12th dean of the Divinity School on Aug. 31, 2010, stepped down from the deanship in August of this year to begin treatment for pancreatic cancer. He had originally intended to step down in June 2016 and return to teaching as a professor.\n\nAt the celebration, Interim Dean Ellen Davis read a message from Duke University President Richard Brodhead, who wrote that he most admired the former dean’s “temper as a scholar,” saying that for Hays, “scholarship has been not a profession but a calling, a consecrated life’s work.”\n\nOther speakers included Duke University Provost Sally Kornbluth; Bishop Hope Morgan Ward, a trustee of the University; Dr. Dan Blazer, chair of the Divinity School’s Board of Visitors; Jeremy Begbie, Thomas A. Langford Research Professor of Theology; Kavin Rowe, associate professor of New Testament; and Lester Ruth, research professor of Christian worship. Hays also spoke.\n\nDavis unveiled the former dean’s portrait, which was painted in 2012 by Whittier Wright. The 30” x 28” oil on canvas work shows him seated at a table in front of an open Bible and will hang in the Alumni Memorial Common Room.\n\nDavis shared a message from Wright, who worked with Hays and his wife Judy on the composition: “When I asked Judy if she had a favorite photo of Richard, she said she rather had a favorite experience with him. She described their time at the end of a working day when the two of them would relax and talk around their supper table on the back porch. Later in the conversation I learned that Richard considered his primary gift was that of a teacher. So joining those two concepts seemed to me a good approach to his portrait—that is, meeting at table, with the meal composed of the Word of God.”\n\nThe Bible in the painting is open to the page containing Romans 8:31-39, which Hays named as being closest to the heart of his faith. The passage concludes: “I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons, neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord.”\n\nDavis also announced that the Hayses have established two endowments: the Richard and Judith Hays Theology and the Arts Endowment Fund and the Richard and Judith Hays New Testament Scholarship Endowment Fund, the latter of which will fund student scholarships. Members of the community were invited to contribute to the endowments in honor of Richard Hays.",

        "link": "https://divinity.duke.edu/news/new-volume-john-wesley",
        "description": "Tuesday, October 20, 2015The Wesley Works Editorial Project, which is hosted by the Center for Studies in the Wesleyan Tradition at Duke Divinity School, has just published a new volume of the works of John Wesley, one of the founders of Methodism, in conjunction with launching a website for the project. The new volume, The Works of John Wesley Volume 27: Letters III (1756-1765), published in October by Abingdon Press, was edited by Ted A. Campbell, a professor of church history at the Perkins School of Theology at Southern Methodist University. The third of seven volumes of Wesley's correspondence, this volume is devoted to letters he wrote from 1756 to 1765. The letters illuminate critical developments in the Wesleyan movement during that time period, including significant rifts between Wesley and his brother Charles, as well as between John Wesley and his wife Mary. They also show John Wesley's attempts to deal with radical enthusiasts and separatists such as Thomas Maxfield within the Methodist movement, his relationship to the Greek Orthodox leader Gerasimos “Erasmus” Avlonites, and his activities related to the Seven Years War. The Wesley Works Editorial Project was launched in 1960 by Duke and three other theological schools in Methodist-related universities to provide a critical edition of the writings of John Wesley to illustrate his contribution to catholic and evangelical Christianity. Frank Baker, professor emeritus of English church history at the Divinity School, was recruited to guide this project and gathered the massive collection of original manuscripts and copies of items in other collections that provided the basis for the publication of Volume 27. The project, which includes a team of international and interdenominational scholars researching the theology of John and Charles Wesley, is now under the direction of Randy L. Maddox, general editor and the William Kellon Quick Professor of Wesleyan and Methodist Studies at Duke Divinity School. In conjunction with the volume’s publication, The Wesley Works Editorial Project also has launched a website that provides information on the 20 volumes of The Bicentennial Edition of the Works of John Wesley already in print, and provides a growing set of other resources for the study of his writings. The new volume adds nearly 50 letters to those available in previous editions and provides more scholarly annotation for each of the letters included, Maddox said. “The website includes an important expansion of our understanding of John Wesley’s correspondence, offering full text transcriptions of all letters addressed to him that are known to survive. These letters not only help understand Wesley’s responses, they provide direct access to the voices of many of the lay women and men involved in the early Methodist movement.” Other sponsoring institutions of The Wesley Works Editorial Project, in addition to Duke and Southern Methodist universities, are: Drew Theological School at Drew University, Candler School of Theology at Emory University, Boston University School of Theology, The General Commission on Archives and History of The United Methodist Church, The United Methodist Board of Higher Education and Ministry, and the World Methodist Council.",

        "description": "Pink banana fruit. Photos by Jason Holmes (L) and Paul Jones (R).By Jason HolmesCurator, Doris Duke Center GardensPhoto by Jason Holmes.One of my absolute favorites among the hardy bananas is the pink banana. From northeastern India, Musa velutina forms a stunning clump of large leaves that reach to 8 feet high. A spike of flowers develops atop the pseudostems, and by midsummer the spike of flowers becomes a mass of attractive bright pink, downy bananas.The word “velutina” translates to “velvety.”&nbsp; These bananas are very small and seedy, and I imagine that they would not provide a substantial source of calories. In November, the bananas burst open to reveal a white interior that from a distance appears as if they are flowering again.The pink banana thrives in our heat and humidity and does well with good moisture and lots of sun or even a high canopy of trees.Though Musa velutina is hardy to zone 7b, it may be best to protect it with a pile of leaves during the winter.The pink banana is a true hardy tropical for the summer landscape and will leave many gardeners asking, “What’s that?”Botanical Name: Musa velutinaCommon Name: Pink bananaFamily Name: Musaceae (Banana Family)Native Range: Northeastern IndiaUSDA Hardiness Zones:&nbsp; 7b-11Locations within Duke Gardens: Doris Duke Center Gardens, Culberson Asiatic ArboretumSite Requirements: Sun to dappled shade; well-drained but moist soils.

        "description": "'Camouflage' dieffenbachia. Photo: K. HaleBy Katherine HaleGardening isn’t limited to those of us with traditional houses and yards. Your space may be too small or dark or barren for a regular garden—but there’s nothing to stop you from living in a lush, temperate jungle, thanks to the flexibility of houseplants.Houseplants come from around the globe, in a variety of sizes, shapes and colors. Some are known by their Latin names, while others accumulate a hodgepodge of nicknames and misnomers. The one thing they all have in common is an intolerance for freezing temperatures, which makes a heated abode a must.While they may have beautiful flowers, a houseplant’s greatest charms are its showy foliage; an ability to flourish in the same warmth, light and humidity levels of modern buildings; and fewer special needs than their outdoor counterparts.Despite their considerable variations, most species of common houseplants can be divided into two groups. Those with lush green leaves have their origins in the shady understory of tropical rainforests—which have the same low, diffuse lighting of a typical living or dining room. The thick, fleshy-leaved succulents hail from harsh deserts, where they are continually assailed by the elements and must cling fiercely to every drop of moisture. Plants in this group generally require more direct sunlight than the tropicals and will rot if over-watered.Echeveria. Photo: K. HaleWe’ll be offering a wide selection of houseplants at our Fall Plant Sale this weekend, but here are three standouts that will fit into any home, apartment or dorm:One look at&nbsp; 'Camouflage' dieffenbachia and it’s clear it falls squarely into the tropical camp. Its wide, elegant leaves—a light green flecked with darker specks like its eponymous pattern—allow it to easily blend in any setting or container. Like all dieffenbachia, ‘Camouflage’ is easy to grow, and it will have few problems as long as its soil is kept consistently moist. It’s important to keep curious children or pets from munching on it, as its leaves and stems are chock full of needle-shaped calcium oxalate crystals known as raphides, which will cause a painful burning sensation in the throat and esophagus. But it is otherwise pest- and trouble-free.Echeveria. Photo: K. HaleOn the succulent side, consider members of the genus Echeveria, a large group of Central American natives whose pale, fleshy leaves cluster in rose-like formations. Though they appear like flowers themselves, their actual flowers emerge from a separate shoot, spiraling upward in search of pollinating insects. Sturdy and compact, each echeveria is compelling on its own, but they are hypnotic when massed in groups. Our favorite is the hybrid ‘Topsy Turvy’, which boasts crimped and crinkled edges as if pinched into position by a mischievous sculptor.Most bromeliads live in the rainforest, but puya (Puya mirabilis) is an exception—a desert-dwelling bromeliad that favors well-drained potting mix over hanging in mid-air like its cousin the air plant (Tillandsia sp.). In addition to its stiff, spiky foliage, puya flowers regularly, sending up bursts of eye-catching&nbsp; green-white flowers that dangle like bells from elongated stalks. Still relatively obscure compared to better known philodendrons and ficuses, this is the houseplant of choice for someone who likes to to try new things.Puya. Photo by Chris Carmichael, UC Botanical Garden at Berkeley.The sheer number and and versatility of houseplants means that you don’t have to let your circumstances—or even a so-called “brown thumb”—limit your choices when it comes to plants and gardening. No matter your tastes, schedule or living conditions, there’s a houseplant—or two, or three—out there for you.FALL PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, Sept. 28, 2019Time: 8 a.m.-noonMember benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only previews sale and dinner from 5-7 p.m. on Sept. 27, and a full list of plants in advance, plus staff recommendations.&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site.Parking: Free.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

Photo by Mandy Cuskelly.By Katherine HaleMarketing assistantIt’s never too early to be thinking about next year’s garden—and that’s especially true when it comes to hostas. Though these dependable perennials wind down with the cooler temperatures of fall, now is the best time to plant new ones to fill in gaps in your collection or add additional variety to your landscape. Hosta fans already know why these versatile leafy plants sell out quickly in all our plant sales, while newcomers are in for a real treat with all this genus has to offer.L-R: Hosta 'Wu La La' and 'First Dance'.Photos courtesy of Walters Gardens Inc.While the broad ribbed leaves are the main focal point throughout the growing season, hosta flowers are nothing to sneer at. Stalks of dangling, bell-like flowers rise gracefully out of the canopy in mid-summer, swaying gently in the breeze. The effect is multiplied when hostas are planted en masse in a perennial border or woodland garden, especially if fragrant varieties are involved.L-R: 'Maui Buttercups' and 'Touch of Class'.Photos courtesy of Walters Gardens Inc.All hostas are incredibly tough, though they exhibit their best color and vigor with afternoon shade, adequate moisture, and high organic matter. Their main enemies in the Triangle region are white-tailed deer, who vacuum up any plants they can reach, meaning that fencing or other protection is a must. Slugs may also be a concern in the shadiest areas.Hosta 'Sum and Substance'. Photo by Jason Holmes.Because hostas are such regular bestsellers, we always make sure to have a wide variety for gardeners to choose from at our plant sales. This isn’t as hard as it sounds, because every year sees new releases from plant breeders along with the return of old favorites. This year, our list includes 'Cathedral Windows’, a variegated tetraploid hybrid with added vigor; 'Dancing Queen’, a completely yellow cultivar; the giant ‘Sum and Substance’; and 'Halcyon', a popular and reliable “blue” hosta. There will also be the miniaturized ‘Sun Mouse’, the leaf-curling 'Maui Buttercups', and the creamy blended ‘Revolution’.&nbsp; ‘Touch of Class’, 'Wu-La-La' and 'First Dance' round out our offerings.L-R: Hosta 'Dancing Queen' and 'Sun Mouse.'Photos by Beth Hall (L) &amp; Walters Gardens Inc.Whether you are a beginning gardener interested in exploring this incredible genus, or an experienced connoisseur, the perfect hosta awaits you. And if you need advice or suggestions about which ones would best suit your landscape, we will be happy to help you select the right one—or two or three or more.

        "description": "Rehmannia elata growing near the peony collection inthe Culberson Asiatic Arboretum. Photo by Beth Hall.By Annie YangDuke Class of 2020Rehmannia elata is commonly called Chinese foxglove for its resemblance to foxgloves, but this herbaceous perennial is actually a member of a completely different family, Orobanchaceae.&nbsp; Although this plant is native to China, Chinese foxglove thrives in the warmer climate of North Carolina and is a lovely addition to local gardens.Rehmannia elata grows best in loose, moist, and well-drained soils. It prefers part shade, especially appreciating the morning sun and afternoon shade during hot summer days, and it also tolerates almost full shade. Once established, it is also drought resistant. However, be sure to protect it from freezing temperatures during the winter with a good layer of mulch. Chinese foxglove&nbsp;is also generally pest-free, attracting only the occasional slug or snail.Unlike true foxgloves, Chinese foxglove will repeat bloom for 3-4 months, usually unfurling its bell-shaped petals from May to September, with the heaviest bloom around June and July. It is generally low maintenance, but if you want to see it keep blooming, you’ll have to remove its spent flowers. However, this little bit of work is well worth it. Its attractive rosy purple color is sure to brighten up any shade garden.FALL PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, Sept. 28, 2019Time: 8 a.m.-noonMember benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only previews sale and dinner from 5-7 p.m. on Sept. 27, and a full list of plants in advance, plus staff recommendations.&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site.Parking: Free.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

        "description": "Osmanthus fragrans v. aurantiacus 'Beni Kin Mokusei'.Photo courtesy of Nurseries Caroliniana Inc.By Katherine HaleThe first sign of fall isn’t shorter days or cooler nights—it’s the apricot-like scent wafting through the air as the fragrant tea olives bloom. Hailing from China, these evergreen shrubs boast hundreds of tiny flowers that pack a big punch, filling the air with massive quantities of perfume. When the season peaks here at Duke Gardens (it’s starting now!), you can follow your nose to the tea olives lining the paths near the lower parking lot and in the Historic Gardens, long before you see them.The plant’s official name—Osmanthus fragrans&nbsp;v.&nbsp;aurantiacus—is a lengthy one, but don’t let that intimidate you. The first three words are a fancy way of saying it’s an especially fragrant tea olive with orange flowers in place of the usual white. What makes&nbsp;'Beni Kin Mokusei'&nbsp;so special is that its blooms are much deeper orange than the garden variety&nbsp;auranticus, so much so that they appear almost red in certain lights.The late horticulturist J.C. Raulston of N.C. State University once saw a sprig of ‘Beni Kin Mokusei’ in a flower arrangement during a visit to a Korean temple and fell in love; he reportedly claimed he would have been willing to risk jail to acquire a specimen of his own. Fortunately, you don’t have to go to such lengths—this variety has now been introduced to the United States and will be available for purchase at Duke Gardens’&nbsp;Fall Plant Sale&nbsp;on Sept. 28, and the members-only preview sale and dinner on Sept. 27.What to do with ‘Beni Kin Mokusei’ once you’ve purchased it? The possibilities are only limited by your imagination. Take advantage of its heavenly scent and plant it in a sunny place near a porch or patio or anywhere you care to linger on cool autumn evenings. Or use it as a privacy hedge or to line outdoor paths, as we do with the&nbsp;Osmanthus&nbsp;at Duke Gardens. Tea olives are deer- and disease-resistant, and incredibly low-maintenance once established, fading into the background until the fall. You’ll wonder how you ever managed to live without them.Read more about&nbsp;Osmanthus&nbsp;at Duke Gardens in this&nbsp;2016 blog post.FALL PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, Sept. 28, 2019Time: 8 a.m.-noonMember benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only previews sale and dinner from 5-7 p.m. on Sept. 27, and a full list of plants in advance, plus staff recommendations.&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site.Parking: Free.Pets&nbsp;not permitted. Please see Duke Gardens' pets policy&nbsp;here.Wagons + boxes: Our supply is limited; please bring your own if possible, and you'll have more time to spend gathering beautiful plants.Your support helps Duke Gardens&nbsp;to provide summer internships to aspiring horticulturists from across the nation.Please see our&nbsp;event page&nbsp;for more information, and we'd love for you to spread the word by&nbsp;sharing the event on Facebook&nbsp;and inviting your friends.Thank you!",

        "description": "Families love to explore Duke Gardens together.Photo by Bill Snead.Easter egg hunts are great fun in your home, but they can create problems in Duke Gardens. We want to remind visitors that Easter egg hunts are not permitted in Duke Gardens, and to offer some fun ways for visitors—particularly youngsters—to celebrate Easter and enjoy all springtime visits together.Why no Easter egg hunts at Duke Gardens?&nbsp;We ask visitors to refrain from egg hunts so that we can keep the fragile plants in this botanic garden safe from excited little hands and feet searching high and low for eggs and candies. We also ask visitors to help protect wildlife, so animals and birds won't try to eat the large number of forgotten eggs and candies later. Many people are unaware that chocolate can be especially harmful to dogs, and we want visiting dogs to be safe, too.What to do instead? We'd love to hear your ideas. Here are some of ours:*&nbsp;Explore the Discovery Garden,&nbsp;a sustainable, organic food garden, to see fruits, vegetables and herbs getting their start for the season. You can also learn a lot about Earth science, chickens, and bees! We have lots of bee houses in the garden, and also a new bee observation hive where you can safely peer at the bees at work.New bee observation hive at the Burpee Learning Center. Photos by Nick Schwab.* Play a game of&nbsp;Search with Your Eyes&nbsp;(not hands, please): Kids can have lots of fun looking all over the Gardens for signs of spring, from new buds to colorful blossoms. How many times can they find their favorite color? How about familiar shapes that appear in leaves and flowers? How many circles, triangles or squares can you find? If you visit our information desk before heading out into the Gardens, we'll give you a&nbsp;free Scavenger Hunt&nbsp;for young visitors to follow.From beehouses to flowers, there are many cool shapes to observe throughout the Gardens. Photos by Nick Schwab and Cathi Bodine.*&nbsp;Fun activities to print out in advance:&nbsp;Plan your family visit ahead of time with the activities on our Self-Guided Garden Resources webpage.Great blue heron and ducks.Photo by Jordan Montgomery.*&nbsp;Bird watch:&nbsp;From a great blue heron to a red-tailed hawk, ducks and many other species, lots of birds will be enjoying the spring weather in the Gardens this weekend. How many different birds can you spot? Any you've never seen before? Check out the informational signs at the Asiatic Arboretum Pond or the Bird Viewing Shelter in the Blomquist Garden of Native Plants, and you can write down species names to learn more about when you get home.*&nbsp;Shutterbug Madness:&nbsp;We'd love to see your favorite photos that celebrate spring in Duke Gardens. Please share them on our Facebook page or on Instagram (tag us at #dukegardens).*Easter Sunday Service:&nbsp;Join Duke Chapel Sunday for a 6:30 a.m. Easter Sunrise Service on the South Lawn of Duke Gardens. Please don't forget to bring a flashlight to help find your way to the lawn in the morning darkness, and a towel to wipe the dew from your chairs. If it rains, the services will be in Duke Chapel.Thank you for joining us in celebrating spring and protecting the plants and animals that we all love.Sarah P.

        "description": "Amsonia 'Blue Ice'By Annie Yang T'20Amsonia 'Blue Ice'Spring is finally here, but just in case you miss the cooler colors of winter, bluestar (Amsonia) ‘Blue Ice’ may be the plant for you! Even in a genus known for its showy, ornamental plants, ‘Blue Ice,’ with its large clusters of dark lavender blue flowers, stands out even among other bluestars.Amsonia ‘Blue Ice’ grows well in moist, well-drained, and loamy soil and in full sun to partial shade. Especially in hotter climates, ‘Blue Ice’ will appreciate the reprieve of some afternoon shade to help its flowers last longer. However, even ‘Blue Ice’ needs some sun, as its stems may topple over in too much shade. This perennial is relatively easy to maintain and does not need to be cut back after flowering, and it generally does not need staking or support either.Amsonia 'Hubrechtii'‘Blue Ice’ works well when massed along borders, in cottage gardens, and in open woodland areas. As temperatures warm up, the spring blooms of this plant will keep a little piece of winter alive in your gardens.Look for ‘Blue Ice’ at our Spring Plant Sale on Saturday, along with the equally beautiful ‘Illustris,’ ‘Elliptica’ and ‘Hubrichtii’.Photos courtesy of Walters Gardens.SPRING PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, March 30, 2019Time: 8 a.m.-noonMembers-only preview sale:&nbsp; 4-6 p.m. Friday, March 29Member benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only preview sale&nbsp;and a full list of plants in advance!&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site.Parking: Free during the sale.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

        "description": "Some of the succulents we'll have at the Spring Plant Sale.By Annie Yang T'20If you’re an apartment dweller or seeking a low-maintenance plant that will thrive indoors, Duke Gardens’ Spring Plant Sale this weekend will have plenty of plants to brighten your home environment, including a large variety of succulents and air plants that can thrive both indoors and out.A few of our air plant offerings.Taking care of air plants is somewhat different from other plants you may be used to growing, but once you get the hang of it, they shouldn’t be too much of a hassle. Air plants are the common name for plants of the Tillandsia genus and they get their name because they don’t require soil to grow. Their roots are not for soaking up water but instead attaching onto pretty much any surface—trees, rocks, seashells and more.Whether it’s in a terrarium, a mason jar or a hanging air plant rack holder, there’s a lot of room for creativity and imagination in displaying your air plant. Place them near a window to get bright, indirect light and good air circulation too.But air plants can’t survive on sunlight and air alone. Every week or so, remove your air plant from whatever you’ve chosen to attach it to and soak it in room temperature water for about 20 to 30 minutes. After it’s soaked, gently shake your plant to remove excess water—sitting water can cause rot and harm or kill your air plant. Set it out to dry with the leaves facing down, and within four hours, or about when you get back from class, the plant should be completely dry and ready to be returned to its container. If you nurture your air plant, it may even bloom in wonderful colors—a once in a lifetime event for each plant.More succulents, ready for the sale.You can also expand your succulent collection at our Spring Plant Sale. Taking care of succulents is low-maintenance and low-stress—you won’t need to panic too much if you’ve forgotten to water them for a few days or even a week or so. The key to taking care of succulents is to wait until the soil is completely dry and then soak them. If you’ve put your succulent in a pot with drainage holes, water the plant until water runs out of the holes. But if you don’t have a container with drainage, don’t worry. You can add pebble or sand layers to your soil to help with drainage, or tip the container to let the excess water run out.We look forward to helping you find the perfect plant for your indoor or outdoor needs!SPRING PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, March 30, 2019Time: 8 a.m.-noonMembers-only preview sale:&nbsp; 4-6 p.m. Friday, March 29Member benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only preview sale&nbsp;and a full list of plants in advance!&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site.Parking: Free during the sale.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

        "description": "Heuchera 'Apple Twist'By Annie Yang T’20Coral bells (Heuchera) 'Apple Twist’As the seasons change, the colors of Heuchera ‘Apple Twist’ capture the whole spectrum of reds, yellows, and greens of crisp, fresh apples. In the spring, ‘Apple Twist’ leaves emerge with a red hue like Honeycrisp or Fuji apples. Over time, the leaves of these coral bells lighten to yellow green and then a full Granny Smith green in the summer.A relatively easy plant to care for, ‘Apple Twist’ grows best in partial to full shade and acidic, well-drained soil. Much like apples, Heuchera ‘Apple Twist’ attracts pollinators such as butterflies, hummingbirds and bees, while also being resistant to deer. This plant works well as a border plant or in containers, but its changing colors also make it suitable as a focal point in any garden.Heuchera 'Black Pearl''Black Pearl’The combination of its glossy, jet-black foliage, purple undersides, and pink flowers makes this Heuchera cultivar a stunning show-stopper. While some Heucheras will bleach and lighten in color with too much exposure to the sun, ‘Black Pearl’ retains its striking color even in full sun. However, especially in warmer climates, this plant benefits from partial to full shade.Heuchera ‘Black Pearl’ is a villosa hybrid, which is a late-blooming species with increased heat and humidity tolerance. ‘Black Pearl’ will grow best with average amounts of moisture, and drier soils will prevent rotting and also deter slugs. Cut back the previous year’s foliage in early spring to allow room for new growth of this intensely colored perennial.‘Black Pearl’ is quite versatile and can fill a number of different roles in a garden. It works well in larger containers that can accommodate its dense leaves, or as a landscape plant. ‘Black Pearl’ can be paired up with brightly colored plants that bring out the full intensity of its dark leaves, or it can be accompanied by purples and violets for a more monochromatic but no less vibrant look.‘Autumn Bride’Heuchera 'Autumn Bride'With its tall clouds of white flowers that bloom from August through September, this Heuchera cultivar certainly does seem reminiscent of a bride all dressed in white. Its flowering is one of the largest in the genus—this plant pulls out all the stops. What’s more, the foliage of Heuchera ‘Autumn Bride’ is velvety to the touch, much like the fine quality of a bride’s gown.Especially in southern climates, ‘Autumn Bride’ thrives in the shade and in well-drained soils that are moderately moist. This easy-care cultivar fares better than most Heucheras in hot and humid summers, and it has good drought tolerance and is deer resistant.Its 2-foot stalks with white blooms really stand out when planted in groups or massed, and they make lovely cut flowers. ‘Autumn Bride’ can also be wedded to other plants to create exciting foliage contrast and combinations.Photos courtesy of Walters Gardens &amp; Lurie Garden.SPRING PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, March 30, 2019Time: 8 a.m.-noonMembers-only preview sale:&nbsp; 4-6 p.m. Friday, March 29Member benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only preview sale&nbsp;and a full list of plants in advance!&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site.Parking: Free during the sale.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

        "description": "Hosta 'Sum and Substance'. Photo: Jason Holmes.By Katherine HaleEach spring and summer, gardeners’ hearts are taken hostage by hostas—and with good reason. These shade-garden stalwarts come in a dizzying number of horticultural hybrids, with hundreds more introduced each year by enthusiastic breeders. While the classic green-leafed hosta remains popular, showy blue, gold and variegated leafed-varieties offer new twists on old favorites, ranging in size from petite to giant. With hostas, the possibilities are limited only by the imagination.Hosta 'Guacamole'. Photo: Walters Gardens.While the broad ribbed leaves are the main focal point throughout the growing season, hosta flowers are nothing to sneer at. Stalks of dangling, bell-like flowers rise gracefully out of the canopy in mid-summer, swaying gently in the breeze. The effect is multiplied when hostas are planted en masse in a perennial border or woodland garden, especially if fragrant varieties are involved.All hostas are incredibly tough, though they exhibit their best color and vigor with afternoon shade, adequate moisture, and high organic matter. Their main enemies in the Triangle region are white-tailed deer, who vacuum up any plants they can reach, meaning that fencing or other protection is a must. Slugs may also be a concern in the shadiest areas.Hostas are regular bestsellers at our annual spring plant sale, and we’ll be offering a smorgasbord of great selections again this year: ‘Akikaze’, ‘Bridal Falls,’ ‘Chartreuse Wiggles’, ‘Cool as a Cucumber’, ‘Dancing Queen’, ‘Dream Weaver’, ‘First Frost’, ‘Guacamole’, ‘Joy Ride’, ‘June Spirit’, ‘Komodo Dragon’, ‘Lakeside Paisley Print’, ‘Neptune’, ‘Sum and Substance’, and ‘Waterslide’.Hosta 'Chartreuse Wiggles'.

        "description": "'Felix Crouse' peonyBy Katherine HaleIt wouldn’t be a Spring Plant Sale here at Duke Gardens without a wide variety of peonies available for your gardening pleasure. Depending on the weather and cultivar in question, these showy standouts bloom anytime between Mother’s Day and Memorial Day, offering an excellent way to honor those special people in your life.Beloved by Chinese scholars and French Impressionists alike, peonies have a pedigree that spans over a thousand years of cultivation and appreciation, and they add character and class to every garden. In addition to old favorites like 'Sarah Bernhardt’, this year we’ll be offering another classic selection, ‘Felix Crouse’.Known in the trade as a bomb-type double, ‘Felix Crouse’ blooms are a massive explosion of raspberry red petals with a silky texture and pleasant fragrance. First exhibited in France in 1881, ‘Felix Crouse’ is a top of the line selection that can live for up to 50 years, and it only improves with age. A bouquet of these beauties can last over a week if flowers are cut in the bud, or you can leave them on the plant to dazzle humans and butterflies alike, while pesky rabbits and deer keep their distance.Like all peonies, ‘Felix Crouse’ will never need dividing, and it responds poorly to transplanting, so proper siting is critical for its longevity and success. Rich, well-drained soils in full sun or light afternoon shade are best, and keep it away from trees and shrubs that will compete with it for water and nutrients. Large, heavy blooms may require staking to remain upright, particularly in heavy rains. Aside from these details, ‘Felix Crouse’ is trouble-free, and equally at home in an informal hedge, the back of a perennial border, or as a beloved specimen plant.Our peony lineup also includes ‘Bartzella’, ‘Bowl of Beauty’, ‘Festiva Maxima’ and ‘Red Magic’, and possibly a few additional surprises.&nbsp; Come out and see for yourself which ones strike your fancy—with thousands of alluring cultivars commercially available, you never know what might turn up!Photo courtesy of thesitegardener.com.SPRING PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, March 30, 2019Time: 8 a.m.-noonMembers-only preview sale:&nbsp; 4-6 p.m. Friday, March 29Member benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only preview sale&nbsp;and a full list of plants in advance!&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site.Parking: Free during the sale.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

        "description": "Coreopsis 'Early Sunrise'. Photo courtesy of Walters Gardens.By Katherine HaleThis year’s&nbsp;Spring Plant Sale&nbsp;will feature a wide variety of horticultural selections, from tried-and-true classics to the latest cultivars. We’ll also have trouble-free and reliable southeastern natives for those looking for low-maintenance and trouble-free alternatives to the standard horticultural palate, including these three knockouts:This 'Snowflake' oakleaf hydrangea is one of severalcultivars growing in Duke Gardens. Photo: J. HolmesOakleaf hydrangea (Hydrangea quercifolia) is a southeastern native shrub with year-round appeal. Huge buds unfurl in the spring to reveal complex lobed leaves before bright pyramidal flower clusters arrive in midsummer. After a vivid display of autumn color, the exfoliating bark of bare branches provides winter interest. They’re an excellent choice for hedges or as foundation plants, especially in places too shady or moist for more conventional options. This year, we’re featuring ‘Snow Queen,’ a sterile cultivar with especially showy sprays of blooms, and ‘Ellen Huff,’ a vigorous, heat-tolerant selection with excellent form.Cardinal flower. Photo: J. Holmes.Cardinal flower (Lobelia cardinalis) is another garden-worthy native that sends up distinctive plumes of bright red blossoms irresistible to hummingbirds in August and September. This showstopper requires moist soil to flourish, making it an ideal choice for rain gardens, stream edges and other soggy areas, though a heavy layer of mulch and frequent watering makes drier areas more acceptable. Cardinal flower offers a zing of color and charm in sunny wet meadows or woodland shade gardens, especially when paired with like-minded species like Indian-pink (Spigelia marilandica), ferns or hostas. Left to its own devices, it will naturalize over time in a charming but unaggressive fashion, multiplying to fill in any gaps or openings in its vicinity.Coreopsis 'Early Sunrise'. Photo: Walters Gardens.Coreopsis ‘Early Sunrise’ is a compact version of a hardy wild favorite, with all of the charm and none of the sprawl of its undomesticated cousin. Masses of bright yellow flowers emerge on cue at midsummer, and they will bloom for months if regularly deadheaded. Like all coreopsis, ‘Early Sunrise’ flourishes in poor, dry soils and is popular with butterflies, bumblebees and other native pollinators. Keep it out of moist areas and let it naturalize freely in open meadows and prairie-style plantings with good drainage, and you should enjoy many years of colorful blooms.Whatever your garden type or skill level, we’ll have something for you here, along with expert advice from Duke Gardens horticulturists, Durham Master Gardeners and specialty vendors.

        "description": "By Annie YangClass of 2020Every year, parents, siblings and other family members descend on Duke for Family Weekend, hurrying about with many things to do and places to be. This weekend can feel like a hectic time for both students and their families, which is why a visit to Duke Gardens is a welcome change of pace.Although West Union might be packed, with no place to even sit down, it never feels too busy when you have 55 acres in the Gardens to explore. The serene atmosphere in the Gardens is like a breath of fresh air, and walking through its miles of paths is a great way to relax with your family while showing them one of Duke University’s gems.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The view from the Frances P. Rollins OverlookPhoto by Annie YangIf you’re coming from West Campus, it’s most convenient to cut right behind the Allen Building to enter the Gardens through the Memorial Gate. Parking at the Gardens often fills up on beautiful spring and fall weekends (though there is a free overflow lot nearby).&nbsp;If your family has never been to Duke Gardens before, it is almost a rite of passage to take them to marvel at the beautiful plants and landscaping in the Terrace Gardens. If you have any younger siblings, they will also be delighted by the colorful koi swimming in the fish pool. Most visitors enter the terraces through the pergola at the top or adjacent to the Fish Pool, but you can bring your family to the overlook up the hill behind the pond for a different perspective and a breathtaking view of the terraces.Another must-see site in the Gardens is the large pond in the Asiatic Arboretum, home to a large variety of ducks, as well as geese and turtles. The turtles often soak up the sun on the rocks at the edge of the pond, and the ducks are happy to be fed food that can be purchased inexpensively at the Terrace Gift Shop. If you look closely at the ripples in the pond, you may also see tiny fish fluttering through the shallow water. You might also spot the resident great blue heron as you walk around the pond!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waterfall at Pine Clouds Mountain StreamPhoto by Annie YangThe iconic red bridge over the pond is currently being renovated. However, there are plenty of other wonderful locations nearby that people visiting the bridge may overlook. For example, you can take your parents to Pine Clouds Mountain Stream, a stunning feature added to the arboretum just a few years ago. The sound of birds chirping and the rushing water in the recirculating stream makes it a perfect place to sit down with your family, take a breather, and absorb all the sights, sounds, and smells of nature. Additionally, a new outdoor restroom with a Japanese-style interior recently opened adjacent to Pine Clouds, which will be a relief for visitors who previously had to trek back to the other bathrooms in the Terrace Gardens or the Doris Duke Center. As you walk through the arboretum, you’ll also see gorgeous blooms of Japanese aster and ginger lily.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Osmanthus fragransPhoto by Annie YangIf you have a little bit more time to spend in the Gardens and would like to show your family around some less frequented but no less beautiful sites, the mini bamboo forest nearby the Garden for Peace is a unique spot. Imagine that -- towering stalks of bamboo in the middle of Duke University! You may also catch a whiff of the&nbsp;Osmanthus fragans&nbsp;growing nearby, which are known for their powerful fragrance. If your parents go, “What’s that smell?” you can impress them by telling them sweet osmanthus’ scientific name.&nbsp;Exploring the winding paths through the Blomquist Garden of Native Plants is also delightful, and a great way to learn about our ecosystem, plant conservation and supporting wildlife.Younger siblings or relatives will also enjoy the Charlotte Brody Discovery Garden, which is a sustainable, organic food garden near the Doris Duke Center. This garden is designed to help visitors learn about nature's symbiotic relationships. The garden is also home to a coop full of chickens, and many bee hives.If have questions, be sure to seek out one of Duke Gardens' volunteer garden ambassadors, who&nbsp;can help you make the most of your visit.There’s something for everyone to appreciate at Duke Gardens. Hopefully, when you return back to the hustle and bustle on campus, you and your family will feel refreshed and energized after your stroll through this nationally acclaimed botanic garden in the heart of Duke's campus.",

        "description": "Stokes' aster in the Blomquist Garden of Native Plants.Photo by Sue Lannon.By Annie YangDuke Class of 2020Stokesia ‘Klaus Jelitto’ shares its name with Klaus R. Jelitto, a German horticulturalist who founded Jelitto Perennial Seeds, an international and award-winning seed company. Though Jelitto Perennial Seeds is a multinational company, this herbaceous perennial is native to the coastal plains from North Carolina down to Florida and should feel right at home in your garden.Stokesia ‘Klaus Jelitto’, commonly called Stokes' aster, has a rather distinctive look, with its pincushion of florets in the center and notched blue-purple petals. It has a long summer to early fall bloom, and removing individual spent flowers will encourage springtime reflowering. This is a robust, low-maintenance plant and a good grower, preferring full sun although it can also tolerate filtered sunlight. ‘Klaus Jelitto’ thrives in moist, sandy soils and is drought and heat tolerant. Keep an eye on it after heavy rains, however, as its large flowers might flop.Draw out this aster's strengths by planting it in borders, cottage gardens, or near water sources like streams and ponds. This is a plant native to wetlands, bottomlands, and wet pinewoods, after all! ‘Klaus Jelitto’ also works well in small groups or massed.FALL PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018Time: 9 a.m.-noonMember benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only previews sale from 8-9 a.m., and a full list of plants in advance!&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site beginning at 7:30 a.m.Parking: Free.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

Photo courtesy of Walters Garden Inc.By Annie YangSchizachyrium ‘Twilight Zone’ stands out from other little bluestems by taking on a silvery purple color starting in midsummer instead of coloring up in the fall like its cousins. This prairie grass first comes out in striking pastel blue-green hues before intensifying into eerily purple tones and deepening into redder shades later in the season, providing a wonderful spectacle for months.Schizachyrium 'Twilight Zone'. Photo courtesy of Walters Garden Inc.‘Twilight Zone’, a bit ironically, requires full sun and is both heat and humidity tolerant. It can grow in a range of soil moisture levels, though it prefers soils on the drier side, and it can grow in both acidic and alkaline soils. This sturdy plant does not require much fertilization either, and it can really thrive in places where other plants find it difficult to survive.The strengths of Schizachyrium 'Twilight Zone’ are best showcased along borders or in a meadow garden. Like its other Schizachyrium relatives, ‘Twilight Zone’ supports pollinators like bees and butterflies and invites birds in with food, shelter and nesting material.FALL PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018Time: 9 a.m.-noonMember benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only previews sale from 8-9 a.m., and a full list of plants in advance!&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site beginning at 7:30 a.m.Parking: Free.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

        "description": "Green and gold (Chrysogonum virginianium).Photo courtesy of Pleasant Run Nursery.By Katherine HaleLike many native species, green and gold (Chrysogonum virginianium) is frequently overlooked in favor of flashier, more aggressive novelties.&nbsp; That’s a shame because green and gold is a shade gardener’s dream:&nbsp; it’s subtle, dependable and fills up bare gaps along wet meadows or woodland understories without taking over.In late March through May, green and gold adorns itself with small, cheerful yellow star-like flowers. They offer a taste of sunshine for those fed up with winter, and a welcome sip of nectar for hungry pollinators desperate for spring. Once the first flush fails, the plants will bloom off and on throughout the summer at sporadic intervals. Semi-evergreen leaves remain vigorous in all but the coldest winters, but they make unpalatable forage for any wandering deer.‘Superstar’ kicks it up a notch by boasting dense, mat-forming clumps that are significantly larger than the wild types and brighter, more upright flowers. Plants growing under ideal conditions—moist soil and bright-filtered shade—average 6-8 inches high and 24 inches wide. They spread by expanding the size of the clumps rather than by weedy rhizomes. Its neat and tidy growth habit make it well suited to rock gardens and shady perennial borders, or lining paths and trails through deciduous understory.&nbsp; It doesn’t work for every garden—full sun or dry areas are not its fortes—but nothing in any plant nursery than can beat it on its home turf.Despite its low profile in the catalogs,&nbsp; green and gold ‘Superstar’ is ready for prime time in your garden. Mix it in with fellow-shade dwellers like Heuchera, irises or Christmas ferns, or bunch it en masse to take over a hillside. Whatever you do, it’s hard to go wrong—and steady, dependable green and gold will be there for you year after year, as polite and charming as ever.FALL PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018Time: 9 a.m.-noonMember benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only previews sale from 8-9 a.m., and a full list of plants in advance!&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site beginning at 7:30 a.m.Parking: Free.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

        "description": "Epimedium 'Sulphereum' in flower.Photo by Beth Hall.By Annie YangDuke Class of 2020Owing to the flower’s unique, almost prismatic shape and the pale white sepals seemingly floating over the petals, Epimedium ‘Sulphureum’ is also known by a number of colorful names like bishop’s hat and fairy wings. It’s no wonder this curious and beautiful flower has been a garden classic for years.This is a relatively low maintenance plant that enjoys partial to full shade and loose soil with consistent moisture. Epimedium ‘Sulphureum’, a long-lived plant, is also resistant to rabbit, deer, drought, heavy shade, dry soil and shallow, rocky soil. The delicate nickname ‘fairy wings’ really belies this perennial’s reliability and durability.Epimedium ‘Sulphureum’ is quite the versatile plant and can fill a number of different niches in a garden. It spreads nicely and works well as groundcover in small, shady areas of rock gardens or planted en masse in woodland gardens. It also lines paths and walkways handsomely and grows well underneath trees.FALL PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018Time: 9 a.m.-noonMember benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only previews sale from 8-9 a.m., and a full list of plants in advance!&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site beginning at 7:30 a.m.Parking: Free.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

        "description": "Willow-leaf sunflower. Photo courtesy of USDA-NRCS Plants Database.By Katherine HaleWho doesn’t love sunflowers? Bright, cheerful, and adored by pollinators, the perennial willow-leaf sunflower (Helianthus salicifolius) dots Midwestern watercourses with its iconic yellow flowers every fall without fail. But its vigorous growth—rising 8 feet or more under ideal conditions—makes it too tall and unwieldy for the average garden in its wild form, flopping over in heavy rains or overshadowing its neighbors.Fortunately, horticulturists came to the rescue and transformed the willow-leaf sunflower through selective breeding. Enter ‘Low Down’, a compact and well-behaved dwarf cultivar with all the charisma of its bigger brothers. Why bother with pruning or staking when you could have a plant appropriately sized for a garden and save yourself the effort? Topping out at 18 inches, ‘Low Down’ is an excellent choice for a perennial border, container garden, wildflower meadow or anywhere in full sun where a colorful look is desired.Like all sunflowers, ‘Low Down’ attracts wildlife, but only the kind you want to see in your garden—bumblebees, goldfinches and migrating birds, as opposed to deer and insect pests. A hardy perennial, ‘Low Down’ offers more blooms for your buck without the need for constant replanting. Willow-leaf sunflowers look great in a vase or in a field with ornamental grasses and traditional autumn stalwarts like asters and chrysanthemums.Good things come in all shapes and sizes. For gardeners, sunflower cultivars like ‘Low Down’ prove that sometimes less really is more.FALL PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018Time: 9 a.m.-noonMember benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only previews sale from 8-9 a.m., and a full list of plants in advance!&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site beginning at 7:30 a.m.Parking: Free.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

        "description": "Anemone x hybrida 'Honorine Jobert'. Photo by Beth Hall.By Katherine HaleWell-known favorites like asters, chrysanthemums and goldenrod have their place in the fall garden, but few can compare with the stately Anemone × hybrida ‘Honorine Jobert’, a hybrid Japanese anemone that begins to bloom in late August here at Duke Gardens. First discovered by chance in a French garden in the 1850s, ‘Honorine Jobert’ is an established classic at the Gardens, most notably in the Walker Dillard Kirby Perennial Allée. There, you’ll find a stunning and unexpected surprise—a massive profusion of 2-inch blooms that resemble giant buttercups emerging out of knee-high mounds of feathery green foliage.Anemone 'Prince Heinrich'.Photo by Chris Holaday.The white petals (actually sepals) around a sunny yellow center (the true flowers) attract bees and butterflies, as well as anyone in the mood for something different as the seasons change. Flower arrangers love the tall stems and long vase life of the flowers, and their color and elegance make them a popular choice for fall bouquets and weddings. If allowed to remain on the plant, the blooms will linger through October, amazing longevity in a season in whic so many other species are past their prime.With a plant as ethereal as ‘Honorine Jobert’, it’s hard to have just one.&nbsp; Fortunately, they work best when planted in dense clusters, resulting in a jaw-dropping collection of flowers when grouped en masse. Isolated plants may need staking and support to show off their blooms to best effect, but plants in larger groups tend to support each other while simultaneously suppressing weeds with their shady foliage.Anemone 'Königin Charlotte'.Photo: C. Holaday.Though ‘Honorine Jobert’ is by far the most popular variety, there are hundreds of anemone options for the discerning gardener. Other fall-blooming Japanese hybrids, ‘Königin Charlotte’ (Queen Charlotte) and ‘Prince Heinrich’, are appropriately named for royalty and boast large, semi-double blossoms in various shades of pink. There’s also the elegant Anemone Wild Swan, with prolific white flowers with lilac stripes on their backs. Unlike the fall flowering Japanese anemones, this A. rupicola hybrid starts blooming in late spring and continues through first frost.Native plant gardeners aren’t left out of the fun: there’s the Canada anemone (A. canadensis), a showy spring bloomer found in moist floodplains and riverbanks throughout the East Coast, and its cousin, tall anemone (A. virginiana), which occupies a more upland habitat.Anemone 'Wild Swan'.Photo: B. Hall.Regardless of which anemone strikes your fancy, some basic ground rules will help ensure their long-term survival. Anemones love moist but well-drained soil that is never allowed to dry out; they can tolerate full sun, but their delicate leaves will burn in the summer heat unless planted under a shady canopy with protection from drying winds. While they are slow to establish in the beginning, healthy plants will freely naturalize over time via underground rhizomes, expanding the patch still further.&nbsp; Anemones are an excellent choice for woodland or cottage gardens, contrasting nicely with the blooms and foliage of shade garden staples like hostas and astilbes.FALL PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018Time: 9 a.m.-noonTall anemone (A. virginiana).Photo: B.

        "description": "Native grasses in the Piedmont Prairie. Photo by Sue Lannon.&nbsp;By Annabel RenwickHorticulturistBlomquist Garden of Native Plants at Duke GardensAutumn brings cooler, shorter days and helps the garden transition from summer into winter. By September many of our garden plants have finished blooming and frequently gone to seed, but not so in the Blomquist Garden’s Piedmont Prairie. Many of the late flowering, native grassland species are just coming into flower, such as the asters and goldenrods, so it’s not surprising that so many of these late flowering U.S. natives have been cultivated as garden plants worldwide, extending the enjoyment of gardens until the arrival of frost.Eragrostis spectabilis.Photo: USDA-NRCS Plants Database.&nbsp;September is also the time when many Southeastern native grasses are in flower along North Carolina roadsides. It may come as a surprise to many, but grasses do have flowers. The tiny flowers or spikelets are formed on a flowering stem, known as an inflorescence, with the more “ornate” grasses having highly branched inflorescences or panicles. Some of these panicles can be so intricately branched that they appear as airy mounds of transparent fine lace. Purple love grass (Eragrostis spectabilis) is one such species that has to be my favourite native grass planted in an ornamental setting. The gray goldenrod (Solidago nemoralis), Black-eyed Susan (Rudbeckia hirta) and smooth blue aster (Symphyotrichum laeve) make super planting companions with purple love grass.Particularly striking are the taller grasses such as Indian grass (Sorghastrum nutans) with its masses of golden, oat-like&nbsp; panicles, and sugarcane plume grass (Erianthus giganteus), with its clusters of silvery plumes shooting skyward. Stipa gigantea (giant feather grass), a stunning grass with arching flowering stems reaching 6 feet, is a stalwart of English Gardens but as a Mediterranean native doesn’t adapt well to North Carolina’s&nbsp; hot and humid climate or heavy clay soil. Indian grass would easily make a marvelous replacement for S. gigantea in a North Carolina Garden.Sorghastrum nutans in the Piedmont Prairie. Photo by Cathi Bodine.The striking Erianthus giganteus works well at the back of a border and could replace the commonly grown (and sometimes invasive) Miscanthus sinensis (Chinese silver grass) in local gardens. Generally grasses prefer growing in sun or may tolerate partial sun, but they will not thrive in shade.&nbsp; Many local grasses are drought tolerant and prefer nutrient poor soil; they will grow in our local heavy clay soil, and as with most grasses they are deer tolerant.Grasses have been used in ornamental plantings in the U.S. for more than 100 years. One of the earliest proponents of incorporating native grasses into U.S. landscapes was the Danish-born Jens Jensen who, at the turn of the 20th century, belonged to the Prairie School style of design based on the Arts and Crafts movement established in Great Britain during the latter part of the 19th century. In more recent decades, Dutchman Piet Oudolf has echoed Jensen’s philosophy, designing and installing grass dominated landscapes including the Highline in New York City.Oudolf has written many design books using grasses, but one of my favorites is “Gardening with Grasses,” by Michael King and Piet Oudolf (1998). A second recommendation is “The Encyclopedia of Grasses for Livable Landscapes,” by Rick Darke (2007).Come to Saturday’s Fall Plant Sale and you’ll find these beautiful native grasses and many more.FALL PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018Time: 9 a.m.-noonMember benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only previews sale from 8-9 a.m., and a full list of plants in advance!&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site beginning at 7:30 a.m.Parking: Free.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

        "description": "By Annie YangDuke Class of 2020Photos courtesy of Lurie GardenWith its tall clouds of white flowers that bloom from August through September, this Heuchera cultivar certainly does seem reminiscent of an ‘Autumn Bride’ all dressed in white. Its flowering is one of the largest in the genus—this plant pulls out all the stops. What’s more, the foliage of Heuchera ‘Autumn Bride’ is velvety to the touch, much like the fine quality of a bride’s gown.Especially in southern climates, ‘Autumn Bride’ thrives in the shade and in well-drained soils that are moderately moist. This easy-care cultivar fares better than most Heucheras in hot and humid summers, and it has good drought tolerance and is deer resistant.Commonly called coral bells, Heuchera works well as groundcover in rock gardens, open woodland gardens and borders. Its 2-foot stalks with white blooms really stand out when planted in groups or massed, and they make lovely cut flowers. ‘Autumn Bride’ can also be wedded to other plants to create exciting foliage contrast and combinations.FALL PLANT SALE DETAILS:Date: Saturday, Sept. 29, 2018Time: 9 a.m.-noonMember benefits: Duke Gardens members get 10% off all purchases, plus access to the members-only previews sale from 8-9 a.m., and a full list of plants in advance!&nbsp;Join online&nbsp;or on site beginning at 7:30 a.m.Parking: Free.Pets&nbsp;not permitted.

        "description": "LONDON — Europe&#8217;s soaring energy bills are triggering a wave of shutdowns at major fertilizer plants across the Continent, causing disruption for farmers, food manufacturers and — to the horror of bar owners everywhere — brewers of beer.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, the world’s largest fertilizer company Yara, based in Norway, announced a 50 percent cut to its ammonia-based urea and nitrogen fertilizer production in Europe, citing “record high prices.&#8221;\n\n\n\nThe decision came less than 24 hours after Britain’s largest fertilizer plant CF Fertilisers UK said it would “temporarily halt” production at its Billingham plant. Two other major fertilizer producers in Poland announced they would pause operations earlier in the week.\n\n\n\nFertilizer is not only vital for boosting crop soil fertility, but its production creates a byproduct, CO2 gas, which is used to add fizz to beer and soft drinks, supply hospitals for surgical procedures and allow animals to be slaughtered humanely.\n\n\n\nFarmers, food manufacturers and even pub landlords are therefore deeply worried about the wider implications of a looming fertilizer crunch. \n\n\n\nCarlsberg Polska, the third largest brewing company in Poland and subsidiary of the Danish multinational, told POLITICO it plans to stop beer production almost immediately — and that other brewers are bound to follow suit.\n\n\n\n“Few people realize that carbon dioxide is a byproduct of fertilizer making. And it cannot be stored for a very long time, so we only have a few days’ worth of reserves left,” said Carlsberg Polska spokesperson Beata Ptaszyńska-Jedynak. \n\n\n\n“We will be shutting down beer production any moment now … but we aren’t the only ones. Unless they have facilities to produce their own CO2, most beer companies will have to do the same.”\n\n\n\nThe energy-intensive fertilizer sector is among the first heavy industries across Europe to slash production amid the energy crisis exacerbated by Moscow’s invasion of Ukraine and subsequent Western sanctions on Russian oil and natural gas — a necessary ingredient for nitrogen-based fertilizers.\n\n\n\nJacob Hansen, head of the major lobby group Fertilizers Europe, said that soaring gas prices, which industry observers fear will remain high until at least the end of the year, are making it “impossible” to maintain production.\n\n\n\nThe energy crisis is exacerbated by Russia&#8217;s invasion of Ukraine l Simon Maina/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\n“It’s an impossible situation to be in. For me it’s obvious that the European gas market is bust — it’s not functioning,” Hansen said. &#8220;We are relatively the biggest gas user —  so if we see the pain, the pain will come for other people as well.&#8221;\n\n\n\nRipple effect\n\n\n\nThe closures have sparked fears across multiple food and drink sectors. Minette Batters, president of the U.K. National Farmers&#8217; Union, said the closure of Britain’s largest fertilizer plant was “extremely worrying.” The fertilizer market “is crucial to maintaining and enhancing our domestic food production,” she added, urging the government to review the availability of CO2 products.\n\n\n\nBritain’s brewing and pub industry said the timing of the shutdown “couldn’t be worse” and “could lead to shortages of beer across the country.”\n\n\n\n“Our pubs and brewers are already dealing with severe headwinds and pressures on their supply chains,” said Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association. “This decision raises serious concerns for the sustainable supply of CO2.”\n\n\n\nBrewers and pubs alike are already facing “extreme” costs for energy, she warned, which threaten to close businesses and damage livelihoods across the U.K..\n\n\n\n“Waiting even a few weeks for the government to act could be too long,” McClarkin added. “We need a sustainable plan for the supply of CO2 to our industry and urgent help with rising energy bills for businesses before they’re forced to close their doors.”\n\n\n\nPtaszyńska-Jedynak from Carlsberg Polska said there are also wider implications beyond beer and soft drinks, because CO2 is used for making products like dry ice, which is essential for preserving food during transport and storage.\n\n\n\n“The situation is critical for every aspect of the food sector where CO2 is used,” Ptaszyńska-Jedynak said.\n\n\n\nPoland&#8217;s Agriculture Minister Henryk Kowalczyk said Thursday he is working on a plan that would help fertilizer producers purchase gas at a moderate price. “We are working on this. For now, I don&#8217;t want to talk about the details, we already have some ideas there and we are agreeing on some solutions,” Kowalczyk said.\n\n\n\nTo ease some of the pressure, the European Commission has proposed temporarily suspending tariffs on key products for making nitrogen fertilizers, which national governments in the Council of the EU will discuss after they resume meetings in September, according to an EU official.\n\n\n\nIn the U.K., CF Fertilisers’ parent company CF Industries has already received one short-term bailout deal from the government, with a payment last September covering its operating costs for three weeks as energy prices surged on post-coronavirus lockdown demand.\n\n\n\nThis time, however, ministers appear reluctant to step in. \n\n\n\n“While the government continues to examine options for the market to improve resilience over the longer term, it is essential industry acts &#8230; to do everything it can to meet demand,” said a U.K. government spokesperson.\n\n\n\n“Since last autumn, the CO2 market’s resilience has improved, with additional imports, further production from existing domestic sources and better stockpiles,” the government spokesperson added.\n\n\n\nCF Industries already closed its sister plant in Cheshire back in June | Paul Ellis/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\n\nSome U.K. businesses have diversified their supplies of CO2 through imports since the initial crisis last fall. As prices rose, other industries have stepped in to capture the industrial byproduct and refine their own food-grade versions for sale. Last year the Billingham plant provided 60 percent of U.K. supplies. It now supplies only 30 percent.\n\n\n\n“Whilst we are in a much better position now than we were a year ago,” said Nick Allen, chief executive of the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), “the British meat industry will have serious concerns&#8221; if CF Industries stops production.\n\n\n\n“We can’t see how government can sit on the sidelines and insist that it’s for companies to work it out amongst themselves,” Allen said. “They are going to need to step in.”\n\n\n\nCF Industries already closed its sister plant in Cheshire back in June, leaving U.K. CO2 supplies “vulnerable to anything going wrong with their remaining Billingham plant,” Allen said. British industry, he added, has been “heavily reliant on overseas suppliers to make up the shortfall.”\n\n\n\nSince the end of July, ammonia producers in Italy and Germany have also cut production and sent European food and drink companies “scrambling” to secure tightening CO2 supplies, Allen added.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nWithout sufficient gas supplies, he said, farmers will potentially face an animal welfare issue, with mounting numbers of pigs and poultry unable to be sent for processing.\n\n\n\n“Europe has always been a relatively high-cost producer&#8221; said Hansen from Fertilizers Europe. &#8220;We export a lot of specialty products to the rest of the world … We are getting to a point where we can’t export anymore.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of&nbsp;POLITICO Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one-stop-shop solution for policy professionals fusing the depth of POLITICO journalism with the power of technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive, breaking scoops and insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomized policy intelligence platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-level public affairs network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY GO PRO\n\n\n\nLOG IN",

        "description": "African leaders are heading for the Netherlands next month seeking delivery on promised cash to help them cope with the destructive forces of climate change, but their European counterparts largely plan to skip the meeting.\n\n\n\nDutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte — whose partly below-sea-level country prides itself on engineering that secures its existence and also hosts the Global Centre on Adaptation (GCA) where the meeting will take place — is the only European leader planning to attend in person.\n\n\n\nThe summit is the first major test of the developed world’s commitment, made at the most recent U.N. climate summit in Glasgow last November, to double its financial support for climate-proofing projects in poorer countries to roughly $40 billion per year by 2025, although the exact number is disputed.\n\n\n\n“As some African heads of state travel to Rotterdam for the Africa Adaptation Summit, we hope their presence will be met with financial commitments to the Africa Adaptation Acceleration Program by their European counterparts,” said Patrick Verkooijen, the CEO of the GCA. “What really counts is for the developed world to deliver on the Glasgow Commitment [to] double adaptation finance.”\n\n\n\nOrganizers from the GCA said they had invited leaders from countries that have traditionally contributed to adaptation finance, including France, Denmark, Finland and Norway. But none of those have committed to make the short trip to Rotterdam in person, despite the anticipated presence of seven presidents from Senegal, Kenya, Ethiopia, Ghana, Gabon, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Zambia.\n\n\n\nThe offices of the prime ministers of Finland and Norway — Sanna Marin and Jonas Gahr Støre — said they would be represented by their development ministers. Denmark’s Mette Frederiksen had a scheduling clash with Denmark’s day of remembrance for war veterans, a government official said, but she would appear in a video. A press officer for the Élysée Palace in Paris said President Emmanuel Macron also had another commitment and would be represented by a secretary of state. \n\n\n\nThe European Commission will be represented by Executive Vice President for the Green Deal Frans Timmermans. A spokesperson for the Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had been invited but also had somewhere else to be.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the GCA could not rule out that other leaders were invited.\n\n\n\nThe lack of in-person engagement from the highest levels of European governments is in stark contrast to the long distance attendance of the African leaders, for whom securing cash for climate adaptation will be a priority at this year’s COP27 climate talks in Egypt. \n\n\n\nHigh profile leaders of international bodies including the International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization, European Investment Bank, African Development Bank and the U.N.&#8217;s second-in-command Amina Mohammed are all expected to join the summit in person.\n\n\n\nThe lack of in-person engagement from the highest levels of European governments is in stark contrast to the long distance attendance of the African leaders, for whom securing cash for climate adaptation will be a priority at this year’s COP27 climate talks in Egypt | Andreas Rentz/Getty Images\n\n\n\nDevelopment finance for adaptation projects like sea walls, drought resistant infrastructure and early warning systems for extreme weather lags far behind funding for emissions-cutting projects like solar farms that more easily generate a ready income and attract private investment.&nbsp;In 2020, roughly a third of international climate finance — $28.6 billion — was spent on adaptation.\n\n\n\nSpending on climate protection in Africa may also seem like a harder sell for European leaders at a time when their citizens face a generational cost-of-living crisis, said Theodore Murphy, director of the Africa program at the European Council on Foreign Relations.\n\n\n\n“Adaptation is not as sexy as mitigation. It&#8217;s egregiously underfunded. So that&#8217;s a hard sell in the best of times,” he said, adding: “It&#8217;s probably not the best time in Europe to be raising funds for something that nobody cares all that much about.”\n\n\n\nEurope has attempted multiple resets in its relationship with Africa, most recently a summit in February in Brussels. But the EU’s desire to be Africa’s “partner of choice” was stymied by its refusal to meet African demands on patent waivers for coronavirus vaccines.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nMurphy said that intransigence on climate funding carries its own risks to the relationship and may open up space for Europe&#8217;s rivals to pursue closer ties with Africa.\n\n\n\n“The danger in this is that the Chinese and the Russians make hay with it. As another example of how Europe doesn&#8217;t walk the walk, or how, when the chips are down Europe&#8217;s not around, basically Africa is Europe&#8217;s partner of convenience,” he said. \n\n\n\nClimate finance expert Joe Thwaites from the Natural Resources Defense Council, a U.S. NGO, said it was difficult to trace China&#8217;s contributions to adaptation in Africa as it doesn&#8217;t have to report it in the same way as the richest countries, but he said it was likely that some money from Beijing was being used for that purpose.

        "description": "GÖRLITZ, Germany — The premise? To travel 750 kilometers from Aachen on Germany’s western border with Belgium and the Netherlands to Görlitz on the Polish frontier.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe cost? Thanks to Germany’s temporary cheap travel program, only €9. \n\n\n\nThe scheme expires on August 31 and it covers all regional trains and local transport in the country.&nbsp;The challenge is that the plan doesn’t include speedy Intercity trains, so I’ll have to use local trains and make multiple connections with very little margin for error.\n\n\n\nI’ve scoped out a possible route. Leaving from Aachen at 7:30 a.m. with 10 transfers — including a very tight one of only five minutes — and arriving in Görlitz at 10:15 p.m.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nBut being German I’ve had my fair share of delayed and canceled Deutsche Bahn (DB) trains, and I’m more than skeptical.\n\n\n\n“This will be a disaster,” I tell a friend before heading out.\n\n\n\nThe train pulls out of Aachen and I immediately get debilitatingly nauseous. There’s no way I can interview anyone, so I close my eyes, wondering why I agreed to this assignment.\n\n\n\nIn Cologne, I rush to the pharmacy and &#8230; it’s closed.\n\n\n\nMotion sickness\n\n\n\nWaiting for the drug store to open, I speak to 60-year-old Andrea. She likes the ticket — but she’s not keen on DB. “Rail travel is simply a disaster in Germany,” she says. “Sanitation is a disaster, organization is a disaster, space is a disaster.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nAt 9 a.m., I pick up anti-nausea pills and run back to the platform, with only a few seconds to spare before my train starts moving at 9:07 a.m.\n\n\n\nSomewhere between Cologne and Dormagen, I meet Ingrid, a 70-year-old retiree.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe €9 ticket has saved her the €92 she normally spends on a monthly travel pass. With no car, she relies on public transport. “I’m not like the other ones my age. I need to move and get into the big city!” she says.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nTwo police staff watch over Brunswick train station | POLITICO\n\n\n\nThe cheap pass and savings make it easier for her to travel more, especially to see her daughter in Cologne, for which she’d normally need to pay a separate fare. “I just don’t fret over whether it’s worth it anymore, I just go,” she says.\n\n\n\nThere is trouble ahead. I glance at my watch. A one-minute delay. Two minutes. Then the conductor announces that we’ll have to wait for another wagon to be added to the train and my hopes dwindle that I’ll make that five-minute connection.\n\n\n\nAll hope dies when we wait to let an Intercity train pass.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI frantically search for alternatives. I decide to hop off in Bielefeld from where I can catch a train to Brunswick. That sets me back by an hour, but I should still make it to Görlitz by 11:15 p.m. if no more mishaps happen.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThe 26-minute connection in Bielefeld dwindles down to four, and I sprint to catch the next train — I’m certainly getting my exercise.\n\n\n\nThe next hours fly by as passengers share a glimpse into their lives.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nThere’s 16-year-old Emma Constabel, who can now visit her boyfriend three instead of two times per week thanks to the cheap ticket.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nJana Steinhaus, 48, who had to go into early retirement and relies on public transport, is being hit by rising prices, so the €40 she’d normally spend on a travel pass comes in handy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nSefer, 24, uses the ticket together with her husband and baby to visit relatives some 500 kilometers away. It’s something they can normally only afford once a year. She takes her 1-year-old son to a children’s play park with the money saved on public transport.\n\n\n\nManfred Christopher, a 54-year-old undertaker, is giving the €9 ticket a try but still prefers traveling by bus even if it’s slower and more expensive. Aside from him, all the other people I talk to love the ticket and want it to continue.\n\n\n\nRunning down the clock\n\n\n\nBut those working the trains are a lot less happy.&nbsp;\n\n\n\n“It’s a total catastrophe!” one staff member tells me on condition of anonymity. “Every weekend we have people come in who are stranded, who tell me they haven’t been able to leave the city for four hours because trains are just too full.”&nbsp;\n\n\n\nPassengers in Brunswick make their way to their next connection or exit in northern German Brunswick on a weekday afternoon | POLITICO\n\n\n\nShe blames politicians for the chaos. “Who else? We didn’t have time to prepare,” she says. “Thank God it’s almost over.”\n\n\n\nThe cheap ticket is also boosting businesses in train stations.\n\n\n\nAn employee for the sausage seller Halberstädter Würstchen says she’s working around 70 percent more than before. “It’s good for the shop,” she says.\n\n\n\nAt around 8 p.m., the train starts to empty. I have been on the rails for more than 14 hours and all I want is to take a shower and sleep.\n\n\n\nI nod off.&nbsp;The man sitting next to me wakes me up. “Long train journey, hmm?” he asks.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nHe doesn’t know the half of it.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI catch my last connection from Cottbus. I start to relax and open my book, only I’m too tired to read. The final hour crawls by, but at last, the announcement comes. Next stop: Görlitz.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nI jump off the train and can’t believe I’m actually there. I was wrong: This wasn’t a disaster.&nbsp;\n\n\n\nA staff member takes a break in Leipzig train station | POLITICO\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis article is part of&nbsp;POLITICO Pro\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe one-stop-shop solution for policy professionals fusing the depth of POLITICO journalism with the power of technology\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExclusive, breaking scoops and insights\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCustomized policy intelligence platform\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA high-level public affairs network\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWHY GO PRO\n\n\n\nLOG IN",

They’re a threat to our very democracy. They refuse to accept the will of the people. They embrace — embrace — political violence. They don’t believe in democracy.”\n\n\n\nHe added: “What we’re seeing now is either the beginning or the death knell of an extreme MAGA philosophy. It’s not just Trump, it’s the entire philosophy that underpins the — I’m going to say something — it’s like semi-fascism.”",

        "description": "&#8220;No one can stand in these solitudes unmoved, and not feel that there is more in man than the mere breath of his body.&#8221;\n\nSomething about time with ancient trees and shimmering waters, time under star-salted skies and by sunlit horizons, takes us as far beyond ourselves as we can go in this world and at the same time returns us to ourselves clarified, magnified, more awake to the native poetry of reality between the bookends of life and death &#8212; perhaps because time in nature resets the brain&#8217;s Default Mode Network that ordinarily trammels our thinking, or perhaps simply because we are nature and it is amid the rest of the natural world that we most openly commune with ourselves, with the &#8220;cosmic consciousness&#8221; of which ours is but a fractal and contact with which is our readiest portal to transcendence. Rachel Carson knew this when she beheld the meaning of life in the rising tide and Emily Dickinson knew this when she saw the web of life in a single flower. \nA century before Carson, when Dickinson was at the peak of her powers, Charles Darwin (February 12, 1809&ndash;April 19, 1882) captured his universal awareness in some uncommonly poetic passages from his memoir A Naturalist&#8217;s Voyage Round the World (public library | free ebook), published a year after On the Origin of Species radicalized the human understanding of and belonging with the rest of nature.\nCharles Darwin in his later years. Portrait by the pioneering photographer Julia Margaret Cameron.\nDarwin writes:\nAmong the scenes which are deeply impressed on my mind, none exceed in sublimity the primeval forests undefaced by the hand of man; whether those of Brazil, where the powers of Life are predominant, or those of Tierra del Fuego, where Death and Decay prevail. Both are temples filled with the varied productions of the God of Nature: &#8212; no one can stand in these solitudes unmoved, and not feel that there is more in man than the mere breath of his body.\nWith the natural humility that haloes the true scientist, he refuses to take the stance of a prophet, as many great minds are apt to do when facing these immense questions, and instead takes that of the poet, who shares with the scientist the art of observation as the raw material of wonder:\nI can scarcely analyse these feelings: but it must be partly owing to the free scope given to the imagination. The plains of Patagonia are boundless, for they are scarcely passable, and hence unknown: they bear the stamp of having lasted, as they are now, for ages, and there appears no limit to their duration through future time. If, as the ancients supposed, the flat earth was surrounded by an impassable breadth of water, or by deserts heated to an intolerable excess, who would not look at these last boundaries to man&#8217;s knowledge with deep but ill-defined sensations?\n&#8220;View of Nature in Ascending Regions&#8221; by Levi Walter Yaggy from Geographical Portfolio, 1893. (Available as a print and as stationery cards.)\nHalf a lifetime earlier, in the middle of the very voyage his recollection revived, the young Darwin had reached for the fundamental answer to the open question and captured the essence of this altered state of consciousness in his journal. Two weeks after his thirty-third birthday, while reading Humboldt &#8212; who had invented nature as we now understand it a generation earlier and whose &#8220;rare union of poetry with science&#8221; Darwin thought &#8220;will for ever be unparalleled,&#8221; even as he himself came to surpass it: the mark of genuine humility &#8212; he writes:\nThe delight one experiences in such times bewilders the mind; if the eye attempts to follow the flight of a gaudy butter-fly, it is arrested by some strange tree or fruit; if watching an insect one forgets it in the stranger flower it is crawling over; if turning to admire the splendor of the scenery, the individual character of the foreground fixes the attention. The mind is a chaos of delight.\nCouple with Darwin&#8217;s deathbed reflection on what makes life worth living, then revisit his contemporaries Florence Nightingale on the healing power of nature and beauty, Mary Shelley on the transcendence of mountains, and Nathaniel Hawthorne on how to look at nature and truly see.\ndonating = lovingFor a decade and half, I have been spending hundreds of hours and thousands of dollars each month composing The Marginalian (which bore the unbearable name Brain Pickings for its first fifteen years).

        "description": "Foregone conclusions: The Alabama Crimson Tide rolling over Utah State on Sept. 3; ubiquitous negative political ads on TV this fall; a wooden performance from actor Keanu Reeves.\nAnd, oh yes, the Rockies losing to Mets right-hander Jacob deGrom at Citi Field.\nHe was superb again Thursday night in the Mets&#8217; 3-1 victory over Colorado, giving up just three hits and striking out nine over six innings. He also walked a batter, just his second free pass of the season.\nIn 10 career starts vs. the Rockies, he&#8217;s 6-1 with a 1.20 ERA. At Citi Field, deGrom is 4-1 with an 0.96 ERA in seven starts.\nStill, deGrom wasn&#8217;t quite perfect and that left the door slightly open for Colorado to have a chance to win. But, as so often happens on the road, the Rockies couldn&#8217;t convert in the clutch and fell to 18-40 away from Coors Field. The Rockies were 1-for-6 with runners in scoring position and struck out 14 times.\nRyan McMahon, who&#8217;s having a solid August, plastered a 1-0, 97.7 mph fastball off deGrom with one out in the sixth. The home run came off McMahon&#8217;s bat at 108 mph and traveled 436 feet, the longest homer off deGrom in more than two years. It was also the first career home run for McMahon hitting from the leadoff spot.\nMcMahon, however, failed to deliver in the seventh inning with the bases loaded. Right-hander Seth Lugo struck him out with a 3-2 fastball. In the eighth, C.J. Cron drew a two-out walk off of Edwin Diaz and Jose Iglesias followed with a single, but Diaz struck out Randal Grichuk.\n&#8220;deGrom obviously is who he is,&#8221; McMahon told  AT&amp;T SportsNet. &#8220;Everybody knows how good he is and he came at us tonight. We knew we would have to fight for everything we could get.\n&#8220;We had some chances, we put some runners in scoring position, especially late, but we just couldn&#8217;t get the big knock.&#8221;\nFormer Rockie Adam Ottavino closed out the game for the Mets with a spotless ninth inning to get his first save of the season.\ndeGrom was perfect for 4 1/3 innings before Jose Iglesias singled off the glove of shortstop Francisco Lindor and Grichuk followed up with a double down the left-field line. But deGrom struck out Sam Hilliard and got Brian Serven to fly out to right to quash the mini-rally.\nRockies starter Ryan Feltner pitched well enough to give his team a chance &#8212; against just about anybody but deGrom &#8212; giving up three runs on six hits in 4 2/3 innings.\nRelated Articles\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tKiszla: Waste of money on Kris Bryant is Exhibit A why Bill Schmidt should not be Rockies general manager\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRangers hammer Rockies, 16-4, following Jose Urena&#8217;s disastrous start\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies&#8217; 2023 schedule includes Yankees at Coors Field\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t Rockies Mailbag: Manager Bud Black&#8217;s job is not in jeopardy part II\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\n\nColorado Rockies | \t\t\t\n\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\tRockies ride 3-run homers by C.J. Cron, Elias Diaz to win over Rangers\t\t\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\n\nThe Mets punched out their three runs in the third inning, the big blow a 409-foot, two-run homer by Pete Alonso, the 2021 Home Run Derby champion at Coors Field. Alonso has 31 homers and 104 RBIs with 36 games remaining.\n&#8220;That (home run) was the back-breaker, for sure,&#8221; Black said. &#8220;Both bullpens did a good job. They picked up deGrom, we picked up Feltner.&#8221;\nMcMahon raved about Feltner&#8217;s performance.\n&#8220;I loved what he did out there,&#8221; McMahon said. &#8220;Just one mistake to a big-time power hitter. That was a learning moment for (Feltner) but I thought he was pitching great. They definitely didn&#8217;t look comfortable out there against him, especially early.&#8221;\nRoster move. Right-hander Chad Kuhl was reinstated from the 15-day injured list Thursday and right-handed reliever Robert Stephenson was designated for assignment. Kuhl will start Friday against the Mets.\nStephenson, a first-round pick by the Reds in the 2011 MLB Draft, was acquired by the Rockies via trade following the 2020 season. He posted a career-best 3.13 ERA across 46 innings last season but has struggled this season, posting a 6.04 ERA in 45 appearances. The 29-year-old gave up three runs over two innings in the Rockies&#8217; 16-4 loss to Texas on Wednesday.\nBryant watch. Left fielder Kris Bryant, who&#8217;s played in just 42 games this season, is no closer to returning to the playing field. Bryant has undergone a PRP (platelet-rich plasma) injection and will be re-evaluated in seven to 10 days, manager Bud Black said Wednesday.\nOn Deck\nRockies RHP Chad Kuhl (6-7, 5.16 ERA) at Mets RHP Chris Bassitt (11-7, 3.26)\n5:10 p.m., Friday, Citi Field\nTV: AT&amp;T SportsNet\nRadio: KOA 850 AM/94.1 FM\nKuhl, a pending free agent, is pitching for his future, be it with the Rockies or with another club. The right-hander is making his first start since being placed on the 15-day injured list Aug. 5 with a right hip flexor strain. Before he landed on the IL, he was scuffling, allowing a season-high nine runs at San Diego on Aug. 3. He&#8217;s taken his lumps on the road, going 3-4 with a 6.08 ERA. He&#8217;s faced the Mets three times in his career, all when he was pitching for Pittsburgh, going 1-1 with a 4.73 ERA. He last faced the Mets on July 16, 2021, posting a win after allowing no earned runs on two hits over five innings.\nBassitt has won four consecutive starts for the first time in his career, allowing two or fewer runs in all four games, while posting an 0.69 ERA. In his six starts since the All-Star break, the Mets are 5-1 and he&#8217;s posted a nifty 1.85 ERA. He&#8217;s only faced the Rockies once, way back on June 30, 2015, when he pitched for the A&#8217;s. He allowed just one run over five innings at Oakland, but the Rockies took a 2-1 victory.\nTrending: Second baseman Brendan Rodgers leads all big-league second basemen with 15 defensive runs saved. His 2.1 dWAR (Baseball Reference) is tied for the fourth-highest among all major league position players.\nAt issue: The Rockies entered Thursday night&#8217;s game against the Mets with a .296 winning percentage (8-19) against the National League East, which is the lowest of any season in franchise history. After four games against the NL East-leading Mets, the Rockies have to play three at Atlanta, the defending World Series champions and a likely playoff team.\nPitching probables:\nSaturday: Rockies LHP Kyle Freeland (7-8, 4.93) at Mets LHP David Peterson (6-3, 3.44), 5:30 p.m., ATTRM\nSunday: Rockies RHP Germán Márquez (6-10, 5.22) at Mets RHP Max Scherzer (9-3, 2.33), 11:40 a.m., ATTRM",

        "description": "T-Mobile will partner with Elon Musk's SpaceX and use the company's Starlink satellites to provide mobile networks for cellphone users in remote areas, both companies announced at an event on Thursday.\n\n\n\nAt SpaceX's Starbase in Boca Chica, Texas, Musk and T-Mobile CEO Mike Sievert said the rollout would have a huge impact on enhancing cellphone service in rural, hard-to-reach areas. \n\n\n\nBefore they spoke, the company executives previewed a video featuring mobile phone users who voiced concerns about the lack of cellphone reception in rural, remote regions of the U.S. Some explained how their lives could be endangered in the event an accident occurs and they are unable to call for help.\n\n\n\nSievert said expanding network coverage into those remote areas is \"important for safety, important for connectivity\" and \"important for all of us.\"\n\n\n\n\"We have all — every single one of us — driven down that windy, country road through the hills and dales, beyond the reach of any cellular network,\" the T-Mobile CEO said. \"This partnership is about imagining a different future ... where if you have a clear view of the sky, you are connected on your mobile phone.\"\n\n\n\nT-Mobile will enter a beta phase in late 2023 with Starlink strictly for messaging and texting apps, but the effort will eventually phase into more cellular services. T-Mobile also announced its intention to spread the service to rural areas across the globe.\n\n\n\nMusk's Starlink satellites are designed to connect high-speed internet to rural areas. The company has around 2,000 satellites currently in orbit above Earth.\n\n\n\nProviders like T-Mobile generally use cell towers to provide network service to cellphones, so the technology of linking satellites for mobile network coverage is entirely new.\n\n\n\nOn Thursday, Musk said T-Mobile's network coverage will be powered by a second-generation Starlink satellite with large, \"extremely advanced\" antennas. The satellites will only connect to cellphones when they enter a deadzone not covered by a cell tower.\n\n\n\nT-Mobile, which recently acquired Sprint and is the second-largest carrier in the U.S., said the satellite service will be included for free in most plans provided by the company.\n\n\n\nMusk said the goal of both companies was to save lives and ensure there are \"no more deadzones\" across the world.\n\n\n\n\"I hope the public understands the magnitude of the announcement,\" the SpaceX CEO said. \"This is a really massive game changer.\"",

        "link": "https://www.mlbtraderumors.com/2022/08/latest-on-angels-potential-sale.html",
        "description": "The Angels appear set for a major shake-up, as owner Arte Moreno announced Tuesday he&#8217;d retained financial advisors to explore a potential sale of the franchise. The news came as a surprise publicly, but Ken Rosenthal of the Athletic reports that Moreno had planned to look into selling the team for a while before making the announcement. One source tells Rosenthal a sale has been under consideration for upwards of two months.\nPrecisely when Moreno settled upon this course of action isn&#8217;t clear, but it appears to have been at some point in June at the latest. As Rosenthal points out, that provides some interesting context for the Halos&#8217; approach to the trade deadline &#8212; specifically with the organization&#8217;s handling of reigning AL MVP Shohei Ohtani. Reports emerged in late July the Angels were listening to trade offers on Ohtani, but any speculation was quickly dashed when the Halos took the two-way star off the market by August 1.\nJon Heyman of the New York Post reported shortly after the deadline that Moreno forbade the front office from exploring Ohtani trades at a time when fellow superstar Mike Trout was on the injured list. Buster Olney of ESPN relayed a similar sentiment this week, writing that the club&#8217;s baseball operations department viewed this summer as the ideal time to extract a maximum return for Ohtani, who is arbitration-eligible for a final time before reaching free agency after 2023. Moreno, however, stepped in and indicated he wouldn&#8217;t approve a trade.\nIn the aftermath of the announcement that Moreno was exploring a sale, there was plenty of speculation among rival fanbases that an Ohtani trade next offseason could be more viable than it was this summer. Yet Rosenthal feels that&#8217;s unlikely, reasoning that Moreno&#8217;s refusal to deal Ohtani at the deadline while already planning to explore a sale of the franchise seems unlikely to change over the winter.\nIt isn&#8217;t known how long the sales process will take, but it could extend well into the offseason. For reference, the Lerner family announced shortly after Opening Day they were exploring a sale of the Nationals. Earlier this week, Barry Svrulga, Ben Strauss and Chelsea Janes of the Washington Post suggested that process could be wrapped up by November, around seven months after the team&#8217;s announcement a sale was under consideration. If the Angels&#8217; process follows a similar timetable, it&#8217;d push near Opening Day 2023. Each situation is individual, of course, and one can&#8217;t know precisely at this stage how long the possible sale of the Anaheim franchise might take. Yet the Nationals situation serves as an example of the complexity of a deal of this magnitude, and it seems likely Moreno will retain ownership at least for the early stages of the offseason.\nOhtani&#8217;s future is just one of many key decisions the Angels face as the franchise prepares for a possible monumental change. The club will have to settle upon a manager, with Phil Nevin currently holding the role on an interim basis after the team dismissed Joe Maddon in early June. General manager Perry Minasian and his staff will also be tasked with trying to overcome what&#8217;s set to be a seventh straight losing season and presumably make another push for contention in 2023. How much financial flexibility will be at the front office&#8217;s disposal remains to be seen.\nThe Halos entered this season with a franchise-record payroll north of $188MM, according to Cot&#8217;s Baseball Contracts. Jason Martinez of Roster Recourse estimates the club has a bit above $103MM in guaranteed money on the books for next season. That doesn&#8217;t include what&#8217;ll surely be a massive raise for Ohtani over this season&#8217;s $5.5MM salary, and the team will also see first baseman Jared Walsh reach arbitration for the first time. The Halos aren&#8217;t facing many significant free agent departures, but they could arguably stand to use external help at shortstop, left field, catcher and in both the rotation and the bullpen.",

        "description": "IntroductionIn this post, you’ll learn to build a Java based Cloud Function that will connect to a Cloud SQL for SQL Server database using the Cloud SQL Connector for Java. This solution will help you learn to build event driven lightweight solutions for any stand-alone functionality with Cloud SQL database that respond to Cloud events without needing to manage a server or runtime environment. What is Cloud SQL?Cloud SQL is a fully-managed database service that makes it easy to set up, maintain, manage, and administer your relational databases on Google Cloud Platform. It has 99.95% availability and supports up to 64 TB of storage available, with the ability to automatically increase storage size as needed. For a list of detailed features, refer to the documentation here.What is Cloud Functions?Cloud Functions is a lightweight serverless compute solution for developers to create single-purpose, stand-alone functions that respond to Cloud events without needing to manage a server or runtime environment.What you'll buildYou'll write a Cloud Function in Java. The function:Creates a Cloud SQL for SQL Server instanceConnects to a Cloud SQL for SQL Server Database instance using a Cloud SQL Connector methodCreates a table in the databaseWhat you'll learnHow to create a Cloud SQL for SQL Server instanceHow to access the Cloud Functions web UI in the Google Cloud ConsoleHow to create a Cloud FunctionHow to test a Cloud FunctionHow to connect to a Cloud SQL database instance (SQL Server) using JavaHow to run DDL operations on a Cloud SQL database using Java and Cloud SQL Connector methodRequirementsA browser, such as Chrome or FirefoxA Google Cloud Platform project that contains your Cloud SQL instanceThe next section has the list of steps to create a Cloud SQL for SQL Server instance 1. Create the Cloud SQL - SQL Server instanceFrom Google Cloud console, go to Cloud SQL Select SQL Server, and choose the SQL Server 2019 Standard as the Database version Choose from Development instance with default compute size and memory (you can change it later if needed) and make sure you leave the Public IP in the Networking section enabledGo to Databases on the left side menu once the instance is created and create a databaseGo to Users on the left side menu and configure a new user account (with a username and password) for the instance. You can alternatively use the default user as well. 2. Prepare code and create Cloud FunctionPrepare CodeThe Cloud Function code for connecting to a Cloud SQL database is available below. Some variable values depend on your Cloud SQL database configuration, and depend on your own database information. The function connects to SQL Server database using  Cloud SQL Connector JDBC for SQL Server and creates a table in the database.The Cloud Functions UI in the Cloud Console includes a text editor. You can copy/paste and edit the code there, or edit the code locally first, and then copy/paste it into the UI. /pom.xmlYou can find the pom.xml file in the repository: https://github.com/AbiramiSukumaran/CloudFunctions_CloudSQL/blob/main/pom.xmlThe Java class for implementing the functionality:https://github.com/AbiramiSukumaran/CloudFunctions_CloudSQL/blob/main/src/main/java/com/example/Example.java/src/main/java/com/example/Example.javacode_block[StructValue([(u'code', u'package com.example;\\r\\n \\r\\nimport com.google.cloud.functions.HttpFunction;\\r\\nimport com.google.cloud.functions.HttpRequest;\\r\\nimport com.google.cloud.functions.HttpResponse;\\r\\nimport java.io.BufferedWriter;\\r\\nimport com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariConfig;\\r\\nimport com.zaxxer.hikari.HikariDataSource;\\r\\nimport edu.umd.cs.findbugs.annotations.SuppressFBWarnings;\\r\\nimport java.sql.Connection;\\r\\nimport java.sql.PreparedStatement;\\r\\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\\r\\nimport javax.servlet.ServletContext;\\r\\nimport javax.servlet.ServletContextEvent;\\r\\nimport javax.servlet.ServletContextListener;\\r\\nimport javax.servlet.annotation.WebListener;\\r\\nimport javax.sql.DataSource;\\r\\nimport java.sql.PreparedStatement;\\r\\nimport java.sql.ResultSet;\\r\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\r\\nimport java.util.List;\\r\\nimport java.util.Properties;\\r\\nimport java.util.UUID;\\r\\nimport java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit;\\r\\n \\r\\npublic class Example implements HttpFunction {\\r\\n@Override\\r\\n public void service(HttpRequest request, HttpResponse response) throws Exception {\\r\\n createConnectionPool();\\r\\n BufferedWriter writer = response.getWriter();\\r\\n writer.write(\"Hello.

Create Cloud FunctionCreate the function1. In a browser, go to the Google Cloud Platform Console UI2. Select Cloud Functions from the Navigation menu3. Click CREATE FUNCTION on the button bar4. Enter a name for the function5. Select the HTTP trigger. (Make a note of the URL displayed beneath the trigger item. It will be in this format: https://REGION-PROJECT_ID.cloudfunctions.net/FUNCTION_NAME)6. Under Authentication, select Allow unauthenticated invocations to make the function public in this example, to make it accessible to test from the browser by clicking the URL in Trigger tab of the Functions console7. Expand the Runtime, Build and Connections Settings In Runtime service account, select a service account that has the Cloud SQL Client role8. Click the NEXT button9. Select Runtime : Java 11 for the runtime option10. Select Inline editor for the source code option11. Select the source code editor windows, delete the existing content for both pom.xml and Example.java, and replace them with your edited versions of the code above12. Enter “ CF-CloudSQL” as the name of the Entry point13. Click Deploy and wait while the function is created. The spinner stops spinning and a green check appears on the subsequent page when the function is ready to use14. Add permission for “allUsers” principal to “Cloud Functions Invoker” role4. Test the function1. Click on the name of the function you created in the above steps2. Select the TESTING link in the middle of the page3. Select TEST THE FUNCTION4. The result should appear. If the test fails, you'll see a stack trace to help with debugging5. In a browser, go to the URL that you saved earlier, when you created the function. If you forgot to save the URL, you can get it from the TRIGGER link6. The ok result should appear in the browser as well7. You can check for details in the “DETAILS” tab8. You can check for log and console information in the “LOGS” tab5. Clean upTo avoid incurring charges to your Google Cloud account for the resources used in this post, follow these steps.Delete the Cloud SQL instance1. Go to the Cloud SQL Instances page in the Google Cloud Console2. Select the instance you created to open the Instance details page3. In the icon bar at the top of the page, click Delete4. In the Delete instance window, type the name of your instance, then click Delete to delete the instance. You cannot reuse an instance name for about 7 days after an instance is deletedDelete the Cloud Function1. Go to the Cloud Functions page in the Google Cloud Console2. Select the three dots under Actions for your function and choose Delete3. Confirm deletion by clicking the DELETE button6. CongratulationsCongratulations, you've successfully created Cloud SQL - SQL Server instance and built a Cloud Function that works with Cloud SQL.Specifically, you've created a Java Cloud Function that connects to and creates a table in a Cloud SQLfor SQL Server database instance using Cloud SQL connector method. This kind of function helps you build stand alone compute solutions for event-driven cloud use cases using Cloud SQL data that is handled by other enterprise applications. Now go ahead and extend this learning to implement an update triggered calculation in an existing table assuming that the data in the table is getting transactionally updated from multiple sources.7.
