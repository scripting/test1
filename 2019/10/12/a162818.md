# Status of State and Justice
Not only can Barr and Pompeo be impeached, they can also be indicted, tried, convicted and imprisoned. It has happened before to Nixon's Attorney General, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_N._Mitchell#Watergate_scandal">John Mitchell</a>.

It's worth noting this because they know it too. 

Both are doubling-down on the obstruction. 

And they have a lot of power. 

However the <a href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/10/10/20908731/rudy-giuliani-investigation-parnas-fruman">SDNY investigation</a> of Giuliani says Barr isn't in complete control of DoJ yet. 

And people from State are giving public testimony.
